My recruitment experience helped me to overcome the challenge of recruiting the right profile, balancing technical and soft skills, according to the Russian market. With my strong network and influencing skills, I engaged with people in western Europe to support the transition of their job to Russia. With my experience and leadership, I helped and developed the new management into a Mars style leadership team.\n\nThe size of my job had increased a lot in terms of budget accountability (4M USD) and complexity with licencing, outsourcing and currency rates. I reviewed the given organisation design in terms of number of people and the split between employees, contractors and outsourcing. I then built a business case and got it approved by the leadership team to change the organisation design to reflect the actual needs. This resulted in cost-efficiency and improved service levels.\n\nObjectives for Global Infrastructure Operations Manager of End User Technologies.\n\u2022 Build an organisation to deliver End-User Technologies Services.\n\u2022 Transition of the service from Western Europe to Russia.\n\u2022 Support the development of a new IT Hub in Russia.\n\nAchievements:\n\u2022 Designed and implemented organisational model for End User technologies operations.\n\u2022 Successfully transitioned EUT service from European locations to central Hub in Russia.\n\u2022 Build a strong high performing team in Russia from scratch.\n\u2022 Played a significant role in building a new IT Hub in Russia (150 people): defining recruitment strategy, pay plan, transition plan from Europe to Russia, development of Mars Culture, coaching of new local leaders.",
