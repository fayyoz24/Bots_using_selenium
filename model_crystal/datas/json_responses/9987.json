    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc I'm a highly motivated and enthousiastic student that enjoys working on artificial intelligence solutions that benefit the greater good of society. My ambition is to research and develop these technologies that have the potential to change the world for the better, and become an interdisciplinary researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. \n\n\u2615 Next to doing my studies full-time, I have committed myself to a wide and diverse range of extracurriculars - from teaching French to young pupils to assisting with the organization of AI-related symposia -- I don't tend to shy away from any challenge that comes up my way. Outside of work, I tend to recharge by road cycling, running, or brewing new speciality coffees and teas.\n\n\ud83d\udcda  A common thread that is visible in my work is the passion and intrinsic motivation to contribute to the greater good. I enjoy writing programs that could make things easier for people, and to do that responsibly on a grand scale, such that it could benefit people with e.g. their health, is one of my noble goals.  I am especially interested in explainable AI, geometric deep learning and safe/trusted AI in the context of (bio)medicine and healthcare.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 I'm expecting to graduate in Summer 2023, so I'll be open for PhD/full-time opportunities by that time! At the moment, I'm busy with my MSc thesis studying the use of generative modelling within the field of hit-to-lead optimization of small therapeutic molecules.\n\n\ud83d\udce9 I'm always open to exchanging thoughts, whether it's on finding the best (matcha) latte in Eindhoven or on something you would like to share -- I'm always eager to listen! Do not hesitate to drop me a line (or any other geometric shape), I don't byte! :)",

Together with five enthousiastic and motivated students from Radboud University from different study backgrounds, we formed a student consultant team. We explored how ABN AMRO can encourage companies to acquire and use knowledge to make the transition towards a more circular business model. \n\nWe came up with the idea of RoundAbout - an 'educational Netflix' platform that uses blended learning methods to stimulate the circular knowledge economy. We ended up in the top 3 of this challenge, out of 15 universities in the Netherlands.\n",
