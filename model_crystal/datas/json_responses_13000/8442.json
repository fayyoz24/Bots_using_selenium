Having privilege working with Russian, European, Asian and African markets, I learned from different cultures, great partners and passionate colleagues. Started in a very junior position and having a journey through various roles in this business, I had a chance to get to know exhibitions from inside. Working with partners in various segments including communications, water and waste management, sports, transportation, food and beverage I studied the best ways to help customers connecting with each other. Now I am proud to lead business development team in one of Informa's most successful portfolios - Food Ingredients - helping our company, our clients, and our projects to reach new heights. \n\n",
