    "summary": "My interests are in environmental management and impact of Climate change specifically related to  natural and water resources associated with business development, urban and rural planning, waste water reuse for irrigation.  As a creative person, I like interactions with people from different background and expertise. I think that \"nobody has a good idea alone\", I mean that idea and concept become really good through interactions.\n\nI aim at providing a holistic view of environmental challenges with creative and out-of-the box thinking to enable the understanding of consequences of choice in adaptation to climate change and ultimately to avoid \"false good-ideas\". \n\nMy professional experiences are on the international market as ESIA expert, senior researcher (Europe, MENA, Africa), as export manager for waste water treatment works and subsidiary Director for a SME.\nMy Thesis explore which type of stakeholders\u2019 participation is perceived appropriate for which type of water related challenges: societal complexity within the context of the EU Water Framework Directive, governance & conflict resolution.\nI am both an engineer and an social scientist (sociology and policy of the environment).\nI also worked in war zone and post conflict area as drinking water programme manager for Humanitarian NGOs.\nTransversal skills: Project Management, Acquisition Strategy, Partnership Development & networking, \uf0d8\tSubcontractor management, Facilitation & Mediation, Stakeholder Engagement, Gender, coaching & Training, Innovation transfer.\n\nOccupational field: Climate change, Water Energy Food nexus, Circular Economy, Wastewater Reuse, Drinking Water & Wastewater, Valuation of Ecosystem Services, Environmental & Social Impact Assessment - Water Governance - WASH policy.\n\nWork experience: Abu Dhabi, Afghanistan, Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Gabon, Ghana, Greece, Guadeloupe, Guinea Conakry, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Italia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Malta, Morocco, Norway, RDC, Romania, Rwanda, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Soudan, Spain, Syria, Chad, Tunisia, Turkey, UK.\n\nAnd also...Bees keeping, Marathon, Karate, long distance SUP, DIY, organic Gardening, Photography, Natural Horsemanship.",

The project consist of installing three irrigation plot for tomatoes, potatoes and cucumber that will be irrigated with 3 water quality: i) traditional water for irrigation (ground water), ii) current treated waste water, iii) tertiary polished water with membrane. In order to implement the project a ELTSO-NRO Fusion membrane filtration device will polished the waste water produced by the Waste Water Treatment Works of the city of Ouargla then stored and used for irrigation through dripping irrigation device defined by Alterra. Ground water and treated waste water will irrigate identical irrigation device to compare crop growth, heavy metals and organic compounds in water, soil and plants.\r\nThe project is co-managed by Alterra and ONA, our Partners are Eltso NRO-Fusion, PB Techniek, INRAA.",
