The main purpose is to help people who are coming to Germany to get a proper understanding of the culture and the German way of living. \n\nBetween 2011 and 2014 I was leading a voluntary network of Spanish women who helped in their country transition during the first months, new Spanish emigrants who came to Munich.\n\nMy mission is to create a bridge between the German and the Spanish culture to enhance German culture and communication understanding, by facilitating the integration into the country."
