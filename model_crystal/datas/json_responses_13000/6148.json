    "summary": "Strategic campaign and creative leadership consultant, facilitator and trainer, based on over 35 years leadership and campaign experience, including 350.org, Avaaz, Greenpeace International, The Council of Canadians, CARAL and more. I've led winning campaigns at the national and international levels, worked with groups from the wildly global to the intensely local -  in locations from Canada to China, Israel to Iran and Korea to Kenya.  \n\nI bring people together, often around difficult topics, provide structure, clarity and listening,  to help find a way forward - from the grass roots to the governance levels.\n\nMy professional background is in health care and management, and I hold the UK national certification as a teacher of adults.\n\nOriginally from Wales, I lived in Canada for many years and now live in Amsterdam. I'm a good cook, an imperfect mother and a terrific friend.",
