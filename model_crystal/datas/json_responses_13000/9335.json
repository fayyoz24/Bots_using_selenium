    "summary": "My decision to become an architect was inspired by the emergence of conservation and regeneration projects in Cyprus. These showed me that architecture not only preserves and enhances culture, but also improves lifestyle and benefits the economy. Becoming an architect would allow me to be a part of this invaluable work.\n\nWhilst studying at the University of Greenwich, I learned how to think as an architect and open my mind to new ideas, as well as developing skills in drawing and model-making. At the University of Westminster, I have particularly refined my digital skills and learned to approach architecture with a more three-dimensional perspective and vision. \n\nWorking at Aedas RHWL Architects, marcosandmarjan Architects,  Zaha Hadid Architects, Foster and Partners has added to my skills and my architectural vision greatly. As a qualified Architect I am currently working at UNStudio where I am lead design architect and associate.\n\nIt has been a privilege to work with these leading practices and a unique experience to see how they approach design, as well as practice management. I believe my experience so far has helped me to achieve important mile-stones in my architectural career.",
