    "summary": "I am a passionate geoscientist with 15+ years of experience in the energy industry. I am highly motivated to help push forward the energy transition and currently supporting Shell's portfolio of carbon storage projects around the globe. \n\nI carry significant experience and deep technical skills in the characterization and modelling of carbonate reservoirs, both for exploration and development projects. I have worked in a variety of sedimentary basins that are dominated by carbonates (Barents Sea, Middle East (Qatar, Kuwait, Oman) and the Mediterranean (Italy, Tunisia and Albania)) or mixed clastics - carbonates (Sichuan basin, Great American bank). In Shell, I am currently the subject matter expert for carbonate modelling. \n\nBecause of the variety of basins and projects that I worked in, both during my studies and in my professional career, I have a wide experience in sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, seismic interpretation and structural geology. This wide experience makes me an excellent (data) integrator of different datasets, something that is crucial for adequate subsurface uncertainty and risk assessment. \n\nMy current role focuses on Carbon Storage project support and capability building and deployment of related technology and workflows within Shell.",
