After the successful launch & steep growth of RocketPay, I was promoted to a senior manager(principal product owner) to lead the payment organization. My main objectives were (1) to increase the overall payment conversion rate, (2) to lower the payment fee(cost) paying out to 3rd parties and (3) to keep the zero down-time of the payment system\u200b.\n- As a head of the Payment tribe, I led 20+ people(with 5 direct reports) org with 3 teams - a development team to maintain the whole payment system of Coupang, an infrastructure team which supports the infra/security of the payment system and an operation team which manages the business operation/partnership with 3rd parties including payment gateway companies.",

RocketPay was launched on desktop web, mobile apps(iOS, Android) and mobile web platforms.\n- Impact : RocketPay brought a 30% increase in payment conversion rate. (also resulted in having +20% lift in customer spending and a cost reduction in payment fees) We have removed friction from the payment process by allowing customers to just use 6 digits of PIN code, even just with their fingerprints. We transformed the payment process of all major payment options in South Korea - bank transfer, credit cards and mobile carrier payment.\n- Growth and Retention : We grew to over 2M customers in 1.5 year. It even grew to more than 10M users in 2019. In addition, we tracked the retention rate of monthly/weekly cohorts and ran several initiatives to retain users. We looked into unit economics and ran promotions which brought positive ROI.\n- Besides Payment, I also led an initiative to remove friction from the refund process by implementing a balance service(like Paypal balance) and integrated it with the cancellation/refund process.",

We strive to promote cultural diversity and human rights of Asians and Asian diasporas in Europe. \n\nWe worked on a number of actions such as initiating a public petition to request the governments to establish a hotline for hate crimes(racism), running a survey with hundreds of Asians, discussing with the governmental/political entities in the Netherlands and Germany and presenting the status quo of anti-Asian racism in Europe through various medias in Europe and South Korea. We have achieved a lot so far despite having less than 10 members, and we are now recruiting more volunteers to expand our activities. \n\nMy role as a founding member and the first secretary of the organization(one of the 3 board members) is to focus on setting up the organization such as drafting the ByLaws(written rules and processes with regard to membership, officers, board of directors, election process and Code of Conducts), facilitating and taking notes of official meetings of the organization and managing/prioritizing multiple projects in the organisation. My next focus is to set up a good process and culture in the organisation to onboard new members(volunteers) and to let them autonomously work on their projects to effectively fight against the racism in Europe.
