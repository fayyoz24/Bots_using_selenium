The long-term goal of INSPIRE is to increase the number of qualified students from underrepresented populations completing advanced degree health programs and serving the community as practicing health professionals. \n\nINSPIRE students conduct original biomedical research under the direction of a graduate student mentor and faculty advisor. The program includes weekly presentations on careers in the health sciences as well as mandatory academic and professional enrichment sessions to improve student performance in language arts, mathematics, science and work place etiquette.  While in the program, students will be introduced to a wide range of health professions and interprofessional research opportunities.\n\nhttps://www.rosalindfranklin.edu/about/diversity-inclusion/inspire/"
