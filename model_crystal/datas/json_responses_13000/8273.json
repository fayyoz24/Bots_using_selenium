    "summary": "When you organise a meeting with several languages, it does not need to be stressful. I will help you to identify your language needs, bring together and manage a team of interpreters.\n\nIf you would like to discuss:\n\n\u27a2 which type of interpretation (simultaneous, consecutive or whispering) would be the best for your event,\n\u27a2 how to make the most of your language resources,\n\u27a2 or if you want help in assessing your language needs,\n\ncontact me on LinkedIn or via zouchra.kasimova@gmail.com\n\nI genuinely believe that if you use interpreting at your international meeting, then you are:\n\n\u2605 Building trust and credibility\n\u2605 Engaging in better conversations\n\u2605 Making your counter-partners feel grateful to you.\n\nI have interpreted at over eight hundred international conferences and meetings worldwide, helping people to communicate when they do not share a common language.
