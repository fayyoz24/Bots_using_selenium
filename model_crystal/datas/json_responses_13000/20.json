    "summary": "In addition to having developed a firm knowledge of English language and culture, and more specifically,  the field of Applied Linguistics, throughout the course of my studies (BA & MA), I have acquired an academic foundation which is reflected in my ability to think analytically, act decisively, and base my decisions on a solid theoretical framework. My teaching degree (my second MA degree) and teaching experience have given me valuable insights into teaching, learning and human development.\n\nI have experience with working on (research) projects related to the humanities, and have marketing experience as well. It is precisely this combination of theoretical knowledge and practical aptitude that I try to utilise on a daily basis. I am interested in learning about research-projects and other more commercially-oriented projects pertaining (but not necessarily exclusively so) to the field of English Language and Culture in which I can bring to fruition the project by implementing my practical know-how and theoretical knowledge.",

These courses dealt with analysing a final paper in terms of language and style, writing a literature review, writing a report, giving professional presentations and writing an expository/argumentative essay. In addition to these language-oriented courses, I taught courses dealing with PR, the ins and outs of E-mail Marketing and a minor on cross cuItural communication. I was also tasked with evaluating the language of ICM final papers. Along with other lecturers from other departments I was involved in putting together the ABC (Artful Business Creations) minor.
