    "summary": "Since childhood, I have been involved in design, communication and storytelling. So it was no surprise that I decided to study communication. However, I wanted to challenge myself by following this study at an international school. As a result, I was able to study and work in South Korea, England and Germany in addition to be active in an international setting in the Netherlands.\n\nBecause I got to know so many different cultures and people, I really started to realise the power of a story. It is something that is the same in every culture: how we learn to understand each other, create deep connections and shape our lives.\n\nWhen I decided to go on an adventure in 2020 and move to Japan for a year, I seized the opportunity to combine the theoretical and creative side of communication and to spend the whole day telling stories. I also wanted to do create something that could make the world a little bit better. From this mix, \u00c9claire Studio was born. \n\nUnfortunately, covid-19 cancelled my travel plans and thus I stil am in the beautiful Netherlands, but now I get to enjoy working with passionate entrepreneurs every day!",

Voor drie maanden lang hebben we elke maandag en donderdag gerepeteerd om uiteindelijk de musical te vertonen op 1 juni. \n\nNa alle positieve reacties van het eerste optreden is de productie uitgenodigd om op de Hanzefeesten, Doesburg grootste evenement, op te voeren. \n\nMijn taken hier waren het vinden en kiezen van een script, het werven van scholieren, het begeleiden van repetities en andere taken relevant bij de productie van de musical. \n\nPersbericht: http://www.doesburgdirect.nl/jongerencentrum-0313-komt-met-nieuwe-musical/"
