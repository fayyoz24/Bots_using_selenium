    "summary": "Now working on the future of foodtech in Europe.  \n\nPreviously, I was the co-founder and CEO of Giggster in Santa Monica, the Airbnb of filming and events locations in LA. In my career I have led the launch & growth of early-to-mid-stage startups in San Francisco, Paris, Boston and LA.\n\nI also like to use my startup powers for the greater good: to promote space exploration. I was the co-producer of the New Worlds Conference, founded by NewSpace pioneer Rick Tumlinson. Every year since 2015 we gathered 500 to 600 people for two days to listen to 35 prestigious speakers  from the space industry in Austin, TX. I am always looking for more involvement in space-related projects.\n\nFormerly VP of Marketing for one of the hottest French tech startup, qunb, I helped the company pivot, find its right product-market fit and obtain its early growth hacking success. We won LeWeb Startup Competition in 2012. The qunb founders and I are Techstars Boston Alumni.\n\nI graduated from HEC Paris, Europe's #1-ranked business school, earning an MSc in Management, with a double diploma from T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paristech, one of the best French engineering schools.",
