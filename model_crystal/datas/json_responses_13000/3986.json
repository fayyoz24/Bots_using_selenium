    "summary": "I always aim to push myself in life and I am not afraid to take on new challenges. I am told that I am kind, honest, creative, optimistic, intelligent, hardworking, and I enjoy working in a dynamic and international environment. Currently, I am studying at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, in the Master in International Communication Management (MICM) program, which has been equipping me with professional knowledge in the management of corporate communication, internal communication, media relations, cross-culture communication, social media, crisis communication etc. I hope to find a job in the field of public relations and communication within eight months when I graduate. \n\nI enjoy reading a lot, since I believe it can help me gain an in-depth understanding of people and things in life. I read a wide range of books, poetry, novels, philosophy, social science, psychology, etc. Besides reading, I also enjoy writing, drawing, singing and dancing. As for sports, I am fond of table tennis and basketball. I also enjoy traveling, and I hope to see as many interesting places as possible.",

Working through different shifts, I learned to quickly respond to any situations, even when I'm work alone, I easily set up special report web pages when something important and urgent happens. I have established around 50 special report websites for the channel, and have been rewarded for the ones that have high click rate, such as the special reports of \u201c2015 Spring Festival\u201d, \u201c2015 NPC & CPPCC Sessions\u201d, \u201cDragon Boat Festival\u201d etc. What\u2019s more, I often lead the English-language group to organize news coverage for special events and homepages, which was a great responsibility that required me to demonstrate great communication skills, teamwork, and the ability to respond rapidly.",
