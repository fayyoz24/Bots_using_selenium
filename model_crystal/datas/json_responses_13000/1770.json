    "summary": "Recent PhD with 15+ years of experience in managing, analyzing, and presenting scientific information. Educator with a passion for research education & archaeology.\n\nAt the moment, I am working as a lecturer in Research Skills at the Denturism program of HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. In addition, I am the editorial secretary for Pharos - Journal of the Netherlands Institute at Athens. Besides higher ed and journal editing, my interests are research data management, social media, science communication, cultural marketing, fundraising, and heritage management. \n\nSince July 2016, I have been combining several of these interests in my role as Social Media Manager and Content Writer for Brewing Classical Styles, a (currently dormant) blog that manages and analyzes data on the role of beer in ancient Greece and Rome and communicates these to specialists and the wider public.   \n\nMy dissertation research examined the connections between the Aegean and Italy during the Bronze Age-Iron Age transition (ca. 1250 \u2013 1000 BC). During my time as a PhD researcher, I presented my work at a number of international conferences and was involved in organizing one myself. I also taught guest lectures at both BA and MA levels. In addition, throughout my studies (BA, MA, PhD) I have worked on a number of archaeological projects in the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, and the US. Over the last few years, I have been particularly involved in post-excavation activities, such as storeroom management, artifact cataloging, and data entry. \n\nContact information: kamvandenberg@gmail.com",
