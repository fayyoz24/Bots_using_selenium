    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. The below was supposed to get me hired more easily. It hasn't. But it remains to remind me of simpler times.\n\nLearning, humanitarian services, development projects and writing are my passions and I have devoted my working life to these. At 24, I found my first and recurring love working for the Red Cross. How can I not keep coming back? The intense first weeks of a disaster operation, the incredible volunteers and the way they remind you of your smallness, the way the Red Cross does so much with so little.\n\nI have been very fortunate to enjoy a successful career across a broad range of internal and field-based Red Cross emergency operations and programmes; meeting wonderful people and doing what I love \u2013 planning, monitoring, delivering and facilitating development initiatives. \n\nSpecialising in leadership, management and team development strategy/interventions, strategic planning retreats and performance management, I have influenced at a local, national and international level. My accomplishments have helped shape learning and development policies, process and procedure; translating strategies, corporate objectives and performance goals into comprehensive training programmes for global teams.\n\nSpecialities include Leadership, Reporting, Writing, Planning, Monitoring, Evaluating, Learning Development, Delivery Methodologies, Recruitment, Training, Journalism, Content Creation, Strategic Engagement, Grant Management, Resource Management, Performance Management, Collaboration, Communications, Change Projects, Coaching, Team leadership, Development Initiatives, Capacity Building, Donor Relations, Workshop Facilitation, NGO, Emotional Intelligence, Consulting.\n\nWant to get in touch? danperegrine@yahoo.com",
