For two weeks, a project which related to the context is created and exhibited within the programme of the festival. \n\nIn this project, for the subject, I treat the used waste as idiosyncratic, symbolic, and expressive materials that depict the diversity of tensions between human, human consumption of artefacts and the nature. I use this content as the starting point in the residency to explore how culture \u201crubs off\u201d onto the artefacts in production, transaction, consumption, and discard on a day-to-day basis in the context of Northeastern Slovakia and convey the understanding that time and transformation of artefacts will result in a new layer of contemporary culture. This contemporary culture comes from that being fuzzy and indistinct in self-identity in the situation of breaking ties with native land and traditional culture. During the residency, the waste collected from daily life and from local industries is sculptured, programmed, and audible into dynamics. Audiences through seeing, listening, and interacting with the tangible objects are led to generate an understanding of underlying meaning as they complete their own perception of what these objects and their movements and audio actually present and mean.\n\ntechnology support: Mathias Funk \nactor: Miroljuba Ivelin Petrova\nvoice: Marina Provatidou and Arie Rommers \nsupported by SYMPOSIUM PICTUM of umumfestival2018\n\nRead the latest article on media at KRITH news  http://krith.phil.muni.cz/experiment/um-um-2018-rozhovor-s-martinem-jakubcem-a-adamem-vrbkou",

In 2017, she tries a new medium which is a combination of internet, videos, images, and texts to create situations where people interact remotely, especially through social media. In iwanttail, the artist is, as a collaborator and a co-producer of the situations, with the different \"YOU\", and these situations can and may have an unclear beginning or end. The work tries to promote public conversation via changing role of the internet in the process. Through the internet as the frame, iwanttail takes place primarily online and directly engages \"YOU\" in the creative process so that each \"YOU\" becomes one part of the happening in this artwork. \"YOU\" are asked to collect and upload images, videos and texts in iwanttail, about the situations of \"what if you have a tail\" and tag \"#iwanttail\" on Twitter and on Instagram. \"YOU\"s and the artist can together compose the theme with fragments that will be distributed across these mediums.\n\nmore information: http://iwanttail.com/",

            "description": "The set of installations, TWO FULL MOON, plays with historical cultural roots of the deep, yet transient connection between human desire and the moon, and reflects it through interactivity back into audience experience. The work TWO FULL MOON is rooted in layers of emotion and inherent humanness that intentionally contradicts or even rejects any notion of the Space Age. It is a result of my experimentation with collecting, repurposing and locally grounding data streams of anonymous participation from the site http://twofullmoon.com. The data serves as input for dynamic physical artworks that selectively represent both remote audience and artistic intent. While technology permeates all my recent work, this project expresses the human desire to bond with nature without techne\u2019s lens obscuring our being and feeling in the world.\n\n Three metal sculptures cast the phases of moon - dynamics from a crescent moon (30*30*16cm), to a gibbous moon (30*30*28cm), till a  full moon (30*30*17cm). By designing spatial and temporal expressions of textile movements and lighting dynamics through the input from the site (http://twofullmoon.com), the project tries to develop psychedelic interaction and metaphorical communication out of usually material or interface practice.  Interactive system (OOSCI) is used to build up connectivity and interactivity flowing through the digital and physical interface.\n\nIn this project, the first version of three sculptures was made of wood and modeled a form by Chet. The final three metal sculptures were cast by Ko, at the same time, my special thanks need to go to Mathias - his OOSCI system is the foundation of designing the whole interactive experience and his technology support develops and maintains this project from the beginning till the end. The exhibition takes place at Agiou Dimitriou 19 in Athens of Greece during 19-22 February of 2019 and it is hosted and highly supported by 3QUARTERS.",

            "description": "THE FALSE MAGRITTE contains both participatory performance and interactive installation which references Belgian surrealist artist Rene Magritte. THE FALSE MAGRITTE stands on the purpose of challenging audience\u2019s preconditioned perceptions of reality - Magritte\u2019s surrealist within his numbers of \u201cwitty and thought-provoking images\u201d.  THE FALSE MAGRITTE extends art scene from where the art piece finally presents to the places where it produces and grows. 32 volunteers are invited to perform \u201carrogant\u201d in front of a camera by using their facial expression, body movement, and stage property. Their performance is collected, edited and played as idiosyncratic, symbolic, and expressive materials in the interactive installation - as one object of conversation - facing directly to the audience.  In this work, Magritte\u2019s \u201ccanvas\u201d and \u201csymbols\u201d are being \u201cstage\u201d and \u201cprops\u201d which are involving the audience in dynamics. In addition to thinking about diversity of stitching, penetration, and even conflict between audience, artwork, space, and time, THE FALSE MAGRITTE hopes to explore how performativity and interactivity, either for meaning-maker or/and for meaning-encounter, could integrate new forms of artistic expression or/and audience experience \u201cbeyond\u201d traditional alignment and presentation. Moreover, THE FALSE MAGRITTE tried to dig out how performativity and interactivity could make artist and audience from being two separate roles of making/viewing an art piece to being together creating and blooming an art experience.\n\nspecial thanks go to performance participants: \u5f20\u4f1a; \u9ec4\u82b3; \u7f2a\u9759\u8339; \u8d75\u552f\u5609; \u5f20\u7389\u8363; \u5f20\u6021\u73fa; \u9648\u6b8a; \u738b\u96c5\u5a67; \u8d3a\u4e91\u742a; \u5f20\u5b87\u8fb0; \u5434\u65b0\u5b87; \u90d1\u9526\u7a0b; \u5468\u51b0; \u6c64\u79cb\u854a; \u674e\u96cd; \u902f\u745e\u6d01; \u5415\u73b2; \u6f58\u9ad8\u742a; \u76db\u706b\u82b1; \u8d75\u51e1\u51e1; \u4e25\u5353; \u5f20\u5c0f\u96ea; \u5218\u9752; \u5192\u5a55; \u9648\u4f9d\u5a77; \u738b\u4ee4\u5a9b; \u68a6\u7af9; \u53f6\u6d9b; \u9648\u78a7\u742a; \u674e\u73c2\u5fc3; \u5cb3\u5b87\u8f89; \u8a3e\u7136\nand my student assistant group for this project: \u8d75\u552f\u5609; \u5f20\u6021\u73fa; \u4e25\u5353; \u6c64\u79cb\u854a",

The prints feature the selected frames from three scenarios that are derived from the same spatial composition. Each individual piece honours the attention to colouring, layering and composition of forms, forms flow off and away from the surface of the projected canvas, yet extends perceptive qualities through time. The concept of the scenarios is to explore different interaction styles and create gradually more dynamic aesthetics in the theme of mountain formations, light, and particles. MOUNTROTHKO as a multi-layer rendered interactive installation uses voice track and position track at the same time. White particles in this artwork have the depth of field rendering. Particles themselves are not rendered as dots, bus as complex composite shapes. The Kinect tracks the position of visitors and changes the three scenarios according to the horizontal position in space. The energy of sound in space is filtered in the two-step process that determines the increment moment of mountain starting from a randomized baseline. The energy of sound in space also controls the amount of horizontal movement of particles.\n\nMOUNTROTHKO day #01 and night #01 exhibited in  Stadhuisplein 1 of Eindhoven (the Netherlands) in the event EINDHOVENART on 27,28,29,30 of December in 2017.   \n",

Through such thoughts, the incentive could lead to the composition in the form of an artistic work: real-artificial, south-north, genders-nationalities, old-new ideas and past-present desires. The composition contains the conversation and the conflict which does create a debatable, but interesting perspective.  The composition remains differences based on language, gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.  On the occasion of the research on diversities, these two artists pose the question between the human beings and the nature, they integrate the question into two different forms of medium - film and interaction. Through the two-different expressive mediums, the artists have constructed animal masks and attempt to demonstrate the beliefs and everyday habits that apply in the time where animal rights are being violated. The audience, via interaction, will realize that they are in the unpleasant position of the animal and being accompanied by sounds of traditional organs derived from the sacrifice of animals.  The artists try to establish the existence of threat, the power, and the respect, with which the audience confronts and reflects via this artwork.\n\nBE DIFFERENCE-COMPOSE TOGETHER was exhibited in ALBERT VAN ABBEHUIS (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) during 13 May - 4 June in 2017.\n\n",

            "description": "notMONDRIAN is an interactive installation. The inspiration comes from the famous red, yellow-blue blocks and grid abstract paintings by the Dutch artist Mondrian during the 1930's. In notMONDRIAN, the artist first breaks the static grid into non-static, followed by the introduction of movement detecting technology, therefore the audience can move different parts of the body to control the positions of the red, yellow or blue blocks on the screen. At the same time, the magnitude of the action will also affect the rhythm and frequency of the sound produced by these patches during the collision. Traditional paintings mainly rely on the coordination of the artists' hands and their tools, as well as professional painting techniques and experiences. What a traditional painting could present to the audience is the last frozen second of the artist's creative process. notMONDRIAN extends painting into the process of \"painting\" as improvised dance-style performances. Meanwhile, in notMONDRIAN, the painting is no longer presented in a single still way in front of the audience, the audience is being involved.  Since 2013, the artist began to use interactive installations as a means to explore the forms of stitching, penetration, and even conflict between art and technology. In addition to thinking about the relationship between art and technology in a broad sense, in this work, she hopes to explore how interactive technology can bring new forms of presentation and experience to traditional paintings, and how to make the audience from \"the bystander\" of a painting to become \"the participant\" and \"the co-creator\" of an experience. \n\nnotMONDRIAN was invited and exhibited in BEIJING DESIGN WEEK (Beijing, China) during 23 September - 7 October in 2017.\n\n",

            "description": "UNNAMED is embodiment of the interaction and cross-merging of multi-art forms. Through setting up a stage, this artwork is the exploration of fictional actions (in the film and on the stage), ways of reactions (by performer\u2019s body and by the interactive system), and process as art. This real-time interactive performance takes place upon a square, which functions as a stage and as a screen. A film themed in \u201cPattern of Lost\u201d is projected on the left side of this stage. In the meanwhile, a performer is lit up from the backstage to the right of the stage with the appearance of the film images. During this passage, two bold white lines appear onstage and traverse the performer\u2019s body. The digitally projected lines and the performer perform the same movement while both moving in the same direction and at the same speed. The lines move forwards and backwards in coincidence with the performer\u2019s movements, as she shifts her body. Gradually, the lines are crossing each other and rotating around the performer. The lines form silhouette around the performer\u2019s body and expand together with the performer\u2019s movements. In addition, the silhouette intensifies its amount of light as the performer intensifies the force of her movements, in particular, the movements of her arms. The scene continues with the film, the performer and the lines overlapped each other. Finally, the performer walks towards to the performer in the film then she stands still and looks straight as the white lines slowly shrink down to exceedingly thin lines in the dark before disappearing.",

            "description": "Going beyond vital and physical functions of the heart, HEART IS THE ONLY WAY investigates a critical understanding of the heart (philosophical awareness) and its artistic presence. This interactive artwork stays in a space where the audience is given an opportunity to speak out. Using this interactive installation as a vehicle to explore different modes of engagement, the audience would experience the overlap between performance (the presentation of prepared scenarios) and performativity (the constitution of understanding through interactivity). The installation combines thousands of threads as a cylinder \u201cscreen\u201d which carries physical aesthetics and embodied interaction to present multiple evocative moments latent in natural landscapes. The interactive experience offered is unfolding the layers of the artwork with movement and auditory input. It enables the audience to become a part of the happenings. The artist records her own sighs, whispers, laughing, singing, and humming as auditory reactions to the audience. By speaking and moving in the space, the audience transforms the floor into a dark sea, thousands of wires into a flowing sea wave, and the tunnel into his/her connections to the heart. The pace of the artwork is much more stable and slower than the audience normally experiences in interactive arts which leads to a \"frozen/mystical\" visual sense and a \"cold/calm\" emotional load. In this installation, knowing one's heart intendment is recognised in the integration of self-experience. \n\nHEART IS THE ONLY WAY was exhibited and experimented in Pavilion U54 in TU/e (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) during 1 January - 29 February in 2016 and exhibited in 1st \"In the front\" Digital Media Summit Forum (Nanjing, China) during 4 - 6 December in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

NOTMASKI is a mixed media installation presented as one film (\u2018WHO., 10:15min), and six paintings (\u201cYOU\u201d, \u201cME\u201d, \u201cHIM\u201d, \u201cHER\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, \u201cTHEM\u201d), which shows pieces of abstract symbols defined directly by the artist. NOTMASKII in this series is an interactive installation. People who involved in this art scene influence each other's behaviors and they have to find the right way to deal with this influence. Every frame of the video and every stroke of the painting and every second of audio in NOTMASKI are controlled, while in NOTMASKII, the interactive installation, audience, machine, and artist together complete the artwork on a flowing canvas. On the stage of our life, self-consciousness, and environmental-influence these two forces, they tear at each other and counterbalance with each other. For people, how to shake hands with both of them and stand together with both of them is an intractable problem. Performing probably is one answer for this question, a means of hiding, scarifying or giving up part of self, part of our willingness to exchange coexistence. \n\nNOTMASKI&II was exhibited in Vestdijk 27 (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) during DUTCH DESIGN WEEK 2015 and exhibited in 1st \"In the front\" Digital Media Summit Forum (Nanjing, China) during 4-6 December in \n2016.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "REPLICATION is focused on the conflict embedded in the general daily life - the many activities in our daily lives have a replication on which our immediate effort and actions could have an impact, in the meantime, this artwork is staged for performing in public that the audience could interact with the artwork individually and also participate through the group observation.  The interactivity in REPLICATION is not just created for building a conversation between the audience and the artwork. The interactivity also helps the audience to be a performer in the public space and to establish a dialogue between the individual participant and the other spectators in the same space. The main part of this artwork is built with over 80 IKEA tables.  In addition to this comparatively large-scale physical sculpture, video images captured by the camera in the ball are projected onto the selected table surfaces.  The experience in this artwork is built on the forms of physical sculpture and interactivity in which both forms serve as a means to allow the audience to access the content. \n\nThe initial iteration of REPLICATION is made by Emilija Marinkovic, Jiali Tang, Xiaoyun Zhang and Yuyuan Zhou as one of the nine results of the international workshop (Taicang, China) for which the artist is involved as the supervisor. The second version of REPLICATION is adapted and developed for the Dutch Design Week 2014 by professors, researchers, and students at the Department of Industrial Design of TU/e (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) in which the artist is involved as the art director and the group leader. \n\nREPLICATION was exhibited in Schellensfabriek (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) during DUTCH DESIGN WEEK 2014 and exhibited in 1st \"In the front\" Digital Media Summit Forum (Nanjing, China) during 4 - 6 December in 2016.\n",
