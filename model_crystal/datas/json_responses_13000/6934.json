    "summary": "I am a student at NHTV, International Tourism Management. I am polyvalent, dynamic, creative, with an extrovert profile, self-initiative, self-motivation & public relations faculties. I was born in beautiful Andorra, in the heart of the Pyrenees (more info at my-woe.com, ;) ) now living and studying in the city of Breda, Netherlands.\n\nI am passionate about learning interesting new topics. Furthermore, I like being surrounded by knowledge-challenging and social environments, where I can share and discuss ideas. \n\nSPECIALTIES: I am highly creative and imaginative. I come up easily with solutions and I think out of the box. I am energetic and easily motivated, always open to new opportunities and new teachings.\n\nEXPERTISE: I think I am quite a polyvalent person because, at the age of 24, I have experience as a translator, entertainer, F&B assistant, public relations, sailing instructor, sales assistant, disc-jockey, receptionist, in administrative functions and much more.\n\nKNOWLEDGE: Before starting at NHTV I already spoke 5 languages (Catalan, French, Spanish, English and Dutch). I had intermediate knowledge of digital communication techniques (photography, audiovisual realization and bases of periodism) and social media. At Breda University of Applied Sciences, I specialized in event management, tourism destination management, e-commerce, and tourism impacts (the world of change). \n\nIf you like my profile feel free to contact me or make a millionaire offer ;).\nSend me an e-mail at sunnyescodameeuwissen@gmail.com.",

I also helped promote and sell their current offer to a specific market. I updated the website of the company, by integrating e-commerce knowledge, to aid attract more customers and to target better their segment. Furthermore, I was invited to assist many Tourism Fairs, where I assisted the team and management with sales and promotion, making their offers known to new potential buyers, and helping them maintain their network through providing the team with assistance in meetings, business dinners, and other events. Some of the fairs I attended were the RDA Workshop (Koelnmesse, editions: 2015, 2016, 2018 & 2019) and the Tourism Fair ITB Berlin (Edition: 2019). \n\nI loved working for this company because they are passionate, client-driven, and really creative when it comes to their products. The things I learned there were CRM and the importance of a good database and network from a young age. As well as how to promote and sell products while being in a competitive environment (Fairs for example). I learned about guiding as well as creating custom-made tours while having a customer service mindset and eye for detail.",

It was a pleasure! It is a wonderful hotel with lots of charm and really good staff. They showed me the basics and I quickly got the rythm. I loved working face to face with the clients. They were all lovely and they were all big smiles when they came to the reception. Some of the clients even felt like family, so their departures were sad but I am glad I could also see and live this experience.",
