    "summary": "I am a new graduate of Master of Arts, and I am aware that I face a future of various challenges that I am very eager to confront.\n \nI have pursued my Bachelor's Degree in International Relations and my Master of Arts Degree in International Relations and Global Communications; where I have studied International Relations and Social Media studies together. Towards the end of my Master's Degree studies, I have written my dissertation on a subject about Social Media Activism on Twitter. So, I can effectively overcome the challenges that I will face in the future. \nWhile pursuing my Bachelor's Degree, I have done an internship at the Koopbank. I had an opportunity to work in various departments of the bank, but mainly as a Treasurer and Teller. My learning experience there was very positive and contributed massively to understand the core of a fast-paced business life and how to be a successful team player. Also, at the same time I've started to learn Greek as my third language. Learning a new language in my spare time helped me to use time much more effectively. \n\nI am currently seeking employement in Social Media, Business or Administration. I believe I have the necessary personality, skills, team-player attitude, positive state of mind and attention to detail to become an effective role player in this industry. I know what it takes to build a professional relationship and implement new strategies. \n ",
