    "summary": "Hello!  I spent the first 10 years of my studies + career listening to people, learning how to amplify voices and figuring out how to tackle some of the world's toughest international public health problems. But a couple of years ago, I decided I wanted to do something a little more creative, a little more fast-paced, so I took my research + people skills and transformed them to become a UX Designer. \n\nMy background in science has me crave evidence-based solutions, while my time evaluating policy powers me to think about the user. I currently design the e-commerce experience at FedEx to help small and medium businesses ship faster. My path to a designer hasn't been linear, but my various experiences make me be a better, more empathetic designer. \n\nLet's connect! Always happy to talk about my my career change, experiences, and UX :)",
