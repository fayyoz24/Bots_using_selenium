    "summary": "I'm an experienced designer, teacher and consultant. I love moments of insight so much that I want to make other people enjoy that thrill as well. ;-) \n\nIT, Design, AI, music, psychology, and management are my backgrounds. Digital Transformation is my current domain. Design, Design Thinking, and Musical Thinking are ways of connecting to the world that have great potential for innovation, in all sectors of society. Always interested in new ways of connecting values to practices. I'm available as an independent consultant for clients. Conceptual thinking is important, but always grounded in reality, in the life world of people and organisations. I think in terms of processes, change and growth. Call it musical thinking, where everything happens in time, and nothing is static.\n\nI\u2019m developing a methodology that explicitly works with values, and is independent of specific media for interventions. I\u2019m calling it \u2018vertical craftsmanship\u2019, because it strongly features switching between levels of abstraction (values, reframing and action) as a craft in its own right. It adds a set of concepts around Kees Dorst\u2019s Frame Creation framework, and makes room for more explicit ways of working with trade-offs between values in relation to situated challenges. It\u2019s powerful and elegant at the same time. \n\nExperienced consultant/teacher with a history of working in digital media and music. Strong entrepreneurship professional, skilled in Inspiring people, Computer Science, Design Research, User Experience Design, Lecturing, and managing (extremely) multidisciplinary teams (hint: it\u2019s not about the different skills, it\u2019s the value systems).\n\nSome people have told me that I'm very good at summarizing things in four-word phrases. Always comes in handy.",

We worked closely with the museum, the public library and the regional archive in Gouda, a town in the Netherlands that functions as a site to experiment with our ideas. During the last couple of years, we were involved in setting up different labs in neighbourhoods in the city of The Hague, that focused on innovations in cultural and social processes. During this, we also developed methods and techniques for reframing complex problems. All those methods took human meaning and values as a starting point for reframing.",
