    "summary": "As an environmental planner, throughout my career I have always been passionate about developing society, and finding new ways to do so, without changing the ecosystem and without damaging nature. Nowadays I am really interested how we can go beyond this with the use of data and data science. \n\nIn Eritrea, I worked in a mining exploration company in the GIS and data management team, creating geological maps to discover the potential of new mining areas. \n\nI have been living in the Netherlands for 4 years now. I now work at the Municipality of The Hague (work experience program \u2013 werkervaringsplek), as part of the GIS team. I am mapping roads, houses, actually all activity in the city. My ambition is to become a GIS specialist. Besides public sector organizations, also interested to work at commercial organizations and development projects internationally.  \n\nMy areas of expertise include: specialist in environmental planning, GIS and Data Management. I am an introvert with good collaboration skills within my own team and with other colleagues. I work with focus, in a very precise manner with excellent time management skills. \n\nIf you would like to learn more about me and how I can be an added value to your organization and workforce, please contact me via Inmail. Always happy to meet in person too! ",
