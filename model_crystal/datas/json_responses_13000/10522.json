The MBA Oath is the management equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath taken by doctors.  \n\nIn a ''Harvard Business Review'' piece published in October 2008, Khurana and Nohria linked the connection between professionalism of a profession and the profession's ability to deliver value to society: True professions bear a code of conduct, and the meaning and consequences of those codes are taught as part of the formal education of their members. A governing body, composed of respected members of the profession, oversees members\u2019 compliance. \n\nThrough these codes, professional institutions forge an implicit social contract with other members of society: Trust us to control and exercise jurisdiction over this important occupational category. In return, the profession promises, we will ensure that our members are worthy of your trust\u2014that they will not only be competent to perform the tasks they have been entrusted with, but they will conduct themselves with high standards and integrity. On balance we believe that a profession, with well-functioning institutions of discipline, will curb misconduct because moral behavior is an integral part of the identity of professionals: a self-image most are motivated to maintain. \n\nReference: http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2008/10/its-time-to-make-management-a-true-profession/ar/1  & \"It's Time to Make Management a True Profession.\" ''Harvard Business Review'' print edition, October 2008.",
