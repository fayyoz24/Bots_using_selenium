    "summary": "Geoscientist with extensive experience in evaluating geophysical and geological (G&G) data for both regional studies and prospect maturation. Skilled in integrating subsurface data to identify exploration and production opportunities, evaluate subsurface risks, and give technical recommendations that support investment decisions in oil and gas projects.  \n\nI am aware of the challenges as well as the opportunities that the energy transition represents for a developing country like Colombia. As a Geoscientist with an 'Explorer' mindset, I can make a meaningful contribution and that\u2019s why over the next four years, I will work on evaluating the low-carbon energy potential of the Caribbean Region in the country and explore how this potential can be harnessed to achieve Colombia's sustainable development.",
