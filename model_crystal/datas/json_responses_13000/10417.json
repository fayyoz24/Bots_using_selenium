    "summary": "Laura Fassio is an Italian Architect and Urban Designer coming from Rome.\nShe has been living and working in Rotterdam since 2010 and has worked with a collective of architects and urban designers (OMERO) for urban and landscape design competitions as the masterplan design for a university campus in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia (2015), the Europan experiences in Feldafing (Munich, GE, 2015) - for the restoration and reconversion of an ex-military area - and in Mestre (Venice, IT, 2013) - for the rehabilitation of an ex-railway depot area.\nIn 2013 and 2014 she has been collaborating with Osar Architects in Antwerp. There she had the possibility to work on different projects, some at the concept phase while others at the construction phase. \nIn 2012 and 2011 she has collaborated with two young offices in Rotterdam, Shift a+u (architecture urbanism) and Stereo Architects. She was asked to look after different tasks: concept studies for urban projects and master plans; technical processing of architectural solutions and details; competitions and ideal new representations of realized projects. \nIn 2012 Laura Fassio had the occasion to meet the University of Rome drafting up proposals for the reuse of an historic building in the municipality of Orte, a small medieval village in the north of Rome. \nIn 2010 she got through the National Exam in Rome to be professionally qualified as Architect and Urban Designer and she registered at the Architectural Association. In 2010 Laura has been awarded for a Leonardo Scholarship provided by her University: she moved to the Netherlands, performing a traineeship at De Zwarte Hond in Rotterdam.\nIn 2009 she graduated with first class honors at the Architecture Faculty of Roma Tre with Professor Marco Cremaschi on a Thesis Research about the meaning and relevance of Urbanity and public space in Centralities. The thesis was developed between Rome and Berlin, within the supervision of Professor Harald Bodenschatz from the TU Berlin.",
