    "summary": "I previously did an internship at the Korea Arts Management Service. There I learned about promotion through social media marketing. Once, we had an issue with the copyright on one of the uploaded videos. To solve the problem, we invited a consultant for some legal advice and took action accordingly. Many variations may occur during online-marketing, especially social media marketing, but it is important to quickly respond and take action to the problem.\n\nWorking at Hyundai Global Service, I was in charge of the logistics. As a mediator between the manufacturer and the customer, I managed the freight schedule taking into account the import and export period and vessel embarkment schedule. From this experience, I learned to plan and manage situations through communication and close monitoring.\n\nMy strength is that I have global experience which gives me a wider understanding of culture and action. Moreover, I am an elastic person who can deal with various situations flexibly to solve and move forward.\n",
