To date, more than 2,500 K-12 teachers, principals and specialists coast to coast have been honored with over $63 million in individual, unrestricted $25,000 awards. More than $135 million has been devoted to the overall program, which includes powerful professional development opportunities throughout the recipients\u2019 careers in education.\n\nUnlike most teacher awards, this program has no formal nomination or application process. Every participating state\u2019s department of education appoints an independent blue ribbon committee to recommend candidates according to strict criteria, with final selections made by the Milken Family Foundation.\n\nUnsuspecting recipients are caught by surprise during annual Notifications when their names are announced at emotional all-school assemblies. In a moment\u2019s time, cheering students, proud colleagues, an entourage of distinguished officials and the media are reminded of teaching\u2019s critical value to society. Young people are inspired to consider the adventure of teaching as a career choice.\n\nThe Milken Educator Award is not an accolade for lifetime achievement. Recipients are heralded in early to mid-career for what they have achieved\u2026 and for the promise of what they will accomplish in the future.\n\nTo further this goal, new awardees are inducted into the national Milken Educator Network, a unique cadre of innovative, results-oriented leaders dedicated to reforming and strengthening American K-12 education. For as the watchwords of the Milken Educator Awards proclaim:\nThe future belongs to the educated.",

While Nyssa served as a member of the NCAS standards subcommittee that created the standards and Cornerstone Assessments for Grades 3-5, she has worked with many sets of standards from various states and countries.  With an emphasis on collaborative process, Nyssa works with teams of arts teachers and curriculum directors to envision, create, document and align arts curriculum.  After curriculum frameworks have been established, she works with teams to refine learning and teaching practice through looking at student work, scaffolding and vertical alignment and increasing rigor, while maintaining the necessary emphasis on the skills necessary for students to be successful musicians.  Having worked with diverse groups of teachers from 6 continents, Nyssa's fluency with curriculum writing comes through in the flexible way she works with groups - meeting them where they are, finding collaborative vision and facilitating a process that helps them reach their goals.",
