    "summary": "I have recently started as a PhD candidate at the soil chemistry & chemical soil quality group at Wageningen University & research. For my PhD research I am investigating how active treatment (i.e. flushing and aerating) of waste within landfills could reduce the contaminant release of the waste. If reduced in a sufficient amount, this could mean other more costly measures for prevent environmental contamination are no longer needed.\n\nBefore starting as a PhD student, I followed the master programme \"Earth & Environment\", during which I specialised in the biology and chemistry of soil and water with a specific focus on soil chemistry. For this programme, I wrote a master thesis about the calcium chloride extraction, and how varying factors within this extraction affected measured concentration of zinc, copper, and dissolved organic matter. Furthermore, I interned at NMI agro, during which I created a simple model capable of predicting nutrient leaching towards surface waters on a field scale.\n",
