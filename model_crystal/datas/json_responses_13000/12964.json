    "summary": "Since more than 15 years I'm fully focussed on business development in Africa. I embarked this journey after having worked in consulting, marketing, advocacy and business development. My consulting firm EMSA Emerging Markets Africa has brought me to some 25 African countries, where I had the pleasure of working with over 100 inspiring African entrepreneurs. My intervention areas are business development, corporate finance, impact investment and value chains.\n\nNext to my consulting practice, I currently deploy this experience and expertise as an entrepreneur myself. With a small number of business partners I own businesses in horticulture, coffee, import and export. My sole aim remains to create genuine sustainable development impact in Africa.",
