    "summary": "Let\u2019s start with the basics: I recently completed my MA in development studies from ISS (Erasmus University) and I love what I do! My thesis was on the relationship medium-sized companies have with their ethics, particularly during transitions. And that is what my career will be in: ethical business. \n\nI recognise that the phrase seems paradoxical, but figuring out how to be ethical while maintaining profit margins is one of the most important conversations of our generation. So, I want to dedicate my career to protecting communities as well as economies through cleaner, more humane and sustainable production (and consumption). \n\nI worked for almost seven years before doing this degree, building a small but robust bank of experience. Firstly as an account manager in an SME advertising firm, then as the head of Shell SG Volunteers, Shell Singapore\u2019s employee-led skills-based volunteer outreach programme. In the former my informal role went beyond client management to resource, project and production management. In the latter I was a one-woman-band, a social entrepreneur within the broader Shell environment. I actively engaged colleagues to co-create and implement meaningful, impactful, mutually beneficial social outreach programmes (30+ annual events with 15% of our 3,000 local staff regularly involved by the time I left). \n\nFinally, my skillsets go beyond research, communications and event and strategy management. I have alos volunteered in amateur theatre productions as a production and stage manager for the past 7 years, which has honed my organisation, leadership, frugality, resource managent, flexibility and teamwork in the field.\n\nAlong with my love of movies, history, and the English language, this is who I am. And collectively, this is how I envisage contributing to our social fabric!",
