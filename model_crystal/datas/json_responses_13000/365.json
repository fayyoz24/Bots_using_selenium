    "summary": "As far as I can remember, I always loved creating projects. A polyvalent process that comes in different steps:\n- the conception of the idea, the project,\n- a creative phase where the identity of the project, its outline and content are defined,\n- the organization and management of the tasks required for the completion of the project, the event. A minutious work rewarded with finding the clients and their guests fully enjoying the experience that was specially built for them. More than a job, it is a vocation.\n\nProduction of business and cultural events, design of unique tourist experiences and publicaton of creative content (written and audio) are among the projects I manage, from Amsterdam where I am based since 2015.

I was therefore at the same time a customer service agent, an event producer and a brand and image developer. \n\nI assisted in the organization of events of different formats, on a regular basis (minimum 3 events per month). I naturally took part in the promotion of those events, through the web and on physical supports (newsletters, website, social media, company brochure, etc). \n\nThis internship definitely planted seeds that grew my enthusiasm for developing my career around events planning.",
