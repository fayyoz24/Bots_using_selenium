    "summary": "I have strong communication and organization skills and am able to coordinate international staff and other stakeholders of various cultural backgrounds. I speak Mandarin Chinese at a near-native level, am improving my Dutch on a daily basis, and am a passionate speaker and strong writer. In my previous role as  department coordinator, I was successful in promoting a positive and welcoming school ethos, organizing and leading events, and solving problems when there were conflicts of interest. I kept department records, interviewed, onboarded and trained new staff, set calendars and agendas, and fulfilled other administrative and managerial roles. Currently I am busy organising events for international employees of Delft University of Technology and their partners.",
