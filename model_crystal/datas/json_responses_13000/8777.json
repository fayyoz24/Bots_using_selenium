Since 2018, we\u2019ve worked with Data and AI specialists to find consultancy roles they love at companies like KLM, ING, Vattenfall and Randstad Group - in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, MLOps, Data Engineering and Cloud DevOps.\n\nIn our vision, freelance consultants are The Future of Work. That\u2019s a difficult step for some to take, but we\u2019ve found a solution. We act as a stepping stone for Data & AI consultants who want to move away from traditional employment towards independency by being your own employer. We take away all the hassle by taking care of all steps to create your own consultancy company, towards more flexibility, higher earnings and projects that you like \u2014 without the risks of starting up all on your own. \n\nIn short: We connect you with your first project at a company of your choice, all before ending your current employment contract. Instead of a fixed salary, you earn 75% of your hourly rate \u2014 around \u20ac12,000 per month plus many tax benefits because of entrepreneurship \u2014 depending on your ideal work-life balance. After one year, you know what it's like to work through your own company and be ready to fly on your own, without Startup Accelerator. The Future of Work, it's up to you!\n\nInterested to see if freelance consultancy could be something for you? Feel free to fill in the questionnaire on the website, which takes 2 minutes of your time \u2014 or contact us by phone or email for any question you might have! https://www.startupaccelerator.nl.",
