We are animal lovers who cannot remain indifferent to the misery of homeless animals starving on the streets and being abused or killed by cruel people. Our mission is to make this world a better place where all lives are valued and respected.\nWe run a dog shelter of 120 rescued dogs and operate under a 'no-kill' philosophy, which means that we do not euthanise animals. Running a no-kill shelter is an extremely challenging mission. Our shelter receives no local, state or federal funding and is entirely dependent on contributions from the public to cover its annual operating budget. Adoption is a second major problem for us as, sadly, local people in Azerbaijan don\u2019t tend to adopt shelter dogs. Rescued cats are being fostered by our volunteers. We strive for giving the rescued animals a chance to live happy, safe lives and we believe that together we can reach our goal and continue this noble activity.\nhttps://barsadopt.nl/"
