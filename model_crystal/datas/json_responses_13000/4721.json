    "summary": "Hi! I am a researcher in the Kotlin team at JetBrains and lead a Concurrent Computing lab at JetBrains Research, working on a PhD in the field of concurrency at the same time. My primary research interests are concurrent data structures and algorithms, their verification, and practically applicable code analysis. Here you can find all the recent information about me and my projects.\n\nI am passionate about outdoor activities, such as cycling, skiing, or hiking when not working. Yet, the true love is sailing on small sports boats. \n\nPlease do not hesitate to visit my website for more details, including the list of publications and given talks: https://nikitakoval.org.",

As a result, a typical concurrent test via Lincheck contains only about 15 lines of code and can test all data structures with the same interface, irrelevant of how these data structures are implemented. Given the operations and the contract declaration (linearizability is the default one), Lincheck (1) generates a set of random concurrent scenarios, (2) examines them using either stress-testing or bounded model checking, and (3) verifies that the results of each invocation satisfy the required correctness property, providing an easy-to-follow trace to reproduce the found error in the model checking mode \u2013 this significantly simplifies the bug investigation.",
