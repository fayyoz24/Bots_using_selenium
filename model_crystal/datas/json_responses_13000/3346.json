    "summary": "I am a PMP\u00ae certified project manager with a background of mechanical engineering. During my 10+ years of work life I have led a multi-cultural/multinational team in various countries, managed quality of a 1,3billion USD project in Turkmenistan, implemented change of management project in one of the biggest chemical company, and led brownfield project in one of the biggest FMCG company in the world. \n\nIn my projects I adapted to changing customer requirements, project needs to add more value to projects, because business environment is changing, technology is changing, people are changing, and projects must adopt to these changes to stay up to date and deliver highest value. Team is the most important element on this goal, and I always focus on my team, empower them, help them improve their skills, create safe environment for them to grow. Another important element is communication, I pay extra attention to stakeholder communications, respond to their requests, resolve conflicts among them, most importantly help them to focus on project goals.",
