We\u2019ve all heard that companies have been using it to capitalize on our brain\u2019s shortcomings, but how? As it has become increasingly relevant in the marketing field, we want to provide you with insights into the theories behind and the applications in neuromarketing. We offered an interactive and introductory talk to provide a theoretical background, followed by hands-on workshops with companies that engage in neuromarketing practices (Alpha.One & NN Investments). The man who coined the term \u2018neuromarketing\u2019, Prof. Ale Smidts, introduced this field. The event took place on April 13th and 14th, 2021.",
