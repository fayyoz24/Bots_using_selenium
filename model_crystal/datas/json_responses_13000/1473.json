    "summary": "Storytelling is the word that best encompasses my professional experience and personal passions. It has evolved and taken multiple forms throughout the years, as it applied to so many topics and fields.\n\nCurrently, I am a children\u2019s book author and independent publisher. I recently self-published my first book, \"The ABCs of Amsterdam: a first guide to the capital of the Netherlands\", an alphabet travel guide of Amsterdam for young readers.\n\nHow did I get here?\n\nOver the years, I contributed to creating over 40 museum exhibitions in internationally-renowned museums across the United States (especially the Field Museum in Chicago, IL), gaining extensive experience crafting compelling stories for different audiences and on many a different topics as well as managing large teams of most talented people.\n\nAfter a family relocation to Amsterdam, I experienced again (after my relocation from my hometown in Italy to Chicago) that the more you know about a place, the more you feel at home. Same for children. \n\nSo was born \"The ABCs of Amsterdam\", the first of the City ABC Books, a series that will take young readers around the world one letter at a time!",
