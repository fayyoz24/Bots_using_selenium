Managed stakeholders, defined long term architectural runway and short term delivery plan. Successfully combined the roles of System architect and Line manager. \n\nAs a system architect I defined the requirements and delivery models for the software and hardware of the system. I used recognized  ISO 26550 as a guideline. Under my management modular sw development and CI/CD were introduced. Hardware release cycles were shorten to balance risk vs time to market. Using the above mentioned practices, I was able to reduce the failure rate of the system by 60 % and achieved a feature delivery rate of 80 %. \n\nAs a line manager I facilitated creation of the true team, defined and successfully implemented personal development plans for all team members, hired outstanding talents and managed to retain people in the company the longest. I was a guardian of the physical and mental well being of the team, teamwork and defined the  collective and individual development paths.I am a true believer in Agile approach and value based work and collaboration.",
