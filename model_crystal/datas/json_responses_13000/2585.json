    "summary": "Anurag Bhattacharya is an architect and project coordinator at ZJA, a Dutch architecture studio founded in 1990 and based in Amsterdam. He grew up in India and graduated from the NIT Trichy, where he studied architectural engineering and design. He received his Master of Architecture from Delft University of Technology with an honorable mention. He is a registered architect in the Netherlands and India, as well as a chartered member of the RIBA UK. Anurag has given guest lectures and talks at various academic and commercial events and he is a member of Advisory Committee at Delft University of Technology.\n\nAnurag started at ZJA in 2014 as part of the design team for the renovation of the renowned Thialf ice-skating arena in Heerenveen (NL). So far, he has contributed to 70+ projects ranging from large-size complex infrastructure including stations and bridges, as well as sports and leisure related projects. He has gained extensive experience with projects of varying scales and a wide range of project phases, from design and programming up to developing construction details. Throughout, he has had a focus on designing creatively with the site\u2019s constraints while creating environmentally sustainable approaches.\n\nAnurag also worked on the new Erasmusline station (HSE) in The Hague (NL), where he assisted in the development of the design and optimization of the roof geometry, which was completed in 2016. This project highlighted the value of parametric design workflows and cross-disciplinary collaborations to achieve the integration of engineering expertise, which led to file-to-factory manufacturing capabilities. He was part of the winning team for the competition of the Diamond Exchange, Capital C Amsterdam, which was completed in 2019. Anurag also played an active role in the research and design of the Shaded Dome concept, which has been awarded a European patent as a unique and novel architectural concept. This concept was further elaborated in the design and construction of Freedom Museum, Groesbeek (NL), which was completed in 2020.\n\nIn his current role, Anurag is responsible for coordinating project teams, overseeing the aesthetic and technical aspects of the design, carrying projects through from conception to realization. He has a particular interest in the implementation of emerging technologies related to design, computation, fabrication, and sustainability strategies. Partly for this reason, Anurag is actively engaged in research efforts and knowledge sharing within ZJA.",

            "description": "The city of Mikkeli sits at an interesting crossroads. At once a dwindling industrial center and a growing administrative and services city. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Mikkeli harbour was a busy industrial and tourist port. The transition of use of shipping to road reduced the industrial use of the harbour. The same railway that helped make its industry has become a block for the connection of the city with the lakefront. The challenge here is to bridge this gap in Mikkeli and strengthen the strip\u2019s identity as a cultural center and agro_energy-hub for the city and region. \n\nThe goal is to develop a self-sufficient eco-structure using performance driven computation techniques taking instances from biomimetic principles occurring in nature. It is done in three interlinked stages \u2013 first being the urban and infrastructure level, second being the more precise building level and the last being the ecological cycle. The architectural design emphasis being on design of the science center integrated with jetty/ public esplanades and the public green houses.",
