    "summary": "A seasoned leader and practitioner with a multi-disciplinary experience in Agriculture, Renewable Energy (RE) and impact investment in emerging markets. Has over ten (10) years\u2019 experience supporting investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions, climate smart agriculture (regenerative agriculture), Disaster Risk Reduction as well as building markets that work for rural poor in the African continent. Keen interest in market-based approaches that crowd in private sector participation in finding lasting solutions to underserved markets. Has a drive for systems change grounded on what works as an evidence base for replication and policy development. To that end, Edwin believes in participatory and inclusive approaches in design and fact-finding assessments. \n\nHis leadership mantra upholds collaboration on a pedestal, an inspiration that borrows heavily from the philosophy of Ubuntu that each of us has a place in this world. The Ubuntu philosophy is beautifully summed in the words of Archbishop Desmond Tutu \u2018\u2019 None of us comes into this world alone. We would not know how to think, walk, speak, or behave as human beings unless we learnt it from other human beings. We need Human beings to be human\u2019\u2019.",
