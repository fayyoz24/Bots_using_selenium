    "summary": "We need a culture change. \n\nBecause to stop climate change, save species from dying and make society more humane, we need a radical rethink.\n\nCommunication is at the core of that change. It's the medium and the message of the change you want to see in the world.\n\n- If we want to make sustainability the norm, we need more sustainable communication.\n- If we want people to take more responsibility, we need more responsible communication.\n- If we want to break down the barriers that keep us from working together, we need communication that connects us.\n\nThat\u2019s why I started From Scratch \u2014 to support organisations in their transformation towards integrating economic, social and environmental impact.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f \ud83e\udd19 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb \u2328\ufe0f \ud83d\udcac \ud83d\udce7 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\n\ud83d\udc49My professional journey before starting from scratch\ud83d\udc48\n\n\ud83c\udfeb You could say I\u2019ve been writing copy since 1997, when I made ads to get pupils joining political groups and fighting for better education.\n\n\ud83e\uddf115 years later, I started the global copy team at LEGO Customer Service. The tone of voice, copywriting and advisor training we created made some LEGO customer service emails go viral \u2014 such as the one that went out to Luka Apps. Proof that customer service is a marketing function.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f I then spent a few years agency-side, writing web copy, voice scripts, chat and email messages for over 70 iconic brands. \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 Ever wished people came with manuals? Here\u2019s mine: shrtco.de/SabinesManual\n\n\u2753\ud83c\udf99 What change do you want to make? Let's chat: https://from-scratch.net/contact or words@from-scratch.net",

Students came from all age groups, from primary school to adult learners. I worked one-on-one and with small groups of up to 5. As success and happiness go hand in hand, I also helped manage conflicts between students, parents and teachers.\n\nI helped stock our library of books and educational games, either buying or creating materials that worked for our students. When we got an interactive whiteboard, I trained my colleagues on how to use it.\n\n- Subjects: German (also as a foreign language), English, French, Latin, Maths, Learning Strategies & Techniques, Concentration; special courses for AD(H)D, dyslexic students and students with special needs/learning difficulties",
