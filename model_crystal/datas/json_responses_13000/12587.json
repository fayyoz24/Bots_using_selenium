The 'Nix' performed well throughout the first passage from Gran Canaria to S\u00e3o Vicente in an elapsed time of 4d 23h 13m 42s. \n\nIn the second leg we sailed across the ARC+ finish line in an elapsed time of 10d 4h 51m 18s, winning Class A and took Line Honours for leading the ARC+ fleet into wonderful Saint Lucia on November 28th. Again a fast and successful passage for the 'Nix'. \n\nA great taste of ocean sailing, truly spectacular!\n\nRead more: http://www.worldcruising.com/",
