    "summary": "As a BSc in Game Design and Production and director of my own game development company (Twirlbound), my life is about game design and development for the larger part. At a young age I was able to forge a hobby into work, which pays off by loving every single minute of what I do.\n\nI enjoy being involved in game projects on all levels, using my skills in overseeing processes and creatively directing teams to make quality products that resonate with the right audiences. I believe psychology is an invaluable part of game design and design in general, and I always strive to dive deep into the thoughts of people throughout an experience.",
