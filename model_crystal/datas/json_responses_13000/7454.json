    "summary": "7 years post education experience in the Medical Device industry as territory manager and product specialist in the Benelux.\n\nExperience in Respiratory Management, Vascular Surgery and (Neuro) Interventional Radiology.\n\nBorn in Paris, I made the choice to go for an International experience and to study in the Netherlands and Sweden. I made the efforts to learn languages of my past environments in order to be able speak English, Dutch and Spanish fluently.\n\nMy main motivation is to help people with tangible or non tangible solutions that simply can satisfy daily needs and practice. I do this by combining my willingness to share ideas and knowledge with people and my interest in technology in general.\n\nI believe knowledge is of course important but communication is also key for each one of us to understand the value of things we do or use in life in general.\n\nMy parents education taught me to always be kind by helping people and opened minded and curious to learn from others.\n\nSo far very thanksful for my experiences and inspiration from people that were a big part of these experiences. \n",
