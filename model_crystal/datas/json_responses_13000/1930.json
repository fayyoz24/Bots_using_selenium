The concept behind the name Elysian Fields is based on ancient Greek mythology, which refers to the final resting place of the heroic and the virtuous. According to Homer, an ancient Greek poet, the Elysian Fields or Elysium was place where the favored of Zeus enjoyed perfect happiness.\n\nToday\u2019s world can be demanding and stressful and so understanding this, we have developed a product that can help make ones experience in this world a lot more pleasant. Enter the Mood Swing. With the Mood Swing one does not have to wait until they reach the afterlife to enjoy perfect happiness and a stress free environment. This product is designed to release natural aromatic fragrances in the air and help boost moods and provide a feeling of calmness in the midst of busy days.\n\nThe Elysian Fields\u2019 Mood Swing is an essential oil diffuser that works in conjunction with mood sensor, which is in the form of a wristband. With this product, we have combined aromatherapy with technology. We have created a symbiotic relationship between nature and technology. The mood sensor is the key element of our product. It is what separates us from the rest of the pack. How the sensor works is, it senses a person\u2019s mood by reading their temperature and monitoring their nerve impulses. After a reading is done and a mood is detected, that mood is then wirelessly communicated to the electric oil diffuser, telling it to release a fragrance that compliments the state of mind a person might be in.

As preferred by Euro-Com, a telephone survey was used to contact the vast majority of Euro-Com's customers.\nThe questions within this survey covered the following subjects upon customer satisfaction: service, product, communication and problem solving abilities of the company. Next to the telephone surveys, face-to-face interviews were conducted with five of Euro-Com's customers.\n\nBy creating possible recommendations, suggestions were made on how Euro-Com could improve the quality of their translations, service, communication and problem-solving skills in order to achieve a higher customer satisfaction.",
