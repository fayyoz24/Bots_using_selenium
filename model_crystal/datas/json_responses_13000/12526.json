    "summary": "I am currently leading an awesome talent acquisition team at Bitvavo, an Amsterdam based scale-up that aims to bridge the gap between traditional currencies and digital assets. In 2018, Bitvavo launched the first version of its digital assets trading platform and by offering transparent fees, a wide range of assets and an easy to use platform, Bitvavo is making the currency of the future accessible for everyone.\n\nIn three years time, Bitvavo has established itself as the market leader in the Benelux, with 1MIO+ users exchanging over billion euros worth of digital assets a month.\n\nWe are scaling and looking for an ambitious people with a passion for digital assets! We have open positions in Engineering (NodeJS | TS | Golang | HPC | React | React Native), Blockchain, Marketing, Financial Crime, KYC & Risk. Visit jobs.bitvavo.com and find out more about us!\n\nMore about me:\nAfter the realisation that I will not make it as a professional musician I decided to focus my creativity elsewhere (I keep telling myself that I was close though...). I have worked in many different fields and companies ranging from NGOs, start-ups, corporations and public institutions only to find my passion for people development and technology. I decided to combine them first as a trainer and coach, and later as a talent acquisition, HR and start-up enthusiast.\n\nI am on a journey to create inspiring workplaces where people will thrive and grow while still having an excellent work-life balance. Alongside I empower people with the necessary skills, tips & tricks to be successful at their job search and able to build careers they always wanted. I am a fan of technology, innovation and various hacks, I do things differently...and that makes it a lot of fun!\n\nSome keywords:\nEmployer Branding | Recruitment Marketing | Candidate Experience | Strategic Sourcing | Tech Recruitment | HR Tech | Agile HR | Start-Up Recruitment | Career Coaching | Interview training\n\nIn my free time you can mostly find me playing music and practicing calisthenics. \n\nNow you know all about me! I would also like to know about you, so do not hesitate to connect here on LinkedIn or contact me at tomas.haviar@bitvavo.com.",
