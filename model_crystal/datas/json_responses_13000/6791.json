    "summary": "An LGBT rights advocate, blogger, public speaker, and a community-oriented social worker. \nAs an Egyptian expat now living in the Netherlands.\n\nMy advocacy career started in 2012. This prompted me to leave my home city of Ismailia, Egypt, where I was studying pharmacy, and move to Cairo, where I started working with a German political rights foundation. \n\nFrom there, I created a project called \u201cMargins for Studies in Social Change\u201d. The objective was to collect stories of marginalized LGBT individuals outside Cairo, including stories about social violence and healthcare access in local communities, and personal stories about the way LGBT individuals lead their lives.\n \nI believe in the power of social media to empower communities and bring about change. For example, in both 2013 and 2015, I launched a campaign on social networks against homophobia for International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (#IDAHOT), which generated thousands of tweets and posts. \n\n\nMy story and work have been covered in numerous international websites, publications, and TV programs in several different languages. I regularly speak at conference and other events about LGBT and human rights issues. \n",

Some people declared that they have a crush on a same-sex person, and a systematic violent attack was declared against these individuals.
