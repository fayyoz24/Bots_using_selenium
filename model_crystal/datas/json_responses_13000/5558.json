My approach was based on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, ensuring the app's usability and overall functionality. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a new framework that would be used across all BairesDev applications. I researched various approaches to creating the framework, ultimately leveraging Swift Package Manager to manage the distribution of Swift code. By automating the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies, I was able to streamline the development process and improve overall efficiency. Throughout these projects, I utilized various technologies, including Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, Jira, Bitbucket, iOS, Scrum, and Testing, with a focus on unit testing for quality assurance.",
