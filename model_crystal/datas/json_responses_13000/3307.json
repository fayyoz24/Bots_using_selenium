The team focused on diversification of funding sources and increased funding from instititutional donors while positioning Oxfam Novib in the global Oxfam confederation with new decentralised country offices. On the other hand, the Project Management section developed large scale thematic multi country projects, while the Quality Team focused on support and capacity building in project management. In this frame I developed a resource pack for financial project management. In the Oxfam Novib reorganisation of July 2015 the Institutional Funding section became a separate department while all projects and the quality team were mainstreamed in the new structure, integrating IFPM gained experience and expertise. From 14 million Euro in new contracts in institutional fundraising in 2009, Oxfam Novib now contracts a steady 70 million Euro per year!\nIn July 2015 we celebrated the achievements of IFPM with all staff, previous and present and a new start for us all!",
