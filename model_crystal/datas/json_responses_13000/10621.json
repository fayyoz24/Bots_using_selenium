    "summary": "I am a mathematician with a Ph. D. in hydrology.  My key expertises are flood risk assessment, flood risk management, statistics, probabilistic modelling and hydrological modelling. My countries of work experience are  Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tanzania, United States and Viet Nam.   \n\nIn the period 2020-2022 I was the only non-Australian member of the \"Independent International Panel of Experts for Flood Studies of Inland Rail in Queensland\", assigned by the Department of Transport and Main Roads  of the State of Queensland. Recently, I carried out a review for the province of Alberta, Canada, on proposed flood mitigating measures for the City of Calgary. Previously, I led a consortium for a multi-hazard risk analysis for the whole country of Afghanistan, for hazards like floods, droughts, avalanches, landslides and earthquakes. In 2010, I carried out a water resources assessment for South Sudan and advised the Government of South Sudan on this topic in the negotiations with Sudan in the process of forming the new independent country of South Sudan.",
