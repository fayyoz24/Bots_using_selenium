Specifically, I provided tailored market entry research service to British SMEs and as part of the package, I also, on behalf of the British companies, approached to the potential business partners in China, made initial introduction of the service, products and other collaboration proposal, etc, aiming to achieve business meetings, identify market initiatives and opportunities. Beside, I was also involved in organising in-market activities; seminars, business visits etc and managing British chamber of commerce finance forum member relation.\n\nThe 2.5 years was a fantastic experience, everyday working in the very frontline of cross-border business expansion. It was so exciting!  I had chance to talk with both the most innovative and adventurous British entrepreneurs and the conservatives ones, understanding what attracted them to explore China and what were they concerns. Being part of their explorative journey in China, I also learnt so much about my own country and people. For instance, how deeply the engineers in state-own-enterprise were concerned about sustainability and how open they were when it was about new energy and new technology that could help reduce pollution and improve life quality.",

Because I personally was fully connected to the mission of this programme, which was to share new ideas and inspire students in rural areas to learn more. \n\nDuring the one week programme, I achieved my two missions: 1) as a live case of a self Made person who was born and raised up in a rural area and eventually changed her life course; if I could so this, so could the other kids, and 2) was able to connect with one of the brightest kids out there and leave him a simple entertainment device in life, a melodica that I had bought it for the trip.  I wished it would help him overcome difficulties in life while breaking through the world he was born with and enjoy the beauty in life. \n\nRef: https://www.pwchk.com/en/corporate-responsibility/cr-report2011-summary.pdf"
