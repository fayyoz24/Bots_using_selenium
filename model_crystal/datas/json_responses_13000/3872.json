    "summary": "How will you define to make business success?\nWhat does challenge mean to you?\nHow about learning?\n\nTo me, business success is business compliance and sustainability. Being a KYC officer, I am the gate keeper of our bank to prevent it from being used by financial crimes, to ensure it satisfies with the regulatory and compliance requirements, and to help it to appear more trustworthy to potential new customer, to understand customer\u2019s profile, to serve the customer better and manage its risks prudently.\n\nKeeping self-challenge is never easy but it makes me become a better version of myself. After nine years of working as a contract and commercial manager in the telecommunication sector, I changed my career to banking industry and became a KYC officer. It was proved by fact that I had made a right decision.\n\nI believe in never stop learning. It is my way to explore and experience the world, spiritually and physically. So to me, learning is not just about courses, training and reading. It is also about to know and understand different people, to travel and discover a new city, and to take in different cultures. All those ways helped me to become who am I and to the \u201cMe\u201d I like.\n\nIf you are interested to have a talk to me, feel free to DM me via Linkdin or send me an email: J.WONG5518@gmail.com\ud83c\udf40",
