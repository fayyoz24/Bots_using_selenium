            "description": "One central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the factors that influence the tempo and mode of evolution. Tempo and mode are key concepts in the evolution of molecular systems and also in the pattern of morphological changes. The rate of evolution and mutational pathways have recently received much attention and these studies indicate that both are constraint at the molecular level.  \nIn the last decade, genomic studies identified protein expression levels as major determinants of the rate of protein evolution. This is illustrated in the universally present negative correlation between evolutionary rate of proteins (R) and their expression level (E). This means that highly expressed proteins typically have lower evolutionary rates than low expressed proteins. This relation is referred to as the E-R anticorrelation.  \nThis project focuses on the role of expression in the dynamics and repeatability of TEM-1 evolution towards Cefotaxime (CTX) resistance. The focal question of this thesis is if the  different expression levels show different favored mutations  \nTEM-1 was evolved towards CTX resistance with directed evolution. The mutations brought in by the error-prone PCR were used for the selection assay. The selection was performed with three arabinose concentrations and different CTX concentrations. The genotypes that were found in the different selection environments were used for the MIC and growth curve assays. Also, the MIC was performed with different concentrations of arabinose and CTX. Four mutations were detected and selected which were present in multiple selection environments. The selected mutations were 4 to 16 times more resistance to CTX than the WT strains. \nThere can be concluded that the different expression levels did not favour specific mutations. The mutations were found by different expression levels and CTX concentrations. All selected mutations had a higher resistance towards CTX.",

            "description": "Antimicrobials are since their discovery in 1928 used for treatments with infections. Right after the introduction of antimicrobials in the clinic resistant bacteria were detected. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are mainly treated with CIP. The problem is that the bacteria also become resistance for CIP which makes it harder to treat UTI. That is why it is important to discover new treatment combinations against resistance bacteria. Previous studies focused on the Crossresistance (CR) and Collateral-sensitivity (CS) networks in CIP resistant E. coli against different drugs. In these studies, the CS between CIP and GEN was shown. None of the studies focused on CR and CS networks in GEN resistant E. coli. This study focuses on the detection of the Collateral networks and mutations in GEN resistant E. coli strains, K56-2,-16,-75 and -78 and their double mutants. The questions were if there was also CS between GEN resistant and CIP and if there was reciprocality for the CIP resistance strains when made GEN resistant.  \n\nThe strains were made GEN resistance above the clinical breaking point (>4 \u00b5g/ml) in a stepwise static selection. The strains were confirmed to be E. coli with MALDI-tof and the resistance was confirmed with MIC strips. After the confirmation, the mutations were detected with WGS, Illumina, and the collateral networks were detected with IC90 assays. The used mutants were resistant above the clinical breaking point and confirmed to be E. coli species. IC90 assays showed CS to Chloramphenicol,CHL and Colistin,COL. CR was shown for Ceftazidime,CAZ. Surprisingly, there was no change in susceptibility towards CIP in the GEN mutants and still CR in the double mutants. Also, there was no change against Trimethoprim,TMP. The mutations causing GEN resistance were mostly changing the permeability of the cell membrane. \n\nConclusion there is no reciprocality toward CIP when the strains are made GEN resistance and that GEN resistance causes CS toward CHL and COL.",

The aim of this project is to develop and test the lab-on-a-chip technology for detecting  protein degradation for a begin of the protein quality assay. In this study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated with Ficoll-paque and the PBMC proteins were extracted with M-PER. After the extraction, the proteins were hydrolyzed with different concentrations a-chymotrypsin and different temperatures. Then the proteins were detected with the lab-on-a-chip technology protein chip.\nthe conclusion is that the lab-on-a-chip technology isn't the best technic to detect protein degradation",

First the bacterial strains were determinant by phenotyping tests, like gram staining, katalase reaction, hemolysis test, API test and antibiogram. After the strains were identified, the genotyping test were performed. From the strains, the chromosomal DNA was isolated by phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol. After isolation, the touchdown PCR was used to view the VNTR\u2019s using MLVA. Also, the Esp gen was amplified by a normal PCR. The conclusion was that the isolates were the E. feacium strains that casus the infections in the hospital and that some strains were resistant for vancomycin. ",

Jessica can be sensitive for warfarin, and when she gets a wrong amount of this medicine, she died. Another option was that her parents abused her or refused to give Jessica her medicine, and that she died of neglect. To investigate in with circumstances Jessica died, we isolate DNA of the collected cheek glue tissue for detecting if Jessica had an SNP on her CYP2C9 gene. The DNA was isolated In two different ways, the Organic isolation and the Chelex method. After isolation, the DNA was amplified by PCR. After the PCR, the RFLP was performed. The conclusion was that Jessica had not an SNP on her CYP2C9 gene, with means that she was not sensitive for Warfarin and that there was another option how she died.",

Bread is a wast product because a lot of people throw there bread away when is its a couple of days old or the crusts. In bread is a lot of glucose because of the strach. the aim of this project was to determine of bread is a good waste product for making biofuel. For making ethanol the starch in bread had to be hydrolyzed to glucose. The starch was hydrolyzed in 3 different ways. The first was by an enzymatic hydrolysis, using, \u03b1-Amylase, \u03b2-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase and Amyloglucosidase, in different enzyme combinations. The second way, was a chemical hydrolyze, using hydrochloric acid. The third way, was by combining the chemical and enzymatic hydrolyze. First the chemical hydrolyze was done and then the enzymatic hydrolyze. After the hydrolysis, the glucose was measured with Fehlings reagent, DNS-reagent and the GOPOD kit from Megazym. Because of the time limit there was no to make ethanol. The conclusion of this project was that a combination from chemical and enzymatic hydrolyze that there was more glucose than the other combinations.",
