    "summary": "As a cheerful kid, I learned about Humans, Kindness, and Nature during childhood in Albania. I also loved numbers. I was cool with numbers. \nAs a young international student in Electronic Engineering in Genoa, Italy, I loved learning about the importance of human relationships and caring, resilient communities.\nAs a McDonald's manager, I genuinely learned about leadership, team dynamics, and customers' needs. After my Bachelor's, I found myself in daily contact with staff, inventory, and sales data. I enjoyed it. Nevertheless, my numbers-loving brain didn't collaborate 100% during my Horeca experience. I realize I felt no magic about it. Something was missing. \nThe reason?\nThere had never been an underlying, greater PURPOSE in seeking my degree. The degree was the goal, an empty one. Also, my natural drive as a people person and a proactive thinker often lacked real, game-changing inspiration to make me thrive at work. \nWhat happened then?\nIn 2019, I took a sabbatical to help my wife and our two children settle in our current hometown, Amsterdam. I slowly dove into sustainability and acquired deep awareness regarding its challenges. I started to scratch the surface on the adaptation, mitigation, and regenerative strategies through online resources.\nUltimately, my Master's in Environment and Resource Management was the enlightening experience I needed:\nI enjoyed and found inspiration from the content.\nI felt great satisfaction from my projects & final thesis.\nI spoke to Data, and Data spoke back to me \ud83d\ude0a.\nI significantly improved my writing.\nI met incredible people with similar, profound sustainability aspirations. \nFrom being a kid in a small Albanian town to a grown, family man in Amsterdam, I connected the dots:\nThe complexity and interconnectedness of the problems we face globally require us to take a holistic, multidisciplinary approach. It also has to build around inclusiveness and diversity, and ultimately, it comes all to People. As collaborative stewards of communities, neighbors, and the planet, we People, will change the World. How great would it be if we started by being KIND & HONEST to each other and HOPEFUL about the future?\n\nBeyond any doubt, I know my WHY: I want to help businesses transform into sustainable enterprises through DATA & COLLABORATION: Let's persevere together towards the future! I am a (biased) dad to two amazing children, so WE NEED ACTION! NOW!\n\nP.S. I am skilled and would love to improve further:\n- GIS\n- Microsoft 365\n- Data Analytics\n- Communication skills\n- Teamwork & Client-focused\n- Project Management",
