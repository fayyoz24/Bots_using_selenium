    "summary": "Ever since I was young I took a strong interest in nature and the many life forms here on earth, which eventually led me down the path to pursue a scientific career in biology. I am a biology enthusiast with extensive background knowledge of micro and macro related biology subjects and disciplines. However, my specialization, which I pursued from an early stage during my studies, is the intestinal microbiota and its relation to the health of the host. More specifically, during my bachelor I studied the toxic effects of nanoparticles of plastic and silver on the intestinal microbiota composition and fitness in Daphnia magna. Furthermore, during my master research projects I studied the effects of the microbiota on the immune system and the central nervous system in the zebrafish model organism. My goal is to further specialize myself in these topics and build my career as a competent researcher.",
