    "summary": "I Start playing tennis when I was 5 years old.\nHave always been by the best of 3 in the tennis rankings in Holland so I have been traveling a lot around Europe and South America for playing tournaments. \nWhen I was 15 years old I became a proffesional tennis player and played Roland Garros, Wimbledon and US Open.\nUnfortunately due to an injury on my hip when I was 18 years old the dutch tennis association (KNLTB) stopt sponsering me financially and I had to stop playing professional, so I attended the sport school ( Cios) for 2 years. \nAfter I attended the sport school I went to America to play college tennis for the University of Mississippi(Ole Miss) having a full scholarship. I graduated when I was 25 years old with cum laude in Parks and Recreation Management. \nNowadays I am teaching tennis lessons to various levels in Belgium.\nPeople also can email me at somersilona@hotmail.com",
