Each week we provided sports opportunities to around 75 girls, all coming from different communities. In addition to running the sports program I assisted the organization with grant writing, social media, and research. Next to this, I organized an individual fundraising campaign, which included setting up and teaching an Arabic Language Course for beginners."
