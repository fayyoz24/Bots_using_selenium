My life took a new turn as I moved to The Netherlands & Italy for my Master's, and it has always been challenging yet never less exciting. I truly embrace the entrepreneurship mindset in all the jobs I do, because taking fast actions & trial will be the only way to know if it works.\n\nI wish to accomplish my deeper goals of bridging the relationship with consumers through purposeful & innovative products & services. In the end i'm also a consumer, and I love everything that's convenient, beautiful & long lasting. ",
