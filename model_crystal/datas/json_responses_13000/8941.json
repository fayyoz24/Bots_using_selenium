    "summary": "As a hydrogeologist intern at KWR Water Research Institute, I am applying my skills and knowledge in groundwater resources and global change to support the hydrogeology team in their research projects. I am close to finishing a master's degree in Groundwater and Global Change from three prestigious universities in Europe: IHE Delft, TU Dresden, and IST Lisbon. This program allowed me to gain a comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on the challenges and opportunities of sustainable water management in a changing world.\n\nI have a strong background in environmental engineering, with practical experience in environmental compliance, impact assessments, and waste management planning gained in Colombia. I also have a keen interest in research and innovation, as demonstrated by my participation in the Amgen Scholars Program at the University of Kyoto, where I conducted research on organic chemistry and completed an honors thesis on microplastic degradation in a simulated river environment in Colombia. I am eager to use my diverse range of skills and experiences to contribute to the advancement of environmental engineering and create a more sustainable future.",
