The TEM can yield information such as particle size, size distribution, and morphology of the nanoparticles.  I am developing a methodology to process and quantify the data with software for a  Particle Size Histogram analysis. A histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the frequency of occurrence versus the size range. Automation of this process would allow accurate and precise information extraction from the TEM, avoiding the procedure of manually counting the particles.\n\nWith this information, it is possible to evaluate how the particulates agglomerate within the oil mixture; and design a mechanism to prevent or minimize the effect and prolong the operational life of the engine.

The TEM can yield information such as particle size, size distribution, and morphology of the nanoparticles.  I am developing a methodology to process and quantify the data with software for a  Particle Size Histogram analysis. A histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the frequency of occurrence versus the size range. Automation of this process would allow accurate and precise information extraction from the TEM, avoiding the procedure of manually counting the particles.\n\nWith this information, it is possible to evaluate how the particulates agglomerate within the oil mixture; and design a mechanism to prevent or minimize the effect and prolong the operational life of the engine.",
