Using a supervised machine learning approach point clouds are firstly classified into one of three groups: building, ground, or unassigned. Ground points are further processed by a novel algorithm to extract a road network. The algorithm exploits the high variance of slope and height of the point data in the direction orthogonal to the road boundaries. Applying the proposed approach on a 40 million point dataset successfully extracted a complex road network with an F-measure of 76.9%.",

            "description": "Bridges are playing important roles on road networks to connect different daily services for Europe inhabitants. Yet, bridges are subjected to deterioration due to excessive usage, overloading, aging, and environmental impact, which cause reserve capacity, resilience, and the remaining service life. Thus, regular, rapid, and cost-effective assessment of bridges is critical during regular operation and after extreme events. Such assessment is also needed for planning critical maintenance and repair. In practice, general inspections are required for bridges bi-annually. With such interval times, damage may not be documented in a sufficiently timely manner to prevent catastrophic collapse. Moreover, the inspection method has many downsides: subjective results, expensive procedures, high safety risks for inspectors, requirements of experienced and trained inspectors, and traffic closures. To address these issues, by taking advantage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), the project will develop automatic, robust, efficient methods to process LiDAR data for condition rating.

The masonry buildings were interesting in this work.\n\nMore specifically:\nDevelop algorithms for automatically 3D building reconstruction from LiDAR data\nAssess building damage due to tunnelling/excavation-induced ground movement",
