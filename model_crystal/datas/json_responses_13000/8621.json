However, the intangible nature of many urban green space \u201cbenefits\u201d makes it difficult to place a \u201cvalue\u201d on the space in quantifiable terms.\nThe research looked at how two local authorities set about providing urban green space via two different approaches: i) a contemporary, spatial planning-related approach (green infrastructure, or GI); and ii) a more traditional (developer contributions-based) approach, in order to discover which mechanisms within each approach led to, or hindered, the provision of \u201cvaluable\u201d urban green space. A \u201cvalue typology\u201d was compiled, which defined the scope of the research and helped to distinguish between the \u201cbenefits\u201d that urban green space can offer (or the local authority planning objectives) and its resultant short-term and/or long-term \u201cvalue\u201d (or the local authority planning outcomes). An original research concept was devised, which was used as a tool for producing findings from data sourced from key documents and interviews with local authority actors and stakeholders in urban green space provision.",

She wants to start an ongoing conversation, and hopes that other HSPs will also share their own useful anecdotes, tips and resources.\n\nLMS\u2019 second goal is to show how high sensitivity, and the strengths which go along with it, can be used to improve everyone\u2019s lives \u2013 by encouraging a new brand of confidence, counteracting negative messages, and elevating the advantages of being (or seeming) \u2018different\u2019.\n\nIf you are not highly sensitive, you are still a sensitive person (hardly any human beings are unsensitive), but you probably don\u2019t experience things in the same way a highly sensitive person does. It is still worth finding out about the highly sensitive experience, as it may help you understand people who are important and/or close to you. And, this is the best bit\u2026\n\n\u2026 If you choose to, you can learn to access your own sensitivity strengths and/or borrow perspectives and approaches from HSPs. You can then use these to benefit yourself, and the people and communities around you. After a while, being more \u2018sensitized\u2019 becomes a way of life \u2013 and it makes for a good life, that\u2019s a promise.\n\nVisit https://littlemisssensitize.wordpress.com/ and see how...",
