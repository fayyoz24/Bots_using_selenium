With advantage of weight to strength ratio with carbon composites, there is a drawback of it being notoriously unpredictable during impact scenarios.\n\nThis project researches to understand the damage and how it propagates during an impact so that it can be tackled and controlled. This was done by comparing various stacking and production methods (especially the AP-PLY method) and testing the specimens. The key phase was analysing the test results and data including the use of the most suitable data smoothening methods to model and acquire different desired curves.",
