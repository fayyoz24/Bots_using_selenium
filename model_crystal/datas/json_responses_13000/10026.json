However, at the same time, youth in Europe is facing huge challenges to find a job right after graduation due to the challenging labour market and the lack of skills and working experience. For employers, a mobility experience is generally considered an asset as 64% believe international experience is important, but eventually, the obtained transversal skills and knowledge are the aspects that matter the most (92%). Why are the skills gained through a mobility experience not clear and why does this lack of recognition still exist?\n\nIn response to this, the Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is launching ErasmusJobs, an Erasmus+ KA2 project, to bridge the skills gap for the Erasmus Generation. The project is a collaborative cross-European partnership between ESN, Masaryk University, Leo-Net, Universidad de Alcala, European Institute for Industrial Leadership, Universit\u00e9 de Mons, European University Foundation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", and Expertise in Labour Mobility B.V.",
