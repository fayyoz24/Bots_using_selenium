    "summary": "Within the Semiconductor industry I develop the Chip Design Ecosystem in Brainport Eindhoven and the Netherlands. Prepare cluster for the European Chips Act and National initiatives.   Focusing on Lab-to-Fab and Tech-to-Market innovation programs and Human Capital and Venture Building capability.\n\nNext to this I also have 15 years\u2019 experience in supporting companies and individuals with their relocation to China. From individual entrepreneurs to multinationals. Focusing on operational excellence and service. Finding the balance between promote and protect. \n\nAfter graduating from business school with a specialization in Asian Business Studies, moving to China, the land of opportunities, to start my career was an obvious step to take. During my studies I followed an exchange program in Beijing at UIBE (\u5bf9\u5916\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d38\u6613\u5927\u5b66), and did a work-placement in Chengdu. Knowing the difference between first and second tier China first-hand gave me a clear preference for the latter; the \u2018real\u2019 China.\n\nChina has always interested me: its long history, its fast growth, the differences with my own culture and the personal way of doing business. It's the land of opportunities, but also a land with many pitfalls. As an organization and a person you have to always be ready to adapt to China\u2019s fast changing environment. Knowing your own business is not enough; you need to know the local differences, challenges and possibilities and translate your business plan accordingly. In these times you need to \u2018think global, but act local\u2019.\n\nDuring my studies and time living in China I have built up my knowledge of both international business theory and Chinese practice. I have experienced a broad education with an Asian perspective, studying subjects like Strategic Management, Organizational Theory, Marketing, Finance, Budgeting, Asian Management, Chinese and Statistics. \n\nThis skill set helps me to lead a varied range of projects and consult on many different aspects of doing business in China. Furthermore, during my studies and working experiences I developed analytical and planning skills, which help me evaluate situations over a short timeframe and come up with lasting solutions. I am well acquainted with working in international teams and with people from different professions to solve a problem. \n\nAfter living in China for over 7 years I have decided to move back to The Netherlands with my family. Utilizing my experience and expertise to function as a bridge between China and Europe.",
