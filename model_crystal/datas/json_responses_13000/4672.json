            "description": "For more complex sites and web applications, managing upgrades and revamps become increasingly difficult and expensive. When launching their new eCommerce website in Austria, Office Depot used, state of the art, hybris software to prepare for the future. \u201cCreating a sustainable business requires moving from a catalogue focused business to an omni-channel, eCommerce led approach. The pilot in Austria is a major milestone on this journey,\u201d said Jonathan Newman, VP eCommerce & Marketing Operations and Intl CIO at OD.\n\nFollowing significant online growth and increased demand from customers, in Jan 2015, the project team started the build of the new platform together with software partner SAP hybris and implementation partner Tacit Knowledge, a Newgistics Company. Austria is the first country in which customers have started using the new and improved site.\n\n\u201cThe integration of the hybris\u2019s omni-channel capabilities has enabled OD to dramatically accelerate its time to market,\u201d said Mark Holenstein, EVP Global Sales SAP Customer Engagement & Commerce. \u201cAnd driving an aggressive deployment timeline, OD, hybris and Tacit were able to help drive significant ROI.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the key values that we have within OD is that the customer is at the heart of what we do\u201d, says Newman. \u201cBesides creating a new site, based on the latest technology, we\u2019ve gathered customer input to deliver a website that answered to their specific needs.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, delivering an enterprise level solution will often attract complexity surrounding not only the technology and the business process transformation, but also the people. \u201cThe quality of our engagement from day one with OD and hybris, was something that together, we focused on to ensure the project was set up for success. Without doubt, this outstanding implementation is owed to the clearly defined partnership between our three organizations.\u201d says Trenton Brown, GM of Newgistics / Tacit Knowledge and COO.",
