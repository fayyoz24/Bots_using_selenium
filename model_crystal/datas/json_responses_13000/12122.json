    "summary": "Technical team leader with strong algorithmic skills and math background. Extensive experience in distributed storage internals and NoSQL & SQL computational engines. Ready to work on system architecture, technical project management, team management and technical recruitment processes. Formerly, a top-tier participant of programming competitions such as ACM ICPC, IOI, Google Code Jam and TopCoder. \n\nSince 2015 I work on YTsaurus, an open-source enterprise-level BigData solution, which is able to operate on clusters of tens of thousands of nodes storing exabytes of data. See more at https://ytsaurus.tech\n\nI am also interested in various theoretical computer science areas like combinatorial optimization, linear programming, data structures and algorithms. I had a couple of CS publications while doing my PhD research (unfinished).",

During this period I helped in hiring two engineers, which entered as intern and middle engineers respectively, and later both became senior software engineers under my mentorship.\n\nPrimary achievements:\n- Devised and implemented architecture of ClickHouse + YT integration with cloud-like model of separate per-project stateless ClickHouse compute clusters \n- Implemented YT-specific query engine for running distributed queries over YT tables\n- Set up user support in a community chat\n- Devised convenient Python API and CLI for working with ClickHouse within YT\n- Worked on integration of various BI tools (Tableau, DataLens BI) with YT using CHYT as a connector\n- Implemented efficient interop between ClickHouse columnar in-memory data representation and YT columnar format, and also interop between ClickHouse and YT type systems (including composite types)\n- Added support for sorted JOIN scheme to ClickHouse which utilizes YT-specific notion of table sort order\n- Written CHYT documentation (reference, architecture and user guide)\n\nMisc achievements:\n- Helped with migration of YT code base from separate GitHub repository to Yandex main monorepository, Arcadia\n- Became the YT release manager, working on release cycle which involves tens of testing and production YT clusters and tens of involved developers; reducing release cycle from 6 months to 3-4 months.",
