    "summary": "I am an economist, MBA, PhD (Thesis - Improving the competitiveness of SMEs in transition countries), an experienced professional in the field of SMEs, entrepreneurship, regional development and smart specialization, author, founder of UMF Training, a training and consulting company that helps organizations and individuals grow, improve their performance and reaching their full potential. Being involved in development work for more than 25 years, I\u2019ve been mainly focused on capacity building, organizational development and facilitating strategic processes. \nMy international career includes moderating conferences, providing consulting services and designing and delivering trainings and presentations, for private companies, public institutions and non-governmental organizations in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, BiH, Bulgaria, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Croatia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and USA.\nI do not consider enrolling the university when I was 16, which makes me the youngest student in my country, or delivering training workshops for over 10,000 people from around 20 countries, as my biggest professional achievements. I am especially proud of little things that don't usually make it onto a resume:\n1.\tInvesting all the money I earned from my own business at the age of 23 in post-graduation studies;\n2.\tNever losing faith, in spite of countless failures and mistakes (e.g. I passed the driver\u2019s license exam after the eleventh attempt);\n3.\tAfter finding myself in a fight between two thugs and feeling a cold fork on my neck, managing to reconcile them and make them continue their quarrel at the bar, each of them insisting to pay the bill\ud83d\ude0a;\n4.\tBeing disciplined and sticking to my diet for two weeks in a five-star hotel with the most delicious, exotic food\ud83d\ude0a\nAccording to Gallup's study on the State of the Global Workplace in 142 countries, only 13% of employees worldwide are engaged at work. In other words, only about one in eight workers are psychologically committed to their jobs and unhappy employees create unhappy organizations uncapable of using their potential fully.\nOther studies demonstrate that stakeholder engagement and effective communication are key factors in the success or failure of a project.\nThis is my \u201cwhy\u201d, my reasons why I have committed myself in both, organizational development through personal growth and improving development processes through effective with stakeholders\u2019 participation.\nWant to contact me for your group events or training sessions for your employees or partners?
