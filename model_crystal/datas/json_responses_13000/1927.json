    "summary": "As a pragmatic idealist, I'm excited about energising projects with a focus on systems change. Thinking about some of the most important problems in the world and supporting a movement of change makers is what I enjoy doing.\n\nTrained in Anthropology and design thinking, I'm a big picture thinker with a holistic, integrative approach to problem-solving. My mission is to combine impact-oriented work with an expanded care and sense of responsibility for the more-than-human world.\n\nMy background is shamelessly eclectic: \n- I\u2019ve managed projects using design thinking for local talent development; \n- Experimented with life-centred and decentralised economies and governance on the blockchain;\n- Worked in edtech to create engaging learning experiences. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m supporting the Effective Altruism community.",
