    "summary": "Tjeerd combines general (salt) geological and (solution) mining engineering knowledge and expertise with a solid expertise in project management. His career has been on the interface of geology/mining and project management. He supports the philosophy that complex subsurface projects, with many stakeholders and risks, may only be a success when (technically) managed by a project manager with a solid knowledge of the subsurface and uncertainties, risks and controversies this brings along.\n\nTjeerd studied geology in Utrecht at the Faculty of Earth Sciences (MSc degree 1999) and completed two post-graduate courses in business administration (2000-2002). In mid-2001 he started his professional geological career at the Dutch Directorate-General of Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) in Delft as project manager raw materials supply. In 2004 he switched to the consultancy firm MWH (formerly Syncera; now part of Stantec) in Zwolle and Arnhem as project manager for sustainable use of the subsurface. In 2009 he became Technical Leader for geology and subsurface and senior project manager. In the meantime, he has obtained several project management certificates (IPMA C / D). \n\nIn September 2012, Tjeerd joined the Mining Department of AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals (now Nouryon) as a Geologist / Project Manager. In addition to providing internal salt geological advice, he has led complex projects in the field of storage in salt caverns (gas oil, gases and compressed air) and well integrity. In August 2017, as Manager Mining Projects, Tjeerd became responsible for all mining projects in AkzoNobel's cavern fields in Denmark and the Netherlands. After the split off of AkzoNobel's Specialty Chemicals division in October 2018 to become Nouryon, and following an internal reorganization at the end of 2018, his job changed to Lead Expert Mining Projects in November 2019, providing geological and mining technology support in several cavern storage projects.\nIn July 2020 Tjeerd decided to leave Nouryon to continue his career elsewhere, focusing on storage of energy (compressed air and hydrogen) in salt caverns and in October of the same year Tjheerd started his own company Mole Underground, offering geological and mining technology project management and consultancy services. In this way he wants to contribute to the energy transition.\n\nSPECIALTIES\nSalt mining technology and salt geology\nUnderground energy storage\nGeological and mining technology project management\nDutch mining legislation\nWell integrity",
