    "summary": "As a corporate lawyer and PhD researcher, I am highly committed, goal-driven and passionate about transforming healthcare through new technologies.\n\nI received legal trainings in China (LL.B) and UK (LL.M). Currently, I am pursuing Ph.D. in the Netherlands. My research project focuses on 'legal and ethical issues of mobile health' (including data-driven healthcare, virtual care platform, medical chatbot and AI-enabled direct-to-consumer devices/apps). I am interested in topics associated with health data privacy, the right to health, social justice, autonomy and liability. I have published articles at peer-reviewed international journals.\n\nPrior to my PhD, I have had over six years of experience as an in-house counsel in life sciences industry. I advised internal clients from a full range of business units, and digital health and corporate compliance are my area of expertise. I also collaborated clients and colleagues from China, Germany, Singapore and Japan to accomplish different projects. I received several awards in recognition of my performance as a best business partner. I also gained admission to the PRC bar.\n\nI enjoy swimming, hiking, travelling, music and art. I am a nature lover and have so far explored 2/3 national parks in the Netherlands. Additionally, I used to be actively involved in volunteering for children, the elderly and visually impaired people.",
