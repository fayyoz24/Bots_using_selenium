    "summary": "With a wealth of experience in the field of cybersecurity, I have specialized knowledge in SIEM/SOC implementation and management. Throughout my career, I have successfully deployed and fine-tuned cutting- edge SIEM solutions, harnessing their power to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. My expertise extends to developing robust security architectures that encompass defense-in-depth strategies, secure network segmentation, and advanced access controls. I am well-versed in conducting thorough security assessments, identifying vulnerabilities, and recommending targeted remediation measures to enhance overall security posture. I possess extensive expertise in successfully transitioning XDR Cortex to ngSIEM. To achieve this, I have set up a dedicated broker VM to collect specific event IDs through Windows Event Collection. These events are classified based on official Windows EventIDs, ensuring accurate and targeted log collection.\n\nTo enhance the security posture, I have employed the DB Collector to monitor behavior connections and identify outliers. This allows for early detection of potential security incidents and prompt response.\n\nLeveraging the files and folders function, I have effectively controlled and managed access to sensitive data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nMoreover, I have integrated over 6-7 Threat Intelligence (TI) platforms into Cortex XDR, bolstering the platform with valuable IOCs and enabling efficient correlation in my archive. By incorporating IOCs, I can promptly detect and respond to emerging threats.\n\nFurthermore, I have honed my skills in creating BIOC (Behavioral Indicators of Compromise) rules for advanced correlations. These rules play a crucial role in identifying sophisticated attack patterns and malicious activities, contributing to the overall security posture.\n\nThrough my extensive experience and comprehensive skill set, I have successfully implemented ngSIEM while harnessing the full capabilities of XDR Cortex, bolstering the organization's security posture and incident response capabilities.",
