    "summary": "I am a PhD Candidate at Radboud University Medical Center. I study the design of visco-elastic biomaterials for use in a bone-on-a-chip, a device that uses human cells to mimic human bone so that we can do medical research on that artificial bone instead of on live animals or humans. \n\nI did my master\u2019s in chemistry, bio- & nano materials at Uppsala University. I chose this programme specifically because it is so interdisciplinary and because I am interested in applying physical chemistry methods to biochemistry, and in making a difference through biomedical research.\nI am particularly interested in working with biomaterials, biosensors, organoids, organs-on-a-chip, microfluidics, drug delivery systems, polymeric materials and other nanobiotechnology such as nanopores for DNA and protein sequencing.\n\nI have always sought to do a bit extra and to satisfy my curiosity. In high school I reached the national finals of the chemistry and biology olympiads, and I participated in a scientific programme for promising students at the local university.\nI wanted to study abroad in Scandinavia during the bachelor and rather than letting the language barrier be a problem I worked as an au pair for a year in Stockholm to learn Swedish and start my chemistry studies in Swedish the following year. During the master programme I tried to go on exchange to Kyoto University in Japan but this unfortunately got cancelled twice due to Covid travel restrictions.\n\nIn university I got involved in multiple student unions and associations and worked to help assure the quality of the education and the student's interests, as well as organize fun activities. I did many extra courses, the most notable of which is my participation in the student-driven summer research project for the international genetically engineered machine (iGEM) competition. I worked a paid summer project in the same lab that I did my bachelor thesis in and data from that is included in a research paper submitted to ChemCatChem & ChemBioChem pending review. From all these activities I learned organizational skills, confident public speaking and presentations, and collaboration in a large project. \n\nI have experience with many techniques through the previously mentioned projects as well as my bachelor thesis making and characterizing mutant catalytic enzymes and my master thesis making and characterizing tough ECM-based hydrogels. These include bacterial and yeast cell culture, protein purification, design and synthesis of hydrogels, rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, and tests of material properties.",
