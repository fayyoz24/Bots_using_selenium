ECN\u2019s expertise is research in wind energy, solar power, biomass, waste, energy efficiency, the environment and sustainable energy systems.\n\nThe EU Commission has set a target to increase the use of renewable energy to achieve 20% share by 2020. In The Netherlands, one of the most promising sources to reach this goal is wind energy, especially offshore. However, offshore wind farms (OWFs) tend to be more expensive than onshore ones due to the complexity of installation and the difficulty of accessing the offshore infrastructure in maintenance. O&M costs can contribute up to 30% of an OWF\u2019s cost of energy. To help the operator of an offshore wind farm to optimize its O&M strategies and reduce maintenance cost within defined targets of cost and availability.\n\nThe main objectives of the project are twofold. First, development of a support tool (mathematical model and software) to prioritize O&M activities and subsequently, implementation of the system in one of the existing wind farm in Netherlands. The first objective of the project is the objective of the master thesis. The tool needs to be able to process the inputs in the form of turbine alarm logs and SCADA data (Turbine Data acquisition system) and prioritize the O&M service orders or tasks considering various constraints, like weather, resources (spare parts and tools, technicians, equipment, vessels), cost, and time.",
