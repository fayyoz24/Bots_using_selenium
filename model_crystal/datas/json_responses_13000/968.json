    "summary": "I would describe myself as an ambitious student who constantly tries to gain as many experiences as possible and chases life-changing opportunities. That is why after completing my bachelor's studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and leave my family (my husband and my wonderful pet) in Greece and start my master's in Biomedical Sciences at Maastricht University. \n\nDuring my academic years, I gained a deep insight into a biomedical field that I truly love and I focused on researching cancer's pathogenicity and molecular pathways. My passion for research and creativity led me to participate in SRBW, a student-run biology workshop, as a conference speaker the first year and an organizer the second year. The challenges I faced concerning time and sources management not only taught me how to effectively handle stressful situations and be creative in coming up with solutions but also motivated me to express and stand for my ideas.       \n\nBesides gaining a lot of practical experience, I was given the opportunity to conduct two main internships at BRFAA, a biomedical research institute in Athens, and at Kofinas Fertility Group in Manhattan. These experiences were a milestone in my scientific and personal development as they broadened my horizons and motivated me to collaborate with international people and embrace different cultures.      \n\nNext to my bachelor studies, I worked at a cafe. Having a side job as a waitress did not only help me stand on my own feet from a young age but also allowed me to join the labor market early and learn how to effectively collaborate with colleagues and employers.     \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy having long conversations with friends along with a cup of coffee, reading books, and also writing literary texts and poems. I value a lot devoting quality time to my family and making memories with them.",
