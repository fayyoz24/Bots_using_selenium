            "description": "The buckling phenomenon is a mechanical instability characterized by a sudden lateral deflection of a structural part (e.g., rod or plate) of a thermoelastic body. As an applied load is increased, also the stresses inside the body increase. Eventually, they will become large enough to cause the current configuration to become unstable, and it will buckle. The present work studies the buckling of injection molded plates. In this context, the loading is represented by a decrease of the temperature of the plate, from the higher temperature after solidification of the melt to the lower one at ejection. The effect of the presence of short glass fibers in the melt is also investigated, with a particular focus on the influence of the fiber orientation in determining the buckling mode. The buckling threshold, i.e., the minimum decrease in temperature required for the disk to buckle, is computed via the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The amplitude of the warpage is determined using a perturbation scheme, in combination with a Legendre-Galerkin approach.",
