    "summary": "I'm a senior student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences(THUAS). \nI'm starting to look for positions in the financial industry. \nAs an international Business major student (Finance and Accounting Specialisation), I'm interested in problem-solving tasks using my numeracy-related skills and financial literacy. \n\nEvery company has different problems relevant to specific parts including finance, marketing, or operations. \nI've taken lots of courses in the finance and accounting field to learn related knowledge and skills. \nIn addition, I've also taken courses about other fields such as marketing, operations, and human resources which help me to have a broad approach from various aspects.  \nLastly, I could examine knowledge and skill successfully on a team project every semester.\n\nI'm passionate, open to learning, and an active person who is not afraid or refusing to learn something. \nIn addition, I want to take a position in the financial field where I can demonstrate my competence in problem-solving, leadership, and cooperation based on numeric and financial literacy skills. \nI took the team leader position 3 times out of 5 projects to raise my leadership and comprehensive skills.",

It was a meaningful experience that I could learn the field knowledge and practical skills from the financial controlling perspective. I can divide the learnings in the internship into several major sections as below. \n\n-Analytical skills from a financial perspective \n-Practical skills in MS Excel and SAP\n-Understanding of the financial statements including balance sheet and income statement\n-Report construction skills \n-International communication skills \n\nRegarding the mentioned skills above, the most effective skills were the analytical and practical skills. The analytical skills from a financial perspective were basic skills for finance-controlling group intern. Based on my understanding of financial statements, it was necessary to select meaningful information or indicators for effective reports. Since the reports target the internal stakeholders who set the direction of the entire business, preciseness and time management were the most important virtues for successful report construction.  \n\nThe practical skills were mainly used to form a report through MS Excel or extract the data from SAP. As an intern in the finance controlling group, I took charge of data management and monthly report construction. Therefore, I selected the necessary data from SAP and extract the data to build the foundation of the report.",
