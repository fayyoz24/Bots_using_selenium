    "summary": "In everything I do, I am passionate and curious about learning. Finding ways to bring learning across to people of various backgrounds is a challenge I enjoy very much - whether the setting is face-to-face, blended or fully online. By focusing on the learners\u2019 profiles, I engage with their interests and needs so that their learning is practical, meaningful and ultimately more motivating. It also makes it more inclusive, by zooming in on the examples, stories or methods that will connect with the learners\u2019 background and profile.\n\nMy work includes developing educational and outreach materials, coaching, facilitating (blended) training courses and writeshops, or writing stories or case studies of experiences. Common themes are sustainable agricultural development, environment, youth, gender, power & inclusion, and resilience in fragile contexts. \n\nI have degrees in International Development (BSc) and Ecological Agriculture (MSc), and a Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Studies in Education. My countries of work experience are the Netherlands, Canada, Afghanistan, Mozambique, Lesotho, South Africa, Benin, Mali, Kenya, Ghana and Australia.",
