    "summary": "I have recently obtained a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Environmental Sciences at University College Utrecht with a minor in Art History, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Biology (specialization Biodiversity and Sustainability) at Leiden University. I am passionate about conservation and evolutionary biology, herpetology being my main field of interest. I am particularly aware of the tremendous impact of the global snakebite crisis, from a herpetological as well as an anthropological point of view, and my aspiration is to acrtively contribute to human-snake conflict mitigation by combining zoological and sociological knowledge. Paleontology and art history are also disciplines I have explored with genuine curiosity. ",

My tasks included writing and recording scripts, interviewing guest speakers, promoting the project, and supervising the work of the 10-to-15 people board. The podcast episodes were published on a Wordpress blog and covered a wide variety of topics, from literature to science and news. The main goal of our project was to prove that our generation was up to the challenge of taking over the world and changing it for the better. This innovative approach earned us the opportunity to be guest speakers at EXPO 2015 in Milan, where we presented and promoted our work on June 8th, 2015. ",
