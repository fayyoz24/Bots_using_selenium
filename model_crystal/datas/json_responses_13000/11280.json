    "summary": "In 2002 I undertook an internship as a designer in \u201cSamoa Industrial\u201d a mechanical engineering company, working in the design and production departments.\nFollowing my internship, I was employed at \u201cGondan Shipyard\u201d in April 2003, during my 9 years on the technical and production department as a Naval designer, I have worked on a large number of projects and on different phases of them, from detailed engineering, block construction or outfitting among the others. I have been gradually taking more responsibilities, starting from 3D modelling, drafting structure and piping systems, to management of the structural drafting team and problem solving on-board. \nAfter these years in Spain, having had the opportunity to learn the advanced structures construction methodology used in the shipyard, I decided to continue my professional development in another country and sector; in April 2012, I started to work in a worldwide company \u201cGlobal Maritime consultancy\u201d, where I currently perform the role of senior offshore designer within the design team. \nBeing part of a company such a Global Maritime, focus in concept and basic designs make me aware of the challenges in the early stage of the design, my role encompasses all aspects of design and regulatory framework.\nNowadays, I am working in Oceanco (mega-yacht shipbuilding) in the Netherlands as a senior structural engineer and my responsibilities are coordination of the structural engineering package, supervision of the internal engineers and the subcontractors for each project.
