Also it provided comprehensive statistical information about all stages of processing. This helped the company to significantly reduce operational costs. With this system the company could successfully complete dozens of projects for major libraries and archives in the country, including the Presidential Library of Russia.\nAlso I developed internal information systems for The National Library of Russia, the Institute of Russian Literature (the project \u00abNational electronic Depository of the sound\u00bb).",
