    "summary": "Frank's motto is: \"everybody can grow trees and earn\", and in this end, he developed software to estimate production, cash-flow and environmental of farms and landscapes. With every new assignment, Frank expands his FarmTree\u00ae Model, and the team working with it with DIBcoop, that he is co-owning. The emerging Monitoring and Evaluation Protocol is used for a range of applications:\n1. Combine Plot Modelling with Geodata, assess the potential impact of Landscape Restoration Projects; and link their quantified performance to Sustainable Development Goals (ICRAF-Ethiopia, EUDel-Rwanda)\n2. Quantify the impact of Landscape Restoration by comparing baseline and with-project management scenarios for thousands of farms (ICRAF Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia)\n2. Based on farmers' testimonies and literature, create a model for Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, and show that it triples cow carrying capacity on sylvo-pastoral farms (World Vision, Kenya) \n3. Quantify investments and economic returns for irrigation facilities for smallholders' horticulture enterprises; often as part of adaptation projects (World Vision / SNV / Oxfam Kenya, Senegal, Mali, Niger)\n4. Quantify social and environmental costs and benefits for farm management scenarios: gender-segregated labour inputs, production per area or per labour input; shade, temperature, soil humidity over seasons, soil fertility over decades, carbon, etc.\n5. Provide project-level budgets and returns, such as in 2015 Projects d'Appui \u00e0 l'Agroforesterie Entrepreneuriale in three West-African countries; in 2014 the Katsina Fuel Wood Balance project of Oxfam\n6. Support writing National Agroforestry strategies (EUDel Bhutan)\n\nKeywords in Frank's experience include:\n*Agroforestry, Smallholders, Diversity, Sustainable Development Goals, Smart Water, Modelling, Financial analysis, Climate Adaptation and Mitigation, Entrepreneurship, Gender-in-development, Action Research, Documentation; linking theory and practice\n*Providing conditions for investments: Investment & Returns analysis, Cash Flow Planning, Economic Indicators, Risk Assessment; Design, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning in landscape restoration programmes",

This allows for adaptation to climate change and rural employment generation. In November alone we developed 20 business plans for in total some 25 ha of Agroforestry planning.",
