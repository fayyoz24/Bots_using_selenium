    "summary": "I am a young mechanical engineer focused on design and design processes. I enjoy using CAD and simulation software to brainstorm and visualize product design ideas. I have experience working at shops and so I also consider how a product will actually be built while I design. I think there is great opportunity for that mindset to make its way into the design processes of small businesses.\n\nI have spent time at small companies helping with hardware design and manufacturing and notice in many places a strong desire to execute awesome product designs but a lack of effective use of design tools. I want to help companies help themselves by automating the design process within small companies using the software and human expertise that they already have. \n\nUsing the tools that businesses already have, it is possible to speed up the tedious tasks involved in all design projects. The idea is to allow people to spend their time thinking about ",
