    "summary": "I am an impact-driven professional with 15 years\u2019 experience in business management, the property industry and financial services sector. My professional and educational experiences span Australia and Europe, meanwhile with volunteer involvement in the lesser developed nation of Solomon Islands. During recent years, I was the decision-maker for unique high net worth individuals and business clientele throughout the economic cycles triggered by COVID-19. This included crisis management and growth prospects for specialised client portfolios at Australia\u2019s largest Business Bank and best Private Bank.\n\nI value the power of relationship building, information sharing, and have experienced how this has prompted the delivery of successful collaborations and client outcomes contributing to economic growth and sustainability.\n\nI am eager to explore diverse opportunities where I can apply my extensive talents in a dynamic environment that aligns to my interests in banking and finance, strategy and innovation, and sustainability. I expect that this opportunity will nourish my continued intellectual curiosity, solution-based problem-solving skills harnessed from both critical thinking and lateral thinking approaches, and frequented visionary thinking for which I have an aptitude to translate into outcomes.",

Member needs can be varied and change quite dramatically. Therefore, it is important that the State Advisory Committee has an active and dynamic member listening capability to ensure relevant events are staged with local members.\n\nIn 2015, we will work with the CEO/Management to promote and deliver relevant events that resonate with our members. Our member events will have three (3) components - information about the AMI, professional development and member networking.",
