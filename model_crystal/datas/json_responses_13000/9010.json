    "summary": "I'm an experienced web and digital designer with a Masters degree in Design of Visual Communications who absolutely loves the tech industry.\n\nIn the past 15 years, my design work was primarily connected to the music industry where I co-created and developed one of Croatia's most popular rap bands, receiving widespread recognition, including 82 million views on YouTube, MTV Double Platinum Award, and numerous other critical accolades. In parallel to this, I collaborated with diverse clients across different industries, continuing to refine my skills and knowledge. \n\nThe software universe remains a realm of exploration and world creation, and I am committed to co-building this digital frontier that complements our physical reality. More than purely creative, I want to be useful. Designing and creating next-gen digital products is the space I see myself giving the most.\n\nSend me a nice msg! Let\u2019s mind melt and create something to be proud of!",

Months of research led to interviews with people around us on how they look at the finite time that they have.\n\nThe valuable insights we obtained from these interviews fueled the creation of Staire. Our intent was to address the daily lack of focus and help people in maintaining a long-term commitment. Despite the abundance of to-do list and habit tracking apps, we believed that there was a need for a dedicated space that focuses exclusively on your most significant goal \u2013 your life's work.\n\nI was a product owner, UX Researcher, UI designer, Web designer, and I worked with Mixpanel to track analytics. Basically a two-man startup shop.\n\nFind out more here: \nhttps://zonwrk.webflow.io/wrk/staire",

                    "description": "Designed album CD booklet and promo poster for music stores, for album \"DRAMA\" by Dje\u010daci. Released by DOP Records / Menart in 2008. \n\nAll illustrations in the booklet of the cover were extracted from child drawings of members of the band, taken from various school notebooks. As the band is called Dje\u010daci (The Boys), and it was their first album, it was a natural progression for us to put all their school daydreaming on the cover of the album. It was fun connecting drawings with the themes of individual songs.",
