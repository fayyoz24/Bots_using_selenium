    "summary": "When I worked on the shop floor, I remember thinking that there should be an easy button that would let me see all my data. Without paying an arm and a leg. Without a 4-year contract.\nRaven is that easy button. \n\nAs an operations leader, your team is looking to you to make decisions that will make them successful. So you\u2019re coming in early or working late to painstakingly collect and track the data you need to ensure your people meet production targets. \n\nRight now, you don\u2019t have the time to do major improvements in data collection and analytics. You know you need to do something, but you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to invest in a complete overhaul of your processes. You need a solution that can be deployed immediately and still give you the intel you know you need. Not something that will inevitably create more work for you and take away from time you don\u2019t have in the first place.\n\nRaven is battle-tested factory floor devices and easy-to-use software. You start by wiring the devices directly to any machine on the shop floor. Once the devices are in place, the team at Raven will work with you to get your dashboards setup. Dashboards that will give you accurate, easy to understand information about machine performance and factory efficiency. You will be able to account for every second of your machine time. You will also be able to see things like average product change over times and real time information on machine efficiency in real time.\n\nIn just one week, you can have a fully operational system up and running. Easy. \nYou deserve a comprehensive data solution that is also quick to implement, delivers accurate OEE (performance monitoring), and is easy to scale.\nI\u2019m here to help.\n \nOn the weekend, you\u2019ll find me out by Cedar Lake (which is practically in my backyard) with my wife and 6-year-old daughter. I\u2019ve played the guitar for 20 years - every night I play \u201cI\u2019ve Always Loved You\u201d for my daughter before bed.",
