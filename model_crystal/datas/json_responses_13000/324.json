Her written tasks are of an excellent standard. Keila has a strong work ethic and always demonstrates that she is committed to her studies; this is reflected in consistent achievement of higher grades in school exams.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Dalton, from the French Honours Department, \u201cKeila always strives to do her utmost best to improve her fluency in French. Keila has achieved an A1 in all of her assessments to date. This alone shows that Keila is a hard worker and is ready to take on any challenge in the future\u201d.\n\nThe Careers Guidance Counselor of Col\u00e1iste Lorc\u00e1in, Mr. Hutton, \u201chighly recommends Keila for any university course she would wish to pursue, as her friendly personality and politeness will help her adapt to college life, moreover, her intelligence, diligence and application to study will help her meet the rigours of Third Level Education\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Campbell, from the Department of History, \u201cKeila is currently in the top percentile of the History Honours Programme. I am impressed with Keila\u2019s authentic interest in history and her drive to self-educate. I can confirm that her work is of a high qualitative standard and her English writing skills are on a par with native speakers. Evidence of this is proven by the fact that her grades are consistently A1 (95-100%) across the board. Keila proves to be an invaluable asset to this institution\u201d.",
