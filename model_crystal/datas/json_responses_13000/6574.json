    "summary": "I'm currently a fourth-year student at BUAS in the Visual Arts department of the Game degree. I've been focusing my studies on 3D animation. I've worked with a full Motion Capture pipeline - from directing and capturing data to cleaning up and implementing animations in-game. I've been improving my keyframing abilities while also diving into the world of creating cinematics and cinematic animation. I've worked on multiple game and film projects so far, on which I've been developing and expanding not only on my professional skillset but also on communication, collaborative effort, problem-solving, and leadership. My goal is to someday create mesmerizing animations and cinematic pieces, which captivate audiences and evoke emotional responses.",
