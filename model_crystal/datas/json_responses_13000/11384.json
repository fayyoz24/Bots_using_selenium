    "summary": "As an artist I'm interested in the vulnerability of the human condition. I draw from life's experience. My drawings scan the boundaries between our interior and exterior. I study our inner world in which we grapple with our mortality and all the invisible stuff that has determined us. I see the body as a witness, a carrier of our experiences. It's the mold in which we've been casted. \n\nIn 2018-2019 I made my debut as an artist with the soloshow 'Quarantaine' in Stedelijk Museum Breda. I was also responsible for the editing and graphic design of this exhibition.\n\nAs a graphic designer my love and expertise lies in editorial and book design. In the recent years I've mainly designed books. \n\nFor me a design project starts with dialogue; to understand the subject and to get an idea of what the author wants to convey. The subject can be manifold as long as it's rich and interesting enough to unravel its potential and possibilities and express them in a visual narrative. \n\nContent is leading and since I believe that graphic design is not purely a matter of translation there is always something added in the process. Graphic design, and book design in particular, is a language, a language that rubs off on the content it expresses. A language consisting of paper, volume, format, binding, lay out, pictures, typography, ink, system, storytelling and last, but not least: editing. \n\nInteresting book design is not only about creating a good looking carrier for words and pictures, it also defines a context for them \u2014 a playground that invites people to relate to them. In some cases, like that of the photo book, the carrier itself can actually become the work of art. This is when design can no longer be separated from the content. Those projects are the ones I love the most. And to work on them I usually get involved at an early stage and become part of the editorial team.  \n\nAs an independent designer I work and have worked with: Premsela, Dutch Platform for Design and Fashion (responsible for their visual communication between 2006-2012), SKOR (Foundation Art and Public Space), Museum Jan Cunen, Stedelijk Museum Breda, NAi, BNA, Hans van Heeswijk architecten, PostNL (stamps Dutch Olympic sports) Ahrend, PlantLab, The Beach, Kesselskramer, BIS Publishers, Frame Publishers, Uitgeverij Meulenhoff, Veenman Publishers, Post Editions, Fw:Books, Joep Luycx, Satyendra Pakhal\u00e9, Maartje Korstanje, Ringel Goslinga, Willem Popelier, Raimond Wouda and Henk Wildschut.",

Uncompromisingly, he investigates the intimate inner world of two people in their mid-forties. During this period, his girlfriend undergoes medical treatment, which has a dramatic impact on their lives. Uleman dissects this experience in a series of intense studies and drawings.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s title refers to the two lovers\u2019 temporary isolation: together and alone at the same time. Many of the portraits depict bathing and sleeping scenes: daily recurring activities that are connected with birth and death. His studious, serial working method and technical skill are a way of scanning and exploring emotions and thoughts. This results in a series of drawings, watercolours and paintings of varying sizes, in colour and black and white. Some are gentle and fragile, whereas others are clinical and wrought. The physical and human presence form a common thread.",
