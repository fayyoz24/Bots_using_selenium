    "summary": "Konrad is assistant professor at the Law and Tech Lab of Maastricht University. Previously, he was a doctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford and an associate researcher at the Open Data Institute. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from RWTH Aachen University (Distinction) and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Oxford (Distinction).\n\nKonrad\u2019s main research interests are building more sustainable digital ecosystems and using computer science techniques to answer questions relating to (technology) law. As part of this, he\u2019s been empirically measuring the effect of data protection and privacy laws on the actual data practices of smartphone apps. The aim of this is to characterise data and platform power in the app economy and to build regulatory technologies that help law scale across millions of websites and apps. He\u2019s also been trying to build new, autonomy\u2013enhancing technologies and translate legal requirements into technical practice.\n\nHis work has been published in leading academic venues, like PETS, FAccT, SOUPS, and the Internet Policy Review. His research has been covered by Forbes, Wired, Vox, Der Standard, La Stampa, Le Temps, TechCrunch, and other international media. He\u2019s been selected for the award of the Future of Privacy Forum for the Best Student Privacy Paper for Policymakers 2022, given annually to one paper worldwide. He has also been selected as a member of the expert advisory bodies of the EU\u2019s European Data Protection Board and the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), two leading European data protection and privacy authorities. He has previously been interviewed by the German and UK competition authorities on concentration in digital markets. Konrad led the winning team in the United Nations Privacy Competition 2022, ahead of 195 other teams worldwide.\n\nKonrad is the creator of TrackerControl, which is an Android privacy app with 100,000+ downloads. The app exposes hidden data flows from apps to companies. It is available in 21 languages thanks to the help of the TrackerControl community. Konrad also helped found a LegalTech startup that is funded by the Alchemist Accelerator (2\u20133% acceptance rate).",
