I feel a duality of creative and practical skills, usually bridging the gap between the two. As a creative, I can truly think outside of the box. As a logistical mind, I can adapt projects to fit within the box. Always loving a challenge, I embrace managing projects and its complexities and create collaborative experiences. Seasoned with high-pressure and challenging environments I have a proven track record of producing quality work with turnaround in the coverage of noteworthy events. I\u2019m a creative visionary.",
