    "summary": "During my career I have worked with people from over 60 different countries, in France, the Netherlands and the UK; I have also trained and mentored new staff. I have worked in multiple industries as a freelancer, including translation (for major companies, such as Orange and Linklaters, as well as individual clients) and journalism (e.g. The London Magazine, Connexion France, TES, Metropolitan), including across time zones. These transferable skills from different sectors are valuable in my chosen career of teaching, enhancing my people skills and organisational abilities, and enabling me to show students how English language applies to the real world.\n\nHaving taught since 2008, I qualified as a secondary English teacher via an assessment-only route, obtaining qualified teacher status (QTS) in July 2014, before completing my NQT period in December 2020; this enabled me to become fully DUO-accredited in the Netherlands in February 2021. I am a dual national (British-French), further opening doors to EU-wide work. I have undergone yearly CPD across Europe since 2009, and implemented and taught IGCSE, MYP and IBDP programmes, as well as serving as Head of Y11 (2009-2017) and Y10-Y11 PSHE coordinator (2022-2023).\n\nI have examined for CIE, OCR, the IBO, and Edexcel, and have produced bespoke educational materials for MarkMyPapers and Kognity, as well as writing a textbook - The A-Z of TOK - published by Elemi Education in October 2021.\n\nFurther, I have taught Anglophone students in Y6-9, and sixth-form American literature classes. I also have TA, cover teacher and learning support experience, as well as running a variety of extra-curricular activities. I regularly write and peer review for academic journals (e.g. The Use of English, English in Education) and have presented at conferences, such as those run by the English Language Schools Association. \n\nAs a private tutor, I have supported a range of pupils, from postgraduate applied linguistics students to Classical Civilisation AS Level and GCSE English Language and Literature students, as well as ESL primary school pupils (who have succeeded in various official examinations, including those run by Pearson and the British Council). \n\nI am particularly interested in formative assessment, developing students\u2019 methodological and critical thinking skills, and supporting the gifted and talented.\n\nOver the next 5-10 years I will continue to seek international education opportunities in Europe, ideally in a head of department role and/or as a gifted and talented coordinator.",
