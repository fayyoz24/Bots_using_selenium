    "summary": "My relocation advice and Dutch language training programmes make it easier for internationals and expat employees to feel at home in the Netherlands and to understand the locals. To discuss your personal/company needs, please contact me by phone: +31 (0)6 497 68 628 or email: monique@amstelexpats.nl\n\nAs Relocation Specialist, I support internationals completing their relocation tasks, such as: registration, BSN, find a home, organise utilities, school search and open a bank account. I help them settle-in smoothly by making a personal relocation assessment, solving specific issues and recommending local service providers. \n\nAs Dutch Language Trainer, my goal is to help internationals getting to grips with the Dutch language without any stress and anxiety. Having lots of relocation expertise and local knowledge ensures that lessons are both fun and informative. Teaching adults in small groups creates an open atmosphere and encourages interaction amongst participants. I specially developed the Boost Your Dutch course to accelerate learning Dutch as a second language.\n\nI offer the following Dutch language activities:\n\uf02d\tBoost Your Dutch short courses (complete overview of Dutch basics in 3 x 2\u00bd hours)\n\uf02d\tWeekly Dutch classes (15 lessons at beginner\u2019s & intermediate levels)\n\uf02d\tLocal Coffee Mornings to practice your Dutch in an informal setting\n\nOver the years, I gained many insights into the communication and adjustment problems of internationals. In my view, Expat Wellbeing is one of the key elements to ensure that internationals remain for their intended stay. Since 2017 I am involved in developing the Expat Wellbeing Indicator, which is an online tool for local authorities to determine their level of attractiveness for international residents. A free demo is available for interested parties, such as local authorities and Expat Centers.\n\nPlease contact me with your queries.\nPhone: +31 (0)6 497 68 628\nEmail: monique@amstelexpats.nl\nor visit the website: www.amstelexpats.nl",
