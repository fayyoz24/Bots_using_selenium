    "summary": "To describe myself I thought it to be best to let others speak up. \nPeople I worked with described me as inspirational, an important role model and generous among many other things. Colleagues have thanked me for my talent in coordination in the broadest sense of the word and my integrity. My friends admire my passion and dedication when I start something.\n\nAs I am gratefully reflecting on these comments and what I would mostly like to do I must say I see myself working on policy in the government or NGOs. I believe my study background together with my passion for people of all walks of life will makes me a good candidate for an environment whose constant focus on people.\n\nShould you think I would be a great asset then by all means send me a message! Who knows what come from it...",
