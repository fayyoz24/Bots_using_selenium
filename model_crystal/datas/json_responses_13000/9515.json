    "summary": "Cornelis Eldering (Niels) is Head of Office within the Commercialisation Department at the European Space Agency. Together with his team, from 2003 until today, he built the largest space entrepreneurial network in the world, i.e. ESA's Business Incubation Centres (ESA BICs) Network. Today, he leads the office responsible for the ESA BIC network, the ESA \u03a6Lab Network, and ESA's Partnership Initiative for Commercialisation (EPIC).\n\nESA currently has 25 Business Incubation Centers (ESA BICs) and 8 Technology Brokers across its member states. The primary aim of the ESA BICs is to provide support to entrepreneurs who wish to exploit space-based solutions. Similarly, ESA 's Technology Brokers support established industrial players in both space and non-space markets. The approach has been adopted for similar technology transfer and incubation activities by e.g. STFC, CERN, Fraunhofer, Czech Invest. New to the office's activities is the \u03a6LabNet, a network of deep tech research centres aiming to use space as a vector for disruptive innovations that lead the way for Europe's endeavour in New Space commercialisation. \n\nNiels holds a MSc(BA) from the Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), where he in 2003 completed his research on setting up a strategy for the first ESA Business Incubation Centre. Since then, he was instrumental in evolving and expanding the ESA BICs and Broker network to its current size. Up until his appointment as section head, Niels has chaired over 200 evaluation boards for ESA BIC start-up company selection and evaluated over 3.000 business cases. Passionately, he provides keynote presentations on conferences as well as guest lectures such as to the CEMS Master in International Management. \n\nIn 2015 he received the RSM Distinguished Alumni Award for Senior Leader due to his efforts in creating benefits for society by engaging business and education with space technology. Besides his career at ESA, Niels is currently a PhD candidate (part-time) at the RSM department for Technology and Operations Management and recently published a chapter in an international handbook of research on Business and Technology Incubation and Acceleration. Moreover, together with RSM, the University of St. Gallen and the NOVA Business School, he initiated the Space for Business Executive Education course which brings together business professionals, policymakers, entrepreneurs and investors to learn about new business models and best practices for for the New Space economy.",
