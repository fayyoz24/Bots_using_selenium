    "summary": "As the world\u2019s first industrial designer with a PhD in Circular Product Design (Delft University of Technology, 2018), I work as an independent researcher and design consultant to industry in circular product design and business models for the circular economy.\nI\u2019m also a licensed trainer for the Innomat LCA and EVC course, a European program for teaching fast-track Life Cycle Assessment and Eco-Cost Value Ratio based design interventions (https://eitrawmaterials.eu/course/innomat/).\n\nA FREE full-text PDF of my doctoral dissertation \"Design for Managing Obsolescence - A design methodology for preserving product integrity in a circular economy\" can be downloaded at: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3f2b2c52-7774-4384-a2fd-7201688237af?collection=research. (A printed book can be bought from (online) bookstores in NL and B and - for international buyers - from Amazon.de).\n\nMy academic work is anchored in thirty years of hands-on experience in commercial industrial design for (inter)nationally renowned design studios and clients, designing fast moving consumer goods, such as (food)packaging, durable consumer goods, such as electronics, (office)furniture, and professional products, such as retail in- and exteriors, museum showcases, means of transport, industrial equipment and logistic systems.\n\nI am co-author of the book \"Products That Last \u2013 Product design for circular business models\", that is currently being used in Circular Product Design courses around the world (e.g., Delft University of Technology, MIT Design India, University of Austin, Texas, Raffles Design School, Singapore) and that is at the heart of the Dutch government\u2019s CIRCO program for promoting Circular Product Design to companies in the Netherlands.\n\nTo disseminate the results of my research and teach my circular design methodology, I do company workshops, guest lectures at design and business schools and publish and present my research in scientific journals and at international conferences.",
