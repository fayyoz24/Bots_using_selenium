During breaks and free-time, I emphasized art and drawing as a means of expression for the students, holding mini-art workshops daily.\n\nInca Wasi is a non-profit after-school program based in Cajamarca, Peru that was created with the goal of keeping local children in school and eventually getting them through university. The students that attend Inca Wasi are among the most disadvantaged financially and domestically. Please read more about the organization at www.IncaWasi.org.pe! "
