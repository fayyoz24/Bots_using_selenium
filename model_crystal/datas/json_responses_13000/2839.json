    "summary": "I love GIS and all the things it can do!\n\nI first came in contact with GIS while doing archaeological fieldwork and was immediately hooked. In 2009 and 2010 I did GIS work for several archaeological campaigns where I learned the basics of mapping, data management and collecting data in the field. This spurred me on to get some proper qualifications and I graduated with my MSc in GIS from Edinburgh University in 2012. \n\nWhile working for the Forestry Commission I learned what a bespoke GIS system can do for a big organisation and what it entails to manage and progress a massive software project. Here I was part of a GIS team who together had more than 80 years of GIS experience! From the FC I moved on to a small charity, again a major change of scenery where GIS played a very different but equally important role. I was the only GIS professional within CSGNT which means I managed and performed all GIS-related tasks. In the last few years I have therefore been able to develop the technical skills that I was taught in my MSc and I used ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, PostGIS, FME and Geoserver on a daily basis. \n\nIn 2016 this experience meant that I was able to move back to my home country, the Netherlands, where I started working at Esri Nederland in the position of Content Engineer. Here I continued to develop my technical and data-related skills. Within the team I mainly focused on spatial analysis, the maintenance of our content within our ArcGIS Online portal and sharing knowledge through blogs and presentations.\n\nCurrently I work at BeoBOM, who have offered me a joined position, combining my degrees in history and GIS. Here I perform historical research for possible sites of WWII explosives and I analyse field data using GIS. \n\nThe thing that my experience so far has taught me is also the thing I love most about working with GIS: it can be used in so many different fields for so many different things in so many different ways. I am up for any challenge presented to me and am very much looking forward to them!",
