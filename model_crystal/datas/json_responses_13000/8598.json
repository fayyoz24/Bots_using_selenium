    "summary": "As a second-generation migrant, ever since I was little kid, research and analytics have been my passion. Particularly, because I learned at a young age that education was a privilege. This passion carried me through my education at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (NL), Dong Hua University (CN), Momoyama Gakuin University (JP), and Northumbria University (UK).  During my education there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied business intelligence, new languages, strategy management, and stakeholder management, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. Also, it was during that time that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.\n\nSo, now, working at Biztory this passion remains with me.  This passion for all things data, love for solving problems, and intellectual curiosity is what I am utilizing every day at my job.  With Tableau I am also able to fully exploit my creative and analytical mind. \n\nSpecialties: Tableau, data visualization, data analytics, cross-cultural communication, and presentations. Also, fluent in Dutch, English, and German.\n\nEducation: MSc. Business with International Management (Cum Laude).\n",
