    "summary": "Experienced software developer with a love for building great applications and solving complex problems in a variety of domains. Always trying to find ways to express my creativity and learning new things. \n\nDriven by a strong curiosity and eagerness to learn I started to self-study computer programming when I was 12 years old. Over the years I\u2019ve harnessed strong autodidactic skills which allowed me to land a job as a full-stack developer right after finishing high school. \n\nI\u2019ve been honing my skills ever since through work experience, reading, experimenting, and courses. \nCheck out my Goodreads profile at https://goodreads.com/melvinkoopmans for an overview of the books that I've read.",

All cases submitted will be assessed by an independent jury of heavyweights from the digital world. They determine the nominees based on the concept, design and UX, result, and optimization.\n\nWe won the Dutch Interactive Award 2021 for the category \"Communities\" with our online community for the Dutch soccer association KNVB. The platform \"E\u00e9n Tweetje\" bridges the gap between club directors to stimulate knowledge exchange.\n\nMy role in this project was the entire development of this platform, based on our community software \"Yunits\", of which I am the lead developer.

The NRZ's goal was to ensure that everyone could safely enjoy the water without the risk of drowning. To this end, they wanted us to build an application that would help them take and evaluate exams related to swimming safety.\n\nIn my role, I was responsible for a number of critical tasks that ensured the project's success. I designed the application's architecture, helping to establish the technical framework that would enable us to achieve our objectives. I also helped the development team operate at their highest potential, mentoring other developers and ensuring that everyone was equipped to perform at their best.\n\nCode quality was a top priority for me, and I established coding standards and performed regular code reviews to ensure that we were producing the highest-quality code possible. We also used automated testing tools to catch errors before they could cause any issues.\n\nFinally, I served as a key liaison between the development team and stakeholders, communicating project updates and addressing any concerns that arose.",
