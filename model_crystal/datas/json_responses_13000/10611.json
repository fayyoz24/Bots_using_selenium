    "summary": "At eLEAF we provide satellite based data services to increase agricultural performance while aiming to reduce the associated water use. As Business Development Manager I am in contact with both funding organisations as well as potential customers of our services. I am responsible for contract negotiations and client management, and I am involved in our operational projects as project manager, or as support for all eLEAF project managers whenever issues arise. I like the translation of high-tech data solutions to tailor-made applications that optimize the daily operations of the end-user, whether they are public water authorities, agri-businesses or small holder farmers. \n\nBesides my role as Business Development Manager, I am part of eLEAF's Management Team, and work closely with the MD on business strategy and internal organisation. \n\nI like working in an international setting. Before joining eLEAF in 2012, I have worked and lived in East-Timor, Indonesia, Sudan, Yemen, Jordan and Argentina on projects in the field of integrated rural development, water supply and sanitation, water management and irrigation.",

The project was a broad Rural Development demonstration project of the Government of Timor-Leste implemented by United Nations Dept of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) to strengthen community management of water and renewable energy services in three rural sub-districts. Achievements include:  \n\n\u2022\t20 Water User Groups were formed and trained during the pilot phase and now the adapted participatory process forms the basis for a new national WUG policy.\n\n\u2022\tFacilitated a participatory planning process for the planning, design and construction of drinking water supply systems in 4 rural communities. 4 new systems were built and another 7 rehabilitated.\n\n\u2022\tDeveloped training on hygiene practices and subsequently piloted the material by training more than 145 teachers and village leaders in over 15 villages.\n\n\u2022\tDeveloped a training method to build the capacity of local village councils in developing strategic development plans for their community. The method included participatory problem tree analysis, prioritization, the writing of a feasible work plan and the independent realisation of the plans by the community.\n\n\u2022\tActively monitored the programme progress of our partner NGOs  responsible for direct field implementation and coordinated the project implementation with national, regional and local government, partner NGO\u2019s, other development organisations and recipient communities.",
