    "summary": "Hallo\nYou can find my work at f.i.Saatchi, Singulart, Artfinder and Artmajeur. And of course on my website www.geertlemmers.com.\n\nBorn in the Netherlands, Geert Lemmers studied photography and photographic Art and worked as a freelancer for magazines and fashion artists before focusing on his artistic career in 2008, winning the same year the professional art-prize in his region.\nMy ideas and statements about ART: \nI think that art gives us back to ourselves in a renewed state. \nBy paying attention to art for a moment, we tap into a source within ourselves and we gain access to the imagination. \nArt offers us new perspectives, makes us think and activates our senses. Art gives us value so that we feel we can be different from what we tend to think. \nShe teaches us how we can free ourselves from our regular pattern, rise above ourselves and open ourselves to other people, to the world. \n\n\u00ab Composing artworks for me almost is a philosophic question in transferring my thoughts into metaphorical representations. \u00bb \nGeert Lemmers is a prizewinning artist from the Netherlands whose works have been featured in shows internationally. Working across painting, photography and new media, Lemmers is inspired by philosophical questions and creates digitally altered images and abstract paintings that reveal hidden worlds. His work is characterized by enlarged characters in chaos, beauty, and imperfection.",

Hierbij kan de directe woon- en sociale omgeving vaak heel belangrijk zijn. Mijn succesvolle stadsbeelden van bijvoorbeeld Nijmegen, Amsterdam en Brussel zijn daar voorbeelden van. Hierin zien we hoe de mens zijn invloed aanwendt om zijn of haar directe omgeving te [her]inrichten en daar veel geld en ook inspanning voor over heeft, maar ook zien we kenmerken van een  gedroomde, niet-realistische inrichting van deze omgeving.",

Often his artwork is about ethnical minorities in the Netherlands and the challenges they struggle with day by day. Although in recent decades, the number of regulation worldwide that prevent cultural injustices to happen is increasing, sometimes in unfortunate ways people from different cultures and religions from the predominant one still face multiple forms of discrimination. The artist thus, throughout the use of bold contrast among colors and sharp traits, which resemble scars and past traumas tries to appeal appeal the sensibility of the viewer making them feeling a connection with the subject and rising an emotional reaction to this universal issue.",
