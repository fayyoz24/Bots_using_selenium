    "summary": "When I was a child, I sensed that something was not right in our world but I couldn't understand what it was. After I experienced and learned about its human-made systems and policies, I realized that our world is unjust and unfair for any human who is or might become vulnerable. Our world needs immediate change, collective response by the people for the people to make the world more humane for its newcomers. That's why I am keen to work with communities, organizations, and policymakers who are committed to basic human values and want to create a better world for everyone. I am offering my expertise in problem- solving questions related to social issues such as integration, migration, refugees, diversity, democracy, inclusion, and social cohesion.",
