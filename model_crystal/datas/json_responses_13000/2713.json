Since 1947, this nonprofit study abroad and intercultural exchange organization has been bringing the world together, advancing peace by building bridges of mutual understanding between different people, different countries, and different cultures.  \n\nLaunching a new high school program in Amsterdam, this course provides an overview of the United Nations and major EU institutions (European Commission, European Parliament, European Council). Students explore the way they work and collaborate to address concerns and interests of EU citizens and beyond.  Students also examine the role of the Netherlands national government. Through course work, case analysis and role-playing activities, participants expand their knowledge on the branches of world government and research governmental responses to current sociopolitical or environmental issues (e.g. Climate change). Along the way, students assess how their lives and our global society are impacted by world government.",
