There is growing recognition that although responding to disasters and crisis is necessary, it is far more cost-effective to build resilience and anticipate and avoid the buildup of risk than to correct or to respond to its effects. Reducing disaster risks and building urban resilience therefore is fundamental to reducing disaster losses.\nResilient Cities Connect (RCC) serves to bring together the different contributors to resilience in one marketplace. In this marketplace local authorities, providers of solutions (products, knowledge and services) and development partners who provide access to funding, meet and connect with each other, discuss and share information to discover ideas, and to find solutions and partners (EXPLORE, LEARN, CONNECT and IMPLEMENT).\nWorked with UNISDR, Dutch Government and Japan Bosai Platform to set up and to launch RCC (May 2016)",
