The main objective of this project is to reflect on controversial energy technologies and develop a methodology which will enrich the overall assessment of decision making by adding public values, concerns and knowledge. \n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research explored the evolution of the controversial debate on nuclear energy on Facebook between 2011-2016 in France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Turkey.  Harvesting data via digital techniques from social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, is an efficient way to detect, analyse, and visualise these controversies.\n\nThe network analysis revealed that the majority of the debate on Facebook is carried out by NGOs and bottom-up community pages, while traditional media, governments and political institutions prefer to use websites. Furthermore, the connections between Facebook pages and between those and the World Wide Web were explored. This showed a rather high degree of regionalisation of the debate, where communities tend to connect to web sites and pages from the same country or area. To conclude, the evolution of the network over six years (2011 - 2016) revealed a rather static picture, with however increasing connections between countries and continents. \n\nThe content analysis, on the other hand, allowed for a more specific insight into the topics of interest of different communities, revealing a rather high diversity between the pro and con pages studied: the former discussing about the potential for energy generation and production technologies; while the latter focusing on costs, climate impacts and nuclear disasters. Differences were also found between countries, type of page and level of user engagement.\n",
