The understanding of the processes after abandonment will become therefore increasingly important for the conservation and restoration that might be necessary after abandonment. The recovery of the degraded fields in the Sneeuberg region, Karoo, South Africa, after abandonment is limited. The hypothesis was that this limited recovery is caused by the lack of precipitation and by a lack of soil nutrients available for plants. The objective of this study was to discover what currently limits the natural recovery of those fields. To reach this objective, two different types of fields were studied and compared with grazing lawns. The history and management of the fields were studied, as well as the soil and vegetation. Soil samples were taken and analysed on soil texture, nutrients, organic matter content and pH. Furthermore, infiltration tests were done. The vegetation was studied and analysed on cover, species composition and species richness. It was found that the soils of the different fields differ too much to be able to make concise conclusions based on the differences found. However, the fields with a clayey soil have a limited recovery most likely caused by limited infiltration capacity. All fields show signs of overgrazing. The vegetation species found indicate overgrazing and disturbances. Furthermore, the species richness at the fields with the clayey soil is limited, which could also be the result of overgrazing.\nKey words: restoration, land abandonment, grazing lawns, overgrazing, Karoo, South Africa",
