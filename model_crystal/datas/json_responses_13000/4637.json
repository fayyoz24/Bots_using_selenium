    "summary": "After studying Graphic Design, I have been wandering around Europe trying to find a place that fits my mindset. I have traveled from Istanbul to Vienna, Frankfurt to D\u00fcsseldorf, and recently to Amsterdam. Despite not speaking a word of Dutch, I am proud to have landed a job as a CD/Copy in a local Dutch agency. I am still learning the language.\n\nIf I am invited to be a member of a jury, I almost always say yes. So far, I have been on the juries of ADC Austria, Kristal Elma Turkey, ADC Germany, Golden Drum Slovenia, Adstars Asia, ZMG Germany, Das Plakat Germany, Adrenaline Lithuania, Jonge Honden Netherlands, LeBook Paris, L\u00fcrzer's 200 Best Illustrators, and the L\u00fcrzer's Grand Slam. In 2021, I was the president of the ADCN Jury. That's quite a nice list.\n\nI am a keen collector of Art Directors Clubs. I have D&AD, ADC Germany, ADC Austria, and ADC of the Netherlands so far. As for awards, I probably have over 100 national and international awards, but to be honest, I have never counted them all. However, Drum magazine included me in their list of the Top 200 ECDs worldwide, so they might have counted some of them.\n\nI play the blues on the guitar, warzone on Playstation, and American pool in the Dutch 2nd league. Music is still a hobby of mine, and sometimes I release electronic music under the name BDA. I also post videos of myself fishing on my YouTube channel, Merman Fishing. My daughter Vi\u00e9n is not yet a follower of mine, so I think I need to do better.",
