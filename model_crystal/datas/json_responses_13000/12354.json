These species occur at differing but somewhat overlapping depths in turbid water and thereby are subjected to different light environments. This study aimed to highlight wether there was genetic (species effect) or phenotypic (treatment effect) driver for habitat choice. \n\nLab work consisted of testing individuals reared in natural and unnatural lighting environments and videoed trials lasting 6 hours. In these trials individual fish were allowed free access to an experimental set up consisting of 4 differently light compartments. 200 hours of video footage captured during the trials was analysed using BORIS to determine habitat choice and fish behaviours.",

This topic was appealing after seeing first hand the effect ALAN has on sea turtles in Greece. With the presentation of these findings I aimed to determine how ALAN effects different species and evaluate the methods currently used to reduce its influence on marine organisms.",
