    "summary": "My name is Tiago Silva, currently working as a Senior Controls Support Engineer for Vanderlande in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. While engineering is my profession, over the years it has become clearer that dealing with people is my passion. Working in a position where I can lead, encourage and motivate groups to succeed is what I aspire to do. \nI love interacting with, and getting to know people. My Portuguese upbringing has taught me that good communication is essential to building strong relationships on a personal and/or professional basis.\nMy work experience in sales helped me develop my people skills into a more professional manner especially whilst dealing and communicating with customers.\nI believe my pro-active and disciplined approach in setting priorities and creating good relationships within the team, as well as our customers and subcontractors, will be the fundamental key for success.   \n",
