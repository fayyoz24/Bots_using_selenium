The gallery actually shows much more, because the Collective K\u00f3kir have been doing art residency with other indigenous nations and they have also guest artists which the work can be seen in the two galleries I curated this year. The exhibitions are beyond art because they tell about a long journey from Brazilian indigenous people to have the right of maintain their language and culture as well as their right to have their different cultural inheritance respected.",
