Some of these  areas include direct/indirect sourcing, milk cycles, ingredients, packaging and product security. \n\nA large part of my work involved regulatory compliance of initiatives and operations with all EU regulations. In particular my focus was on sensitive EU Antitrust topics such as cooperation agreements with other market operators, exchange of information, market dominance and vertical relationships with business partners. Furthermore, as part of the regulatory compliance scope, I assisted the team in designing the internal GDPR guidelines and for all relevant stakeholders and organized training sessions focused on infringement prevention and deeper understanding on the matter.\n\nOverall, my role consisted in assisting the lawyers of the General Counsel's team in providing indications of potential risks of violations and determine the most compliant and effective ways of fulfilling operative goals both short and long-term.",
