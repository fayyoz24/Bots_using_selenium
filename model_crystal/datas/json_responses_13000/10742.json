    "summary": "Anno 2023 humanity is facing some enormous challenges. We are dealing with overpopulation, climate change, and pandemics. As a young engineer, I am fascinated by the challenges the future generation will have to face in these complex crises. During my studies in architecture, I learned how to analyze processes and how to think outside of the box. Besides my studies, I also completed a multitude of extracurricular activities to build a broad skill set. In my future career, I hope to harness these skills to solve challenges related to business, science, and society.",
