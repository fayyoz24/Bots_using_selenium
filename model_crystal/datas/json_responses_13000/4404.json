    "summary": "I am a passionate brand builder, marketer, and corporate strategist with over 20-years experience working for some of the world's largest multinationals on their most valuable brands. Career highlights include many successful category launches, a world-first innovation, award-winning packaging, and globally recognised brand performance and digital campaigns.\n\nBut in 2016, halftime happened for me. A journey that has been defined as moving from success to significance. One in which you ask yourself the most urgent and complicated questions, Who am I? Why am I here? What does the next half look like?\n\nNever one to sit still, I left a traditional corporate role, ran a marathon, wrote a book, joined a young tech company, and started to talk to people about leadership, branding, and purpose. \n\nThis was all to find my answer. \n\nThe culmination is Markd Global. Markd Global turns purpose to performance through world-class strategy, proprietary tools including PX\u2122- The Purpose Experience, and fast and flexible execution supporting multi-industry personal, corporate, and SME clients. We use a global brand village of expert collaborators to bring every brand experience to life across digital-first platforms.",
