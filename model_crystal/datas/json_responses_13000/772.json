    "summary": "Dr. Ksenia Podoynitsyna is an Associate Professor in Data-Driven Entrepreneurship at JADS, the Joint Graduate School of Tilburg University and Eindhoven University of Technology.\nKsenia\u2019s dissertation (2008) was nominated for the prestigious Heizer dissertation award of the Entrepreneurship division of the Academy of Management. Ever since her research helps manage the risks and uncertainties surrounding new business development. Combining scientific rigor with practical relevance, Ksenia got funding for a number of research and teaching initiatives in the context of sustainable energy and data science, funded by the EU, EIT KIC InnoEnergy, and Philips among others.\n  Her current focus is on business models and ecosystems for data-driven and sustainable businesses. Projects include implications of revenue model and feature innovations in the Apple app store, business model innovations in smart cities, and patterns in innovative sustainable business models. The latter project resulted in a tool for mapping the business model of a focal company together with its immediate ecosystem. This tool is distinctive for its focus on value exchanges between the focal firm and external actors, and the options for structuring both value creating and value capturing transfers.   Ksenia has published in journals such as Journal of Business Venturing, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, California Management Review, Journal of Product Innovation Management, and Strategic Organization. On top of this, she serves on the Research Committee of the Entrepreneurship Division of the Academy of Management.",
