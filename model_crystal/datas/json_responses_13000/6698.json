    "summary": "A (Social) Entrepreneurship Ecosystem builder, Non For Profit Program Manager,  and Impact Investing consultant with a focus on green and digital transformations. \n\nI am currently working at the Ikea Foundation as a Programme Manager where i am responsible for funding and monitoring initiatives in line with the Foundation's Employment and Entrepreneurship portfolio strategy, which focuses on helping green entrepreneurs who provide employment and meaningful livelihoods for people living in poverty while protecting the planet. \n\nPrior to that i worked for 6 years at Hivos where I designed, implemented and lead the efforts to secure funding for 4 programs implemented in MENA aiming for an inclusive green and digital transition. The combined impact of the programs i designed and implemented at resulted in the supporting of more than 7000 job opportunities and the enablement of more than 200 Small and Growing Social Enterprises  (SGBs) in the green and digital sectors. \n\nThis comes after accumulating 13 years of regional and international experience in Impact Assessment, Non For Profit programme management and consulting social entrepreneurs on starting or scaling their social ventures between Cairo, London and San Francisco.\n\nI hold a Masters of Social Entrepreneurship from HULT International Business School in San Fransisco  and a Bachelors of Arts Specialised in Political Economy from the American University in Cairo.",
