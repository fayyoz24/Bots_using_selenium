    "summary": "The Little Blue Whale business was started by a mother, who sometimes found it difficult to obtain products for her own baby and decided to make things herself.  This means that the designs of all products have been pre-tested.  The items started with baggy pants, blankets, clips for dummy (soother, pacifier), mobiles for babies and toddlers. Items will be added as new needs arise. The inspirations and ideas come from current lifestyles.\n\nThe materials used, pay attention to the comfort of the child and take into account safety and issues such as potential allergies. All materials meet high quality standards (Bio Cotton, OEKO-TEX*).\n\n\n*OEKO-TEX\u00ae therefore offers extensive and reliable safety for every tested product without sacrificing the desired functions and the usual quality. The big bonus is that the products have been proven to be harmless to health through corresponding product testing because: Our textiles must never affect our health!\n\nVisit our website: www.littlebluewhale.nl",
