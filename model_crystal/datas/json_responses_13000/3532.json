    "summary": "I am a results-driven architect and leader, driving towards results in all types of environments.  I'm currently the infrastructure architect at Triodos Bank in the Netherlands, where my focus is driving a vision of agility, stability, high performance, and sustainability for Triodos customers.\n\nI have 5 years of leading/managing a high-performing global engineering team and 7 years of experience managing projects ensuring they align with business requirements, follow standards, and are cost-efficient.  I\u2019ve been a key player in transforming methodologies from legacy on-premise waterfall-style infrastructure development to more agile, cloud-first, CI-focused successes.  I have extensive experience getting the most out of vendors across the globe, whether in Europe, the Americas, or Asia.\n\nMy technical experience is broad, with Systems & Network design at my core.  For over 13 years, I\u2019ve been responsible for designing and implementing a wide range of technologies to ensure they meet the needs of our customers.  Whether designing a high-latency comms network for Special Forces in Afghanistan or creating highly available solutions for a multinational enterprise-level company, I have the experience to drive towards the best solution that adds the most value for the client and company.  \n\nFinally, I\u2019ve lived and worked in four different countries over the past 10 years bringing a unique mix of cultural awareness, technical expertise, and leadership skills.  \n\nI am currently based in Utrecht, Netherlands, originally from Canada.",
