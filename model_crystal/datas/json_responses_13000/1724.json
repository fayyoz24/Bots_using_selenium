The Greek hospitals always had trouble with waiting times and lower quality compared to the private clinics, however, the public health system provided free or low-cost care service to residents and their dependents, contributing to the social security. The main goal of this Thesis is to evaluate the impact of economic crisis on the patient flow between public hospitals and private clinics. In order for that goal to be achieved, a dataset which contains the total number of the three surgeries, LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY, SIGMOEIDECTOMY AND TOTAL GASTRECTOMY for the period 2007-2011 for each of the three hospitals and the three clinics accordingly was obtained. Furthermore, it contains the characteristics of each patient who underwent each surgery, which include; age, gender, marital status, sickness fund, cost of surgery, number of hospital days. This kind of dataset has never been obtained before in Greece and this is the most interesting and unique part in this analysis. The findings suggest that indeed there is an impact of the economic crisis in the healthcare, with the costs of the surgeries decreasing dramatically in the years of 2010 and 2011 compared to the previous years and most importantly, a patient shift from the private clinics to the public hospitals after 2009.",
