The Job Days vary in size and focus but they are all run with the aim of encouraging mobility throughout Europe and, of course, placing the right candidate in the right job.\n\nTo make European Job Days accessible to as many people as possible we have recently created the European Online Job Days that allow employers and jobseekers to come together \"virtually\" without being physically present at an onsite event.\n\nSome European Job Days combine an onsite event with a European Online Job Day.\nWhatever your preference, you are sure to find an event that meets your needs.\n\nEuropean Job Days are run by EURES, a network of European Employment Services and the European Commission.",
