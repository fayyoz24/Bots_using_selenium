Moved to Singapore in 2005 and obtained ITEC certificate in Anatomy Physiology & Holistic Massage, also practitioner for Raindrop Technique.\nI am an English native speaker with an abundance of work and social experience in the UK, \nNetherlands and Singapore. I feel I have accumulated several different skills that could be \nbeneficial within your company. Communication, Team Working, Organising and Planning\nare a few skills I would like to elaborate on. With my work experience I have been able to\nshow my written and spoken skills in both the English and Dutch language, specifically\nthrough reporting, presenting, supporting and motivating others. \nAs a former Self Employed Wellness Coach (Dutch) I also feel I have enough enthusiasm to make things\nhappen, have a hands on attitude, achieve goals and accept responsibilities for my actions.\nI am now looking for a new challenge be it in the laboratory world, administration, customer care or anything related to the English language.",
