            "description": "Volc\u00e1n de Colima is an active andesitic volcano in Western Mexico. Its history includes dome growth and collapse, lava flows and Vulcanian type explosive eruptions. Volcanic activity has increased since 1998 and since 2003 explosive activity commenced with multiple events. The larger magnitude eruptions of Volc\u00e1n de Colima produced ballistics that landed up to 3 km from the volcano. Earlier studies have proposed theoretical models that explain the production of ballistics, but only very few have integrated field-data into their theoretical models. This study therefore aims to construct a field-data based ballistic trajectory path, which will be used to estimate the kinetic energy released during the December 2016-January 2017 eruptions of Volc\u00e1n de Colima and its associated ballistics. Collected field-data includes the dimensions and sizes of both the impact craters and ballistics with special attention paid to the vesicularity, texture, lithology, crystallinity, glassiness, alteration and impact angles of the ballistics. In addition, density and distribution maps of the 2016-2017 ballistics were generated and a hazard map based on the 2016-2017 events was constructed. By estimating the average initial velocity of the 2016-2017 ballistics, the released kinetic energy was found to be 8.8 x 108 J, assuming a hyperbolic trajectory. The ArcGIS maps show a clear cluster of ballistics NE of Volc\u00e1n de Colima, which agrees with earlier studies (Alatorre et al., 2006) and suggesting a non- vertical orientation of the conduit. Hazard maps show a low risk of impact between 16 km and 9 km distance from the crater of Volc\u00e1n de Colima, an intermediate risk between 9 km and 2 km from the crater and a high risk within 2 km distance from the crater. Hazard maps for air navigation show that ballistics can reach altitudes of up to 11.8 km.",

            "description": "A remarkable feature of the Scandinavian Caledonides is the widespread occurrence of orogenic peridotites at most of its tectonostratigraphic levels. Until the present day, only a few tectonic models have been proposed that can explain their origin (protolith formation), spatial and temporal distribution and crustal emplacement, which are thus under discussion. This research aims to determine whether the current tectonic models for the Scandinavian Caledonides need to be modified and focusses on the origin and crustal emplacement of orogenic peridotites in the Western Belt of the Seve Nappe Complex (SNC) and lower part of the K\u00f6li Nappe Complex (KNC). Samples of peridotites and their immediate surrounding country rocks were collected during a one month fieldwork period in southern V\u00e4sterbotten and northern J\u00e4mtland (central Sweden) for further analysis using OM, SEM, EMP, XRF and Raman spectroscopy combined with thermodynamic modelling in PerpleX. This study proposes an oceanic origin for the Lower K\u00f6li and a suboceanic mantle wedge origin for the Western Seve orogenic peridotites, based on EMP and XRF analyses. After protolith formation, the Western Seve and Lower K\u00f6li peridotites experienced a similar retrograde ocean floor serpentinization event, interpreted to be Early Finnmarkian in age (505 Ma). After serpentinization, the Western Seve belt peridotites and surrounding country rocks experienced a peak metamorphism of 610\u00b0C and 0.8 GPa (calculated in PerpleX) during Finnmarkian thrusting (490 Ma) while the Lower K\u00f6li peridotites experienced a prograde metamorphic event up to 400\u00b0C-500\u00b0C (based on the stability of antigorite and olivine in the absence of talc). The prograde metamorphism of the Western Seve and Lower K\u00f6li is overprinted by a second retrograde serpentinization event (M4). The origin and metamorphic conditions of the Western Seve peridotites and their country rocks are used to improve the current tectonic models for the Scandinavian Caledonides.",
