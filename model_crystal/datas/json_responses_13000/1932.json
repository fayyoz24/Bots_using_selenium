In addition, I set high standards and I want to deliver excellent performance.\u00a0\n\nReliability and openness are of tremendous importance to me. I\u2019m clear about what I can deliver. In this way colleagues and relations can count on me.\u00a0I get motivated by involvement in devising and deploying concepts where I pay a lot of attention to processes.\n\nI get my energy from initiating, planning and following up on projects.\u00a0In complex situations I intuitively see in which direction the solution should be sought. Within processes I see the broad outlines and analyze them in detail in order to achieve the desired results.\n\nsource: Personality survey written by: MariekeWesselman, Development Platform for coaches & consultants OPcc.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
