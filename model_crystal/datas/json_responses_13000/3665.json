    "summary": "I love learning and data analysis - two fields in which I have always succeeded the most. These two passions have guided my career path, and, thanks to them, I learned how to solve problems using data and programming. Even though I am always keen to do more elaborate work, over the years, I\u2019ve learned to strike a balance between the work that needs to be done and the features that can be added later or would be nice developments.\nWhen devising solutions, I am striving to always choose the options that are better suited for the Occam\u2019s razor principle and can be automated as much as possible.\nMaking a [working] plan to implement a solution or organize a process is always a challenge but I prefer to have a bird\u2019s eye view of the matter with details added or adjusted on the go.",
