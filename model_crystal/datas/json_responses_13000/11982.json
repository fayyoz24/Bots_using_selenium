    "summary": "As a native Slovak with over 20 years of global experience in leadership and management, I have always been drawn to the non-profit sector and developed a profound passion for charitable work early on. Inspired by the teachings of Bob Chapman, I firmly believe in the transformative power of leadership to positively impact the well-being and lives of individuals. My belief in peace through collaboration, open dialogue, and the promotion of simple acts of humanity has been a guiding principle throughout my career.\nIn my extensive experience in event and hotel management, I have focused on fostering a culture of teamwork and inclusivity, encouraging individuals to work together to achieve shared goals. I firmly believe that kindness and compassion reside in the hearts of all individuals and can be harnessed to create positive change.\nTo further promote kindness and happiness in everyday lives and inspire people to treat one another with kindness at the familial, local, and national levels, I am seeking a new challenge where I can leverage my expertise and experience to forge new fundraising partnerships and drive business growth across multiple regions. I am excited to utilize my skills in relationship-building, strategic planning, and business development to make a meaningful impact in the non-profit sector and contribute to the greater good of society.",
