I was drafting complex Chamber and Committee judgements and decisions, notes to the President, procedural notes (anonymity, confidentiality, priority requests, etc.), interim measure decisions (Rule 39) and communication reports in cases covering a variety of human rights issues. I prepared hundreds of legal documents presented to the Judges of the Court for deliberations and, as regards the correspondence with the parties, to Section Registrars. The drafts I produced showcase my ability to conduct a comprehensive legal research, analyse State legislation and identify as well as apply European and international human rights standards to the facts of the case. Throughout the years I trained legal professionals on the European Convention on Human Rights and published articles on important Court\u2019s case-law. I was also in charge of reviewing relevant press releases, updating country-specific reports and the Court's manual on broader-WECL procedure, which is used by the Registry's lawyers. Between March 2019 and December 2020 I was in charge of managing the caseload of the whole State Unit.",
