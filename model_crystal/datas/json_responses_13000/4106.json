This paper argues that the cultural branding of Korea for global consumption is now expanding further than mainstream media production and lifestyles products, with ordinary residents of Korea both contributing to and capitalising on Korea\u2019s global visibility by posting aspects of their daily lives on social media. In particular, this paper is focused on lifestyle content that hinges on the more mundane or banal aspects of daily life in Korea, such as TikToks showcasing convenience store food or vlogs detailing different amenities in Korea, such as gyms, recycling, and libraries. The Korean-ness of these mundane activities is amplified by their creators, turning the mundane into aspirational content for audiences and consumers of Korean Wave products. Most significantly, this new trend in the expansion of the Korean Wave encourages the average Korean social media user (or even visitors to Korea) to brand themselves according to Hallyu logics, in particular given the increase in social media interaction and visibility that association with Hallyu and Brand-Korea can bring. However, while these social media users/content creators may benefit in terms of metrics and advertising revenue, these efforts ultimately feed into the larger, cross-industry branding efforts of South Korea. These creators are encouraged to present a certain vision of life in Korea, wherein an acceptable Korean self is one that adheres to the trends and norms of the Korean entertainment and lifestyle industry. The fantasy of K-Dramas and K-Pop alone can no longer drive the global expansion of Korean content, Korean life must now also replicate the fantasy constructed by the Korean wave.",

This \u2018foreignness\u2019 stems in part from the shows provocative premise, placing a number of objectively attractive and single individuals on a deserted island where they will battle it out in the name of romance. Echoing popular global reality formats from Love Island to The Bachelor in Paradise, the supposed \u2018foreignness\u2019 of Singles Inferno is linked not just to popular Western reality television conventions, but specifically the sexual and scandalous content these series are famed for. And yet, despite this initial teasing of a show unlike any other Korean reality series to date, Singles Inferno remains a largely conservative and uncontroversial production, where intimacy is teased but never realised. This paper aims to trace the balancing act that is preserving the excitement, drama, and scandal expected of global reality dating series without compromising the traditional morals and conservative norms that continue to define Korean television production. While the show itself navigates this terrain through editing and panel commentary, I will also demonstrate how the coalescence of conservatism and neoliberal competition causes new forms of scandal to arise. These tensions surrounding the process of localisation also point to larger discussions around the power dynamics at work within an increasingly platformised media context.",

Although both films offer a challenge to the \u2018abstraction of women\u2019 in South Korean cinema (Doane 1990), their efforts produce different results; while 'Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982' follows in the footsteps of the melodramatic \u2018women\u2019s film,\u2019 'The Woman Who Ran' takes a much more subdued approach, presenting three conversations between women with very little filmic intervention. The paper demonstrates how these different aesthetic interventions serve to either re-articulate womanhoods that adhere to the typical abstraction of the Korean woman, or dis-articulate the dominant tropes of Korean womanhood.",
