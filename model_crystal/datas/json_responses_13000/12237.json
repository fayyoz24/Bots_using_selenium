    "summary": "I am a highly motivated computational chemist and method developer working at the interface of chemistry, catalysis, graph theory and artificial intelligence. During my PhD I have developed GARNA: Graph-based automated reaction Network Analysis in Homogeneous Catalysis. Further, I have extended my studies to high throughput screening investigations on large databases of homogeneous catalysts through further developments in GARNA. During my master studies in pharmaceutical engineering, I have done extensive molecular dynamics simulations on polymeric drug delivery agents. I have solid knowledge of different molecular simulation tools as well as coding skills in artificial intelligence and data science. Prior to my PhD, I have had industrial experience as a software developer and formulation scientist in the pharmaceutical industry. This experience has given me deep insights into research and has greatly improved my technical and interpersonal skills.",
