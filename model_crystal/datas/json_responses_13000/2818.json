    "summary": "I recently completed my master thesis on how time is processed in the brain. My main task was to analyse fMRI data in order to learn more about how the brain keeps track of duration. In addition I worked with artificial neural networks in Python to assess how they respond to simple input with varying durations. Next, I would like to continue working in data analysis and visualisation. I am very handy in R and have experience in making online dashboards in R-shiny. Additionally, I have experience in Python and Matlab. \n\nI have enjoyed my bachelor internship at the Brain, Behaviour and Cognition research and development department at Philips a lot. There, I have worked with EEG data from a neurofeedback system and made a dashboard for visualising data from a health-tracker. Ideally, I will do similar kind of work in the future, I like to use data analysis and visualisation to help people or companies to improve their well-being. I would be interested to do this type of work anywhere in the world.  I gathered a lot of skills and know-how during my AI studies that I would love to apply to real-life problems. \n\nIn addition to data analysis, I am very passionate about philosophy of science. I enjoy thinking critically about methodology, but also about broader questions concerning different levels of explanation and how they relate. If I come across a really interesting PhD position in philosophy of neuroscience, cognition, free will, consciousness, information processing systems, or reductionism and emergentism, I am willing to consider it as an option.",
