    "summary": "I am a trained applied mathematician now working as an algorithm engineer and software developer.  \nI am currently working as  Rust software engineer at Heliax helping to develop the ledger behind the Anoma network.\n\nPreviously I worked as  a researcher and afterward worked as a data scientist and later as an algorithm engineer. \n\n I have lead the algorithms chapter at start-up company from from pre - product launch to scale-up phase and taken ownership of two large existing codebases and overseen their maintenance and development throughout this period.\n\nI have also contributed to open source projects and I am always excited about new technology and a chance to learn something new and expand my skill set. \n\nDuring my studies I focused on (among other things)\n * Symbolic computation\n * Complexity theory\n * Algorithm design\n * Quantum computing\n * Cryptography\n * Computational geometry\n\nSince working as software developer, I have acquired the following skills:\n * Algorithm analysis, maintainance, and development (performance analysis, optimization in both speed and memory, to thread safety, memory leaks)\n * Owner and maintainer of multiple large code bases (both pre-existing that I took on)\n * Worked in a polyglot environment (day to day work in Python, C++, and Rust)\n * Databases: SQL, Postgres\n * GIS, especially in regards to traffic map and public transportation data,\n * CI/CD tooling, including Travis and Jenkins\n * Docker and microservice architectures\n * Protobuf, Avro, Kafka, ZeroMQ\n * REST APIs\n * Data science and machine learning\n",
