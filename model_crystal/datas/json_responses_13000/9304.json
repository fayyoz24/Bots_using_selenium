    "summary": "I started my PC journey when I was 12 years old. It was love at first sight. Year after year I develop simple apps, games and tools for myself. Like many \"geeks\" of that time, I researched operating systems, compressors and viruses and tried to write my own. Three volumes of Donald Knuth took pride of place on my bookshelf. After graduating from high school, I took up commercial development. I enjoy solving complex and demanding tasks. I am 40 but I still continue to learn and constantly find something new. By studying various programming paradigms, you can sometimes find really interesting solutions in their hybrid application, raising your and your company's productivity to a new level, often no matter what programming language or stack you use.",
