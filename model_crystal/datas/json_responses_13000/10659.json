    "summary": "Currently Global Director at Archineer, I am a building technology expert with over 22 years of extensive experience in architecture and construction; specifically, in architectural steel structures and sophisticated envelope designs. I designed many prominent parts of the iconic Marina Bay Sands IR; most notably the ArtScience Museum, efforts that were recognized with Singapore\u2019s \u201cPresident\u2019s Design of the Year Award\u201d. \n\nI directed and motivated multi-disciplinary teams on a variety of other high-value complex projects, such as: Singapore\u2019s National Stadium and other stadiums; airport terminals, hotels and casinos, museums and theatres, skyscrapers, mixed-use commercial projects, high-end retail, bridges and more. My expertise encompasses the project development cycle from concept creation and tendering to on-site execution, including: resource planning, 3D design, engineering, interface & change management, prefabrication, installation and inspection.\n\nDuring my career, I have held key roles and cooperated with world-renowned architects, engineers and contractors: building strong relationships with a broad array of multi-cultural professionals and clients around the world. This has placed me in a unique position to understand the perspectives, challenges and stakes of all parties in our industry; allowing me to align expectations and get the results. \n\nThroughout, I am highly focused on intelligent use of budget, time and resources; implementing 4D/BIM processes and value engineering to mitigate risk, ensure feasibility and product quality. \n\nThis is described in my book: \u201cLord of the Wings; Making of Free Form Architecture\u201d.\n\n   - ISBN-13: 978-1614995494\n   - ISBN-10: 1614995494",
