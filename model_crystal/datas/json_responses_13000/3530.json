    "summary": "Is there a solution to hunger and poverty? Can we make nations less dependent on official development assistance or address root causes for youth unemployment (leading to large-scale migration)?\n\nI believe the answers to many of these are sustainable economic development, with emphasis on job creation and local value-adding enterprise development. \n \nProfit is not a single bottom line! Economics of mutuality considers benefits of companies investing in its communities, people and environmental system.\n\nIf we help create an enabling environment, build people\u2019s capacities with marketable skills and support local enterprise development, then more people in the BOP can earn a living wage. And by helping them develop their sustainable livelihood, they will increasingly be able to provide for their families, educate their children, access health care, etc. I believe this should arise from business development and job creation, using market based approaches and agricultural value chains.\n\nSustainable Economic Development | Agribusiness | Livelihoods | Job Creation | Business Development | Social Entrepreneurship | Bottom of the Pyramid | Africa and Fragile States",
