    "summary": "My expertise is in seismic data processing and advanced imaging, but I am currently in a geophysicist role that also allows me to build on existing Petrel skills, structural and stratigraphic interpretation training, and on-the-job interpretation experience. \n\nThis makes me an even broader geoscientist with a powerful integrated seismic skill set; data processing, depth imaging, inversion, interpretation. Knowledge of how a seismic volume is created is vital for successful interpretation and avoiding pitfalls. On the other hand, incorporating geological knowledge into imaging (QC) can \"bridge the gap\" between geophysics and geology. Passionate about working in multidisciplinary teams, I am focussed on sharing information within and between project teams, regions and disciplines.",
