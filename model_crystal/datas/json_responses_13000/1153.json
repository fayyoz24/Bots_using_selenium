We performed a climate assessment to highlight potential risks regarding heat stress, droughts, pluvial\nflooding. These themes are all documented in an online report (iReport). My role within this project was to create the heat stress maps and do the interpretation of the maps considering the vulnerability of Best to heat stress. Moreover, I was a facilitator in several sessions within this project where we did an online webinar and an interactive session in Microsoft Teams.",
