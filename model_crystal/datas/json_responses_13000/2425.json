    "summary": "I am a Lead Data Platform Engineer with a vast range of domain knowledge (healthcare, research, IT, media, and finance). In my current role, I hold HR responsibilities, I own technical and architectural decisions for the team, and I do hands-on work. The platforms we work with are cloud-based and include Azure, AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake. \n\nIn the past, I have had experience in every other side of data analytics (e.g. ML, BI reporting, dashboarding, ETL, EDA, data modeling, statistics, data quality). \n\nIn terms of team vision, I put a lot of effort into building a positive and nurturing environment for all of us on the team to feel safe and grow together while showing respect to the other teams. I believe a team's well-being is its primary asset, not only because it is in general a good thing, but also considering it is fundamental to maximize productivity and contain turnover. Coherently with this view, I consider part of my role as being the first line of defense for the team, in case of external pressures or general challenges.  \n\nOn the strategic side, I have a strong propensity for streamlining both architectures and processes, in order to minimize the time needed for maintenance and give more space to the engineers for more interesting kinds of work. I also focus on accurate and efficient communication, which I tackle by writing rich but pragmatic documentation, and organizing a reasonable amount of frontal meetings.",

My supervisor was Ovidio Mario Bucci and the co-supervisor was Gennaro Bellizzi.\n \nThe work was about finding a new way to measure the magnetic permeability that could work on the ferrofluids that the researchers of the department used for biomedical applications. These ferrofluids have a really low concentration of magnetic nanoparticles and are water-based: this particular setting leads to many problems in this kind of measure.\n\nI run the experiments, analyzed the data, and optimized the MATLAB code in order to shorten sensibly the time needed for the measures and analyses. \n \nWe measured the magnetic permeability of aqueous ferrofluids with a concentration thirteen times lower than the lowest measured in literature, using an innovative technique we developed in the department.\n\nThe work was published in an article: \"A Novel Measurement Technique for the Broadband Characterization of Diluted Water Ferrofluids for Biomedical Applications\"\u200b, on IEEE transactions on Magnetics.",
