With a recently completed Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and extensive hands-on expertise as a Ventilation Practitioner and ICU Nurse, my diverse background positions me uniquely for success.\n\nHaving successfully sold inhaled anesthetics in the ICU across the Benelux & Europe, I have acquired practical knowledge in sales planning, territory management, opportunity qualification, controlling the sales cycle, effective communication, negotiating, and utilizing sales enablement tools. This work experience has provided me with real-world insights and a deep understanding of the challenges and dynamics of the sales environment.\n\nFurthermore, my educational background, including a BBA, has equipped me with a solid foundation in strategic decision-making, financial analysis, and market dynamics. This academic knowledge complements and enhances my practical experience, allowing me to approach sales challenges with a well-rounded perspective.\n\nAdditionally, my hands-on experience as a Ventilation Practitioner and ICU Nurse has provided me with in-depth knowledge of Intensive Care Medicine, Mechanical Ventilation, Electronic Impedance Tomography, healthcare practices, and healthcare innovations. This practical work experience enables me to effectively communicate and collaborate with healthcare professionals, understand their unique needs, and tailor sales strategies accordingly.\n\nBy combining my practical work experience with my educational background, I offer a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to sales. This blend of hands-on experience and academic knowledge allows me to bring insights from both the business administration and healthcare domains to deliver tailored solutions and drive sales growth for clients.\n\nIf you are seeking a healthcare professional with a solid foundation in management who can not only leverage their educational background but also bring practical work experience to the table, I invite you to connect with me.
