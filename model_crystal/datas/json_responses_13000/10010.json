The cultural factor was incorporated as the moderator variable (human service vs self service). Based on the research and analysis from the targeted distributors and the potential customers (in-depth interviews and online questionnaires) the adoption potential of hot drink vending machines in Istanbul office buildings for the near future was estimated. Traveling to Istanbul and conducting meetings were a part of my activities during my internship. These business development activities and engagement with distributors and customers supported the sales team of RPC Tedeco-Gizeh in developing new channels.",

With my model, I have executed a research and analysis on the potential customers, early identification of projects and an overview of competitors. Following this, I have given strategical and tactical advice / directions to the Sales team and we gained new construction projects for the firm within the Health - and Education segments.",
