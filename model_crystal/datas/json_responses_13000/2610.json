            "description": "Wind energy harvesting in urban areas has recently received growing interest. This is mainly because urban wind energy provides a decentralized local energy resource and can substantially lower energy cost by avoiding the long-distance energy transmission costs/losses. Urban wind energy can be harvested using: (i) stand-alone wind turbines/wind farms installed in urban settings, (ii) wind turbines/wind farms retrofitted on the roof of existing buildings, and (iii) wind turbine(s) integrated into the initial architectural design of the buildings. Due to the complexities of wind conditions in urban areas, the design of an urban wind energy harvesting system needs to be made with special attention to the wind conditions in and\naround the buildings.\n\nThis PhD research project aims to provide fundamental knowledge on:\n(i) The optimal geometry and positioning of building-integrated wind energy harvesting systems; \n(ii) The aerodynamics, power performance and wake interactions of wind turbines for layout optimization of VAWT wind farms in urban areas.\n\nHigh-fidelity CFD simulations and wind-tunnel experiments are employed. Wind-tunnel experiments area employed for the validation of CFD simulations. The validated CFD simulations are used to characterize and optimize the power performance of building-integrated wind turbines and urban VAWT wind farms.\n\n\u25c9 This ongoing project has so far resulted in 2 journal papers published in the top journals of the field, as well as 3 conference papers presented to frontier conferences (see Publications section of the profile).",

This architecture possesses a variety of original elements and strategies to satisfy necessities imposed by context. Iran\u2019s vernacular architecture has developed different architectures in different regions of the country. Despite their different appearances, these architectures follow the same logic: sustainable adaptation to context. This project studies this logic with a focus on south-east Iran. Elements and strategies of sustainability are studied, specifications of the context are linked to different aspects of architecture and their impact on the architecture is illustrated so they can be used as guidelines for future designs and constructions.\n\nThe project goes into more detail in studying the natural ventilation and its elements in vernacular architecture of south-east Iran, including: (i) roofs (Sistani, Filpush and Barrel), (ii) ventilator openings (Kolak, Surak and Dariche) and (iii) walls. Three different compound room types are identified based on orientation and use of mentioned elements by documenting thirty-two sample houses across the region: (1) stretched against the prevailing winds; (2) stretched aligned with the winds; and (3) L shaped. CFD simulations are used to study the wind behavior and evaluate the ventilation performance of these room-types. These simulations lead to guidelines to enhance the ventilation performance of existing buildings and future constructions, including: where to put the windows, which orientation maximizes the natural ventilation performance, where to consider precautions to block the undesirable winds from entering and how far from each other should different room types be built.\n\n\u25c9 This project resulted in 3 journal papers published in the top journals of the field (see Publications section of the profile).",
