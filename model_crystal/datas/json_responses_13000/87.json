    "summary": "I am an experienced teacher of English as a foreign language (EFL) at all levels, but I specialize in creating and teaching tailor-made courses for academics and professionals in several fields, most notably the humanities, art, design, creativity and creative concept development. I have also taught and helped develop courses in academic writing and presentation skills. I have developed and taught a series of English courses designed to help artists and lecturers at Dutch art schools improve both spoken and written communication with their international students and colleagues. \n\nFurthermore, I develop and teach English courses and write course material for many different groups with specific needs, for example: receptionists, secretaries, career counselors, foreign students, foreign lecturers, and Dutch students of all levels. I enjoy applying my knowledge of the language to each specific situation and helping my students to broaden their vocabulary, strengthen their grammar, and build confidence in their use of the language. I have also contributed to an series of ESL publications called NU Engels that is used widely in vocational schools in the Netherlands. \n\nI also enjoy working in language testing - testing each candidate's level of English based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). I work  and have worked as an examiner for several organizations. I also teach Cambridge exam prep courses, both for groups and individuals. \n\nFinally, I am experienced in writing and editing in both Dutch and English. I focus on academic texts in the humanities and texts about art, design, theater, creativity and concept development. I limit translations to the areas I am most familiar with to ensure the quality of the final product. I will refer clients to a colleague if I feel they might be better equipped to deliver a good result.",
