    "summary": "I want to provide Austrian investors and developers the possibility to connect to a professional network of building engineering professionals in the Netherlands and for Dutch investors and developers the same in Austria. \n\nAs an engineer in the European Union my vision is to learn and practice design solutions in different countries. I have a longterm professional experience and educational background in Austria where I was able to create a network from construction companies to architectural offices. Since two years I have gaines experience in the dutch market currently working as a BIM coordinator in the area of The Hague.\n\n\nA wide range of experience with all different kind of buildings. energy efficient design, value engineering, value engineering, detailed engineering solutions, interface engineering, site management & supervision, scheduling, tender management, integrated design from the early design stages.\n\nPersonal strengths: good communication skills, analytical mindset, fast decision making, good in creating teams for different tasks, skills in negotiating with clients and contractors, Solution oriented working, ability to work under high demand, crisis management.\n\nWorking in a team is important for me, to share the strengths of the different characters who are involved. \n\nThe various projects gave me good overview of what kind of systems are meeting the demands of\nclients and investors today and to be still in the responsibility to give the advises as an engineer for\ngood quality, state of the art technology and sustainable design. At the same time I kept my \nacademic way of thinking big and outside the box, to give a perspective for alternative solutions and \nto attract clients for investing into outstanding solutions.\nAn important experience is as well to act in the field with the clients, the engineering consultants of\nthe clients, as well as with the project audits to work together on the best solution of each building, \nto create a marvelous environment. \nAll of that packed into the mindset of integrated and life cycle design.\n\n",

We set up a partnership with several companies, including Suzuki, Klim and Enduristan to tackle this journey. Alongside we were filming, photographing and writing about our experiences and adventures and published our work on the Adventurism Youtube-channel and our own website adventurism.tv.
