    "summary": "I am a senior geologist working on New Ventures Exploration. I am currently the subsurface lead for a venture in West Africa. Skilled in regional to prospect scale analysis while integrating a wide range of data. I bring a specialism in stratigraphy and clastic sedimentology applied from core to outcrop and plate scales. My career at Shell has spanned the Middle East and North Africa, the Indian Ocean and Africa and the South Atlantic, from regional studies to prospect appraisal in new and held ventures. I am a regular reviewer of journal articles and have organised AAPG workshops as part of technical committees. My interests lie in academic and industrial geoscience.\n\nPrior to joining Shell I spent 18 months at Rock Deformation Research Ltd (RDR) where I contributed to the development of content for the Studio Advisor module for Petrel which provides embedded workflows and geological guidance for the Petrel E&P platform. \n\nBefore industry I spent 7 years within the industry funded consortium \"North Africa Research Group\" at the University of Manchester (UK).  The group has a specialism in fieldwork and regional geology throughout North Africa from Morocco to Egypt. During this time I was also able to continue a part time PhD with the group. I was fortunate to study the Numidian Flysch formation in Sicily and northern Tunisia with an aim to piecing together the slope depositional architectures. I also spent time trying to piece together the ambiguous basin evolution including the provenance of the deep marine sediments which remains one of the main controversies within the geology of the western Mediterranean.",

Primarily involving the mapping of structures and facies types along with geochemical data and outputs from basin models to provide a view on hydrocarbon prospectivity. \n\u25cf Representing the full uncertainty range in the parameters of geological models and how this impacts the commercial decisions to be taken. Understanding also the statistical chance of failure of the project due to risk and uncertainty.\n\u25cf Managing technical aspects of the team to deliver high quality studies on time and on budget. Being aware of well-being within the team.\n\u25cf Planning a structured approach to projects with framing events, agreement of key deliverables, decision gates to be taken, assurance plans, and stakeholder engagement.\n\u25cf Communicating often complex stories to decision makers in a simple and understandable manner. Supporting decisions involving significant capital expenditure. \n\u25cf Maintaining secure communications with external companies, and honouring restricted or confidential ways of working.\n\u25cf Safety and wellbeing is a key concern where geological understanding of the petroleum system (i.e. reservoir pressures and gasses such as H2S) can put people in potentially harmful situations. I have also attended first aid at work and first aid in the field courses.\n\u25cf I have worked several years in the equatorial West African Atlantic on held ventures as well as new ventures opportunities. I have also worked on projects in Oman, Bulgaria/Romania, across north Africa and the Indian sub-continent.",
