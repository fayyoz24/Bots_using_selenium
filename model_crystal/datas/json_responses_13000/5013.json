    "summary": "I am a Business Analyst (5 years) in IT with a huge marketing background. I\u2019m focused on bringing value to business and prefer to work in the agile environment. Mostly I deal with:\n - requirements (elicitation, prioritization, management) and user stories (acceptance criteria, mock-ups);\n - stakeholders on various levels (interviews, surveys, demos, workshops);\n - business processes (diagrams, analysis, customer journey map);\n - QA and dev team (as a liason between business and dev);\n - Project documentation.\n\nI also believe that communication (with business owners, end users and within the dev team) is a core tool for successful software development. I speak English, Polish, Russian and still unideal Dutch.",
