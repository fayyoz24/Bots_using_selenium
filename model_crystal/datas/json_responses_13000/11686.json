    "summary": "Fields of interest: Research in fields of Postcolonial Literature, and Educational research methodologies.\n\nFor the last few years I have dedicated myself to my team and their needs. Making sure that they can work in an environment that caters to their best performance has been my main goal. I have done this by concentrating on organisational logistics, i.e. making sure their schedules are optimal, their tasks are balanced, their tasks fit their expertise, that there is a structural approach to change, that there are standard procedures in place for daily, monthly and yearly activities and  that they have the resources needed in order to be the best team they can be. \n\nAdditionally, we have worked together on redesigning the curriculum.  We have focused on modernizing not only content but also our approach to teaching and learning. We have dedicated more time to our students individual needs, designing and implementing a strategy for students with all forms of additional needs and support. We strongly believe in the role of education in addressing societal issues and the role that our students can play in becoming agents of change.",
