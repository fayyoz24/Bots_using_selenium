Systemic therapy involves treatment that travels through your entire body rather than being aimed at one area. Systemic radiation therapy uses radioactive drugs to treat certain types of cancer, including thyroid, bone, and prostate cancer. These are liquid drugs made up of a radioactive substance. Although these drugs travel through your whole body, they can find and collect in places where the cancer cells are located. This helps them deliver radiation doses exactly to the tumour or area where the cancer cells are found. Some belong to PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. This treatment combines radioactive material with a peptide to make a radiopeptide. When given, the radiopeptide finds and attaches to certain types of cancer cells, then delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the cells.",
