    "summary": "As a Civil Engineer (MSc in Geotechnical Engineering and MSc in Urban Development) I have a genuine interest in multidisciplinary projects. Formerly I have been involved with facilities\u2019 rehabilitation, construction sites management and supervision and structural engineering consulting. \nCurrently, as a Geotechnical Engineer I work independently or within a team both onshore and offshore, on offshore projects, overseeing data collation, interpretation and analysis using cutting-edge tools, characterizing the soil profile encountered to facilitate on offshore developments' designing. Additionally, I create or collaborate with software teams to the creation of necessary innovative solutions to automate data integration and analysis.",
