    "summary": "You want your English copy to sound as good as your Dutch. But you struggle to find your brand voice in English. Your company needs to connect with a global audience. But you find it hard to write in English (even though you speak it effortlessly).  \n\nYou need real English... Echt English. \n\nWhether you are looking for a translator to turn your Dutch text into English or a copy editor to refine and correct your text, I will transform your words into fluent, flowing English.\n\n\u2714 Dutch to English Translation\nTranslation is more than swapping a Dutch word for its English equivalent. It\u2019s about conveying the meaning behind the words. I deliver clean, accurate text that is faithful to the original and resonates with an English audience. \nResult: Natural translation that sounds like it was written in English in the first place.\n\n\u2714 English Copy Editing\nPerhaps you have already written your website/ annual report/ marketing materials/ press release, but it doesn\u2019t have the same impact as the original Dutch. I can help smooth out awkward text, correct mistakes and give your words a fluent English voice. \nResult: Flawless, native-sounding texts, free of errors.\n\n\u2714 Language Style Guide\nMost companies have a brand style guide, but it doesn\u2019t always include how you sound. I can develop a language style guide to give you a consistent tone of voice and style. \nResult: Language guidelines to improve the quality of your brand content. \n\n\u2714 Academic Editing\nAll PhD students in the Netherlands must submit their thesis and academic papers in English. This can be hard if you are a non-native speaker. I can edit your paper for grammar and spelling, clarity and structure.\nResult: Your work reaches its potential and increases the chance of being published.\n\n\u2714 Copywriting\nYou know what you want to say but your text still sounds stilted and unconvincing. I can listen to your brief, research and write engaging, compelling (SEO) copy for whitepapers, articles, blog posts, websites and anything else you need.\n\nFriendly, fast and flawless. \n\n\u270d Personal service \u2013 no project managers or client relation managers. Just me, and you. \n\u270d A people\u2019s person - flexible and easy to deal with. \n\u270d A language expert \u2013 with meticulous attention to detail. \n\u270d Someone you can trust - reliable with deadlines and can work to tight turnaround times.\n\n\nFor all your translation, editing and writing, email me claire@echt-english.nl or 06 42 45 1332.\n\nwww.echt-english.nl                                                                                         \n\n#unmistakablyEnglish",
