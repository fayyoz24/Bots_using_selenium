    "summary": "Cemal Koray Bing\u00f6l is an architect and computational designer. His research focuses on computational design technologies through data-driven design, interaction design and robotic fabrication. He finished his study at Computer-Aided Architectural Design Master\u2019s Programme at Yildiz Technical University, after he received his Bachelor of Architecture from Istanbul Technical University. He also attended to Urban Design graduate program as an exchange student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. In his master\u2019s thesis, he researched simulating urban sprawl through computational models. He taught computational design and basic design courses at Istanbul Bilgi University between 2013 and 2019 and has been giving lectures in various universities on computational and interactive design. He worked as a full-time lecturer between 2019 and 2022, and coordinated the digital fabrication lab at the faculty of architecture. Meanwhile, he co-founded the computational design and art collaboration Epitome {co net}, and data-driven design consultancy Bits 'n Bricks. Currently, he is working at the Delft AI Labs AiBLE LAb at Technical University of Delft as a PhD Candidate and his research is focused on energy transition design strategies.",

The overall design was developed in scope of effective/selected parameters and their projections in a spatial sense. The concepts of adaptability and responsiveness was discussed with various scenarios and the participants were introduced with different techniques of kinetic systems and sensors. In addition to interactive systems,  digital form finding experiments were made in order to achieve a self standing system that will allow the set of actions that are mounted.",
