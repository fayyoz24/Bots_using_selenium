The program included various workshops focused on various women's right-related issues, leadership, female empowerment, and entrepreneurship led by Babson College and negotiations led by Harvard University. The program culminated in the presentation of personal action plans in the Massachusetts State House. \n\nAfter attending the conference in 2017, I was selected as a returning alumnae in capacity of an intern. My experience as an intern during Women2Women Conference was truly a remarkable one. My tasks included mentoring a group of participants and helping them with preparation for their final presentation at the conference. Additionally, I was responsible for the smooth process of all activities and well being of participants. \n\nI was a part of the first Women2Women delegation to the UN Women. As a part of the team and Polish delegate.
