Rehabilitation, completion and modernization of irrigation infrastructure, improved water management and maintenance, development of agricultural potential and marketing, institutional development and private sector development at farmer-, scheme- and community level and training, led to improved water security and agricultural production, to market oriented reforms (micro- and small scale enterprise development) and to higher farmer incomes. Institutional development based on a Scheme Management Development Model took place at both farmer and at scheme management staff level. Water User Co-operatives of farmers with three main functions viz. (1) water distribution and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, (2) agricultural production and (3) marketing / business development were established and trained. Scheme Working Groups were developed, consisting of representatives of key government agencies and farmers who together plan and implement all scheme activities.",
