Her love for art was born out of her heritage: landscapes, sounds, ancestral re-manifestations, gospel, and spirited cultures of Home. She commends the ongoing cultural renaissance in Africa and the Diaspora. Many of her works showcase these visual cultures and aim to cultivate discourse about panafricanism, afrofuturism and social alchemy. As an intersectionalist, other subjects celebrate the resilience of women of color as healers, warriors, and creators. They strive to create and capture a retrospective alignment between the past, present and future, through diverse treatments of form and balance.",
