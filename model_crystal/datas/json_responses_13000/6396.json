    "summary": "As a high-capacity International Business Student at George Washington University with a deep enthusiasm for working within multicultural environments, I have developed communication skills that allow me to connect with people from different backgrounds on both a professional and human level. My drive to serve international markets has given me the opportunity to learn the importance of multicultural communication and diversity initiatives that advocate for continuous improvement within businesses and foundational relationships within the community. \n\nAs a young Congolese woman, I am passionate about the culture, history, and traditions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. My ethnically diverse background has driven me to grow my own background in working with different cultures within an international business landscape. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with people from all over the globe as the Vice President of Operation Smile Student Club DRC, raising funds to offer aid to medically disadvantaged residents within the Democratic Republic of Congo. As an Aquadroom Ambassador, I partnered with Belgian schools to raise money and supply a Congolese school with clean water. \n\nEnthusiastic to lead continuous improvement initiatives that create meaningful contributions within organizations and the local community, I am passionate about fostering innovative business development frameworks. I am fluent in English and French, with a basic proficiency in Spanish, which allows me to promote collaboration across language barriers within professional organizations. I am also able to maximize inclusion and work with people from diverse backgrounds, widening the range of impact across the organization. Throughout my professional and educational experience, I have developed a proven foundation in creating lasting, impact-oriented global business solutions within a culturally diverse landscape. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about me, my areas of specialization, or how I can be a resource, I\u2019d love to connect with you!\n",
