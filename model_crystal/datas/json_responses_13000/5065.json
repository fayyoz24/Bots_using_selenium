It allows to simplify the trading process and makes it cheaper. \n\nWe focused on building the core platform first, and only then we built the first service around it. The core platform includes many security layers. The service on top of the core platform allows customers to perform documents exchange and confirmations with customs. As a result, customs clearance became much faster and cheaper.\n\nBackend and some services were written with golang, and Solidity was used for smart contracts.\n\nTarget: Create a new application for logistics with a simplified interface for customs clearance and voyage tracking.\n\nAction: Together with another blockchain developer and backend team we built the whole new infrastructure, with a management dashboard and consumer services, and connected it to the British customs system.\n\nResult: I have successfully built a few frontends for the project, some of them were using API, and one of them is directly connected to the blockchain.\n\nStack:\nReactJS, NodeJS, SASS, TypeScript, Microservices, Git, Jira, Confluence, REST, Solidity",
