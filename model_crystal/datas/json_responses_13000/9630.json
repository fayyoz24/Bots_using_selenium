    "summary": "After nearly 40 years being employed in aviation and defense industry, I took the decision to start in August 2013 ABROK Consultancy. This business undertaking provides me with the possibility to offer my knowledge and experience as a self-employed consultant.\n\nProduct support, customer services and military logistics have been key words in my career. In all these fields I gained my experience in both operational and managerial positions. \n\nParticipation in the preparation and negotiation of several large-scale contracts (both B-to-B and B-to-G) is part of my track record. In those cases my contribution was focussed on through-life support issues as well as the individual elements being part of the overall logistic support (ILS). \n\nNext to this, the management and execution of contracts already in place, as far as support services/logistics, has been a major activity throughout my entire career. Besides this, the development of new, advanced support concepts combined with the analysis of associated business opportunities was a frequently, recurring theme. \n\n(Integrated) Logistic Support, including all individual elements being part of this, the underlying development process, as well as production and qualification of corresponding deliverables are keystones within my profession.",
