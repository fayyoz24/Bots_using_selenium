    "summary": "Koorosh Ameli, FCIArb., is an arbitrator and legal consultant in international legal disputes with over thirty years of experience in the field. He established Ameli International Arbitration in The Hague in 2010. A Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators since 1997, he is qualified in Iranian law and public international law and experienced in American law.\n\nHe began his career in 1981 when he left the United States for a position with the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. In the period 1981-2009, he was mainly arbitrator in treaty disputes between states and treaty based cases of expropriation of foreign investments and property rights, state contracts, construction and commercial contracts in defence, petroleum, telecommunication, housing, banking and other industries between US nationals and companies of one country against Iran and treaty or contract disputes between the two governments before the Tribunal.\n\nHe was also appointed as arbitrator in a number of ICC and ad hoc arbitration cases in petroleum and telecommunication industries since 1982, in one of which he was directly appointed by the ICC.\n\nSince his resignation from the Tribunal in 2009, he has been appointed as sole arbitrator by the LCIA in a DIFC-LCIA dispute in the petroleum industry, as a legal expert by international law firms such as Clifford Chance (Paris), DLA Piper (London and Paris), Salans/Dentons (London and Paris), King & Spalding (Washington and Paris) and other cases for claimants from Europe, Asia and Latin America on various issues of international business law and Iranian law in a number of major arbitration cases, including a BIT case and in some US  and European court cases, or as legal consultant in foreign investment, commercial transactions and legal due diligence matters in telecommunication, transportation, food and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nHe has also acted as co-counsel in two major PCA arbitration cases on behalf of the Claimants, Crescent Petroleum, along with international law firms, Three Crowns, and Gibson Dunn, securing a 2021 partial award of $2.4 billion in one case, and a 2020 award on termination in another case, also for Crescent, which paved the way for a much larger award on damages. Both cases are reported in the Global Arbitration Review and the Investment Arbitration Reporter.",
