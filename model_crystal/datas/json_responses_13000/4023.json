    "summary": "I'm a South Korean who grew up in Europe, seeking to combine both of my data science knowledge and finance/business background for the future career.\nAfter obtaining my BSc International Business Administration from Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, I worked as an analyst in bank accounting and financial accounting in a multinational company. During this time, I've automated many of the tasks within the department with self-taught programming skills and grew my passion in data science. I was also invited to be the main contact and contributor in the Budapest office to develop a self-service BI dashboard, ultimately leading me to obtain MSc Data Science and Advanced Analytics with business analytics specialization, Cum Laude, at NOVA IMS, Lisbon.\n\nI'm comfortable in multicultural environments as I grew up attending international schools. With various Model United Nations experiences, I've harnessed my communication and public speaking skills. Additionally, my military experience has trained me for working in high-pressure environments and to have high sense of responsibility. I speak near-native level English, and I've recently started learning Dutch.",
