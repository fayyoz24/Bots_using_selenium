The aim of the project was to analyze the influence of car to car communication to avoid traffic congestion. A simulator was developed which allowed importing an Open Street Map road network. Driving trajectories for individual cars have been generated by using mobile subscription data.\n\nTraffic jams cause a lot of waste of energy, time and money. Additionally, the environment suffers. Avoiding traffic jams is beneficial in many respects. A lot of traffic jams are caused by clearly identifiable situations (roadworks, accident,\u2026). In order to avoid an increase in the traffic jam, the instantaneous propagation of the information is crucial. Usually, such a situation is handled by giving a call to a broadcast station. This station broadcasts the traffic jam information after a while (typically up to 30 minutes). This delay helps the traffic jam to expand (area, number of involved vehicles). Another possibility to handle such a situation is to distribute the information instantaneously via car-to-car communication. Doing so can help to avoid an expansion of the traffic jam.\n\nDetailed achievements:\n\u2022  Generating driving trajectories for mobile subscribers\n\u2022  Assigning trajectories to cars in the simulator\n\u2022  Estimating the cell coverage area for the mobile network\n\u2022  Annotate trajectories with timing information from hand-over cell update.",
