    "summary": "Vulnerability is the birthplace of joy, creativity, and success. And I see business development as a stage where creativity shapes a plan and process. As an international business developer, I have worked on investment and trade projects in different countries, including China, Turkey, Kuwait, the UK, the USA and  Africa. During my career, I have achieved to realize the following dreams as follows:\n\u25cf I got a fully-funded master's degree program at Peking University in 2015.\n\u25cf I got awarded by Campinas University to present my term,\" Imperial Meritocracy,\" in 2017.\n\u25cf I published my master's dissertation in which I propounded the term \"Imperial Meritocracy\" in 2018.\n\u25cf China Desk Project of Kuwait Turk Participating Bank and increased Turkey-China trade of the bank by 4% in 2019.\n\u25cf Gained 322% of new lines and corporate relationships with China to Kuwait Turk Participating Bank in 2019, and Kuwait Turk became the first Turkish participating bank member of the Shanghai Gold Exchange.\n\u25cf In 2020, as Head of Marketing of ATN Energy and Foreign Trade Inc. Company, built new partnerships with the investment of an e-commerce project and exported Turkish cosmetics and food supplements with an e-commerce project to China.\n\u25cf In 2020, as the Head of Business Development and one of the Project Owner of PonteGold, I achieved to create the first stable gold-based coin in Turkey with my teammates at ATN Group Company. \n\u25cf In 2020, I achieved one of my dreams to be part of the main team of a fintech company belonging to the ATN Group. \nBeing in international trade, trade finance, and startup sectors gained me huge knowledge and know-how. While working in different roles in my career, I found myself finding innovative and attractive ways to do the same job. This is how I got into the fintech sector after I worked as an international banker and was busy learning Power BI and Big Data and Data Science. I built a project with my colleague with S&P and Fitch in 2019 which targeted digitalizing and innovating the international banking department.\nAs an amateur musician of santoor, baglama, duduk and Ableton, I regularly feed my vulnerability. To be able to strategize my dreams and goals regularly by playing \"go\" last ten years. Because if chess is a war, go is life.\nMy purpose is to connect and transfer the real financial tools to the innovative digital economy with financial technology.",
