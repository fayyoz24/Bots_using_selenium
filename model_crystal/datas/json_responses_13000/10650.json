    "summary": "I have always wanted to have children of my own, but of late I\u2019d been contemplating if this would be a fair or responsible decision - our planet isn\u2019t currently the most conducive environment, and pressing issues like climate change are only set to worsen in time. As a problem solver, I didn\u2019t want to just complain, give excuses, or resign myself to fate. It is our fundamental responsibility to leave a world for the future generations to thrive, and I am committed to taking actions to make our planet a better place.\n\nFor seven years I worked as an internal consultant in both the financial services and healthcare industries, working with C-suite executives to develop growth and transformation strategies. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the process of problem-solving, I realized the inherent inertia and structure of corporations is a limiting factor in how fast they can move and disrupt the norm.\n\nI wanted to have more ownership over the impact I create while being able to learn and contribute across the entire value chain. With that in mind, I took the leap to join Entrepreneur First, a highly selective deep technology incubator and co-founded pFIBRE. \n\nAt pFIBRE, we\u2019re developing fully biodegradable B2B packaging using plant-based materials. Our solution is aimed at reducing plastic waste, and the greenhouse gas emissions that come with their manufacturing and disintegration. We\u2019re hopeful that this will be a positive step forward towards a greener, more sustainable Earth.",

I have learnt that everybody wants to be heard, and I did just that \u2013 I listened. It is easier for people to speak to strangers, as there is hardly any fear of being judged. Empathizing with patients was more important; they did not seek sympathy. It was surprising how people opened up, shared, questioned, spoke and expressed grief.\nThe decision to work for six months at a hospital among patients waiting for their final moments, for me, was life changing. Patients and their families expressed gratitude and constantly appreciated the thought that went into it. I knew I found my purpose, to leave this world a better place, when I saw them smile despite the grim reality."
