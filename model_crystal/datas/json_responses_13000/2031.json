Leading and working on projects with direct impact on reservoir modeling ranging from Saturation evaluation (electrical, capillary pressure), Rock typing (core level, log recognition) to water flood performance in heterogenous carbonates. Since joining Shell, I have been involved in various research aspects falling under the broader Carbonate Rock typing effort.\nSpecifically on petrophysics, one explored research direction has been the saturation determination from electrical properties using Shell\u2019s in house effective medium theory model (Satori) for carbonates. In this direction a step forward has been made in applying SATORI where NMR data was not available by relying on MICP and showing what kind of variability can one expect in Formation Resistivity Factors upon maxing more than 2 pore systems [work published only internally].\nAnother explored research direction has been in the area of permeability prediction from MICP measurements leading to a new method that was shown to be independent of the Rock Type [1,2,3]. An important application of this work has been the proposed QC method for (micro)fracture detection in RCA plugs that is of a great importance for low porosity matrix characterization[4].\n[1]http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/abstracts/html/2011/annual/abstracts/Hulea.html\n[2]www.spwla-abudhabi.com/SPWLA_update2.doc\n[3]http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/content/96/9/1627.full?sid=b68b80a0-4ca6-46ff-9881-b84bb28e53ae\n[4]https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-164251-MS",

We find that the contact resistance can be as low as 100\u03a9cm with narrowly spread fluctuations. For comparison, we have also performed scaling experiments on similar gold-contacted devices, and found that the reproducibility of FETs with nickelelectrodes is largely superior. These results indicate that nickel is a very promising electrodematerial for the reproducible fabrication of low resistance contacts in organic FETs [1].\nAnother research direction has been focused on effects that are caused by the gate dielectric. To investigate these mechanisms, we have studied transport through organic single-crystal FETs with different gate insulators. We find that the temperature dependence of the mobility evolves from metallic-like to insulating-like with increasing dielectric constant of the insulator [2]..\n[1] http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/88/11/10.1063/1.2185632\n[2] http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v5/n12/abs/nmat1774.html",

For fully colored displays there are currently two options being examined. One involves the use of three di\ufb00erent polymers for the fundamental colors (red, green, blue). Hence the physical properties of the fundamental colors are independent of each other and for ink-jet printing the process has to be optimized for three di\ufb00erent types of ink. Dye doping is a promising way of improving the spectral purity of the LEDs without changing the viscosity of the polymer. \nChapter 5 is dedicated to the density of states and hole mobility in PPV. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the temper- ature dependence of the carrier mobility in polymers. The models attempting to explain it, need as an input the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) which was often assumed to be either Gaussian or exponential. Using an electrochemically gated transistor, we achieved controlled and reversible doping of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) in a large concentration range. Our data open a wide energy-window view on the DOS and show that the core of the DOS function is Gaussian,",
