Further, nothing and no one has reached their full potential \u2013 as a product, business, or natural resource or as a person.\n\nDevelopment of living-systems thinking capability and management of one\u2019s own state of being and will can endlessly advance intentional evolution and the expression of each living system\u2019s potential.
