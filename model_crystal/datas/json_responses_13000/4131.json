    "summary": "Currently as Senior Business Development Manager at Kepler Interactive, I source, negotiate, close and maintain relationships with partners ensuring appropriate business terms. While collaborating closely with the Kepler leadership team, studio heads and our subsidiaries, I support formulating strategy, planning, and execution of new business opportunities. \n\nPreviously at Utomik, as Partner Manager, I generated connections and developed fruitful business relationships between Utomik platform and various game developers and publishers. Managing key accounts, such as Thunderful Publishing, Modus Games, Headup Games, Team 17 and more, I took care of content acquisition, internal and external coordination regarding integration, releases, marketing activities and more for the majority of indie titles. Furthermore, to maintain the optimal content portfolio, I managed performance data reporting and other data analysis projects. \n\nI have an academic background in New Media and Digital Culture where I developed strong analytical skills using digital tools. From digital gaming and motion pictures to political discussions on social media, I conducted multiple research projects and I still am very passionate in looking into digital entertainment contents in a data standpoint. \n\nI speak English, Korean and Japanese fluently and has been always working and studying in a multi-lingual environment. With a number experience as a translator and interpreter, I am a skilled communicator in a multi-cultural environment. \n\nLastly, I am deeply passionate about making the game industry more kind to the minority and vibrant creativity and have been delivering the message through public speaking.",
