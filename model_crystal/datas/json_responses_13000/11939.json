    "summary": "Olga is the founder of BrandAide, a consultancy building beautiful brands scientifically primed for sustainable growth. Uniting art, science, and business expertise to build brands that excel.\n\nStrategically applying key principles of neuroscience to all elements of the brand building ecosystem, BrandAide\u2019s unique methodology is proven to hyper-excite consumers\u2019 brains to achieve sustainable growth. Anticipating and acting on buyers\u2019 (sub)conscious wants and needs, so your brand becomes their instinctual preference. By understanding the human mind, we create brand building activities that influence consumer choice. Crafting experiences, products, and businesses that stand out, are easy to process, and drive strong emotional connections with customers. \n\nPrior to founding BrandAide, Olga was Design and Brand Experience Leader for Procter & Gamble\u2019s Global Prestige Beauty, Fragrances, and Hair Care portfolios. She was a driving, visionary force enabling growth for iconic beauty and luxury brands. \n\nHer most remarkable P&G legacy is her study of over 100 iconic brands, synthesizing the fundamentals of their success to apply these to turning brands around. Combining this with her expertise in cognitive science, she incorporated key drivers of human attention, memory, emotion, and decision-making into the brand portfolio.  \n\nOlga's passion for capability-building led to the creation of P&G\u2019s Eye On Beauty, a bespoke mobile app to elevate the beauty eye, mind, and craft of the organization. An inspiring, indulgent, personalized, and convenient tool to foster a growth mindset, promote collective intelligence, and make employees\u2019 unique knowledge accessible to others. \n\nPrior to P&G, Olga was Design Director for Glamour Magazine (Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications) in New York. \n\nAs a pioneer in the application of Cognitive Science to Brand Building, Olga lectures internationally on the subject. She is the author of \u201cAn Eye for Color,\u201d analyzing the finest color usage in art, design, fashion, and nature. Her work has appeared in major design publications, featured in exhibits in the USA, Korea, and Spain, and won numerous international awards. \n\nOlga was a Professor at the Pratt Institute in New York for over 10 years, teaching graduate students in Visual Communication, Packaging, Typography, and Editorial Design. \n\nCreative & Brand Executive | Brand Building | Brand Experience | Design & Product Innovation | Visual Communication | Advertising | App Development | Social & Ecommerce Platforms | Retail Architecture | Publishing | Editorial | UX Design | Design Thinking",
