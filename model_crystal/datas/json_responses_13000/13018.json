    "summary": "I have a strong background in photography and photojournalism, and a passion for photographic and visual literacy education. I have over a decade of experience working alone and with international teams, as well as with large institutions in Europe and East Africa, to envision, design, fund, realise, manage, produce, monitor and evaluate diverse cultural projects, often in resource-limited environments. I am the founder of the Uganda Press Photo Award and FOTEA, and I have developed both into sustainable organisations that have a strong presence both in the region and internationally. With a background in cultural policy and arts management, as well as a wealth of practical expertise gained from running a prominent photographic platform, I regularly collaborate to produce events, exhibitions, books and educational programs across borders, boundaries, languages and cultures. I frequently nominate, serve as a jury member and review portfolios for initiatives including the Joop Swart Masterclass, CAP Prize, FORMAT International Photography Festival and Belfast Photo Festival. I\u2019m currently based in The Hague.",

These include the Uganda Press Photo Award, the East African Photography Award, the Young Photographers\u2019 Award and the Young Photographer Mentorship Programme. Alongside this FOTEA also organises photography and video workshops, portfolio reviews, public discussions, exhibitions and film screenings. Through this work we are committed to building a networked photographic community in East Africa. Outside of the UPPA, FOTEA focuses on visual education and works with students and early-career professionals and engages them as partners, encouraging them to look beyond the boundaries of the established media ecosystem and to develop ideas and approaches which address issues which they\u2019re passionate about through photography. \n\nWe believe that our collaborators have the right to shape and diversify the narratives of their societies, countries and continent, and that by equipping them with the tools to critically engage with the wider world we help them to build better futures. We also firmly believe in the downstream benefits of visual literacy and the essential nature of good visual education. People who can\u2019t read images will always struggle to engage critically with them, and good journalism is as much about how it\u2019s read as how it\u2019s written.\n\nWe are passionate about collaborations and are always looking for new partners from around and outside of the African continent.",
