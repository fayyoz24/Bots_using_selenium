    "summary": "Starting out as an electrician, I always worked my way up from the bottom. Each chapter was a valuable learning experience that helped me write a successful story. Today, as Director Operations, I lead a growing team of 25 people who are responsible for monitoring both critical and non-critical hardware at Digital Realty\u2019s Brussels campus.\nWhat we do? Everything from watering the plants in the garden and changing light bulbs to maintaining the data center and making sure that our customers\u2019 products are always running. Because our activities are so multidisciplinary, it would be easier to describe what my team is not responsible for \u2013 the answer is sales, finance and HR.\nBased on my personal experience, leading by example makes you more compelling as a leader. When something needs to be done urgently, I am not afraid to put on my work pants and do it myself. It also fits with my proactive approach that encourages me to always stay one step ahead. Instead of waiting to see if something will become a problem, I like to grab the bull by the horns and tackle it. Of course, this is particularly important in a data center where the smallest issue can have huge consequences.\nIn my private life, you often find me at events with vintages tractors. In fact, I own two antique tractors myself. Both professionally and personally, my passion is to explore new areas and learn new things.",
