    "summary": "Experienced Consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the oil & energy industry. Skilled in Petroleum geology and geophysics through seismic interpretation, with a special interest in Seismic Attributes and AvO and a passion -and track record- for coaching our new generation of subsurface specialists. Strong consulting professional with a Mr science in geophysics, physics and computer sciences from University of Utrecht. \n\nEstablished the 'SeismicO' company in 2018 as a vehicle for short term consult & assurance on critical elements of the seismic interpretation workflow.\n\nAfter drilling, seismic data is often the single biggest operational investment. Do you monetise all of that intrinsic value in your seismic data? In order to extract maximum value, is the data in shape? Have your staff looked into it\u2019s AvO potential? Is your local earth response in the seismic data adequately calibrated and understood through well ties? \n\nMy 35 years of experience in the energy industry as subsurface specialist, trainer and coach, might just help lift your staff and project to the next higher level!\n\n",

Supervised the 3D seismic processing. Subsequent 'Operational Seismology' actively supported intense Yibal development drilling -5 rigs each summer, 3 consecutive years- with location generation and screening on seismic structure and attributes in close co-operation with reservoir engineers, geologists and petrophysicists. Direct, if not driving force, involvement (quote from team leader farewell speech) in the drilling of some 120 wells, often under tight time-constraints, on target zones away from faults and water fingers as defined from 3D seismic.\nMeasurably reduced drilling risk from shallow gas (gas kicks upon mud losses in faults) resulted from work on overburden fault interpretation in close contact with drilling department on optimum well trajectories. This initial 3D effort on Yibal increased reserves with about 100 million bbl and resulted in the drilling of 'smart wells' with on average 30% better than forecasted production performance through targeting bypassed oil pockets and avoiding water conducting faults.\nI  pushed for  advanced borehole geophysics; uphole surveys in Al Huwaisah, VSP campaigns in Yibal and Al Huwaisah. The former in preparation for 3D seismic calibration to wells in various field compartments, the latter in support of a flank appraisal drilling campaign\nSeismic facies mapping from 2D seismic and accurate depth conversion under sabkah conditions, incorporating uphole surveys and Landsat data, of the Al Huwaisah Field.",
