    "summary": "The energy sector is going through a critical transition: shifting to a renewables based system while remaining reliable and affordable. As an energy professional, my goal is to help organizations and governments navigate the complex and rapidly-evolving landscape of decarbonised energy systems. \n\nWith experiences in consulting, utility and start-up companies, I have developed expertise in energy markets, clean energy tech, renewable financing, generation and transmission techno-economic analysis, modelling and analytical skills. I had broad project exposures on net-zero energy systems, assets transactions, electricity forecasting models and European/US energy markets.\n\nWith an international work/academic background, I have developed a strong ability to approach experiences, people, and opportunities with an open and adaptable mindset. \n\nExpertise/specialities:\n- Energy field (Generation, Storage, Transmission, Distribution)\n- Energy Markets, Policies and Regulation (EU/US)\n- Energy Distributed Assets (PV, Battery Storage)\n- Renewables Energy Financing\n- Electric Vehicle / Grid Interactions",
