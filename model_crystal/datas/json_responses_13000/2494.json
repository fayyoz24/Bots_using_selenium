    "summary": "Structural engineer with strong affinity to architecture. I prefer to work in multi-disciplinary teams to achieve a common goal. The structural design should support the vision of the architect and should not always be hidden. Since the structure defines part of the character of the building and is more durable than for example the facade or floor plan. Especially in renovations and refurbishments new opportunities arise to reinvent or even enhance the structure.",

The novel solution studied in this project is called IRWES (Integrated Roof Wind Energy System). IRWES uses its shape and geometry to not only to increase its efficiency in terms of energy generated, but also to blend into the architecture of the building and surrounding. IRWES consists of a series of louvers on each side, a curved internal dome, four internal walls dividing the funnels, and a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) in the centre, all enclosed by a roof top. A number of radial distributed inlet ducts guide and accelerate the incoming wind flow with their skewed shape, to strike the VAWT located at the internal top of the roof. The configuration of the structure enables electricity generation from wind coming from any direction.\nThis thesis addresses the design of the first pilot unit of IRWES, to be constructed on top of an existing high rise building. The goals of the project were: \nI) Define a suitable building for the design, construction and testing of IRWES; \nII) Evaluate the loading pattern to which IRWES would be subjected; \nIII) Design the structural components of IRWES.",
