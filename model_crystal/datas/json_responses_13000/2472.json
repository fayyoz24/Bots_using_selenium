    "summary": "ABOUT ME /  OVER MIJ /  SOBRE M\u00cd /\n\nPhotography. It is my way. Every picture is a story and a reality on its own. Photographing is my way to tell my stories and to create and express my reality. Personal, pure and human, that is how I like my photography. It is my love as well as my profession.\n\nI was a kid, only six years old, and I was given an enticing present by my grandfather ~ Cornelis Wairata ~ . This present, which would stay with me forever, was my first camera. Ever since, I have been making photographs. A passion for life\u2026..\nAt the age of 21 I started to be a professional photographer. For 10 years I was making my photographs for a living and then decided to do a study: Creative Photography at the Academy of Photography in Amsterdam. And why? Ha, I do invite you to ask me\u2026.\n\nAlways looking for new challenges, but drawn in particular towards making portraits and photo reports. The main reason? I am just in love with art and theatre\u2026.\n\nBesides, I have a pronounced interest in symbolism and geometry; natural shapes you can find all throughout nature.\n \nI love to play\u2026.. like a child\u2026.as pure as it gets\u2026\n \nI love to play with the ideas people come up with. Especially when there is room to experiment. Room to create a new reality together.\n\n \n\u201c The model defines the portrait \u201d\n\n\n>>> OVER MIJ /  SOBRE M\u00cd /   >>> www.michaelb.nl",
