    "summary": "I am a goal getter that have not been  restricted to my main educational  qualification but thrived in any business venture that picked my interest hence I described myself as Investor, Entrepreneur and Facilitator. \n\nCreativity is my strongest point, for this reason technology supplies captured my interest with deep passion that it became my first set up company. It gave me that ability to make conventional technology unconventional (obsolete or contemporary). \n\nThe first ever Interactive touch screen installed in MTN Nigeria both at Aromire(Reception) and The Plaza HR department was installed by H3oMT in 2011 and 2012 respectively when this technology was relatively new to the world. This was my initiative which I proposed to the organisation and I was offered a proof of concept purchase order due to the fact that no one within the organisation had seen such except in science fiction films. Thus I funded it myself and was reimburse when it was installed and functioning properly as they envisaged. This depicts our role as a pioneer in technological innovation.\n\nWe have gone on to supply innovative technological corporate gift to big organisations around African continent; \nLG  Kenya\nDulux Nigeria \nNIC Bank Kenya \nCBA Bank Kenya \nLiquid Telecom UK\nLiquid Telecom Kenya \nChase Bank Kenya \nEtisalat Nigeria just to mention few. \n\nWe live in an ever evolving world and H3omt has come to realise that a company can also generate passive income by investing in other business sectors infusing our technological means to enhance productivity. We are currently working with few companies in the following business sectors; \nAgribusiness\nReal Estate\nBusiness Consulting Services\nLogistics Services. \n\nWe also invest in other companies that aligns our interest and add value to our business, investors and service users. Our investment capacity are in any of the three categories which generally are:\nMinority passive (less than 20% ownership)\nMinority active (20%-50% ownership)\nControlling interest (over 50% ownership)\n\nThe above exhibits the description of myself as an Investor, Entrepreneur and a  Facilitator.",
