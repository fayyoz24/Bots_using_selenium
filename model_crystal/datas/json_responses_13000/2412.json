    "summary": "I am honored to be employed at the Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (DTETI), Faculty of Engineering, UGM as a junior lecturer. I currently take a 4-year academic leave to pursue my Ph.D. degree at the Delft University of Technology. My main task was leading a team of 5 master students in conducting research on content filtering, a project funded by Ministry of Communication and Information of Republic of Indonesia. I also had the opportunity to organize several academic conferences and seminars, held by DTETI UGM.\n\nMy main passion is conducting research in the area of Geometry Processing, specifically in reduced method to allow interactive processing and analysis of surface information (functions, vector fields, n-RoSy fields, or tensor fields) in generously tesselated polygon mesh. \n\nPreviously, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Information technology at Universitas Gadjah Mada. I then went to South Korea to pursue my master degree in 3D Modeling and Processing group at Seoul National University (Seoul), where I have the honor to learn and be supervised by Prof. Kim Myung-Soo. \n \nOutside of my academic life, I like to contribute to society and to inspire others. I was Secretary-General of IMUSKA and KMI South Korea (both are Indonesian organizations in South Korea). I also frequently give motivational and inspiring talks in student events, held by numerous universities within and outside Yogyakarta. ",
