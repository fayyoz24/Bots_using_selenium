The projects could go as far as actually going to the market. However,  due to multiple other projects running, my idea has not been brought to the market at the moment.  \n\n My innovative idea was called ''Smart Wardrobes'' and consisted of two products.\nThe first product is an app that would allow users to easily catalog their clothes in one place. Moreover, the app would be designed to allow users to find their clothes via their cameras. The app is made affordable for the masses through in-app advertisements. The second product was an expansion pack for the app and was a smart mirror where users could see their saved outfits on themselves in real-time.",

The areas are called: Anthropology, Culture, Earth Sciences, Geopolitics & History, and Technology.\n\nTo test one's knowledge of these areas, various projects were put in place. For example, 3 essays had to be written with either 2 or more of the areas covered to see if students could explain how they are interconnected. For this project I wrote the following essays: \n- How would Germany have developed politically if the First World War never happened?\n- Artificial ways to impact climate change\n- How to make data objective and inclusive\n\nIf there is interest in reading any of the essays, feel free to reach out. \n\nOne of the other projects was creating a product of choice which covers at least 4 of the 5 areas. For this project I decided to go with the following topic: 'Technology is the gateway towards achieving the four sustainability pillar goals'. The project was called 'The age of awareness' and is expressed through a website. The project follows how technology can be used in the various sustainability pillars and how it impacts the SDG goals.",

Next to that, it became clear that if you want to be inclusive to people with a disability one must start with him/herself. \n\nA memorable quote from this congress was:\n\" Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance.\" ",
