As I have lived in two countries working in four languages, I'm able to draw on my international experience and education to achieve a meeting of minds and to establish trust. In fact, it's what I thrive on.\n\nI'm equally at home in academic, prestigious and disadvantaged environments. For me, it's about using my talents to bring people together. For me, language is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Although I'm well qualified academically in translation, my strengths are in analysis and resolution.",

I designed this project together with a colleague, created its content and was one of its organisers.\n\n2. Raising awareness of the shifting barbed-wire borders being installed on Georgian territory by Russia: also as a consequence of the 2008 war, Georgia found itself facing (and still does) the ongoing encroachment of the Russian \"border\", causing a creeping loss of territory and splitting farms and villages in half. Again, in this case I was the content creator and organiser. We installed symbolic barbed wire in the main hall in the Embassy and exhibited photographs of the affected area of Georgia.\n\n3. A charity fundraising event to gain support for Tbilisi Zoo after its devastating flooding.",

I have had the joy of working in this field professionally since I graduated from that field at Georgia's best university.\n\nIt's not often appreciated in the West how essential it is to the life of small nations to be able to communicate accurately across borders. For countries like Georgia, with a small population and a unique language, translation and interpreting is a way of life and a valued skill so that we can share our experiences and needs across borders. Otherwise, our businesses and public services would suffer greatly from isolation. For this reason, I feel a lifelong commitment to provide accurate translations of important documents and to interpret well in key encounters between Georgians and foreigners.\n\nI have translated in various combinations between the four languages that I speak natively or near-natively: Georgian, Russian, Dutch and English. My commissions have included local government (Municipality of Beverwijk), national government (Georgian Embassy in the Netherlands), national media (NTR News), law firms (BOHLER), and medical practices (Amsterdam Medical Centre).",

I researched, translated and analysed information regarding Georgia in the Netherlands for the Ambassador and for his head office, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThis often involved rapid responses to fake news and resulted in high-impact pieces to correct the record in the Dutch press. In the other direction, my job involved me facilitating the work of the Georgian Consul-General at the Embassy when she was having trouble contacting the right person in Dutch officialdom in order to serve Georgian citizens in the Netherlands.\n\nI also undertook some fulfilling and valuable social projects during this time (see under Accomplishments below).\n\nI managed the Embassy\u2019s online presence during these years.",
