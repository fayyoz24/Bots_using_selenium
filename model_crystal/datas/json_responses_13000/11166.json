    "summary": "| Software Mobility Technologist | Always Curious | Always up for a Challenge | Always bigger picture Focus |  \n\nYou can do two things when something is annoying: either accept it or try to do something about it. I choose the latter. Time is precious and standing still in traffic is not what I like to do. \n\nMy career so far is about improving mobility together, fighting traffic and coming up with smart solutions to increase the efficient usage of our modes of transportation. While the climate is changing and the need for people to be on the move, more than ever there is a need for intelligent transportation solutions.\nAs a Director Business Development in the field of smart mobility, specialising in traffic management, public-private partnerships, ITS software development and who\u2019s passionate about finding solutions for mobility challenges this is an exiting time. We must strive to solve a huge social problem that affects almost all of us on the planet. We can do this with the enormous amount of crowd-sourced data by turning that into information and tools that can help find solutions to improve mobility.  \n\nWith +20 years of experience in the mobility ecosystem in various roles, such as Adviser Traffic Management, Senior Product Manager, Sales Director Realtime and currently Director Business Development my team and I are helping all sorts of mobility stakeholders to ease their lives during their daily commute, professional business or traffic management. I'm convinced that no single organization has the ultimate solution and so partnerships in this ecosystem are crucial. \n\nI thrive on innovation in mobility, creating valuable partnerships, leading teams and people into the future of transportation and mobility, thinking excellence, capacity building and academic research. I aim to understand the unique problems each one faces, love to support people and organizations in developing new ideas and strategies, delivering better transport solutions and finding safer and more prosperous solutions, on a local regional, national or global scale in order to share experiences and knowledge.",

The ITS software solution will seamlessly integrate all the currently separate road sub-systems making the RMC the central hub of all monitoring, operation and management within Qatar.\n\nPTV Group will provide software for micro simulation and traffic forecasting. PTV will collect available GPS data and extract speeds that can be used for simulation and real-time and mid-term forecasts, for the whole Qatar network. PTV software will also be used to calculate Estimated Time of Arrivals (ETA) of public transport services at stops, as well as transfer alerts on stops where transfer time exceeds given threshold, due to delays. Software programmes that will be used for this project are PTV Optima, PTV Visum and PTV Vissim.\n\nThe project brings together world leaders in technology with proven expertise in their respective fields worldwide to accomplish the challenging and ambitious project, with SWARCO and KBAS responsible for delivering the project with sub-contractors PTV Group, Transpo Group, Qmic and Mannai Trading Co. L.L.C.\n\nThis exciting and innovative project will ensure smooth performance and management of the road networks in Qatar following the final delivery of software. Moreover, it will leave a legacy in the form of an Innovation Centre which will be developed as part of the solution, which will be connected to the core RMC software for development and testing for future technologies, and for training purposes.",

Most people do not know about the important role of dispatchers who direct emergency response cars to help the people who have called the dispatch centre for help. Operators play a key role in making sure cars are dispatched and reach the incident destination on time avoiding traffic congestion delays. We worked with PTV Group to implement PTV Optima and PTV Hyperpath softwares to optimise response time to emergencies by dispatch vehicles.\u201d\n\nAndrea Petti, Managing Director, PTV Group Middle East, India and Africa, says: \u201cOur software helps authorities with real-time traffic situational awareness, traffic forecast and route optimization to allow emergency vehicles to reach the emergency site as soon as possible. Using the software, they can track locations, calculate distances and provide the operators with the relevant estimated time of arrival.\u201d",
