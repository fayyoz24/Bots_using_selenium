This is a prerequisite to meet the target of Global Goal 6: universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030. \n\nThe partnership is part of the Dialogue and Dissent policy framework of Minister Lilianne Ploumen in which 25 alliances together with the Ministry will strengthen the capacity of civil society organisations in \u2018lobbying and advocacy\u2019 in low- and low-middle income countries. The focus on lobbying and advocacy is important for civil society to be able to hold governments and companies to account for contributing to inclusive growth and help reduce inequality.\n\nWatershed will be implemented at international level and in six countries: Kenya, Uganda, Mali, Ghana, Bangladesh, and India. In these countries the partnership will strengthen the capacities of national civil society to make the voice of customers heard to government and the private sector to ensure they respect the human rights to water and sanitation as well as sustainable management of water resources for future generations. A strong civil society is essential to hold service providers and governments to account. This will contribute to measurable improvements in the quality and sustainability of WASH services.\n\nThis partnership creates a great opportunity for the participating organisations to join their forces, use their knowledge and expertise in lobbying and advocacy to make the voice of civil society heard.",

Namely:\n\nGoal 1 Sector adoption of a service delivery approach. IRC equips local governments and service providers with knowledge and tools to sustain the delivery of water and sanitation services. By conducting action research and influencing policy and decision makers, IRC improves reliability and sustainability.\n\nGoal 2 Sector adoption of a learning and adaptive approach: A learning and adaptive approach is essential because climate, economies, demographics, and people's needs and expectations are constantly changing. Making services sustainable means identifying business, technological and financial models that work in the context of a country or region. IRC promotes learning, adoption and ownership of innovation for all stakeholders.\n\nGoal 3 Improved aid effectiveness: Truly effective aid delivers more benefits with less waste. When aid is channelled through a country's sector budget and harmonised with national plans, with the government taking the lead, institutions can operate and maintain water and sanitation services into the future. IRC lobbies stakeholders to embrace the principles of aid effectiveness and supports governments' efforts to provide strong, clear leadership.\n\nGoal 4 Improved inter-sectoral dialogue and planning alignment: IRC promotes learning and dialogue about the contextual issues of water resource management, climate change, WASH in schools and multiple-use systems for economic development \u2013 all of which are paramount in the post-MDG discussions.",

WASHCost can count amongst its achievements:\n- Helping to shape the post-MDG debate;\n- Influencing the approaches of several major donors and some planned investments;\n- Making significant contributions to the cost dialogue in the four focus countries, in particular in Ghana;\n- Developing a methodology for assessing costs now being applied in at least eight other countries;\n- Developing a training facility which has already trained more than 1000 people from 91 countries; establishing a strong WASHCost network; and\n- Producing an extraordinary array of 176 quality publications.\"  \n\nFor complete external project evaluation: http://www.ircwash.org/news/washcost-end-project-evaluation",
