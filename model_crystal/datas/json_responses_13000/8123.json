The question was how to improve the protection against flooding in the Netherlands. Our concept is to invest in resillience rather than just protection against flooding. This is achieved by creating a concsiousness within the Dutch community of the inherent risks that come with living below sea level. This is done along 3 themes: concsiousness, reinforcment and cooperation. The ideas are relatively easy to implement as they connect to existing networks and infrastructure rather than creating new. The concept was credited for its innovation in its thinking and the possibility to implement the measures on a short term.\n\n ",

Now the village, by mouth of an association of residents has expressed a wish to establish an irrigation scheme to facilitate commercial crop production.  Standardized irrigation design practices, or blueprints, are deemed unsuitable for the local context. Whether larger irrigation schemes or for the small rural villages, a system needs to be adapted and designed to suit the local conditions. So farmers need to develop, together with scholars and professionals, an approach for developing an irrigation system. But the process which will bring them from A to B is still unclear. To actually build an irrigation scheme requires several types of infrastructural artifacts such as canals, division structures, a diversion structure and/or a pump. Besides this a management system must be in place to take care of maintaining the infrastructure and operating the system as well as tackling any conflicts. As of yet there is little knowledge on what options are open to the farmers, what options are desirable and feasible. Furthermore it is unclear  how to assess these criteria or how to approach the design process and to which end. This research hopes to contribute to this lack of understanding by actively engaging in the design processes. ",

This report is the result of that research and it's goal is to give the SASOL foundation, a NGO which is focussed on developmentcooperation, advice on how to proceed with their  MPC-South project and to show other students a brief look into an internship abroad. The SASOL foundation started  a project which was named MPC-South, they want to construct demonstration farms and training centers there. Water is needed for all of the employees, trainees and livestock and the project area is located in one of the most arid parts of Kenya. Therefore SASOL asked Water management team 172 to conduct research into:\n\n-The properties of 5 predetermined build locations for sand dams in the seasonal stream, which borders the project area. The research contains topics such as geology, stream configuration, material availability, site accessibility and bank condition.Furthermore for each of the five sites a initial spillway  was designed.\n \n- A pipeline for connecting the sand dams to the area where the offices, demo farms and training centres are to be built. \n\n- The possibility of catching rainwater on roofs and subsequently storing it for further use within MPC-South. \n\n\nAs Edukans/Ex-Change have a strong focus on educating of the Kenyan students with whom a Dutch students works, I trained the Kenyan students in the use of a theodolite, which was required for the pipeline and spillway design cases and gave instructions on how to calculate possible harvestable water from roofs and the spillways using the Manning formula.",

When a road or embankment needs to be constructed on such a low load bearing soil several problems present themselves. Settlement problems, building time, building costs, O&M costs. These all depend on the technique for constructing the embankment. Therefore we did research into the optimal embankment for a low load bearing soil type through a case study, a newly build road between Hoek van Holland and Westerlee. This research looks into what options are available for engineers when it comes to creating an embankment, this included tried and tested methods but also newly developed methods such as Smartsoils. We looked at these methods through different glasses, or in other words we made a multi-criteria analysis where for different weight sets, representing different stakeholders, we could look at the opinions of these different stakeholders on the techniques. We then used this as input for our modelling exercise. The results from how a road could be built, was then input for a cost calculation but now focussing on lifecyclecosts instead of building costs, which is traditionally done. We concluded that a more expensive technique with less O&M does not weigh up to a cheaper building method with more O&M.",
