This school currently depends solely on a open dug well to meet all their needs, but in 2015 and 2016, the area experienced a drought. The well water could not meet their needs and this forced the school to decrease water use for 3 months each year and buy water when the supply got too low. Our team is analysing how to make the water system more sustainable by reducing runoff and harvesting rainwater. In July we will travel as a team to the school and orphanage to share our ideas and implement the solutions. ",
