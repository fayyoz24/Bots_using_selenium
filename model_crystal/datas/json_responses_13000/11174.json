    "summary": "Promoting health and equitable health systems has been the driving force of my career in the Netherlands, Europe and globally for more than 25 years. From my first position at the World Health Organization (WHO), I have worked as expert and manager in the health sector in various countries and settings. In my backpack is a university education supplemented with knowledge and experience in the field of policy and management of health systems, strategic and operational planning incl. financing, information management and logistics processes (\u201csupply chain\u201d), investment in health and intersectoral cooperation, education / training, monitoring and evaluation, and (valorisation of) research. Feedback from (co-) managers and colleagues also consistently shows that I am an excellent networker and that I function well in the field of policy, research, education and practice.\n\nI planned a 6-9 months sabbatical period from March 2020 onwards for travel, sports and reflection but the COVID-19 situation intervened. I am available for a new assignment!  ",
