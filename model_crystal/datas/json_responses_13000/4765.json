    "summary": "\u2022\u00a0RESOLVING CONFLICT - RESTORING CONNECTION\n\n- As a Conflict Resolution Facilitator I create environments of trust and respect. I help stuck negotiating parties re-engage in dialogue to move from frustrating compromises to empowered win-win solutions. \n\n- After 30 years experience I am considered a thought leader in European law enforcement.\n\n- Increasingly complex threats need a different kind of policing.  Most common approaches only focus on increasing budget, staff count, skill level and equipment.\n\n- I believe that a deeper understanding of our connectedness as one humanity fosters international cooperation based on trust and common goals.\n\n-  Internal power struggles and trust issues amongst competing national interests often hinder the effectiveness of policing. As a Conflict Resolution Facilitator I bring awareness to these issues.\n\n\u2022 WHAT DIFFERENTIATES ME FROM OTHER CONFLICT RESOLUTION FACILITATORS? \n\n- In nearly all my roles in the European Law Enforcement over the last 3 decades I'm known as a 'bridge builder' - as someone who can bring people and often disparate opinions and points of view together. \n\n- My sensitivity for the individuals' needs alongside the organisational road maps has allowed me to facilitate fast and surprising turnarounds in often difficult, stuck environments. \n\n- This is not only a gift or an instinct, it is something I've consciously honed and strengthened over the years through studies not only in traditional organisational change management but also in psychology and personal development. \n\n- This still novel approach of honouring not only the mind, but also the body (physicality) and emotions makes my work very effective and creates repeatable and predictable results, respecting equally the emotional wellbeing of the individuals and teams alongside the organisation's interests.\n\n\u2022 SPECIALIST TOOLS THAT DEFINE MY WORK & APPROACH \n\n- Organisational and Cultural Change (Office of Government Commerce, UK)\n- Business Analysis (Requirement Engineering and Business Models)\n- Senior Process Manager (Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderungsinstitut Wien, ISO Norm)\n- Programme Management for Transformational Change (Office of Government Commerce, UK)\n- Project Management (Office of Government Commerce, UK)\n- Portfolio and Risk Management (Office of Government Commerce, UK)\n\n- Journey Life Coach (Transformational Conscious Coaching Model after K. Billett)\n- Constellations for Organisations (Bert Hellinger Institute, NL)\n- Brennan Healing Science Practitioner \n- Journey Practitioner\n- EsenciArt (Body/Mind Work)",
