    "summary": " Nature Based Carbon Removal Credits bring life! \n\nWe represent entrepreneurs who, while operating their business activities, simultaneously remove carbon from the atmosphere while at the same time helping companies to reduce their CO2 emissions.\nThe goal? To reverse global warming, allow our planet to heal and create life!\n\nI have been working in the field of various forms of sustainability for over 20 years. with the aim of creating win-win relationships between the fortunate and less fortunate, the wealthy and the less wealthy. This symbiotic relationship benefits everyone, and above all our planet.\n\nThis passion drove me to co-founding Outdoor Albania, where I helped local isolated farmers in rural mountains to create an income by hosting tourists. \nAmong other benefits it gave me the opportunity to help local tourism suppliers to gain access to selling their tourism services on the internet.\n\nI remember a conversation I had with a rural self-sustainable farmer who lived in a small village in Northern Albania and how I tried to explain what the internet was. \u201cLike an invisible book with pages in the air, which everyone with a computer can read\u201d  \n\nSo, when I was asked by Climate Cleanup if I wanted to join their mission in reversing climate change, It didn't take me long to decide to join them and contribute to their mission;\n\n\u201cRemoving CO2 from the atmosphere by doubling nature\u201d- It\u2019s as simple as that!\n\nAlmost the same as the times when I was trying to inform local Albanian farmers what the internet was, after all this entire voluntary carbon market hasn't been around for a long time. And many people need help with understanding these concepts. We are helping to do this.\n\nAll our projects are accredited by ONCRA, store carbon and create additional benefits related to the millennium development goals. \n\nIf you would like to know more on suitable projects for your nature based carbon credit purchases while being able to establish a personal relationship with these entrepreneurs or just get a better understanding between Onsets or Offsets I would love to connect.\n\n\nFeel free to contact me!",
