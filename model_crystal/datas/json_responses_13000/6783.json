During 7 months I investigated the interactions and influences between international (cross-cultural) project management and the implementations of sustainability. Sustainability in the context of the research is limited to actions related to LEED. \nThe reason for my research topic is that there is hardly any information available on the effects of cross-cultural management in international construction projects (such as the Mall of Egypt) implementing a sustainable certification scheme and the ways that incorporating these types of management can support the implementation of sustainable certification schemes. This led to the following research question: will the execution of international construction projects such as the MOE in Egypt benefit from taking cultural differences into account when drafting plans for LEED? The aim of the Thesis project is to provide BOJV with key issues in the execution of LEED projects in Egypt by incorporating cultural differences into the project sustainable certification process.\nCurrently I am in the final steps of writing the thesis.\n\nDuties\t\n\u2022\tObserve the BOJV LEED team and the people they work with\n\u2022\tAttend meetings of the BOJV LEED Team\n\u2022\tEstablish a timeline of LEED related actions at MOE, specified for BOJV\n\u2022\tReview project documentation, drawings and uploaded documentation from LEED Online\n\u2022\tInterview people on the project for their experiences with LEED\n\u2022\tMeet with the BOJV LEED Consultant, the client and others for their thoughts on LEED at MOE\n\u2022\tAttend site visits to inspect LEED related on site\n\u2022\tAssist in writing reports & verifying specifications of materials",

This calculation sheet provides building specific investment- \t& return costs and the added value on the energy label of residential areas per material. \n\u2022\tLearned how to work with the programs AutoCAD & Sketchup in order to create project \tsketches\n\u2022\tHouse visit for several renovation projects, performed an intake of the buildings and made the \tEnergy Performance calculations in VABI.\n\nDescription project: \nThe Active House project in Montfort was the first of its kind. Although the concept of active house is not a new concept, this was the first time that this concept was executed in a renovation project in the Netherlands. Ten residences from 1970 with an energy label E were renovated to a label A++. This entailed a 50% reduction of the energy demand.\n\nCompanies involved in this project:\t\nBAM W&R had the role of project management in a consortium that included VELUX group, Danfoss, GroenWest, Bouwhulpgroep & Nieman Raadgevende Ingenieurs.",
