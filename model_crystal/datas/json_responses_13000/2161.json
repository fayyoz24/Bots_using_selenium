    "summary": "Petrophysicist/geomechanicist with 33 years hands-on experience (28 years in petrophysics, 5 years in geomechanics) in various Shell companies across the world. I have persistently aimed to deliver technically high-quality fit-for-purpose products, thereby valuing honesty and integrity. Enjoy and experienced in coaching junior engineers of both western and non-western cultures.\nExperienced user of petrophysics computing tools Techlog and IP, but flexible to use other packages (especially when user programming options are available). I aim to keep reports and presentations comprehensible for non-specialists as much as possible.\nSince summer 2022 working regularly as an associate for Panterra Geoservices, providing petrophysical support for various geothermal projects.",
