    "summary": "After completing my Master's Degree in Counseling I opened my own practice here in the Netherlands. I focus on person-centered approaches, with solution-oriented thinking to help my clients overcome the things they're struggling with and move forward into a life more in line with themselves, their wants, and their needs. \n\nI've been in private practice for nearly six years and am proud of how much my business has grown in that time. I now have a thriving part-time practice which allows me to stay home with the daughter I welcomed into the world in 2021. I plan on returning to full-time once she's in school, but for the meantime enjoy the balance that my smaller practice allows me to achieve.",
