    "summary": "Project Manager with 7+ years of experience in the non-profit and public sector with large-scale consortia projects and creating social impact. I have a background in International Development Studies (Cum Laude) and I am driven by my will to contribute to a more just, greener, sustainable and inclusive society. I am passionate about subjects as gender, diversity, equity, inclusion, project management and social entrepreneurship. I am convinced of the power and inclusion of minority groups in the development and implementation of policy, and throughout my career have been working to contribute to this aim as a Project Manager.\n\nCurrently, I fulfill two occupations; I work as a Project Leader Diversity and Inclusion at the Dutch Research Institute (NWO-I) and as Project Coordinator for Women in Quantum Development. Previously, I have worked as Project Manager at the University of Amsterdam managing large-scale scientific research projects, in the human rights sector at the NGO AFEW International, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the NGO Ceres Global, and the Buenos Aires municipality. I have experience with the development, implementation and evaluation of international consortia projects in the field of health policy, human rights, and diversity & inclusion. I have worked with target groups such as people who use drugs, LGBTQI+, migrants and women (living with HIV). I have worked in Argentina, Australia, Europe, and Central Asia.",
