Innovative techniques were used to identify new opportunities by tapping into corporate knowledge. A large number of projects were taken from the identification to the execution stage, including a large corporate acquisition, farm-ins, near field and regional evaluations and big punts on new plays. The team was recommended for its 80/20 approach, knowing when to stop and high quality output.\nDue to its success the responsibilities of the team gradually grew to cover the countries bordering the North Sea and Eastern Europe.",
