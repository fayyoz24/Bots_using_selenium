    "summary": "I have been interested in economics since I was 14 years old. I decided to start a bachelor degree in economics with major in economics in the Netherlands, at Maastricht university. During the study I narrowed my interest toward financial markets and the way these interact with the economy as a whole. After the bachelor I decided to take some time to deepen my understanding of the financial industry and, at the same time, gain some real world experience approaching the job market. This brought me to start an internship at KPMG Prague as intern analyst in the financial services audit department. When not working, I spend my time studying how professionals build and manage long/short equities portfolios, how the banking system works (especially repo markets) and the functioning and implications of the vastly underrated Eurodollar market. \n\nIn other words, I am working every day to deepen and widen my understanding of economic/financial factors and mechanics to develop a critical and conscious idea of how the system works, how players interact in the market, where we stand today and where we are headed. Everything, putting particular emphasis on those that could be defined as the weak spots of the system. By this, I mean to understand which are the fragilities of the system and how certain developments and events could break or damage the wider economy and markets in general.",
