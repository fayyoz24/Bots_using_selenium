    "summary": "One-line summary: I'm a translator and editor who thinks like a writer.\n\nLonger summary: I\u2019m a creative translator (Dutch-into-English), editor and copywriter with 10 years of editorial experience and an affinity for arts and culture, social issues and marketing. \n\nI collaborate with clients to improve their copy so that it says what they mean, and does so simply, coherently and in natural-sounding English, and in a way that I hope makes it a pleasure to read. Life, as we know, is simply too short for headache-inducing syntactic puzzles, especially when they're unintentional. \n\nSo if you're a cultural or non-profit organisation, or architect, designer, ad agency, production company, etc. and need someone with a feel for clarity, style and originality of thought, I'd love to hear from you. Because any competent translator or copy editor can turn a passage that's long-winded, opaque, and filled with grammatical errors into a passage that's still long-winded and opaque, but now grammatically correct. \n\nVisit my website (theenglishwriter.nl/clients/) or email me at TheEnglishWriter@icloud.com.",
