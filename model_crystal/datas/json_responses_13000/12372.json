    "summary": "I obtained my PhD at KU Leuven (Belgium) in 2005, after which I have spent five years as a postdoc funded by the Flemish Science Foundation. In 2010, I was appointed as assistant professor (tenure tracker) at Leiden University, and moved to Naturalis Biodiversity Center (Leiden, The Netherlands) as permanent researcher in 2014, where I was promoted as senior researcher in 2018 and group leader in 2020. I was a visiting postdoc at Leiden University in 2006, at the University of Utah (USA) in 2009, and visiting professor at the University of Bordeaux (France) in 2013 and 2014.\n\nDuring my PhD period as teaching assistant (2000-2005), I studied evolutionary and ecological signals in the wood anatomy of flowering plants. My postdoc internship in the Sperry lab (Univ. of Utah, USA) taught me how to perform water flow measurements in stems, which enabled me to functionally interpret wood anatomical observations with respect to different levels of drought stress resistance between species, with particular emphasis on the ultrastructure of intervessel pits. The outcome of this anatomical-hydraulic work has resulted in an award-winning paper on maples in New Phytologist (Tansley Medal for Excellence in Plant Science in 2010). Another line of research that has always fascinated me as an evolutionary biologist is to understand the frequent life form transitions in flowering plants, especially the growth form transition from herbaceousness towards (derived) woodiness. I just finished a unique global dataset on derived woodiness in flowering plants, showing that derived woodiness has evolved at least 600 times independently, which raises the intriguing question which (a)biotic factors triggered wood formation in all these lineages. Most of these derived woody species are native to dry continental vegetation types, which may point to palaeoclimatic drought periods as potential drivers behind wood formation in various herbaceous groups. \n\nIn addition to the question why plants became woody during evolutionary history, I am interested to know what are the genes that have turned on the wood pathway in all these hundreds of derived woody groups using gene expression and QTL experiments in Arabidopsis and relatives. I hope my research could contribute to complementary directions, such as inducing woody and thus more drought resistant and taller phenotypes in otherwise herbaceous crops that may help us to produce more food in a world where plant growth will become more demanding due to climate change.\n",
