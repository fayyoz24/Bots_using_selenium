    "summary": "I am an Engineer with more than 15 years of experience on software systems specification, design, development and operations. \n\nFor the last 8 years I've been working on the Aerospace Industry. I\u2019ve gained wide experience on the full cycle of the software systems engineering process. Along these years I have had different roles, beginning as a software developer and now being Head of Simulators development Area.\n\n I am specialized in the design and development of S/C simulators, Mission simulators and other Ground Segment software, like Production Pipeline simulation and S/C SAR Payload analysis tool.  Currently at INVAP I am regarded as an expert on these areas, having an active participation with the S/C systems engineering team giving support along the entire systems engineering process. I have a leading role on the definition and design of different software products, bringing broader view on the software being developed and the systems and subsystems to which it interfaces. \n\nAmong my strengths and skills are a highly systemic approach to the problems, with a multidisciplinary view; excellent response under pressure and tight schedules; team leadership and client/provider negotiation capacities.\n\nBesides my professional career I am passionate about Astrophysics, trying to educate myself on topics like stellar formation and evolution.",
