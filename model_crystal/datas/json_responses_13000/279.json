First we are doing a market research to choose the product. Secondarily we are presenting the businessplan to our shareholders. Finally we are going to sell our product and make, hopefully, the highest possible profit there is! Also we will give five percent of our revenue to a Just Digg It, a charity.",

Another way to think about SDN is as an extension of the bring your own device (BYOD) movement, which is puzzling businesses and security managers. \n\nTechAccess invests in SDN because of its potential as a new growth market. Due to the saturation of current markets, it is key for TechAccess to focus on new possibilities in IT. One of those is SDN.
