    "summary": "I believe that there is a solution to every challenge. A wise man once said: \u201cLogic will take you from A to B, imagination will take you everywhere\u201d - Albert Einstein. To solve the challenges our planet is facing we have to work together, use our imagination, and act in order to make this world a better place. \n\nThroughout my entire life, I have been travelling around the world. Living on a sailing boat I experienced the beauty of nature on a daily basis, alongside different cultures as well as the urgent challenges our world is facing. These adventures shaped me into the person I am today and predetermined my study and career path in the field of sustainability.\n\nDue to my great interest in corporate sustainability and positive impact in both social and ecological areas, I decided to first study \u201cInternational Studies and Global Challenges\u201d and after five years of work experience pursue a Master\u2019s degree in \u201cEnvironment and Resource Management\u201d with a focus on sustainable food systems. Healthy diets have always been an important part of my life and our consumption choices have major socio-economic and environmental impacts. Developing a smart, sustainable food system can contribute to solving many challenges we are facing today.\n\nWorking at reNAture brings me joy and fulfils me as we work towards all these values that I believe in. Believing that we can live in harmony with nature where everyone and everything prospers and thrives. At reNature, I am responsible for Latin American projects and together with my team, we support the transition to regenerative agroforestry practices with the aim to make it mainstream. Regenerative agroforestry is a solution that will bring us closer to solving the sustainability challenges of our time!",

Businesses are the number one thriver of our economy and we know that a strong economy with the right mindset can fight poverty and leads to sustainability.
