    "summary": "The focus of the research programme of my laboratory is to develop and apply new Physical microscopy methods at the interface with Chemistry and Biology to shed light on the biomolecular processes underlying cell function, ageing and neurodegeneration. I undertake a similar approach to study advanced functional surfaces and materials.\n\nTo pursue these objectives, I continuously push the boundaries and capabilities of methods of analysis of modern physics and chemistry in which I have deep expertise, such as nanoscale microscopy and spectroscopy, surface science, artificial intelligence and image processing.\n\nI hold a PhD in Biophysics obtained at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, where I acquired a strong expertise on scanning probe microscopy and single molecule methods.\n\nDuring my previous research experience at the EPFL and Cambridge University, I have acquired strong expertise in research design, communication and management of scientific teams and large international collaborations.\n\nI work alongside several undergraduate and graduate students as a mentor and supervisor. In my mentoring, I focus at developing the independence of the students to approach a problem of interest for the scientific community and society. \n\nFor a complete list of publications please see:\n\nhttps://research.wur.nl/en/persons/francesco-s-ruggeri\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PPuFbGcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works",
