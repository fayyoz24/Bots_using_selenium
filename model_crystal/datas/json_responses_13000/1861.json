    "summary": "- BA in American Studies with a specialization in Cultural Theory. \n\n- MA in American studies. MA thesis on American superhero films as modern mythology. \n\n- Experienced in American popular culture and media. \n\nI am searching for employment in the film industry. My preference would be in acquisitions at a distributing company. However, I am also very much interested in a low level entry position within a film related company. Moreover, I am interested in other employment opportunities involving media and entertainment. I gained experience in acquisitions at Universal Pictures, where I completed a six month internship within the Acquisitions department of Universal Pictures International Home Entertainment, which distributes films in all major international territories.",
