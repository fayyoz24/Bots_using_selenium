This \u2018Diplohack\u2019 will bring together coders and developers from across the world, alongside diplomats, social entrepreneurs, experts on sexual violence in conflict, survivors and NGO representatives. The aim is to produce technology-driven solutions supporting the four aims of the summit:\n\nTo improve investigations/documentation of sexual violence in conflict;\nTo provide greater support and assistance and reparation for survivors, including child survivors, of sexual violence;\nTo ensure sexual and gender based violence responses and the promotion of gender equality are fully integrated in all peace and security efforts, including security and justice sector reform; and\nTo improve international strategic co-ordination.\n\nOver three days (10-12 June), participants will first generate ideas for the most useful technical solutions. They will then work in small start-up style teams to turn these ideas into prototypes and present them to a high-profile judging panel which includes; Jody Williams (Nobel Peace Prize Laureate) Fran Perrin (founder & director of the Indigo Trust) Laetitia van den Assum, (Dutch Ambassador to the UK) Chris Taggart (Co Founder and CEO of Open Corporates) Hibaaq Osman (Founder and CEO of Karama), and Niccol\u00f3 A.

The event brought together actors from across sectors (NGOs, diplomats, artists, social entrepreneurs and corporates) who came together to 'hack' diplomacy by knowledge exchange and collaborative and creative problem solving.\n\nWe will be co-created innovative solutions based on the power of the internet and social media around two specific challenges:\n\n1. \"How can creative collaboration in the arts enhance freedom of speech and tolerance around the world?\"\n\n2. \"How open data and technology can tackle inefficiencies in the food supply chain?\"\n\nThe project is intended to look at new ways of diplomacy and collaboration in international relations. \n\nWired.co.uk came along and wrote up what it saw: http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-09/27/diplohack \n",
