    "summary": "About Media\nI believe that there should be access to all information that also allows journalists and sources with a different opinion to have a say. This is the only way to get to know all sides of the story. It's easy to go along with the current news and take everything for granted. With so much one-sided reporting, it is important for people to have a remote control with access to all news sources. So that you can distinguish fact from fiction.\n\nAbout Last Century Music\nIf you enjoy watching and listening to once in a lifetime music videos and other stuff, then you are welcom to join the ever expanding Last Century Channels on Rumble.\nWhat you get are once in a lifetime musical collaborations, live concerts, music collections from all the best musicians and bands in the world and rare music videos that you don't often come across.\nPlease follow and share these channels and make Last Century Music the biggest music spot in the world.\n\nAbout Myth\nWe were born from a fusion of eroos and chaos.",
