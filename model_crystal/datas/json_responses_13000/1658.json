Subsequently, these models will be utilized for high throughput pharmacological testing and advanced disease modeling.  Furthermore, I will perform in-vivo transplantation experiments in a small animal model. Experiments will focus on subcutaneous implantation and cardiac grafting to help ascertain what composition of the grafts will enable the best electromechanical integration and help restore cardiac conduction.",

Their ability was determined through trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) which measures the \"tightness of a barrier\". I also examined the biocompatibility of several bio-composite materials through in-vivo mice and rat experiments in collaboration with Bivalacqua Lab in order to characterize their overall integration and cytocompatability.",
