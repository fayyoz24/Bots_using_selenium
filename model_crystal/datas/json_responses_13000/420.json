Significant results were achieved: individuals who are less impulsive are more likely to have higher implicit language aptitude scores. There was also a moderate positive correlation between the temperament trait of sensation seeking and implicit language aptitude. I received an award from the American Psychological Association and the Teachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools.",
