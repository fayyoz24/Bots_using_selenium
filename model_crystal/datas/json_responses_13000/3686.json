    "summary": "I\u2019m passionate about hospitality, creating better experiences for customers and employees alike through innovations that take our industry further. \n\nMy work experience in fast-paced hotel operations spreads across a variety of luxury hotels in Germany, France, Switzerland and Russia. \n\nAfter graduating from the \u00c9cole h\u00f4teli\u00e8re de Lausanne in 2013, I joined a hospitality training tech-driven start up in the Netherlands where I first focused on product research & development in the early stages and thereafter lead the commercial team to growing our market presence.\n\nThe start-up world has been a real eye-opener and has allowed me to dive deeper into skills such as project management, growing a team, coaching, leadership, inspiring motivation, critical thinking, sales, negotiation and business development. \n\nWhat I enjoy most is creating a connection with people from all around the world, and it fuels me to work with a dynamic, diverse & energetic team to bring new ideas to fruition!",
