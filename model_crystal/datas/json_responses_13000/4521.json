Within this department, I gained insight on their content management system. Additionally, I worked within a team to organize the AIDS2018 Congress, as well as smaller scale initiatives such as \"De Tour d\u2019Amour\" (link below). Finally, to conclude my internship, I developed Aidsfonds\u2019 Instagram. Knowing the influence the platform has, I realized the potential to reach a wider, younger audience. \n\nOverall, my time at Aidsfonds was insightful and knowledgeable.

With this opportunity I was able to familiarize myself with the world of journalism as this was my first time taking part in it. \n\nDuring my time at Red Pers I noticed the importance of structured writing; there is a certain beauty in the way a story is told and each article has its own unique form. Helping a journalist find and formulate the structure was challenging but also worthy for a well-written article. Along those lines, the content itself is just as important. What should the author keep in or leave out? \n\nI found myself researching the topics and providing recommendations of my own on what I thought the author might consider adding or removing. A key point I made sure to keep in mind was the importance of not allowing the opinions of the journalist to overpower the story. Though it is important for the stance of a journalist to be kept in mind when reading articles, I made sure it was not over done.",
