    "summary": "Dr Bram van Leuveren (he/they) is a cultural historian of early modern Europe and works as Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Individual Fellow at Leiden University, The Netherlands. Bram researches the salient role of the performing arts and ceremonial protocol in supporting diplomatic relations between the Low Countries and its most important European associates in the late sixteenth to seventeenth centuries, notably France and Great Britain. Bram's research is transnational, comparative, and interdisciplinary in scope. It particularly focuses on questions of cultural exchange, translation, identity, and spectatorship.\n\nBram's first monograph, \ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude0b\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude0d\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude29 \ud835\ude0d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26, 1572-1615, is based on his/their doctoral research at the University of St Andrews, United Kingdom, will appear in the 'Rulers & Elites' series of Brill on 31 August 2023: <https://brill.com/display/title/58251?rskey=iAXp6j&result=4>. It is the first book-length study court and civic festivals of the late Valois and early Bourbon rulers from a pan-European perspective. Bram has lectured art and political history in the early modern period at the University of St Andrews, Leiden University, and Groningen University, the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2021, the European Commission awarded Bram a highly competitive Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Individual Fellow in recognition of his/their research and leadership skills as a historian. The fellowship sponsors Bram's two-year research project 'Public Diplomacy in Early Modern Europe: Theatrical Entertainments for the State Journeys of English and French Royals into the Low Countries, 1577-1642' at Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society (LUCAS): <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101029762>. Bram has also been a recipient of a prestigious Maddock Research Fellowship from Marsh's Library, Dublin, in October 2019, which enabled him/them to study the library's remarkable collection of 17th-century pamphlets on nuptial diplomacy.\n\nBesides conducting his/their individual EU-sponsored research, Bram has worked on various research teams. Most notably, in 2019-2020, Bram was hired for his/their expertise in digital humanities research to develop an online open-access database, entitled 'Theatre in Saint-Domingue, 1764-1791: Plays, Ballets and Operas', within a large research team of historians, translators, and software engineers headed by Julia Prest (University of St Andrews). The database can be accessed at <https://www.theatreinsaintdomingue.org/>.",

This is called public diplomacy. Historians such as Helmer Helmers and William T. Rossiter have shown that printed media were already widely used for public diplomacy by European governments and their diplomats in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However, the role that pageantry, such as ballets, firework dramas, and mock tournaments, played in early modern foreign relations is often overlooked. Knowledge of this tradition helps to increase historical awareness about ideas and practices of diplomatic communication prior to the foundation of the European Union. This EU-funded project will explore the diplomatic function and reception of early modern pageantry. The focus will be on the theatrical entertainments staged for the state journeys of the English and French monarchy into the Low Countries between 1577 and 1642.",
