    "summary": "My journey into exploring the depths of my mind and consciousness began at an early age, when I first discovered the practice of meditation during my teenage years. It was during my time at Queen's University, Canada, where I pursued studies in Philosophy and Theology, graduating in 2011, that my passion for understanding the nature of existence deepened.\n\nIn the present day, a significant portion of my focus is dedicated to program and business development for Expere. Drawing upon over a decade of experience in executive roles within software and pharmaceutical companies, I have embraced the opportunity to merge my enthusiasm for health and wellness with the pursuit of building meaningful and impactful ventures.\n\nOutside of guiding business strategy and delivering transformative courses, you can find me exploring the great outdoors and participating in retreats and festivals to find inspiration and rejuvenation.",
