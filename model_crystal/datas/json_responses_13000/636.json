The research and fieldwork we\u2019ve conducted with leaders across every industry sector and civil society has led us to the inescapable conclusion that if we wish to reinvent capitalism, we need to reinvent capital and the organizations that generate and apply that capital. How can you, as a leader, use ThriveAbility to build a vibrant future for your organization or business as part of a ThriveAble world? Some of the key questions that you will need to grapple with include: \n1.\tWhat are the unique capabilities needed to maximise the thriving of my organization and its stakeholders for the smallest footprint? \n\n2.\tWhich innovation pathways can deliver the improvements and breakthroughs needed to deliver enhanced ThriveAbility to all our stakeholders? \n\n3.\tHow can we measure True Value in everything we do? \n\n4.\tHow can we get our organization to begin the ThriveAbility Journey? \n\n5.\tIn what ways can advantages in 1-4 above be translated into competitive advantage versus other organizations that are not on the ThriveAbility Journey?
