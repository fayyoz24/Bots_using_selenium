    "summary": "Currently I'm working at Kaemingk Season Decorations as account manager France & Romandy. Kaemingk is an international supplier of seasonal decorations for home & garden. In my role as account manager, I am responsible for a various range of customers, such as DIY stores, supermarket chains, and garden centers.\n\nI have worked in sales and export for several years, gaining experience in various types of sales: direct & indirect sales (selling through distributors/agents) in national and international companies. Next to sales, I've worked extensively together with my marketing colleagues on events and lead generating campaigns. In sales, the most important thing for me is to listen and discover someone's needs and to find a solution that matches these needs. \n\nWhen I'm not working, I try to travel as much as possible. A city trip or a touring holiday are my favorite. Next to travelling, I love to cook a delicious dinner for my friends or family. My favorite sports are tennis and speedskating. \n\n#sales #account management #marketing #international #export #France",
