    "summary": "Hi there!\n\nI am an influencer marketing specialist originally from Venezuela who came to work and live in the Netherlands in 2016. I graduated with a marketing degree from CUFM, Venezuela. From 2010 to 2015, I had my first foray into the world of marketing at DIRECTV US-LATAM (https://www.directv.com/), a cable television company from the United States with regional offices in Venezuela. There, I supervised a group of 30 employees. During my tenure, my biggest achievement was the sale of 4500 devices in a single campaign.\n\nAltogether, I got sales and customer service experience of 5 years at DIRECTV. At the beginning of 2016, I joined Crowdmobile (an Australian marketing agency in Amsterdam), as an influencer marketing assistant. While there, I have closed deals with influencers from all over Latin America, running campaigns through many social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat. I have worked with fashion influencers, top channels, sports, horror, lifestyle, comedy, travel, and many other kinds of social media personalities. My greatest record during this time was bringing a turnover of over 80 thousand customers in one day for a courier service in the Mexican market.\n\nIn 2017, I was promoted to influencer marketing coordinator for the Spanish-speaking markets in Crowdmobile and continued working in said position until joining Reign as influencer marketing manager in June 2021.\n\nIn 2016, I opened my own marketing agency, which I have around 15 influencers under my management. I have called my agency Missritter, in honor of the literary character that my husband always uses to write in his personal blog.\n\nI am very talkative, outgoing, and creative. I consider myself an animal lover, I enjoy Asian culture, plants, photography, puzzles, board games, and Latin music. In my free time, I play the piano and sings.",
