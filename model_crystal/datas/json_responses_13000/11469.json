The new Transfield Services CEO, Graeme Sumner, then asked me to come on-board in this role to help him and his new team, bring these acquired companies together with the existing Transfield businesses in NZ.  \n\nWe had all the usual acquisition challenges of bringing different cultures and operating processes together and getting them aligned. It meant getting closer to our Australian colleagues to get that broader alignment across the Group.\n\nI led the HR, Quality and HSE teams across the Group with the initial aim to get the alignment and then engagement in the agreed company protocols particularly safety which a paramount focus for us given the nature of the business.",
