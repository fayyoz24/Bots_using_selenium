    "summary": "I am an experienced researcher in the field of molecular biology and plant physiology. During my lab work I have shown to be a hard-working person with ability to obtain results under pressure, both independent and as a part of a team.  Working in the lab environment taught me also to work on multiple projects simultaneously while meeting tight deadlines and still staying focused on results.  Being ambitious pushes me to improve and develop new skills. As for my personal skills, next to excellent organizational talent, I posses good communicative abilities, both in English and Polish. Furthermore, I can be characterized as a highly motivated quick-learner what makes me a great addition to any team. \n\n",

When applying pair-wise transcript analysis, an important number of pairs exhibited significant correlations. Whilst several of these correlations were expected, or predictable, most of them were novel and included several strong correlations between transcripts and nutritionally important metabolites.\nMy task was to test the function of the homologue genes (e.g. Anthranilate phosphoribosyl-transferase, Caffeoyl-CoA methyltransferase) in transgenic antisense Arabidopsis thaliana plants. For plants characterisation following techniques have been performed: Northern blot, microarray techniques, enzyme assays, HPLC, GC-MS. \nI have also joined other experiments carried out within the group and performed conventional plant molecular biology experiments, feeding experiments and general plant handling.\n\nSome of the results have been published: \nUrbanczyk-Wochniak E., Usadel B., Thimm O., Nunes-Nesi A., Carrari F., Davy M., Bl\u00e4sing O., Kowalczyk M., Weicht D., Polinceusz A., Meyer S., Stitt M., Fernie A.R.
