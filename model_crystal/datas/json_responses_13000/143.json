The first speaker was Onno van Wilgenburg from the Nuffic, who gave an outline of the history of CLIL in The Netherlands and the Dutch education system. I spoke about CLIL, integrating the English language within a business context for international students at the Nijmegen School of Management, Radboud University. Other speakers included, Kevin Schuck, Professor Rick de Graaff and Tessa Mearns, all experts on CLIL. Rosie Tanner and Hilary Phillips gave workshops on how to apply CLIL in the field of teaching. Three visits were paid to schools in the Nijmegen region where bi-lingual education is offered: De Lantern (primary), Kandinsky College (secondary) and OBC Bemmel (secondary). In addition, two speakers from Finland spoke about their CLIL practice at a local primary school. The participants gave each a reflective presentation about their own interpretation of CLIL in their teaching and what they had observed and learned from the week's activities. It was a great success and everyone thought that they had a fruitful and meaningful exchange. ",
