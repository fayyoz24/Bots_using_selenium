    "summary": "Let's deliver more high impact CX together! I've worked or am working with companies like Egon Zehnder (global scaling), T-Mobile, Randstad (global scaling), SVB and Sociale Dienst Drechtsteden.\n\nAny tangible results? Yes!\n- Increase of journey CSAT within 3 months on multiple occasions;\n- Scaled CX program to 10+ countries within 1 year more than once;\n- More than 20% of all employees energized to lead by example and start experimenting;\n- Proved causal relationship between CSAT and financial results like revenue and GP;\n- Employees sharing in their feedback about the program that they feel more sense of fulfilment.\n\nWhat's your context or situation?\n- Do you want to create a more customer-centric culture but are you struggling how to make this concrete?\n- Are you running a CX transformation program but the results are not what you had hoped for?\n- Is Customer Experience important to your organisation, but are you struggling to get measurable results?\n- Do you feel your organisation system has numbed employees and killed energy for experimentation?\n- Did you lose sight of what matters most to your customers and let kpi's and processes take over?\n\nJust some of the contexts I encounter in many organisations I work with. And the puzzle I love to solve together with you. Making Customer Experience measurable, steerable, creating a lot of energy with employees to start experimenting on topics that matter most to your customers. That's what gets me out of bed every morning and that is how we have increased customer satisfaction, employee engagement and financial results in organisations.\n\nThink your organisation can benefit from my support?\nDon't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email or DM.\n\n#customerexperience #cx #transformation \n#customerservice #employeeengagement #employeeexperience #engagement\n#changemanagement #leadership\n\nLet's do this! \n\nhello (@) zannavanderaa (.) com\n+31623511779",

On behalf of the Drechtsteden social services department, I formulated a plan for digitalization of the initial application processes for special income support. The plan focused on digitalization from the client's point of view, though obviously also with an eye for the organization targets. Technical realization, usability, satisfaction, channel steering, cost reduction, these were all components of this project. How do you ensure that a client immediately knows his possibilities, even before actually submitting his application? Is digital allocation of benefit payments possible? Our round of local governments made us aware of our pioneering role, and we're pleased that the first digital application processes went live in 2016!",
