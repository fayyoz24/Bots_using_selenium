The jury unanimously lauded this impressive work, which provides a systematic analysis of popular contemporary TV series in China as well as a highly persuasive analysis of their political implications. The book demonstrates how direct official censorship does not explain the common elements of the political discourse found in these programmes. Instead self-censorship, commercial incentives, bias in the rating systems, and so on, are of crucial significance.'",

The topics of my classes include: \n- Government and Governance in Modern China, \n- Modern Chinese Economy, \n- From Newspaper to New Media - China's Media System in Transition, \n- Visual Political Communication in China, \n- Political Language and Discourse in Modern China; and others.\n\nMy most recent research work focused on the political contents of mainland popular Chinese television series, including their production process, censorship, broadcasting, and audience reception. Methodologically, this work has combined critical discourse analysis, semiotics, and iconography, as well as the analysis of semi-structured qualitative interviews. \n\nA current project deals with staged mass-media events in mainland China, such as the Beijing Olympic Games Opening Ceremony in 2008, the 60th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 2009, and the Shanghai Expo in 2010. The project explores how the Chinese leadership makes use of such events to promote a national identity and legitimize its own rule. A primary question in this regard is how concepts of tradition and of modernization (or progress) feature into such events, and what impact they have on the interaction between China and other actors in the international community.\n\nMy most recent project is entitled Digital Nationalism in China, and is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). Between 2013 and 2016, I will explore how networked actors use Information and Communication Technologies to shape nationalist discourse in the People\u2019s Republic of China, vis-\u00e0-vis Japan as foreign Other. This research will be both qualitative and quantitative, and will focus on two cases: the issue networks relating to the 1937 Nanjing Massacre and the Diaoyu/Senkaku Island dispute in the East China Sea.",
