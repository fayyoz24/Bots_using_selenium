    "summary": "I am a senior press and cultural affairs officer at the Consulate General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in New York, responsible for Cultural Heritage and Dutch Old Masters.\n\nPreviously, I\u2019ve held positions as a researcher, writer, and journalist, covering subjects such as pop music, pop culture, dance, music videos, fashion, architecture, cultural heritage and access to art and culture in relation to socioeconomic status, cultural background and age.\n\nIn recent years, I have worked and lived in the Netherlands, United States (Los Angeles and Chicago) and the UK (London). As a journalist I have reported to editorial offices based in the United States, Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Between 2010 and 2017, I operated my self-launched website My roots, My style! and contributed to VOGUE Italia. Publications varied from profiles on fashion designers, musicians, and filmmakers to essays.\n\nI hold a MA in Arts Journalism from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where I was the New Artist Society Scholar. In addition, I hold a MA in Fashion Journalism from the University of the Arts London (UAL) and a BA in Cultural Heritage from the Amsterdam School of the Arts.",
