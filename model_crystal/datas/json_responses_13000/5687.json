The question given to our team by Tempohousing was: \u201cHow can we make the container housing more affordable for low-income households?\" Our solution focussed on creating a blended finance fund in combination with an online financial product (susu model) for the target market.

With my passion for sustainability and hiking, I took the opportunity to give back to the Kenyan society and make an impact. Therefore I challenged myself to combine and accomplish two of my personal ambitions: climb Mt. Kilimanjaro and thereby make a contribution to achieving the SDGs. By climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro (with 5.895 metres African\u2019s highest mountain), I raised \u20ac1.500 that provides Kenyan entrepreneurs with an opportunity to chase their dreams and start their eco-friendly businesses. \n\nInstead of collecting money to donate to charity, I chose to work with the organisation Kiva (www.kiva.org). Kiva is an international non-profit micro-financing organisation that fights poverty by connecting people with loans. By offering a micro-loan to disadvantaged people, these entrepreneurs get a chance to set up or improve their businesses. Moreover, the raised money will be reinvested on a continuous basis through giving loans.",
