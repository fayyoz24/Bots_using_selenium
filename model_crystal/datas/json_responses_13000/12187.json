    "summary": " As a teacher I have to be able to explain things clearly and positively, both verbally and in writing. Good communication skills are some of the simplest, most essential tools for teaching. \nOpen hands, good eye contact, smiling, good posture, respect for others\u2019 personal space: these are all part of good communication. Having good body language establishes trust and means students will not only have more confidence in you, but will want to listen to and work with you. \nBy using three languages confidently, I become better at observing my surroundings and adept at focusing on relevant information and editing out the irrelevant. I tend to make more rational decisions. Because any language contains nuance and subtle implications in its vocabulary, and these biases can subconsciously influence my judgment. Good language means that my diction is clear and audible, my sentences are concise, my thought processes are logical and my delivery is flowing.\n\nA natural sceintist loves to explain things. The ability to explain things clearly and effectively can help the scientist to become a good teacher. This teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others but passing on knowledge, interests and challenges to the next generation of undergraduates is a rewarding outcome.",

The plan is to synthesize specific probes that will target to particular cellular components, both in terms of cellular localization as with respect to the chemical target (protein and/or lipid). The aim is also to focus on early cellular responses, i.e. before cells become apoptotic. Once the goal is reached to specifically follow redox processes in the epithelial cells, finally, specific antioxidants will be identified. (The proposal is not granted the financial aid)",

These fluorescent probes are used to envisage a liquid ordered phase in a liquid disordered phase on a molecular scale. The investigation focused on the thermodynamic changes, in particular viscosity and transition temperature that accompanied the phase order of the lipid. To achieve this purpose, the probe should be able to respond to any perturbation in microviscosity of the surrounding. \nAt the same time, the fluorescence techniques and all its relevant computational methods were the research main subject",
