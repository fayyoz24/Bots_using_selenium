    "summary": "A full-field engineer with strong international experience and high profile research record, expert in materials mechanics.\n\nI graduated with honors in Civil Engineering (Firenze, Italy). I gained my PhD with honors (\"cum laude\") in Mechanical Engineering (Eindhoven, Netherlands) and I have been Postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical Engineering at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland).\n\nI have developed new models for designing steels (e.g. automotive applications), metal alloys and new generation alloys for high temperature applications (e.g. aerospace/nuclear applications). My modeling approach can be used also in the structural mechanics/civil engineering field, in the biomedical domain (e.g. NiTi shape memory alloys) and in any \"mechanics\"-related domain (including watch industry). I have extensive and in-depth experience in theory and simulation of materials from engineering scale to micromechanics to nanoscale. I have worked in collaboration with both industry and experimental characterization groups all around Europe.\n\nI am open minded and easy to adapt to new environments and cultures. I am creative and keen on taking new challenges. I am a fast learning person with good communication and interpersonal relation skills. I am very easy at learning languages: I can speak fluently Italian and English. I can communicate in French, Spanish, Dutch. I have elementary knowledge of modern Greek and Polish.\n\nMy technical skillset covers the field of materials mechanics at multiple scales. I master Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques, computational approaches at different length scales (nano, micro, macromechanics) in the broad materials domain and physical metallurgy area.\n\nExperience:\n1) Windows/Linux + related packages (Office, including Word, Excel, Power Point);\n2) Finite Element Method (FEM) and Analysis (FEA) software (Abaqus, MSC Marc);\n3) MATLAB;\n4) Programming (Fortran);\n5) LateX;\n6) Software for atomistic simulations (LAMMPS for MD; Quantum Espresso for DFT).",
