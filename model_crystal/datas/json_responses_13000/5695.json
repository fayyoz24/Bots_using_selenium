    "summary": "Transferring knowledge has been the goal throughout my professional carrier, first for 12 years in the water sector in several developing countries and now for 15 years in informal and formal education and training in rural Burkina Faso, West Africa. \n\nSince 2010 I manage a technical school in the north-western part of Burkina Faso. The school offers four disciplines: electrotechnics, car mechanics, civil engineering and metal construction. The total course takes four years; one preparatory year and three years of technical training. In the future we want to expand with courses especially for girls.\n\nBesides pure technical training, our emphasis lies on training future entrepreneurs, because entrepreneurship is one of the best ways to develop a region or country. Education and Entrepreneurship, that\u2019s our slogan. We focus on youngsters in rural areas, because there the need is the highest.\n\nWho wants to have his car fixed by a garage without properly trained personnel? Would you let your computer to be serviced by somebody without the needed knowledge? Probably not! So, technical training is needed, especially in developing countries.\n\nThrough creativity and devotion I manage to achieve my goals. I am a people\u2019s person and like to put my capabilities in action to make the world a better place to live for everybody. I speak five languages fluently and two more passively.\n\nSpecialismen: Managerial and organisational skills, good communicator, adapt easily in multicultural environments, enthusiasm and total devotion to the cause.",
