I performed interviews with market experts, researched publications, and relevant standards such as ETSI GS QKD 016 (Prepare & Measure QKD) and ISO 23837-1/-2 (generic QKD). \n\nThe second part implied choosing and justifying what security functional requirements (ISO 15408) apply to MDI-QKD devices.
