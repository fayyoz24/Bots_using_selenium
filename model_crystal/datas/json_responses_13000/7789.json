    "summary": "With over 15 years experience in developing and implementing gender educational trajectories and coordinating multi-million sexual, reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and HIV country programmes in amongst others Botswana, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia and Bangladesh, I get excited getting the best out of people and programs, with the aim to empower (young) people and vulnerable groups to support their health, wellbeing and unlock their potential. I specialise in gender education and in working with country NGO coalitions, multi-stakeholder programs and governments at different levels. I am currently also finalising my PhD in anthropology to even better understand working in and between differing cultures. In my PhD project I am interested in the socio-ecological complexities and dynamics between individual, social and structural factors in health-related behaviours, impact, and (often) resulting inequities. In my peer reviewed articles I investigate power and privilege in development from policy to practice, as well as the politics of data and knowledge making involved in these gendered international spaces.",
