    "summary": "Facilitation is a leadership and a life skill. We apply it consciously and unconsciously when we host meetings or invite friends for dinner. \n\nWhen we feel lost in the crowd or unheard and disconnected, someone has missed an opportunity to facilitate. \n\nFacilitated environments enable individuals to use their full potential for the benefit of the group and the larger purpose. \n\nAnd everyone can become a facilitator and create such environments. It doesn't take much.  \n\nI am passionate about human behaviour, enjoy moments of sparking creativity and find fulfilment in the creation of environments that leverage the power of groups. \n\n\ud83d\udd2e My WHY  \nBringing people together so that new ways of being and doing can emerge.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My HOW\nThe NeverDoneBefore community for facilitators\nTailored Facilitation Training Programmes \n1-1 Support as your Thinking-Buddy\nReferral of expert facilitator teams for complex projects\n\nhttps://workshops.work\nhttps://neverdonebefore.org",
