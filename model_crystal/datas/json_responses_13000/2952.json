            "description": "The Basrah Gas Company (BGC) financing was an important financial landmark for Iraq as it seeks to re-emerge in the international community. ...\nIn addition, BGC has important environmental benefits wrapped in with commercial logic. BGC gathers, treats and processes associated gas that would otherwise be flared at oil fields of West Qurna 1, Zubair and Rumaila in southern Iraq. The expansion project funded by the financing consists of two natural gas liquids trains, each of 200m cubic feet per day capacity. The capture and processing of associated gas from the upstream oil fields is currently limited by the capacity of BGC\u2019s existing natural-gas-liquids plants and export infrastructure. Construction of the new Basrah natural gas liquids facility will expand gas processing by introducing additional NGL separation gas treatment.\n\nThe US$360m loan to back its US$1bn expansion project is structured as a five-year pre-export financing. IFC led the deal and invested US$137.76m. It bought eight international banks \u2013 Bank of China, Citigroup, Deutsche, ICBC, Natixis, SMBC, Societe Generale and Standard Chartered \u2013 into a US$180m syndicated loan and raised a US$42.24m loan through its Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program, a platform that allows institutional investors to participate in IFC\u2019s loan portfolio. Pricing is around 5%. Norton Rose Fulbright acted on the deal. ...\nhttps://www.pfie.com/story/3175998/middle-east-africa-awards-swlbgyb2lg",
