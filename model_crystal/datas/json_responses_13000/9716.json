    "summary": "My musical education started in the local music school at the age of 9, where I discovered the cello. In High\nSchool I attended an orchestra music program. Upon finishing my basic education I went on to study Cello\nwith Lars-Inge Bj\u00e4rlestam at Ingesund University. My conservatory education began in Odense, Denmark at\nthe National Music Academy of Denmark. My professor for the three-year bachelor program was the solo\ncellist of Malm\u00f6 Orchestra, Niels Ullner.\nIn his letter of recommendation, Professor Niels Ullner writes:\n\"[...] Petronella Torin ... is a serious and hardworking student. [She] combines her fine musicality and sense of tone\nproduction with a strong ambition to constantly improve her playing which has really paid off during the last years.\"\nI did an Erasmus year at the Maastricht Conservatory in the Netherlands, where I worked with Ursula Smith\n(Professor, Guildhall School of Music, London & solo Cellist in Esbjerg Ensemble, Denmark).\nFor my master in \"Music Performance\", I choose the Royal Conservatory of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium and Professor\nJean-Paul Zanutel, solo cellist and member of the national ensemble \"Musiques Nouvelles\" in Belgium.\nPlaying the cello is not all I have been doing in my music education. When I was fourteen I started taking\nsinging lessons and today one of my specialities is to play the cello and sing at the same time. I am always\ntrying to challenge and expand the way of playing the cello. During a theatre project in the Toonelgroup\nMaastricht I even played the cello while dancing.\nIn 2016 I started my own company called \"A Swedish Cellist\". \"Take Away Concerts \u2013 Feed your Ears\" was\nmy first project, the idea is that you can order a concert for your home like take away food. My mission is to\nspread classical music and build bridges between people and music. I have since performed as \"A Swedish\nCellist\" around Europe, including in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany & Sweden.\nI have also so far interviewed more than 24 people for my podcast \"Master in Music\", with the aim to inspire\nand spread valuable knowledge between artists and audiences.\nMost recently, I have been working towards becoming an International Coach in Mental Training, following\na course from the Scandinavian International University in Sweden. My professor is Lars-Eric Unest\u00e5l, the\nfounder of the Swedish model of mental training.",
