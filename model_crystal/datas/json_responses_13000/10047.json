    "summary": "I am a Senior Credit Analyst with 9 years experience at the Credits Department in various international banks. \n\nCurrently, I have been working as Senior Credit Analyst for Credit Europe Bank NV since August 2021. In this role, I am responsible for oil and petrochemicals portfolio under structured trade and commodity finance department.\n\nBefore joining Credit Europe Bank NV, I was working as Senior Credit Analyst for Anadolubank Nederland N.V. in between Feb\u201919 to Aug\u201921. I was responsible for corporate, commercial, trade finance and FI clients. In this role, I analyze credit data and financial statements to determine the degree of risk involved in extending credit or lending money. Also, I prepare reports that include the degree of risk and generate financial ratios, using computer programs, to evaluate customers' financial status. Our most exciting work is to compare liquidity, profitability, and credit histories of establishments being evaluated with those of similar establishments in the same industries and geographic locations. Another interesting point is to analyze financial data such as income growth, quality of management, and market share to determine expected profitability of loans.   \n\nBefore Anadolubank Nederland NV, I worked as \u201cCorporate and FI Credit Allocations Senior Associate\u201d in between Jun\u201918 and Feb\u201919 for Alternatif Bank which is a subsidiary of the Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ), \u201cCorporate and Commercial Credit Allocations Associate\" in between Jun'17 and Jun'18 for Burgan Bank Turkey which is a subsidiary of KIPCO (Kuwait Projects Company) and \u201cCorporate, Commercial and FI Credit Allocations Specialist\" in between Jul'14 and May'17 for Odeabank A.\u015e. which is owned by 82% - Bank Audi Sal and 18% - EBRD & IFC in Turkey. \n\nI\u2019m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other bank employers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of my job is analyzing the client's business process and financials.\n\nIn February 2021, I have completed thesis based Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir University. My thesis subject is \u201cAn Overview of Company Valuation, Its Techniques and an Implementation\u201d. Also, I have a BS from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University which is the only Turkish university among the top 200 universities in the Best Global Universities Rankings for 2021.",
