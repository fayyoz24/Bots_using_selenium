During the 2 months, I managed a team of 5 Master's students and we successfully created and presented an 80-page report in which we analyzed the field the company wanted to buy, proposed what grain varieties to grow and how to grow them on the specific soil, what other crops to use in the rotations and why, and what nature-inclusive elements to implement so it has the highest possible biodiversity benefit and lowest yield loss.",
