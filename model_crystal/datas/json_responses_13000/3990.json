We also have full flight simulators engineering and manufacturing. We have also started business jet operation recently. The Covid-19 crisis has changed the habit of business travel, and taking a business jet to travel provides people with a very convenient, save and private travel experience across Europe and beyond. We are entering into partnership with a number of important players in the Chinese aviation partnership, and seeking to partner with more strategic cooperation partners around the world. With the taking-off aviation market in China, the sky is our limit. Welcome to join us!",
