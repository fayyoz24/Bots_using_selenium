For the past several years we saw the significant demand from Belgian customers for TS24's products. So now it's a right time to start exploring this area further, which is my task to do. I wouldn't really call it the task because it's a very interesting project, which doesn't make me feel under a pressure. The whole issue is divided into three big parts: market research, customers' behaviour analysis and the plan of the new strategy implementation (4p and other). The project has just begun, so it means that more updates to come.",

It is obvious that some of these products might be returned by customers with the different reasons. In order to create an effective, fast and simple system, I had to completely change the current approach. I cannot say that it was an easy task but at the end of the day, I've deeply studied the internal processes of the company, improved my knowledge in logistics and learnt about optimisation of warehouse processes. By the end of the project, employees no longer had to spend a lot of time, solving logistical issues. We also received the feedback from our happy customers, they were glad that their problems have been solved fastly and with the expected care level.",
