The projects I have undertaken were either regional studies to get a better understanding of the reservoir properties and distribution; or field based studies for hydrocarbon volume calculations and post well-analysis. The petrophysical studies included well correlation, facies modelling and calculation of the physical properties both on Clastic (sand and shale) and Carbonate (chalk and limestone) reservoirs. A core-logging study and training of local staff with the use of petrophysical software, was part of my responsibilities as an petrophysicist with ERCL.\n\nA large part of the role as an Geoscientist with ERCL was to provide seismic interpretation (both 2D and 3D) and play fairway analysis for regional studies. Additionally, I have executed a Ground-Magnetometer survey on behalf of ERCL.",
