    "summary": "I am a young professional driven by the urge to create a positive impact and my passion for creative expression and entrepreneurship. Living in over five different countries, I was able to widen my social and cultural horizon. During that time, I learned many things about myself, my role in the world and became adaptive. I thrive in challenging environments that require creative and critical thinking.\n\nAt the moment, I am enrolled in Global Project and Change Management at Windesheim Honours College (NL) in my last year. This program focuses on sustainable development, global challenges, research, business skills, and project management. \n\nAfter my first international project in Brazil last year, I am currently studying Journalism, Media, and Communication as an exchange student in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Choosing courses such as photojournalism and video production, I aim to expand my knowledge and experience beyond project management and business, learn about visual communication and storytelling.",

Over time, we developed the concept further, started producing the first products in Zwolle, promoted the brand on different social media channels, joined events, hold speeches, and even co-created a workshop for the Round Square Conference at Felsted in England. One of my responsibilities was content creation for Instagram where I shared our story and helped the brand grow from 0 to 500 followers.",

One of them was delivering meals to elder people who were neither able to buy groceries nor to cook themselves anymore.  Apart from that, I enjoyed driving children and teenagers with disabilities to different locations. Once a month, I was on a 12-hours on-call duty. In case of a call, I drove to the location to provide first-aid and decide if calling an ambulance was necessary. "
