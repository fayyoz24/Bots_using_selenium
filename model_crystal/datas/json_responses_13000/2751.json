    "summary": "I am a highly motivated and ambitious Research Master in European Studies at Maastricht University, passionate about history, the European Union, international relations, and political decision-making. My master's thesis will explore the role of women in the European Parliament during the European Economic Community, focusing on \"The \u2018missing\u2019 women of European Integration\".\n\nAs part of my two-year degree, I am currently interning with Dr. Aline Sierp (Maastricht University) on a research paper about norm-building in memory studies. I am also a research intern with the Contested Histories Project by Euroclio, where I write reports on controversial monuments and street names. My experience with these internships is helping me to develop my analytical and research skills.\n\nIn addition to my studies, I am the head of the Marketing department of the European Careers Association Maastricht (ECA). As the marketing team leader, I work closely with my colleagues to implement our marketing strategy and promote ECA. I am also a German teacher at Belingual Maastricht, which allows me to share my knowledge and expertise with others.\n\nDuring my Bachelor's degree in political science and social and economic history, I participated in Erasmus and spent time at Tartu University, Estonia. This experience sparked my passion for history and the European idea. I was also an active member of Model United Nations, participating as an organizer, delegate, or chair in more than 10 conferences during my Bachelor's. In my last year, I discovered a passion for Marketing, which I was able to explore through an internship with the Unicorn Factory. I was also part of the Model United Nations Society G\u00f6ttingen, and in 2019, I organized the annual G\u00f6MUN conferences as deputy secretary-general. This role required me to fundraise \u20ac5000 from NATO, manage the conference logistics, and ensure academic standards were met.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy attending MUN conferences, travelling, and reading various books, such as fantasy, romance, biographies, and LGBTQ+ literature. I am also part of the UM Pride Book Club and JEF. Spending quality time with my family and friends is also important to me.\n\nOverall, my diverse experiences and passion for European Studies make me a valuable addition to any organization or team.",
