    "summary": "How do organizations get the human element into digital experiences? How do they get the most value out of technology they bought into? How do vendors bring their solutions to market best? What opportunities are they missing out on today and how can we tap into them successfully tomorrow?\n\nFor two decades, I have helped tech vendors and their clients answer these questions to become more successful in digital. I have been fortunate to work with international vendors and customers across North America, Europe, Middle East and Japan. Having worked with vendors from different perspectives, I offer a unique all-round perspective: As a customer, implementer, in sales, product marketing and heading up marketing teams.\n\nMy passion is helping growth-driven B2B tech vendors with product-market fit to fully achieve their potential. Based on a well informed growth strategy that leads to a streamlined go-to-market execution. Finding the right message that resonates with target audiences, when to pivot and when to persevere, and tapping into the right growth drivers continues to be a fascinating endeavor. Building teams and coaching young talent gives me tremendous joy and I love to see the next generation excel and grow. \n\nI am always curious to get to know new people and welcome new connections.\n\nSpeak soon,\nSonja\n",
