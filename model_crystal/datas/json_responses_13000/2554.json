This means that VSL is now accredited by the Dutch Accreditation Council (RvA) to organize proficiency testing schemes for almost any field. Furthermore VSL can also offer customised service at an unprecedented level.\n\nParticipation in interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) is a key criterion for accreditation, but is also a vital investment in reliability, operational certitude and staff confidence.\n\nVSL offers a wide array of interlaboratory comparisons and proficiency testing programs. Convenient, capable, to-thepoint and eminently reliable \u2013 these are the cornerstones of VSL\u2019s reputation. \n\nVSL has more than 30 years of experience in interlaboratory comparisons. We organize interlaboratory comparisons and proficiency testing (PT) schemes for:\n\u2022 Chemical analysis\n\u2022 Asbestos\n\u2022 Gas analysis (Air Quality Gases, Environmental (VOC, BTEX), Natural Gas (odorization) , Refinery Gas, Biogas, Siloxanes, Energy Gases, Stack gas, Vehicle Emission Gases, LPG etc. )\n\u2022 Electricity (AC/DC, restistance, inductance etc)\n\u2022 Pressure, \n\u2022 Mass\n\u2022 Temperature and humidity\n\u2022 Length and geometry\n\u2022 Ionising radiation\n\u2022 Flow and volume (pipettes)\n\u2022 Light measurements",

Therefore measurement air quality networks have been installed and a European Directive requires the monitoring of air pollution. Improvement in the quality of life for European citizens cannot be achieved by observing ambient air alone. It is also important to be able to identify, to quantify and finally to regulate the emission of distinct sources relevant for ambient air quality. For this reason it is essential to establish a metrological basis for the measurement of certain critical pollutants. \n\nAutomotive vehicles are a major source of environmental pollution i.e. particularly the primary atmospheric contaminants, such as CO, NOX, SOX and hydrocarbons. Petrol combustion also causes pollution with a number of inorganic elements, such as mercury (Hg), which is naturally occurring in fossil fuels while Platinum Group Elements (PGE) can be present from catalytic converters, and sub-micron particles are present in exhausts from the combustion of Diesel fuel. In order to assess the risks from these additional pollutants and introduce appropriate regulation, the capability of practical and traceable measurements is required.\n",
