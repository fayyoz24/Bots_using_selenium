    "summary": "Passionate about a broad range of themes related to responsible natural resource management, nature conservation and sustainable production & consumption patterns attached to it. About making it possible, through research, start-ups/scale-ups and (impact) investments. \n\nMy current work focus is on scaling enterprises active in the WASH sector and increasing their impact. I do this within my position at Aqua for All as Technical Assistance (TA) Manager for the Impact-Linked Fund for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (ILF for WASH), a follow-up the \u2018Social Impact Incentives (SIINC) for WASH\u2019 programme. In this role, I'm responsible for designing and managing all TA activities that are part of ILF for WASH. The full focus of the TA is on Impact Measurement & Management (IMM) and Investment Readiness (IR). \n\nILF for WASH is co-designed and implemented by Aqua for All and our partner Roots of Impact. The purpose is to provide (financial) rewards to enterprises that create (more/better/faster) positive social and environmental impact (additionality). The payments are based on the achievement of pre-defined outcomes and incentivise enterprises to further deepen their impact whilst, at the same time, enabling them to raise private investment and scale. In other words, the enterprise receives \u201cbetter terms for better impact\u201d.\n\nMy added value lies in my broad view and empathy, my analytic attitude, writing and presentation skills, and in my approach to relation & stakeholder management. \n\nI have the ability to quickly put information in the right context, smoothly coordinate projects, I work thoroughly with a great eye for detail, am flexible and I master three languages (Native Dutch, Full Professional English and Limited Working Spanish). I love to interact with different types of people and manage ad hoc situations.\n\nI am curious by nature, dedicated, flexible and I love to interact with different types of people. \n\nKnowledgeable about: \nImpact Investing |  International Relations | Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL)/Impact Reporting | Network Organizations | Project Coordination | Project Development | Public-Private Partnerships | Stakeholder Analysis | Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) | Qualitative Research | Water Management.\n\nThings I love to do include acting, traveling, listening to music, dancing (Lindy Hop), watching documentaries and spending time with friends. Other things I enjoy a lot: going to festivals, reading historical novels and playing piano. \n\nFeel free to contact me to have a chat about ideas, suggestions, advice or mutual interests!",

We do this by supporting innovative business models and scaling local entrepreneurs to grow their businesses in a sustainable manner (via grants, technical assistance and outcome/results-based funding), while we also use our funds to facilitate (local) public and private investments in viable water and sanitation solutions (via first & second loss capital and guarantees).\n\nIn my role of TA Manager ILF for WASH, I'm responsible for designing and managing all technical assistance (TA) activities that are part of the Impact-Linked Fund for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (ILF for WASH), a follow-up of Aqua for All\u2019s \u2018Social Impact Incentives (SIINC) Programme\u2019. The full focus of TA is on Impact Measurement & Management (IMM) and Investment Readiness (IR). The TA activities include a Train-the-Trainer (TTT) programme (for service providers, e.g. accelerators), an ILF-readiness bootcamp (for enterprises) and tailored Foundational Support (for enterprises). \n\nILF for WASH is co-designed and implemented by Aqua for All and our partner Roots of Impact. The purpose is to provide (financial) rewards to enterprises that create (more/better/faster) positive social and environmental impact (additionality). The payments are based on the achievement of pre-defined outcomes and incentivise enterprises to further deepen their impact whilst, at the same time, enabling them to raise private investment and scale. In other words, the enterprise receives \u201cbetter terms for better impact\u201d.",
