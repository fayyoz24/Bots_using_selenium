    "summary": "I have been working at PwC since 1998. As tax partner, I have an extensive background in advising international clients on Indirect Taxes, especially in the context of large business transformation projects, ERP implementations and post-deal restructurings. I\u2019m experienced in serving large multinational companies as a business partner, helping them to translate complex technical issues into practical implementation. \n\nAs leader of the Dutch Consumer Markets practice, I oversee client relationships, business development and thought leadership in the Retail, Consumer Goods, and Transport & Logistics sectors. \n\nI am passionate about this practice because it\u2019s all about tangible goods and services that we all use in our daily lives. These sectors are also changing rapidly as a result of, for instance, technology, e-commerce, new market entrants, changing supply chains, changing business models, and a focus on sustainability. In these interesting sector dynamics our clients are facing questions and challenges we can help them with.",
