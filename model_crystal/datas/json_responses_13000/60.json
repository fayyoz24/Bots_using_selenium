    "summary": "Top 5 character strengths: Honesty, Love, Creativity, Love of learning, Gratitude  \u2014 VIA Character Strengths Report, January 2023  \u2014\n\nI help people think, learn and grow - things I myself do best and love doing.\n\nMost recently, I have followed a heart\u2019s calling to move to The Netherlands from Germany; a worthy challenge that aligned with my primary personal values- Agency, Bliss, and Courage, my ABCs. I knew I had to rattle things up to grow into the next phase of my best self - in a way to disrupt my hereto comfort zone. \n\nIn my previous life, I was a university lecturer, research fellow, and teacher. Looking at the breadcrumbs I\u2019ve left behind - ever since a child - I gather I always had a love for reading, writing, learning, and travelling as well as joy in mingling with people from all walks of life with an interest to help, lead and teach what I learned and found useful; be it due to scientific curiosity or aesthetic appreciation. \u2028\u2028\n\nMy flow states emerge when I find myself tinkering experiential learning moments with seemingly disparate concepts and methods coupled with observations of unraveling processes that become learning moments. \n\nMy idea of playfulness is when I get to combine learning space design with an appropriate curriculum to achieve a learning outcome. \u2028\u2028I love the idea of borrowing concepts from cutting-edge educational research, time-tested reform pedagogy of the 20th century, and contemporary happiness and wellness-based lifestyle strategies into evolving learning contexts. It feels like all my professional and personal experience as a scientist, educator, and mother have arrived at a sweet spot to evolve doing just that. \n\nIn my free hours, I spend my time reflecting on what I did, read, and hope to act upon in terms of ideas or experiences I\u2019d love to be playful with, if not read, learn, connect, or just be. \n\nTo sum up, observing and docu-Instagramming our son\u2019s Montessori and Reggio-inspired learning whilst savouring my husband\u2019s one-of-a-kind humour at our minimalistic home that I call my sanctuary pad is what I look forward returning to, be it to tweak homemaking or crafting that next recipe inspired by travel and/or impressionable people I've met along the way.\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/good.people.uberall/",
