    "summary": "Dear mother, your situation is not complex, it is unique and invites you to authenticity. \nI do not believe in labels, but see the effects of a very stressed society. \n\nKind Walks counsels MOTHERS to lead their families well in Dutch, Spanish or English.\n\nI indulge in every honest conversation as FAMILY COUNSELOR at our school and in my supporting role caring for vulnerable mothers at Leger des Heils, Kleur Cafe Den Haag and Het Rachamhuis.\n\nBesides voluntary work and studying I make time for counseling sessions during a walk in The Hague.\n\nMothers face stressful times in every new phase in life, where they lose contact with their maternal instinct and are unable to see the full picture to reclaim and delegate responsibilities as mature leaders.\n\n\"KIND WALKS COUNSELING\"\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CnkiI4ItvgQ/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==\n\n\u201cHOLDING SPACE\u201d provides a moment free of judgement, solutions or a plan that allows women to gain back ownership, vitality, resilience and hope simply by freely expressing their struggles preventing feelings of shame, guilt, confusion and isolation that often result in physical and mental health issues.\n\n\"AUTHENTICITY is the fruit of the courage that arises when we fully embrace our personality and history\".\n\nWorking out your GENOGRAM combined with the right questions, we unravel patterns, convictions and the effects passed on through GENERATIONS. \nYour physical struggles will also lead us to a full understanding, freedom and relief. \n\nReflecting about our generational history produces Kindness and Gratitude for our life and Curiosity for our purpose. We will develop empathy, understanding and compassion for ourselves and others. \n\nI overcame irritable bowl syndroom, frozen shoulders, several allergies, people pleasing, burnouts and depression without the need of medication or therapy. As a living example of our body's SELF-HEALING ability based on the POLYVAGAL THEORY I am happy to help you out.  \n\nKind Walks offers company to CHRONICALLY SICK WOMEN that have understood the benefits of a daily walk but are in need of discipline, a new routine and accountability.\nDepending on your condition we will meet during 2-3 months to walk together building up condition and a routine so that you will experience all the benefits and get used to walking on your own or inviting otters.\n\nChoosing for solitude and self reflection during MINDFUL WALKING also heals, then you can count on my accountability. \n\nEverything Kind Walks offers is based on a free contribution and 25% of the profit is donated to Stichting Groundwork.",

As a Professional Organizer specialised in Time Management and Counselor I help women rise from their sofa and pick up their life to get used to a regular walk.\n\nWe obviously also talk through past experiences, decisions and convictions that emerged from trauma and loss of the own identity.\n\n\"Liminal Space\" is a moment in life where we are confronted with the reality that our old ways of doing things do not work any longer, but we do not know how the new way works yet. \n\nThis moment can be very confusing and in a society where everything is rushed it could lead to wrong decisions with big impact. Taking our time, being held and not feeling alone or rushed helps to think with clarity and take authentic decisions. \n\n\"Holding Space\" during a walk brings comfort, clarity, relief and hope. \nHave you never heard of Holding Space? https://youtu.be/wEfrj4tqgtU"
