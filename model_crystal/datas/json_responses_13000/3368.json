            "description": "This Special Issue will unite the need for market-led oil and gas just transition with net zero emission ambitions, critically analysing the potential for a just transition by 2040. Such a just transition will  ensure due process and fair outcomes for workers and communities across the whole oil and gas value chain. We employ a pathway to 2040 because, even in countries such as Denmark where there is an \u201coil stop\u201d deadline of 2050, there is an expectation of significant production as late as 2040. The 2021 Production Gap Report, however, finds that compared to global production levels under the 2\u00b0C-consistent pathways, governments\u2019 fossil fuel supply production plans and projections would lead to 120% more coal, 14% more oil, and 15% more gas in 2030. The production gaps for all fuels becomes much more significant by 2040 for an under 2\u00b0C-or 1.5\u00b0C- temperature limit and thus, this timeline needs to be critically assessed.\n\nGlobally, we cannot reach the emissions reductions necessary to meet a 1.5\u00b0C or even a 2\u00b0C target overnight. Evidence from the Oil and Gas Transitions project suggest that net zero targets for oil and gas sector should be more ambitious.\n\nSpecial Issue papers will ideally engage with a broad geographical scope, either within or across each contribution, including, for example, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Norway and the United Kingdom, in order to showcase both leaders and laggards, developed and emerging economies. Papers will also variously consider a range of barriers and opportunities, including corporate and state-led initiatives.",
