    "summary": "We have started Summ( )n to assist teams in navigating the complexities of the world, to support their future innovations and to foster the development of novel concepts and ideas.\n\nWe increasingly witness that the pursuit of these groundbreaking innovations is futile if the teams striving for them are unwilling to evolve and adapt themselves. The teams that don't want to reevaluate their established practices, to scrutinize their underlying assumptions, and to reassess the values that motivate them... well, they fail. And no, they don't fail better. \n\nConsequently, we are increasingly busy with facilitating the transformation of these teams themselves, guiding their journeys of self-discovery and aiding them in becoming a bit less unprepared for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\ntl;dr We keep summoning your futures, together with you.",

This initiative has been successful throughout the last 15 years, and holds on to its purposes:\nDeveloping and strengthening economic bonds between Russia and the Netherlands;\nCooperation that leads to sharing knowledge about Russian and Dutch society, culture and economy.\nThe President\u2019s Programme is geared towards prosperous and profitable business relationships. To achieve this, the training is completely focused on preparing economic bonds between Dutch and Russian firms.\nBut the President\u2019s Programme goes beyond education, in the sense that all participants will be involved in an \u2018internship\u2019 in a Dutch firm for a three week period. This is not a standard internship; it is aimed at establishing economic bonds. The Russian manager and their Dutch host company work on finding opportunities for these economic bonds throughout the internship period. In the past, the internships have led to good spin-offs for the Dutch and Russian corporate worlds. Whether in the form of export or import contracts, dealer partnerships, research cooperation and foreign direct investments.\nThe President\u2019s Programme is facilitated by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
