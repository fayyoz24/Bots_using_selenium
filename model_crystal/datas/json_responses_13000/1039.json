    "summary": "Hi, my name is Mees Boerman. I am very passionate about biology; specifically environmental biology, biodiversity, and sustainability. I am seeking opportunities to research and teach current environmental and biodiversity issues, and their solutions. \n\nI have lingered in the education system:\n\nAs a Biology bachelor graduate, I am capable of reading scientific literature, formulating my own research questions, creating my own research methods to establish a strong foundation for my own future research. Additionally, I can obtain my statistical results via Rstudio and am capable of presenting these results to many different audiences.   \n\nAs a student assistant, I am passionate about transferring my knowledge to other people and I can do this on an academic level. Even though Biology is very broad, I am capable of explaining subjects which are not my expertise. As I enjoy reading and learning about other fields in Biology like microbiology. \n\nAs a tutor, I can change my approach when giving explanations at certain subjects or feedback, depending on what a certain student needs. I am also very capable of making timetables and can provide different ways of reading and studying strategies, which my students can try during study periods before tests.",

As the first practical courses, basic practical 1 and 2, gave me the extra responsibility of being a mentor to my assigned students. Which included assisting students who had trouble with planning, collaborative work, studying, presenting or writing reports.\n\nFurthermore, as a student-assistant I also had the opportunity to participate in a few meetings regarding points of improvements for certain courses, mostly regarding planning, communication towards students and course material.",

It took place on the institute of biology Leiden and was guided by Prof. Dr. Hans Slabbekoorn and PhD candidate Kees te Velde. \n\nMe and my partner researched the effects of noise and light pollution on macroinvertebrate communities in agricultural drainage ditches. This required extensive background research, a small pilot-research, working with a limited budget, familiarity with Rstudio, and presenting our proposal and results to multiple Professors and PhD's. \n\nOur subject was rather new and less researched and therefore required more creativity. It included a pilot experiment as we had to mimic urban noise and light pollution. Therefore, our experimental set-up included manually made underwater speaker and a largely original set-up. \n\nWe received an eight for our experiment. The highest grade that was obtained in the department that year. Both me and my partner were also considered above Bachelor level by Prof. Dr. Hans Slabbekoorn and PhD candidate Kees te Velde. \n\nYou can find my Bachelor research below, if you desire more information.",
