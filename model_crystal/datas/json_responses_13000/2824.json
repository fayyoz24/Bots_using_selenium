We had one good Editor, later we got another.\nIn the meantime, I assisted where I could.\nImaging in this case had to do with what your eyes see in the studio is not always right for television.\nCamera, light and contrast, is a totally different story...\nand it also has to agree, because we are aware that you are receiving us, in your living room. You are important, not only with the message you receive, but also in the way you receive it...with all respect.\nI wrote some short stories. One was made into a short movie.
