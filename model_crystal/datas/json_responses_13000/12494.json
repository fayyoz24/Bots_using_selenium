In 1999 he joined Zurich Ballet as demi-soloist and was promoted to principal dancer in 2002 at the young age of 23. Under the direction of Heinz Spoerli he danced many lead roles and took part in new creations. Wanting to expand his repertoire and looking for new challenges he joined the Dutch National Ballet as principal dancer in 2007. In 2009 he recorded a DVD of the ballet Giselle in the role of Count Albrecht in a new production of the Dutch National Ballet which received international acclaim. He regularly has guest appearances with numerous companies such as The Royal Swedish Ballet, Turkish National Ballet, and Kazan Ballet Theatre and took part in a large number of international gala performances. More recently he worked on new creations with internationally renowned choreographers such as Christopher Wheeldon, Hans van Manen and Alexei Ratmansky. \nJozef has won awards at several international ballet competitions and received the Alexandra Radius \nPrize (for rising young dance talent) in 2009. \nIn 2012 the magazine Dance Europe included Jozef in their top 100 international dancers.\nIn 2015 Jozef danced the first vignette in the dance film \u201cVoices of Finance\u201d based on the best-selling \nbook \u201cSwimming with Sharks: My journey into the World of the Bankers\u201d by Joris Luyendijk.\nIn 2015 Jozef was nominated by the President of the Unesco International Dance Council to become a \nmember.",
