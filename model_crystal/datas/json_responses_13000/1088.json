It aimed, primarily, to study and understand the geology of the site, giving us an idea of the physical and geochemical properties of the ground and the subsurface. This campaign was launched to give thorough understanding of the ground prior to construction.\nFollowing the geotechnical campaign, I worked on Cross-hole Sonic Logging, for quality control on concrete, as construction kick-started on the project, while dynamic penetration testing continued, side by side.",
