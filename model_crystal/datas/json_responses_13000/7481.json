    "summary": "I am combining my development, natural resource, and livestock background, now working as the General Director of V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res Belgium (VSF-B) again, believing that -working in fragile areas- it is important to support the livelihoods of the people living in those areas, and that -amongst other things- livestock can work for the environment, the economic situation of an area and for the community development at the same time.\n\nBefore this job, I worked as Regional Director Europe with IFAW, I have been Senior Advisor Animal Production Systems for the Centre of Development Innovation, connected with Wageningen University and Research (2016-2018). \n\nFrom 2009-2016, I also worked for V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res Belgium (VSF-B) as the Executive Director. VSF-B had at that time livestock development programs in 9 Sub-Sahara African countries (mostly ASAL areas) and 1 education program in Belgium. \n\nIn 1992 I started my career with Heifer Cameroon as a coordinator for a dairy value chain program. Later on, became deputy country director. This gives me about 5 years of solid program and management experience in Africa. Upon return, in 1997, I started Heifer Nederland, which continues to be a thriving organisation that raises funds for joint projects with its partners in the \u201cSouth\u201d. In 2009 Heifer Nederland had a budget of 2,1 million euro and was operating through its local partners in 10 countries in Africa and Central, Eastern Europe. \n  \n\nSpecialties: \nOne Health, natural resource management, technical livestock & community capacity building expertise\nAnimal wellbeing, landscape, carrying capacity, production & value chain approach\nStrategic and operational planning, reporting\nProgram cycle management (planning, monitoring, and evaluation)\nFundraising, grant writing, and reporting\nNetworking, advocacy at the national and international level\nEducation, extension and awareness raising (North and South)",
