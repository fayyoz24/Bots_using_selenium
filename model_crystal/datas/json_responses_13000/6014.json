    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Kristie, and I\u2019m not great at writing about myself, but I'll do my best!\n\nI\u2019m an expat at heart, I grew up in Adelaide, Australia and quickly decided that I needed to experience life outside of my city, so I moved to Canada where I lived for 8 years. Once again, I felt like I needed more and to push myself in ways only traveling allows, so I recently moved to the Netherlands. \nPlease note: I am intending on staying here for a long time! Moving across the world does get a little tiring as I get older \ud83d\ude1c\n\nI have always followed the path my heart told me, which sometimes led me to difficult situations, but I feel like all of those were meant for me to grow and challenge my views on life. \n\nGrowing up, I was the girl that wanted to try everything, and I mean everything! From acting class, to ballet, to learning a musical instrument (I failed at mastering an instrument so I went for the next best thing: sound engineering), and learning how to renovate houses. \nHaving this open and curious mind allowed me to have some incredible experiences across a multitude of careers. \n\nI have worked as a sound engineer, recording some of the best musicians in the world, coached high performance tennis juniors in Canada, created my very own vegan recipe book (still in the works of course \ud83d\ude02), designed warehouses and recording studios, and managed live broadcast television in both Australia and Canada. \n\nIf it weren't for my desire to learn and push myself, I wouldn\u2019t have the diversity I have now, and the understanding of what it takes to be confident in your own abilities.\n\nIf any of this sparks your interest or if you would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out \u263a\ufe0f",
