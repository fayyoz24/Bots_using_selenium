In daily practice we see that families can take all forms and shapes with multiple parents or with aunts/uncles/grandparents closely involved in the upbringing of the children. Dutch Family- and Migration law nevertheless hold a very small understanding of what a family can be because the Dutch norm, regardless of what we see in practice, still seems to be 'two parents with their children'. \nTraveling by car from the Netherlands to Tadzjikistan I will ask the people I'll meet whether I can meet their family and take their picture so that when I'll come back after 3 months and 17.000 km., I'll have a whole series of different interpretations of what a family can entail. By showing these photo's to the general public I hope to widen the viewer's interpretation on what a family can be, so that their instant reaction at the question 'what makes a family' will not be \"two parents and their children\", but a more inclusive and less restrictive one.\n\nSee my blog: definitelyfamily.wordpress.com",

                    "description": "The Sweet Business project entailed helping local beekeepers in Santa F\u00e9 de Amborr\u00f3 and Huayt\u00fa, Bolivia, with improving their honey production and to set up a small but sustainable business. By providing them with only the basic knowledge and funding the beekeepers now have created their own business with a sustainable income. \nTo manage the project I had to keep closely connected with the developments in Bolivia. Via monthly telephone conversations, regular email and personal visits every six months, we, as a SIFE team, were able to provide them with all the tools necessary to lead this project to a success.",
