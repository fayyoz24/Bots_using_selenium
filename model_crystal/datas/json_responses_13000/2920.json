    "summary": "As a young professional with both an academic foundation and extensive work experience, I believe I will be a valuable addition to companies interested in leveraging their data with careful consideration of business needs. I am looking for a position that will allow me to utilize newly acquired skills in data science in an impactful and strategic way for a company.\n\nWith 3 years of hands-on experience as a management consultant and strategy specialist, I have honed my market research, strategy, and data analysis skills, assisting companies in successfully entering new markets, creating business plans, and building strategies. I have experience in handling both quantitative and qualitative data, including national statistics, competitor pricing, and customer reviews, to derive actionable insights and make strategic recommendations for companies.\n\nDriven by my passion for data analysis, I have enrolled in a master's program in Business Intelligence and Smart Services at Maastricht University to learn smarter ways to bring valuable impact to companies. Here, I further expanded my skill set by studying machine learning techniques for structured and unstructured data analysis in R and Python. The master's degree has provided me with a formal understanding of common approaches to data analysis and their applications for informed business decision-making. Moreover, I learned the fundamental processes (double-diamond and design thinking) of smart service development and developed a smart service solution together with my team. In addition, I got especially curious about neural networks applications during my studies, so now I am doing my thesis on multiple product forecasting using neural networks.\n\nI believe that my academic and professional background, combined with my passion for data analysis and commitment to excellence, make me a qualified and grounded expert in the field of Business Intelligence and Smart Services. I look forward to leveraging my skills and knowledge to drive a positive impact on businesses and organizations.",
