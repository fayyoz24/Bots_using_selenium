    "summary": "I am an historian researching individual experiences of space and time across eighteenth- to twentieth-century Europe, with an expertise in transnational travel texts and practices. I am also a language and history specialist of the Netherlands.\n\nAs an academic, my main activities are research, teaching, museum consulting and academic writing.\n\nI also translate fiction and non-fiction, and write about history for non-specialist audiences.\n\nI combine insights and techniques from different fields and disciplines: history of experience ('ervaringsgeschiedenis'), history of praxis, science and technology studies, material culture studies, cultural history, economic history, literary history, critical theory, history of ideas, history of emotions, history of the body, gender studies, queer theory, critical race theory, disability studies, (historical) geography, anthropology, sociology, and environmental history.",

I uncover cultural, intellectual, but also material influences on the individual sense of power over space. Thus, I trace the development of a.o. privacy and homeliness. Social position of course plays an important role in experiencing these matters. But can the supposition of a 'modernisation' of people's dealings with time and space, made by so many historians and social scientists, be maintained in the light of the new evidence offered by my collection of travel egodocuments?",

Current scholarship tends to concur with essayistic texts and images by contemporary intellectuals that technological and organizational developments increased the freedom of movement of those living in western-European societies, while at the same time alienating them from each other and from their environment. I assess this claim with the help of Dutch travel egodocuments such as travel diaries and letters. After a prosopographical investigation of all available northern-Netherlandish travel egodocuments created between 1500 and 1915, a selection of these documents is examined in greater detail.\n\nIn these documents, travellers regarded the possession of identity documents, a correct appearance, and a fitting social identity along with their personal contacts, physical capabilities, and the weather as the most important factors influencing whether they managed to gain access to places. A discussion of these factors demonstrates that no linear increase, nor a decrease, occurred in the spatial power felt by travellers. The exclusion many travellers continued to experience was often overdetermined. The largest groups affected by this were women and less educated families. Yet travellers could also play different access factors out against each other. By paying attention to how practices matched hopes and expectations, it is possible to discover how gravely social inequities were really felt by travellers. Although opportunities remained strongly unequal throughout the period, this was not always experienced as a problem. Also, in cases where it was, many travellers knew strategies to work around the obstacles created for them.",
