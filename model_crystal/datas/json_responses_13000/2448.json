    "summary": "I finished my PhD in the field of algebraic geometry at Leiden University in the Netherlands. My thesis looks at dual complexes associated to generalised semistable varieties, and as such uses a good deal of combinatorics. Aside from research, I also have years of experience programming in Python and C++, and more recently I've taken the machine learning course on Coursera. I have spent the past year as a quantitative financial analyst at Ortec Finance, with a particular focus on risk-neutral models.\n\nI'm interested in challenging mathematical problems that have the chance to make a real, positive impact on the world, whether it be in education, data science, cryptography, or financial mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n",

Found and corrected an error in previous iterations of the method used by other researchers.\n\nThe calculations were performed using C++ as well as Python. Maple and Matlab were employed when necessary. This was supported through an NSERC USRA award.",
