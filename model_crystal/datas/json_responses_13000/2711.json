This was done by analysing a random set of 100 individuals (adults and non-adults) and examining them for possible scorbutic lesions, identified by Snoddy et al. (2018). These results were then analysed to examine which lesions could be more diagnostic for scurvy in this population, and the prevalence rates were compared to similar populations across Europe, as well as discussing and identifying possible cultural and economic factors for the development of scurvy in this particular area.
