    "summary": "My marketing and marketing strategy began in a medium-sized, family-run business and now continues at a large pharmaceutical multinational. In both places, I have seen and learned from the benefits and liabilities of both structures. My ideal next job would be at an organization that combines the flexibility of the former with the structure of the latter.\n\nI have varied marketing skills and experiences including sales-focused activities across traditional and digital platforms, implementing marketing strategies, and project managing. I thrive in most environments whether more hierarchical or organizationally more flat. I work well with women (the CEO of Piccola Cucina was an inspiration) and I currently mentor a women starting her career at Janssen. I also play well with the boys and fit in teams where I am the only female. I am confident, articulate, and determined in all situations.",
