To validate single cell RNA-sequencing and single cell ATAC-sequencing results I did knockdowns of transcription factors in isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells and measuring expression (RT-qPCR) for the relevant immune genes. And to investigate the role of histone monidying enzymes in OPCs in MS I Inhibited methylating and demethylating enzymes in isolated OPCs to research the involvement of methylation of specific immune genes in response to IFNg. In addition design and cloning for CRISPR-Cas9 was done to investigate enhancer regions.",

Later in the pre-adolescent years cognitive decline, motor problems and often epilepsy occurs. Post mortem vacuoles are observed in the white matter and astrocytes become and stay swollen. I worked with Mlc1-null mice to observe changes in astrocytes after increasing neuronal activity using histochemistry. \nMethodological experience gained: 1rst and 2nd antibody and GFAP antibody staining, cell patching, brain slice preparation, microscopic imaging, statistical analysis, preparation of different concentrations aCSF solutions containing high potassium or kainic acid.",
