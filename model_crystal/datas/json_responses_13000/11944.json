    "summary": "I was born in Barcelona where I lived untill I finished my  Degree in Management at Pompeu Fabra University \n\nSince June 2020 started as general manager the company Cartama Europe B.V.  The new European office of Cartama (Biggest grower of avocados in Colombia) together with the Fresca group located in The Netherlands.\n\nAll my previous working experience has taken place within international agroindustrial companies in different locations (Netherlands 8+ years, Per\u00fa and Spain). I have focused my career so far on the commercialisation of Avocado across Europe in leading companies ( Camposol / QPI / Reyes Gutierrez). \n\nWorking at Cartama means working for the only Avocado grower in the world B-Corp certified. With a very strong culture and sense of pride within our very young but experienced team.\nWe share a deep respect for our surroundings and want to develop the Colombian agro while implementing all the UN SDGs. \n\nFor private contact you can reach me at jps888c@gmail.com\n\nFor Business related \nJpascual@cartama.com\nwww.cartamaeurope.com",
