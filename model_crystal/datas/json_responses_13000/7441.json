    "summary": "\"Don't try to find customers for your product, turn your products into solutions for your customers\" and \"Deliver on your promise\" are two quotes that define the basis of my professional career.\n\nEver since I started my career I have been working in commercial roles where I built partnerships with the world's largest clients. My team and I work closely together with our clients to come up with creative solutions for their challenges and objectives. \n\nWorking with the people in my broad network is the key for success as it allows me to bring the best people together to work on projects, solution designs, implementations or even outside of work. As a people leader my goal is to continuously work with my individual team members to get to their defined next level, based on attention, transparency and honesty. All their individual successes together will lead to the overall success of the team!\n\nI am extremely proud to be awarded the 2018 and 2021 American Express President Award which acknowledges the outstanding performance of the 1% Top Performers within the company. Not only is this a great recognition but it also confirms that I am on the right path to future success!\n\nWhen you catch me not working I am probably enjoying life with my beautiful wife and kids, playing sports (padel, tennis, indoor soccer, mountain biking, road biking or snowboarding) or enjoying a great night out with friends.",
