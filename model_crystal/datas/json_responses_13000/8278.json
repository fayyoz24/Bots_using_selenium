Now, 3 courses further, we read quite complicated texts and my conversation skills are much further than just basic. Mrs. German is a very demanding teacher, but the result is strong progress. Besides learning Russian, Mrs. German can tell you everything about  Russian culture and the Russian way of life. Last but not least, her lessons are very funny indeed. I can definitely recommend her.\n\nGeorge Janssen\nPortfolio Officer Europe and Central Asia, FMO",
