My research is about targeting and empowering women in extreme poverty and social exclusion through the Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) scheme. I then evaluated UCT using my newly combined sustainable livelihood (SL) and dynamic poverty (DP) approach toward inclusive development. I also analyzed the theory of change of the program, its partnership model, and its selection process. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used in this field work to measure the following variables:\n- Livelihoods\n- Financial aspects\n- Food security\n- Natural (environmental)\n- Psychological \n- Social/relational \n- Health\n- Education of children\n\nThemes: Sustainable Development, Inclusive Development, Poverty Reduction, Development Intervention, Women Empowerment, Unconditional Cash Transfer, Rwanda",
