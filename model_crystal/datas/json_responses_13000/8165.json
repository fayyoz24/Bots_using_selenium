This article published in Bioenergy Insight in the Sept-Oct 2022 issue. \n\nThe point has been made that one of the biggest issues for wood pelletisation is the lack of a continuous flow of available, sustainable, applicable and affordable feedstock.\n\nMain takeaway: If you have managed your feedstock, if you have controlled your feedstock, you are already halfway to structuring your pellet facility towards bankability.",
