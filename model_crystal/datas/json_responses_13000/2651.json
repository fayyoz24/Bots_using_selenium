    "summary": "What interests me most is \"what we have failed to understand\" (and, especially, \"why\"). My contribution to the science of psychology therefore comes by way of explaining ideas that have previously not been well-understood, or which have been dismissed for reasons that no longer make sense. To this end, I have found that there is nothing better to encourage clear thinking than interacting with students in the classroom and with colleagues at conferences: if the audience is bored, or has trouble understanding, then written explanations won\u2019t be clear either. My goal is therefore to entertain and explain, both in class and outside of it; this material is difficult (or else we would have understood it already), but it doesn't have to be painful. Our improved understanding then makes new experiments possible, and new policies too.",

To that end, this prize will be awarded to a new scholar who will deliver at an annual meeting of the Jean Piaget Society an address based upon her or his dissertation on an historical, epistemological or empirical subject. The prize will be given to the submission that best continues the spirit of Piaget - a study grounded in a firm knowledge of, but not limited to, the work of Piaget and Inhelder.\"\n\nAny doctoral dissertation originating from any country, from psychology, philosophy, education, history of science, evolutionary biology or related fields that concerns the topic of knowledge and its development will be considered. Empirical work, rigorous demonstrations of educational methods, epistemology, historical analysis of ideas, evolutionary theory or explorations of Piaget and Inhelder's late process theory are some examples of the topics that may be submitted. The quality of the work will be paramount: the work need not have originated from the point of view of Piagetian theory, but knowledge of the theory should be demonstrated in the winning submission, to help explain how the work furthers the ongoing study of the interdependence of knowledge and development.\n\nThe mission of the prize is not to look backwards but to promote exciting new discoveries - discoveries that recognize that the study of the development of knowledge begun by Piaget, Inhelder, and their many collaborators is a living, continuing tradition that reverberates in many rich and surprising ways through many disciplines.",
