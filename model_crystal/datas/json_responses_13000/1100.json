Software design, programming, integration with seismic interpretation (LandMark) and reservoir modeling (Shell GEOCAP) to reduce feedback time between them, testing, documentation, training, support, budget and 5 person team planning and management. Subject Matter Expert for palinspastic reconstruction. Consulted in several thrust belt farm-in opportunities.",
