    "summary": "Welcome to my profile, this is Merlijn from Groningen, The Netherlands.\nI was born in '87 and I am skilled in cultural diplomacy, entrepreurship and above all I specialise in the art of having fun. \nOne of my main passions in life is creating unlikely connections between people from different backgrounds all over our planet. Uniting them, creating new concepts from scratch and then telling the world about it is something I structurally do while the power of music is often leading in this process.  \n\nSince a young age I have been a musician and been involved in running projects often based on underground music. \nThis started with organising metal concerts in the north of The Netherlands since 2006 and it gradually evolved to doing the dance-music programming, setting up international exchange projects and doing lectures about nightlife governance. \n\nSince 2009 my main projects consisted of:\n\n* The founding of SNME (Stichting Nederlandse Muziek Export) which is a foundation dedicated to Dutch Music Export and setting and financing up dozens of tours all over the globe \n\n* The founding of nightclub Subsonic. Managing it to become Groningen's leading small size open-minded nightlife venue with underground dance music\n\n*  Programming music events in Simplon venue since april 2014 with a focus on dance-events (2014-2016) and metal shows (2014 till present)\n\n* Programming headliners and support acts on the Yin Yang Music Festival China\n\n* Founding and financing the first China Pavilion Conference 2017 at Amsterdam Dance Event \n\n* Head of program of the Dance Stage at Bevrijdingsfestival Groningen since 2015\n\n* Fellow Member of the European Music Council between 2016 and 2018\n\n* Advisory member of the Dutch Popcoalitie, specialised in internationalisation, dance & nightlife culture and part of working group 'makers'\n\n* Developing the Gateway to China social media service for Western artists of Chinese social media channels since 2018\n\n* Founding COSIMO Foundation since 2019, bridging the gap between the cultural world and the business world with the mission of creating new ways of project funding \n\n* Being the Nightmayor of Groningen since 2018, with a second term until October 2022 \n\nLecturer and public speaker at conferences all over the globe such as Sound Diplomacy Chengdu, SIM Sao Paulo, Stadt nach Acht Berlin, Balkan Music Conference, TedX Youth, ESNS and many others.

The system rewards real life interaction in order to stimulate this and aims to create an easy overview of cultural life in a city with Groningen as it's current testing-ground.\n\nGroningen municipality funded the first connection-tool between all dance & pop-organisations in august 2013 and in since then on various steps were made in implementing the concept in the official digital cultural overview of activities and location for foreign students and expats in Groningen.\n\nSince 2015 various lectures on the platform were given on occasions like:\n\n* Hanze University for Applied Sciences 2015\n* Holland Webweek 2016\n* The European Forum on Music in Wroclaw (as member of the European Music Council) 2016 \n* Eurosonic Noorderslag  2017\n\nThe next step which currently (summer 2017) is being taken is to cover the total cultural segment of the city of Groningen in an interactive site to connect  venues, stakeholders, artists and audience in order to bring them closer to each other.",
