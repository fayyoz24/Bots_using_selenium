    "summary": "Over my professional career, I have grown to be a modelling expert in the energy industry. After studying Aerospace Engineering and Applied Physics in Delft, I kicked off my career as a Reservoir Engineer at Shell, where I made a living of forecasting and scenario building for investment decision making. I then dived into the world of algorithms and (big) data at Pipple, before starting a job at McKinsey. There, I grew to become a modelling expert across different energy markets, most notably gas and hydrogen trade optimizations. I enjoy the combination of diving into code, working in a project team and keeping focus on the business need. My professional interests are as broad as my technical background, but especially lie in global energy transition as well as transport and infrastructure.",

Currently (2015-2017) working on the Waddenzee fields, onshore The Netherlands.\n\nWas responsible for all reservoir engineering activities in the Waddenzee/North Friesland: one of NAM\u2019s largest gas-producing areas. Core business involves developing new opportunities to sustain production, therewith analysing dynamic data to understand both subsurface uncertainties as well as surface bottlenecks. It also involves reporting out on ground subsidence modelling to the regulator. The Waddenzee is an environmentally sensitive area and we all would like to keep it that way.\n\nDeveloped formal and informal capabilities in geology, geophysics, petrophysics, production technology and economics.\n\nMastered expertise in numerical simulation using a wide range of methods. This involves combining many sources of data (production rates, pressures, RFT data, production logging data, well logging, seismic interpretation and geological understanding) into a forecasting output, with a realistic uncertainty range. This can be done conceptually, deterministically and probabilistically - all with their pros and cons.\n\nObtained experience in the following activities and/or software: Project Development Reservoir Engineering, Integrated Production Systems Modelling, Material Balance (MBAL) modelling, 3D Dynamic Simulation and Experimental Design, Ecrin Software & Well Test analysis, Business Planning, Reserves Booking, Reservoir Engineering for modelling of subsidence, Integrated 4D seismic studies.",
