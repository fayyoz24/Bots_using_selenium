    "summary": "Welcome! \n\nThanks for viewing my profile. My past years of education took place in institutions in six different countries and were combined with various jobs in different departments. Currently employed as a project-based PhD candidate (until 09/2024), which combines academic research with consulting work for all supermarket chains in the Netherlands.\n\nEducation: The Double Degree Master of Marketing at the highly ranked University of Groningen and BI Norwegian Business School has provided me with practical marketing tools, advanced statistical modeling techniques, and research capabilities.\n\nWork: To apply those theories and gain practical experience, I have additionally worked in multiple marketing and communication positions and engaged in research-based consulting projects with well-known firms. Please find more information on this in the listings below.\n\nHobbies: Outside of work you can find me on a beach volleyball field or tennis court, listening to or making music, working on creative projects, or just hanging out with friends.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me for exciting ideas, research projects or to just have a chat :)",
