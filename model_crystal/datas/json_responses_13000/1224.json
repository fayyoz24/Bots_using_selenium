Times abroad were alternated with three to four year stints in the Netherlands:\nFirst as teacher to new intake and 3/5 years expat staff, including a new geological excursion to back-up this course. Wrote new manual for PG's. In subserquent periods as senior PG in several teams, active in Nigeria, Rumenia, Tunesia and Syria. \nWhilst in Oman organised and supervised the surface mapping of Precambrian ice-age sandstones, (oilbearing downdip), organised geological excursions as in the other countries we staid. \nRetired 1996, but stayed in Oman and joined MB company as chief mining engineer, aimed at prospecting gold in the area. Identified two area's of which the first drilling results identified economic volumes. \nReturned home to the Netherlands in 1998 to support our children during their last years at university..",
