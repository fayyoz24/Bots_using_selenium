In my role as a production manager, I was responsible for planning, organizing, and coordinating daily activities at the quarry. This involved overseeing an annual production of 1000m3 of dimension stone, and ensuring that all operations were carried out safely and efficiently. I also prepared quarry profiling reports and mining legislation documentation, and was responsible for managing business administration.\n\nAs a consultant, I participated in the quarry development and production process at the dimension limestone quarry. In addition, I prepared monthly drilling and blasting plans for an aggregate limestone quarry client. My expertise in documentation preparation was instrumental in obtaining two mining licenses for dimension stone quarries, which allowed the business to expand its operations and increase its revenue streams.\n\nThroughout my work in both stone production and consulting, I was committed to ensuring a safe and productive work environment for all personnel and adhered to safety regulations and best practices to mitigate any potential hazards.",
