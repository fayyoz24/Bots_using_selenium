    "summary": "After having completed a university degree in medical physics, I joined Shell as a Petrophysicist in 1981. I worked in several places in Europe and for a total of 9 years in the Middle East. Apart from having had exposure to many of the Petrophysical sub-skills, I have gained experience in training and staff development, software development and deployment (Techlog), integrated reservoir modelling (workflows, including links to Petrel etc.) and Data management optimization (standards).\nI have retired since the 1st of March 2015, and set up a one-man consultancy called \"Across Petrophysics\", offering services in above mentioned areas of expertise.\nSince then I have worked for Baker Hughes in Delft (petrophysical input into subsurface modelling software developments for 9 months), and since october 2016 for Centrica Aberdeen, working on a mid-sized gas field in its late field life. \n\nSpecialties: Petrophysics, Techlog, Saturation modelling, Integrated Reservoir Modelling, including basic Petrel skills",
