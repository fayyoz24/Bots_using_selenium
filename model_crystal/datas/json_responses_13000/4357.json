    "summary": "Experienced Managing Director with demonstrated results of working with public institutions, knowledge institutes and private enterprises in the context of PPP. Skilled in Sustainable International Business development, specialising in feasibility studies (e.g. to enter new markets), realising new business opportunities through the creation of strategic alliances.\n\nProven experience in building new business opportunities.  As a team player and a connector, with strong communication and relationship skills, result oriented, eager and committed, I was able to setup different Consortia. \n\nAfrica is faced with many challenges, but offers at the same time a wealth of opportunities. Today with the Migrant issues, security issues in North Africa and the worldwide food security problematic, the only way to solve these issues in the Mid/Long term is to create an economic bridge between the North and the South.  My aim is to help in the development of a successful strategy based on a strategic cooperation between national governments, knowledge institutions and industry.",
