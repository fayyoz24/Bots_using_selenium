    "summary": "I was born and raised in the Netherlands, but have always had a natural desire to explore the world. Ever since I started studying International Business I've had the dream to work and live abroad. In January 2022 this dream came true when I moved to Singapore to work in Supply Chain Management for Decathlon. Before coming to Singapore I had studied and worked for approximately a year in China and travelled to a plethora of countries, only solidifying the desire to go overseas. \nSo far I've loved the sense of adventure, learning about the history, culture, and of course the incredible food(!) in Singapore. \nAnother big positive for me is that I'm able to travel all over South East Asia, to experience these rich cultures & the ability to practice one of my passions year round, which is Golf. Besides Golf I'm a huge fan of Formula 1, snowboarding, spending time with my dog, friends and family & investing.\n\nI started my career in retail mainly thanks to my upbringing. My parents used to own their own perfumes & cosmetics stores and web-shop, so it felt very natural to me. \nWorking 'boots on the ground' in retail has thought me a sense of hard work, always being customer oriented, having to be pragmatic & creative, but most of all - always focusing on people first. I've learned that taking care of your teammates, making sure that they have the right tools and the right guidance and direction, will ensure the highest probability of success. Furthermore, it makes working intensely more gratifying. I've also learned, through leading multiple teams, that it is KEY to always stay authentic, straightforward and to allow yourself to be vulnerable in order to create trust. \n\nIn my current role I've had the pleasure to be able to work with people from over 15 different nationalities. This has honed my ability to adapt and to be culturally sensitive. \nHaving had the opportunity to work in Category and Supply Chain Management has opened my eyes to all the factors that make a successful value chain. Seeing all the opportunities ahead, I'm driven to use my experience in retail and commercial sense to maximize profitability.",
