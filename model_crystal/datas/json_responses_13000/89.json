    "summary": "Language is my passion. I love all languages, but am fluent in Dutch and English; Dutch is my native tongue and I've had a life-long love affair with English. I learned to speak English perfectly while living in Canada, years ago, and have maintained it since with several univerity studies which were all taught in English. Most recently I completed my bachelor English. The next step is a master in translating. \n\nOn October 7, 2010, I registered my translation agency, True Sense Translations, with the chamber of commerce. I've since been kept busy with a steady flow of assignments. The source documents I translate range from private novels to general terms and conditions and anything in between. Whether they are written in flowery or formal language, I love the challenge they present - the hunt for just the right word, phrase or idiom so that the original meaning and message are preserved in the translation.\n\nCurrently, I am still working a steady job to support myself. The goal, however, is to grow big enough within the next two years to support myself entirely with True Sense Translations. \n\nFive years from now, I want to be able to land 'dream assignments'; published novels and movies (subtitles). \n\nTen years from now I want to have my own external office and employ translators whose expertise is German, French and Spanish - a passionate team of language enthusiasts who feel as in love with their language of choice as I am with English.\n\nSpecialties: Translating, proofreading, copywriting, English, creative writing.",
