    "summary": "Italian born and raised, I own and run Italian cooking school \"La Cucina del Sole\"\u200b in Amsterdam since 2002.\nI'm specialized in Italian regional, classic and healthy cooking and write (in Dutch, Italian and English) about food for culinary weblogs and magazines. I published my first cookbook \"Antipasti\"\u200b (in Dutch) in 2006. My second cookbook, \"Cucina di casa mia - Recepten van een Italiaanse familie\"\u200b was awarded 3rd prize as \"Best Italian Cookbook in the World\"\u200b at the Gourmand Cookbook Award in Paris (2013). http://www.cucinadicasamia.nl/\nThe third book \"Gewoon gezond\"\u200b, written by nutritionist Rolien Scheepbouwer with recipes developed by me, has been published in May 2015. \nIn 2022 I've followed two food photography courses with Lucie Beck.\n\nIn December 2009 I got qualified as Professional Sommelier by AIS, the Italian Sommelier Association.\nIn 2011 I've been pioneering a new field on Italian television presenting 40 episodes of \"La cucina degli altri\"\u200b, the very first cooking program on Italian TV dedicated to the international cuisine (on Italy's biggest food channel, Gambero Rosso, Sky ch. 411). \nBetween 2015 and 2017 I've been Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution Ambassador for Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In this role I've been teaching healthy cooking to children in schools and contributing to spread healthy, durable and sustainable food habits.\n   \nI am also a professional Italian voice-over with 30+ years of experience. I work with the leading Dutch and Belgian voice-over companies and lend my voice to videos, radio and TV commercials, Italian language courses, guided museum tours, voice response systems and much more. See http://www.nicolettatavella.com/#!voice-overs/c1dwo\n\nBeing an eclectic personality and very interested in spirituality I also enjoy working as a professional Tarot reader. On my website www.houseoftarot.nl you'll find more info about this activity.\n\nSpecialities: I'm an expert in the field of classic, regional, healthy and innovative Italian cuisine with an excellent knowledge of international cuisines.",

Awarded a prestigious prize at the Gourmand World Cookbooks Award in Paris 2013: 3rd place in the \"Best Italian Cookbook in the World\"\u200b category.\n\"Gewoon gezond\"\u200b is my 3rd book, written by nutritionist Rolien Scheepbouwer, with my recipes. \nFor Dutch Detox Coach Jacqueline van Lieshout I've developed a cooking workshop focused on healthy, detoxing dishes which we've given together several times. Most of the recipes have also been published in her \"Het tempelkookboek voor kinderen\" book with healthy recipes for kids. \nAs a food consultant I've worked for the Dutch Consumentenbond, Dutch TV programs \"Kassa!\", \"Smaakpolitie\", \"Herrie in de keuken\", \"Tijd voor Max\" (http://www.omroepmax.nl/tijd-voor-max/alle-recepten-fragment/nieuws/risotto-ai-funghi-porcini-e-mirtilli/), \"Huisje, boompje, beestje\" (see http://www.schooltv.nl/share/NPS_1242195) and \"Wat de boer niet kent (24Kitchen).\n\nIn 2022 and 2023 I've followed several food photography courses with Dutch food photographer Lucie Beck. \nYou can contact me for articles, essays, the writing of original recipes with beautiful photos, advice on the development of new food-related products and trends and for suggestions on the Dutch and the Italian food market.\n\nMy blogs: \nhttp://cucinadelsole.nl/blog/ (EN)\nhttp://cucinadelsole.nl/nl/blog-nl/ (NL)",

Years later I decided I wanted to learn more than just \"Tarot-from-a-booklet\"\u200b and after 4 intense weeks of learning Tarot and Numerology in the States with Christopher Beaver between 2004 and 2006 I decided to start reading Tarot cards professionally. My way to read the Tarot is totally free from future-telling interpretations. I strongly believe in the idea that we all constantly create our \u201cfuture\u201d with our own choices, thoughts and beliefs so it doesn't make much sense to \"read the future\"\u200b. I prefer to read the \"now\" so that I can give indications and advice on how to create a better future.\nWhat I do with my work is to help people better understand certain situations so that they can choose more consciously and with a serene mind what their next steps will be. Every Tarot reading starts with a Numerology analysis on personal birth number/numbers and personal year numerology and related energy.\n\nVisit my Tarot website: www.houseoftarot.nl",
