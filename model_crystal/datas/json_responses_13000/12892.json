    "summary": "    I am an anthropologist with 20 years of experience in reintegration and conflict transformation programming around the world. I have an international reputation in the field of reintegration of ex-combatants, children associated with armed forces and groups, gender and conflict-affected youth. \n   I am a well-known resource person in international conferences, courses, and networks, serving for seven years in the UN (ILO) by focusing on economic reintegration.\n    In addition to reintegration I work on broader peace building issues including on local economic development, dialogue and mediation, and capacity development. \n    I am currently the director of the international consultancy firm Transition International, based in Landgraaf, the Netherlands, which has a network of senior consultants all over the world. \n    I also have an extensive experience in designing and facilitating training. I am the course director, designer and lead trainer of the international \u2018Reintegration of Ex-Combatants: Advanced Training course\u2019 organised by Transition International, which takes place on a yearly basis, as well as the mid-level reintegration course. \n    My record as a researcher and writer is furthermore illustrated by my books and wealth of articles and chapters in books. I am also the course director and lead trainer of this CBRS course.\n    \n    My aim is to assist the major players in peacebuilding to become more effective in order to reduce suffering and increase hope and opportunities for those people in this world who do not have the power or voice to trigger change.",
