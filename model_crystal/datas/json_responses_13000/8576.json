    "summary": "I grew up bilingual and bicultural in Milan, where I obtained a double graduation at the German School. \n\nSoon thereafter I started a double law degree in Italian and German Law. This course is spread over a period of five years beginning at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze and ending at the Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln, allowing me to acquire a broad knowledge of both legal systems. My education has been furthermore enhanced by a two-month internship at the Italian Desk of Luther law firm, where I gained a practical insight into both legal systems.\n\nCurrently I am attending the masters program  \"International Business Law: Climate Change and Corporations\" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This Master focuses on private law, such as corporate, contract and liability law but will also address financial regulatory law and European law, all through the lenses of Climate Change and Sustainability. \n\nSince the age of 17, I have been working as a ski instructor at the Swiss Ski School St. Moritz. This experience has given me responsibility and reliability on the work place. \n\nI have also acquired very strong teamwork skills and determination through participating in and winning the business@school programme organised by Boston Consulting Group.",
