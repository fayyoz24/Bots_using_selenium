    "summary": "I am a passionate mathematical finance graduate whose interest in finance began rather unfortunately by losing money in a Ponzi scheme (after high school). Since then I have acquired a BSc in Financial Mathematics and an MSc in Mathematical Finance. I have a theoretical understanding of stochastic calculus, derivatives pricing in discrete and continuous time, c++, python and computational methods. I am excited to leverage my skills in an entry-level position as a quantitative analyst (& financial engineering). My previous experience includes a 1-year actuarial assistant position at Hollard Insurance Botswana.\n\nIn my spare time, I write articles for my blog (http://themodelscollector.co.uk), exploring some of my own ideas in mathematical finance. So, if you are interested in learning about my professional journey or have a peculiar taste and want to discuss why a stock and bond portfolio with a strictly positive initial value and a positive value after 1 time step is an arbitrage opportunity, please connect with me \ud83d\ude09.",
