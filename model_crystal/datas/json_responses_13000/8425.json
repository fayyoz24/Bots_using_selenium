    "summary": "What I do very well is writing texts. For example, while working as an author and screenwriter on television, I had to write a lot. My regular upload as a writer averaged two documentaries per month, each an hour and a half of air time, that's about 40 pages of scenario-text behind for each film. These were investigative films about socially important topics, such as human trafficking, world and Russian politics, history, space exploration, weapons, public life, etc.\n\nAfter leaving TV in 2017, I started working with YouTube projects. Basically, I acted in my projects as the only one expert in video production and I had to organize or do almost all the work myself from the idea, concept development and content plan for YouTube channels, then I wrote scripts for them, organized the filming process, hired a team of operators on my own, compiled the editing plan for video editors, and did the final editing of the video. Then wrote the description of the videos, tags for YouTube, published the video and also ran advertising campaigns for the video through Google Ads.\n\nMy experience in television is about 17 years, I have held positions as a news reporter, documentary author, editor-in-chief of a weekly documentary television program, and editor-in-chief of a newsroom in the largest and most influential media\u2019s in Russia.\nI have skills in the entire cycle of video production, I can distinguish at a glance a video shot on Cannon from a video from Sony Alpha, I can edit a video, arrange cameras to shoot a beautiful video, write a text for the heroes of the video, before that - understand any complex topic and tell about it in simple words so that the audience could not take their eyes off what was happening.",
