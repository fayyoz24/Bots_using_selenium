    "summary": "Nice to see you here! I\u2019m a digital native offering 18+ years of experience in a relatively broad spectrum of industries. My path to success is anything but linear, regardless, you will always see me give 100%, whether it is in business development, stakeholder management, or providing guest lectures at international universities.\n\nMyself in a nutshell: With a background in tourism studies I took on every international challenge that came my way. This allowed me to travel the world in my 20s which was absolutely fantastic. I've lived in the most amazing places such as the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Belize, and Ecuador. Over the years I\u2019ve developed skills and insights to adapt quickly to any business environment and I often find creative ways to reach goals without making any concessions.\n\nMy expertise isn\u2019t limited to a single area; I\u2019m currently involved with the Dutch Union of Charted Controllers (the VRC). A non-profit organization in Finance that aims to promote the Register Controller title through research & education and bring together Executive Masters of Finance and Control (EMFC) alumni\u2014quite a mouthful, I know. Here I'm head of the Business Development Department where our main focus is contributing to the board's strategic decision makings and translating short- & long-term vision into smaller feasible projects. \n\nFeel free to reach out and get in touch. I'm always looking to expand my network with like-minded spirits.",
