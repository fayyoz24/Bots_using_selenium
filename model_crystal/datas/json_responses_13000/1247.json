When the user performs an activity the system collects information from mobile sensors and external agents, and with this information a feedback is provided to the user aiming to improve his well-being. This domain can be captured in Causal Loop Diagrams. However, these diagrams include large quantities of information and should be reduced to create specific context-aware applications. The reduction could imply the loss of information, increasing the difficulty to develop these applications. We provide different approaches to this problem.",

Its system is based on the idea of ERP's but in this case it will be ERP for everyone, allowing the client to maintain his own web application as if it was a simple Blog. The purpose is that anyone can manage it's business 'on the cloud'.\n\nThe second part will be a front end in which the user will be able to present a website describing his business, offering possibilites of 'on-line shopping' and indeed a better approach to the user's clients.\n\nAs an example, my website will be using this system. Showing in the front end my CV, Projects, and related information with a backend in which anyone can have a look on how the system works.\n\nExpected release date April 2014",

These extensions implied research and information gathering for a full BPMN compliance as well as compatibility with competitor's tools. Thus, developing the related assignments improved my research and communication skills as I kept frequent communications with colleagues from different departments (SE, R&D, consultancy, technical support, ...) as well as partners from other companies.\n\nMy following steps within BiZZdesign brought me to take part into a team project, in which we work according to AGILE and SCRUM methods. As a member of the team I am involved in the development process of a new tool of BiZZdesign using different tools and programming languages together with GIT repository control. Being part of this project requires constant communication with colleagues in order to achieve common goals, and a proactive attitude to increase the team's efficiency and product quality.\n\nAs an addition to the fulfilled assignments, I also gave different presentations and demos for an internal audience and on a given occasion a technical pitch addressed to external partners.",
