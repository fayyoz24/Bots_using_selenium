    "summary": "I grew up in Northern Japan and  received a master degree at the University of Amsterdam. Here's 7 things to quickly know about me. \n\n1.) I do love challenges. Since childhood, my motto has been, 'whenever you are in doubt, choose the one that requires greater courage.' \n\n2.) Eager to learn. Through news, YouTube, books, and experiences, I continually update my knowledge and skills. My recent favorites are mathematics, designs, and branding strategies. \n\n3.) Strong work ethics. When I set a goal, I work towards it making utmost effort. \n\n4.) Interest in how the world works. My Bachelor at the University of Tsukuba enabled me to follow inter-discipline courses such as international politics, law, economics, development, and environmental studies. I chose international law as a major where I find my passion and an essential role in the world. \n\n5.) Flexible and open-mind with a lot of self-control and discipline. That's how people describe me. \n\n6.) I help people. I have been involved in volunteer work in education and migration. I also support Japanese students who wish to study abroad.  \n\n7.) Visiting more than 30 countries. I like traveling with my friends, but I also love doing it alone. One of the most memorable trips was to Uzbekistan where I met lifetime Uzbek friends and gained new insights about the world.  \n\nThank you for reading! I'm open to any exciting opportunities in global environment. \n\nFeel free to message me :)",
