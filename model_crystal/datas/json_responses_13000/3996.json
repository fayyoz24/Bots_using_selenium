    "summary": "As a recent graduate of the Master's course in Construction Management and Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, I am excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in the industrial construction field. While I am a newcomer to this industry, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills that I have gained through my education and past experiences to add value to any project that I am a part of.\n\nWith a proven track record of success as a nationally certified construction manager and cost engineer in China, I have developed a diverse skill set in project management and construction management, including collaboration, leadership, and quality control. I am confident that I can bring these skills to a new role as a project engineer, project control engineer, or cost engineer, and am eager to learn and grow as a professional in this field.\n\nOverall, I am committed to making a positive impact on any project I am involved in and look forward to contributing to the success and sustainability of the industrial construction industry as a whole.",
