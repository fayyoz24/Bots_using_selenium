    "summary": "I am a social scientist (MA) and a development professional with over 20 years of working experience in international development cooperation: 13 years in Africa (Cameroon, Ethiopia) and 7 years in the Netherlands travelling to Asia. I started my career as an activist in women rights issues and contributed to the kick off of a very successful local organisation currently representing the voice of women victims of forced and early marriages. I am interested in a wide range of thematic areas and good at coordinating and managing the overview of complicated processes leading to the intended results. As a critical learner I have expertise in different approaches re. project cycle mgt, result based mgt, MEL, participatory & right based strategies, gender analysis. I gained experience on multi country programme and project management, multi donor grant management & contract compliance and developed monitoring tools for programme and financial management. As a leader I achieved successes in showing impact and change at programme/project level, winning contracts from various donors, organisational level reporting, policy development, staff recruitment and organisational change processes. My achievements are mostly results of well-coordinated team work, in which acceleration, problem solving and interpersonal skills are often my contributions.\nThematic areas: women and violence; gender empowerment; livelihoods; emergency; climate change & resilience; natural resource management; water, sanitation & hygiene; civil society & accountability. \n\nPersonality: team player, committed, supportive, guiding, responsible, creative, good-humored & positive.
