    "summary": "Canan Marasligil (Ja\u2019anan Marashligil) (she/they) is a feminist writer, artist, literary translator, editor and curator of literary and cultural programmes, whose practice spans from performing, giving workshops to making podcasts. She is active in the fields of literature, comics, photography, cultural criticism. Throughout their work, Canan advocates for representation, equality and diversity. Canan works in English, French, Dutch and Turkish, and has a fair command of Spanish.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach is central to how Canan works, with their practices feeding one another to create spaces where we can collectively engage with art, culture, literature and ignite change through creativity. \n\nIn Spring 2023, Canan will launch The Attention Span newsletter which focuses on reflection, analysis and imagination, offering a closer look into their work and practice. Each issue (every two weeks) contains a short essay on a topic related to Canan\u2019s work, a nerdy look at translation, a page from one of their notebooks, and a list of interesting things she is reading, watching or listening to. \nFor more information visit https://theattentionspan.com/subscribe",
