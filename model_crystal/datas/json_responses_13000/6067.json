One of our notable initiatives involved drafting a Ministerial Letter directed to the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development, and Disability Inclusion, Carla Qualtrough. This letter highlighted the challenges surrounding the cost and affordability of post-secondary education, emphasizing the importance of accessible and inclusive learning opportunities for all. Our collective efforts aimed to foster positive change and pave the way for a more equitable future."
