    "summary": "Key achievements:\nPlanning and executing seismic surveys including processing for MCG with well negotiated business terms. This includes designing surveys using GIS systems, generating pre-plots, establishing the most optimal acquisition parameters, obtaining the relevant permits and environmental clearances, negotiating the optimal contract for acquisition services depending on market conditions, assigning a processing contractor and establishing the processing flow to best show the potential of the data, followed by data management and delivery.\n\nPlaying a large part in design, equipping and managing the build of the highly successful PGS S-class Ramform. My role was in overall  management of the project: cost control and evaluation of technology improvements as well as managing design changes.\n\nImproving fleet-wide vessel performance at PGS to a very high level; mostly achieved without major capex through a consistent improvement plan, interaction with sales, fostering best practice and diligent selection of equipment. A significant component of the succes was also due to the cooperation with streamer and electronics manufacturers, whereby very strict pre-delivery testing was introduced. The operations included a successful deepwater 4C operation.\n\nManaging a large division supporting a global fleet of 12 seismic vessels with over four hundred persons offshore and onshore in my reporting line.\n\nProfessional background in commercial, operational, technical and geophysical aspects of marine seismic service industry. \n\u2018Soft\u2019 skills: negotiator, facilitator, bridge builder, solution seeker.\nStrong proponent of Heath, Safety, Environment and Quality standards",
