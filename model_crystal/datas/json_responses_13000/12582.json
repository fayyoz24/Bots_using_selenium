The conference took place in St. Gallen and Geneva, and for my part included meetings with the Permanent Mission of Australia to the WTO and several meetings with experts and professionals of the WTO, ITC and UNCTAD.\n\nAs a sign of recognition of my participation as the best individual substantive contribution to the negotiations during the Model WTO conference, I was awarded the Honourable Mention (this is the highest award given to a single delegate, awarded to 3 out of 75 delegates).",
