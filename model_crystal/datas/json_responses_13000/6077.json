    "summary": "University lecturer and former ESDC policy analyst turned research and grant advisor, combining over a decade of experience in instructional design, public speaking, peer-reviewed research, and evaluation with the knowledge gained through work in regulatory affairs.\n\nI hold a MA in English from Western University, a PhD in English from the University of Ottawa, and a MPPA from Carleton University's School of Public Policy & Administration. These degrees were funded in part through competitive grants like the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (x5) and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council's Canada Graduate Scholarship (x1); see full details in 'Awards and Honors' below. \n\nI have completed my move to the Netherlands, as of July 2022, and am seeking new connections in higher education for collaboration and knowledge exchange. If you're in Rotterdam, Leiden, or the Randstad more widely -- let's talk.\n\nWhile my current role at Erasmus University Rotterdam carries a focus on research funding in the Dutch and EU academic landscapes, my past roles have included work, research, and teaching on:\n\n- Accessibility, disability, and regulatory policy\n- Regulatory guidance development\n- Stakeholder engagement\n- Public memory and commemorative policy, particularly relating to the two world wars \n- Happiness and wellbeing measurement, especially through international or intranational indexes\n- The history and practices of rhetoric, persuasion, propaganda, and public relations\n- Cultural and arts policy\n- Popular education, especially bridging the gap between academia and youth, seniors, and other members of the public",
