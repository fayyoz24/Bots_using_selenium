    "summary": "Hello!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 I'm passionate about driving innovation and creating exceptional digital products that redefine user experiences with active involvement in growth and digital products experience for +8 years. I thrived on transforming visionary ideas into tangible solutions that resonate with users and business goals. Having actively immersed myself in growth and digital product experiences during this time, I've had the privilege of working within startup ecosystems across the Netherlands, Ireland, Slovenia, and Czechia. Collaborating closely with diverse product and marketing teams, I wholeheartedly embrace agile principles and continuously seek ways to achieve more with less through scalable habits, hard work, and creative thinking. \n\n\ud83d\udd11 My journey has included guiding over +50 startups, empowering their teams to navigate the path to success. Furthermore, I've been honored to share my experience of marketing, digital products, and growth at various events, captivating audiences worldwide with engaging insights. Currently, I focus on delivering effective product experiences by analyzing user behavior data using techniques such as A/B testing and engagement analysis. By incorporating user-centric data throughout the product cycle, I lead & collaborate with UX design, strategy, and engineering teams to develop a comprehensive product experience strategy. Before this, my experience in holistic inbound marketing strategies at HubSpot's head partner agency in Turkey has been invaluable. Additionally, as the former VP of Marketing at AIESEC, I gained profound insights into driving system processes with diverse continental teams. \n\n\ud83c\udf31 Beyond my professional endeavors, I actively engage in voluntary projects, driven by the belief that we can contribute to a better world. As evidence of this belief, I organized an independent TED event called \"TEDxHacettepeUniversity\" with +40 young people. Furthermore, I devoted my time to volunteering with the AIESEC organization, ensuring the well-being of the next generation.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Today, I am an enthusiastic digital product professional, utilizing insights to drive transformative change and deliver measurable results. But moreover, my travels and experiences with various cuisines have provided invaluable life lessons. Exploring the diverse flavors that reflect the culture of the countries I visit is one of my greatest passions. The simple pleasures of good company and exquisite food are among life's most valuable treasures. \n\n\ud83d\udcec Let's connect and make life richer!",
