I am trying to use hieroglyphs in the logotype and in the signage system to reflect the Ancient Egyptian culture and style. I want people to be introduced to hieroglyphs and get used to them through the new identity.

It creates communication channels between people and different variables. Design affects the society and the culture and vice versa. To add to this, it represents the political, economical, cultural, and environmental circumstances. It is well known that design is related to problem solving and the designer\u2019s job description is to solve problems that face customers, users, and the public. nowadays design is not anymore limited to problem solving it goes beyond this stage. In our modern society design is used as a communication tool, to create a visual representation for an idea or a message. Graphic design is not only about type, image, space, and alignment. Its about creative solutions. ",
