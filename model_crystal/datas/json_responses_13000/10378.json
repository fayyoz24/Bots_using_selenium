    "summary": "What always triggered me is how innovations can bring real changes in our lives and the way we do business. Identifying opportunities, adaptation, and being the engine of a team to transform them into profits are the common elements in my career. Looking forward and analytical skills pushed me to different innovative sectors:  International Media, Cable Networks, Telecom, IT Hardware and Software, Data protection and Sustainable Development. Flexibility, result orientation combined with good communication and commercial skills enabled me to work with various sizes and types of enterprises.\nIn a more integrated Europe I decided to go working where I wanted to live : in France where I lived as a Frenchman for 20 years. That is what I mean with \u2018solid international experience\u2019: adapting yourself to different business cultures is much more then just speaking other languages. \nWhen Completel existed only on paper I convinced the founders of this Telecom Operator to include investing in the Grenoble region, where I became Regional Director. We had to built this profit centre from scratch. At the end we proved the investment decision was right and we even became the 1st EBITDA positive region, thanks to my very implicated and motivated team.\nSustainable Development has triggered me since I was a kid. The company I founded it this domain provided services to France largest companies to dispose their used IT hardware in a responsible way. We became a \u2018Gazelle\u201d, a very fast growing company, and were profitable from year 1.\nThe most leverage to achieve the best results I had when I worked with larger companies or large scale start-ups. Today back in NL I\u2019m seeking a position in Management, to lead, to challenge and to be challenged. In an environment that encourages innovative thinking, initiative, and performance. I look forward to joining a team that can benefit from my experience and skills. Interested? Give me a call and let\u2019s have a cup of coffee.",
