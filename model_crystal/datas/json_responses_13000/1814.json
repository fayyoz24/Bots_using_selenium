    "summary": "I am owner of The Wrap Institute and head trainer for Avery Dennison North America.  I am an American who has been based out of Amsterdam since 2007.  I began my wrapping career as a freelance installer in New York City in 1996.  During this time I wrapped around 2000 vehicles along with walls, windows and floors.  After moving to Amsterdam, I came out with my first instructional DVD called Techniques and Tips: Vehicle Graphic Installations.  The next year I came out with 2 more DVDs and began teaching hands on workshops. In Europe I taught workshops for 3M and in the United States I started teaching workshops for Mutoh.  In 2010 I started the Avery Dennison  North American hands-on workshop program and in 2013 added an advanced course as well as a certification program.   As of 2020, I teach hands-on workshps for Avery Dennison North America, Japan, Australia and South Africa along with Alltak Tuning in Brazil.  I also have been a judge in numerous wrap competitions, notably FESPA Wrap Masters, Cambea wrap contest in Brazil and the Irish Wrap Championships.  Since 2014 I have also had the good fortune to coordinate, install and mc the Avery Dennison SEMA booth which has included some legendary installs and designs with fellow wrappers: Jim Miller, Joffrey van der Jagt, John Duever and Chad Parrish.  \n\nIn 2014, I launched The Wrap Institute with my partner Scott Bechtel, owner of Car Wrap City in Dallas.  The Wrap Insitute is an online streaming video platform that started out with 80 instructional videos and  6 years later has over 2000 videos and counting.   The Wrap Insitute is a neutral platform which means that all content is soley based on how to wrap with no agenda other than creating the highest quality, durability and efficiency.  The Wrap Institute now has facilities in Dallas and Munich and offers a wide variety of services: training videos, product and promotional videos, hands-on training and consultation.  Since 2015 The Wrap Institute has had a central booth at the Wrapscon show for NBM with the focus on bringing awareness to the wrap industry.  In 2019, The Wrap Institute partnered with ISA on a multi-tier platform.  The first is a wrap contest called The Never Stop Learning Wrap Contest.  This is an event open to all levels of installers.  We also have created The Wrap Experience which is an innovative learning area for attendees at the show.   The Wrap Institute and ISA have also created a digital badge program for installers.  \n\n",
