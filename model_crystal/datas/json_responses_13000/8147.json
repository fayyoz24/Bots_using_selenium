    "summary": "Allart has worked and lived in Africa for the past 2 decades. His arrival on the continent coincided with its recent acceleration of growth. The multinational companies he has worked for are active in the soft commodity sector and they all started their operations in Africa during this particular period. For each employer he had played an innovating role in developing the local business models before he managed the daily operations that followed as a result. \n\nAt his last employer, ECOM Agroindustrial Corp., one of the world\u2019s leading multinationals in the soft commodity industry, he spent 12 years developing and managing its business operations and sustainable supply chain initiatives across West Africa. Following this period, he has been assisting multinational companies like AGROFORCE, CIBES, PETROFORCE and Royal De Heus, as an independent specialist, with the development of their business models, trades, operations, strategies, processes, and local infrastructures in this newly emerging region.",
