There is a need for a foreign exchange options market where Zimbabwean companies and traders can hedge themselves against foreign currency risks. These instruments have not been traded in Zimbabwe, hence the researcher seeks to outline the fundamentals of foreign currency options, and how foreign currency options have been traded in other advanced markets like the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Seeing that most options are priced using the Black Scholes Model the researcher will seek to highlight the limitations of the Black Scholes model. The researcher will seek to outline the different types of models that are used to price foreign currency options, most of which will be derived from Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). \nFurther the researcher will develop an appropriate foreign currency options pricing model. However to ensure that this is not just an advancement in mathematical modelling, the researcher will henceforth develop a derivatives market trading simulator. This trading simulator (coded in Visual Basic and C++) will allow traders to trade foreign currency options.\n",

            "description": "When investors go into investment deals their main aim is to achieve a great return and while exposing themselves to ideal risk conditions. Various optimization models have been used in determining a favorable investment portfolio. The mean variance theory by Harry Markowizt laid a very strong foundation to optimization of investment portfolios. His method was built mainly on quadratic programming which is an optimization model. The researcher sought to quantify quadratic programming as well as advocate for the use of other improvisation models such as goal programming in solving investment portfolio problems",

During that period as a student in A'level we would initiate social activities, visit children's homes, and also child prisons, to advocate for youth empowerment as well as alleviate the plight of the less privileged in the society. \nI also participated in the National Budget Formulation Conference that was facilitated by NANGO where we sought to deliberate on the 2009 national budget to assert if it was child friendly or not. Using our findings we lobbied with child parliament in Zimbabwe to ensure that the needs of the less privileged children in our society were addressed."
