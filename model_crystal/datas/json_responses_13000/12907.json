Our mission is to empower and support young people by providing the opportunities and necessary skills to be agents of change and sustainable development in the community.\n\nFriendship Village Hanoi provides medical care, physiotherapy, education and vocational training to Vietnamese children with disabilities caused by Agent Orange. On behalf of Minor Global Awareness, we have written a handbook through Participatory Action Research to help new volunteers with their orientation process. For the Movement Class, I built some games with the children. To make the class more effective, we developed disability-specific curriculums. For the older children, we set up an English class as well as an English class for the deaf children. Finally, we renovated the gym where we organize Movement Class.",
