These companies were too small to justify their own I.T. staff but large enough to be able to benefit from a solid server infrastructure.\n\nWe offered a complete range of services to compliment the core SLA (service level agreements), with particular success in website development, search engine optimisation and pay-for click campaigns. \n\nOur customer base grew rapidly, enabling a secure recurring revenue base.\n\nIn 2006 I decided the time was right to move on to new challenges, and sold the company as a going concern, before moving to Iceland.",
