    "summary": "I loved biology since the fifth grade of the elementary school, from the first contact with the enigmatic cell, it was love at first sight.\n \nOver time, I've toyed, in one way or another with this field. In the 9th grade from high school, I got 1st place at the biology Olympiad in Timis county.\n \nIn the 2nd year of faculty, I was an Erasmus scholar at Landau campus in Germany, Koblenz-Landau University.\n \nAfter graduation, I worked as a biologist in Medlife to do an internship of six months, required for my adherence in  OBBCSSR, to obtain my practice license in medical laboratories.\n\nAlso I was a biologist at the Sante Clinic, in a wonderful professional team and with valuable people.\n\nI like to meet new people and learn things all the time. If I've aroused your interest, do not hesitate to write to me and we discuss more details about what you are interested in about me.\n",
