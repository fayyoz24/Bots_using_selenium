We were interested how drinks that are popular between the youngsters nowadays, influence both of the above mentioned processes. \nWe chose four different drinks (homemade wine, Coca-Cola, juice and tap water and two different media \u2013 simulated gastric fluid and 0, 01 M HCl ) and to release of paracetamol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin was investigated. These three active ingredients, which were in the pharmaceutical forms of the tablets were added to the dissolution vessels that contained the medium and drink and the temperature was held in specified limits. \nWith that we tried to simulate the biological conditions in stomach. \nAlso, we use tap water, as a medium to see how an active ingredient would behave, if we had only water in our stomach, instead of gastric juice.\nResults showed that the type of a drink influences the amount and the rate of release of the active ingredient and has influences pH of media, although not significantly. The highest influence of drinks on dissolution was observed with norfloxacine and the smallest with ciprofloxacine, regardless of what kind of media we used, \nNorfloxacine showed the greatest influence on pH profile of media and the paracetamol had the smallest effect.",

            "description": "The virtual reality (VR) Game \u201cBug Off Pain\u201d is based on the idea of using spider venom toxins to make better painkillers for the future, with VR being used as an innovative approach to science communication and public engagement.\n \nBug Off Pain is an immersive and educational VR experience that places the viewer inside the brain and shows them first-hand the molecular system in our brains that allows us to sense pain. The game consists of two parts; first, it teaches you about what you see in the brain (regarding the different cell functions and the proteins in these cells that are crucial in pain pharmacology). Then the experience gets even better when the spiders start crawling, injecting their venom and you can choose, by trial and error, which spider venom is capable to shut down the pain and which is not. More blocking, more points for you! The experience ends after you\u2019ve found a perfect venom which blocks one specific protein and results in \"pain over\".\n \nThe game was launched on Halloween weekend, the 27th of October 2017, as one of the main attractions of Norwich Science Festival. Bug Off Pain had been launched on two different platforms; high-end Oculus Rift and its cheaper version \"Google Cardboard\" (scan the QR code via www.bugoffpain.com) which allows you to play Bug Off Pain straight from your sofa at home.\n \nWe hope you would find our VR game \"Bug Off Pain\" to be an engaging way of learning about science and can be used for broader science communication, education and teaching.\n\nAuthors: Lucka Bibic, Justinas Druskis, Samuel Walpole, Jesus Angulo, Leanne Stokes.\nProject leader: Lucka Bibic\n\u00a9 2017 University of East Anglia.
