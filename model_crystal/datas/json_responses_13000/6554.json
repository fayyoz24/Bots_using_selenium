I start from the initial design, cost estimating, preparing the schedule, presenting the results to the management / customer, leading the actual implementation to the project completion, commissioning and handing over to operation, completing documentation.\n\n\u2022\tI lead a life extension projects / contract roll (10 years) of Technology Air Separation Unit (ASU) for production in Litvinov / CZ. I prepared one of the technical solutions for life extension for ASU in Glogow / PL. This is in preparation and cost estimation of dozens projects that are in one comprehensive package. These projects are e.g.:\no\tReplacement of piping systems and vessels.\no\tRenovation of automatic valves and instrumentation.\no\tIncreasing reliability by replacing parts of specific technological units (compressors, coolers, frequency converters, etc.)\no\tReplacement and modification of control systems.\n\n\u2022\tI designed, cost estimated and implemented new or existing Compress Dry Air systems (CDA) such as:\no\tReplacement of cooling towers for the CDA system in Teplice.\no\tProject preparation, presentation and negotiation with the customer about complete renewal of the compressor station and treatment.\n\n\u2022\tI prepared projects for relocation of hydrogen filling stations to new locations (CZ / SK).\n\n\u2022\tI managed the preparation and construction of nitrogen generators.\n\n\u2022\tNitrogen / oxygen backup (s):\no\tPreparation and construction of emergency nitrogen backup for a new polyethylene unit.\no\tPreparation for nitrogen backup expansion (200MT / 5,500Nm3 / hr).\n\n\u2022\tPipe modifications\no\tModification of critical piping (reliability increase) to nitrogen backup.\no\tAutomation of parallel oxygen vent from low pressure oxygen reservoir.\no\tPreparation of projects related to cooling water piping replacement including a new filtration strategy (DN80-DN800).\n\no\tPipework replacement and related modifications for oxygen, nitrogen and CDA.",
