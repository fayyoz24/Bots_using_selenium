    "summary": "I am a keynote speaker, executive coach and expert trainer on topics of Female Leadership & Gender Diversity with a great deal of experience in engineering and technology. \n\nI worked with international clients from all around the \ud83c\udf0d, including Geneva Business School, Maersk, Rabobank, AtlasCopco, Oracle, Wageningen University of Research, Fonterra, PartnerRe and IG&H. \n\nI believe that the world would be a better place for everyone if women would have more influence on the world. \ud83e\udd17 \nThis is why I help women to get more influence on their own careers and on the world and why I help organisations to become more (gender) diverse and truly inclusive. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Here is HOW I can HELP You:\n\n\u2705 Raising awareness about the unconscious gender bias, why and how to fight against it \n\n\u2705 Training female top talent to become more visible, better negotiators, more influential and impactful\n\n\u2705 Coaching higher management members to become more inclusive leaders\n\nI use interactive and practical approach, filled with humour and based on academic research, personal experience of me and my business partners; and leading management literature. \n\nHere is my story:\n\nI've started my career as an engineer specialised in helping historical buildings to stand safe. I have always had a passion for career coaching and I was helping women in getting the job they deserve and getting properly paid for that as well. After getting my PhD and working for many years in the commercial, nonprofit and governmental sector, I realised a big bold truth. \nEven when the number of girls and boys is equal during their study period, the moment you start looking higher in the corporate and/or academic ladder, there are much less women than men. Yes that is still the case! Much less women than men. \n\nTherefore, during the Covid-19 pandemics, I've decided to leave my corporate job to actively help women to get more influence on their own careers and on the world. Because with all my heart I believe that the world would be a better place for everyone if women would lead more negotiation processes, create national policies and corporate strategies, or decide on research funding. \n\n\ud83e\udd17 Book a discovery call with me: https://calendly.com/booking_in_touch/30-minute-meeting-miravasic\n\nDM me or send me an email:  mira@intouchwrm.nl\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Visit my company's website: https://www.intouchwrm.nl/en/\n\nFollow me for daily content about the unwritten rules and office politics, \u2028strategic leadership skills for women and unconscious gender bias",

We help individuals to develop and strategically use leadership skills, share with them the unwritten rules in business and make sure they get more impact and influence on their career and on the world. We introduce gender diversity as a business issue in companies and organisations. We help them to become truly inclusive organisations that value both feminine and masculine working styles. We help organisations to have a happier labour force and a higher rate of job satisfaction for both men and women.\n\nI joined In Touch to make sure gender diversity remains on the world's agenda and help women to get more influence on the world. I am passionate about going beyond empowering women and girls, and I provide them practical tools, tips and inspiration on how to survive and thrive in masculine oriented working environment.",
