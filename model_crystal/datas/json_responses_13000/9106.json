    "summary": "Fijne dag! \n\nMy name is Mirta and I am a passionate RMSc student of Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 looking to use my strong research and academic skills.\n\nI am a huge fan of social sciences, and I believe they are a necessity to private and public sectors. \n\nMy research interest lies in sociology of music and gender (in)equalities within the music industry, both on micro and macro level. I am currently writing my master's thesis on sexualization, objectification and misogyny within turbo-folk lyrics, employing mixed (both quantitative and qualitative) methodology.\n\nBesides academic work, I love fostering cats in need, travelling and singing. I am a semi-professional singer with loads of experience and achieved collaborations with Jacques Houdek, Maja Blagdan, Marko Tolja and many other prominent names in Croatian music industry.\n\nFeel free to message me as I hope I can provide and give new values to you!",
