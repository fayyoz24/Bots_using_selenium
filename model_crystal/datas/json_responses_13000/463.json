In 2016 I was elected President Emerita of the International Institute of Space Law (IISL), having served as its President from 2007-2016 and as Executive Secretary from 1991-2007.

In 2019 I co-authored the 4th edition of 'Introduction to Space Law' (Kluwer).\n\nI am Secretary of the Stichting Space Professionals Foundation (SSPF), which provides funding to 'NL-connected' participants for short duration space-related courses, such as the Space Studies Programme of ISU.\n\nI lectured at many universities worldwide, set up courses in air and space law at the National University of Singapore, and worked as a consultant for a space insurance broker in France and in my own company in The Netherlands.\n\nI currently serve as advisor to or on the board of various organisations, such as Open Lunar Foundation, ASU Interplanetary Initiative, UARX Space, Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC), China Institute of Space Law (CISL) and Mars One, and am a member of the Board of Editors of Air and Space Law (Kluwer).
