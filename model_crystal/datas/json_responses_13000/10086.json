As long as there is enough energy, you can farm anywhere you want to by using our containers. The main materials for these containers are transparent polycarbonate, (allowing use of sunlight) and rock wool (for thermal insulation). In places where sunlight is insufficient for agriculture, efficiency can be increased by using the purple led lights of our containers. Moreover, our customers will not have to deal with learning about vertical agriculture details thanks to our mobile application that provides containers' conditions and crop ripeness, allowing them to know when to visit their containers. If our customers just want fresh products without dealing with farming, we also provide \"city farmers\" for them through the use of our agriculture network. As a result, we also create employment for people with farming skills, especially younger people, eager to learn about agriculture. Even if we are targeting well-off people living in cities desiring fresh products our buy-1-give-\u00bc business model also helps those in disadvantaged areas. With the help of this business model, we can reach not only people in big cities but also people in underdeveloped countries that need healthy food. \n \nWe are the Hustler Elif is a business administration student responsible for the financial and administrative process, the Hipster \u015eeyma is a computer engineering student responsible for designing the application and improving UI/UX, the Hacker Erdem is an electrical and electronics engineering student responsible for developing the special containers and vertical-hydroponic farming systems. All members of the ConFarm believe in the power of agriculture as much as this team can change the world!\n\nPitch Deck\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U82COQAynwoRz07OTAt2xopQk8b98hGeYnrjiuwd-Vs/edit?usp=sharing",
