    "summary": "I am an Architect, specialised in the Conservation of the Architectural Heritage, working as a Technical Expert and Advisor for Living Future Europe [LFE]. For more than a year, I have been collaborating with the New European Bauhaus [NEB] team from the European Commission on behalf of LFE - a NEB partner, and independently, as external evaluator. Also, in October, 2022, I have joined the team of one the firsts NEB based Horizon Europe projects as a Technical Expert in urban renovation. I am currently based in Amsterdam, having previously worked and lived in Paris, Brussels and London. \n\nAs a Cultural Manager in Romania, since 2006, I have developed structured methods of bottom-up urban analysis aiming for the reactivation of the architectural heritage, such as the \u2018Mourning Houses\u2019 project, or \u2018EDRAH - Economic Development in Relation to the Architectural Heritage\u2019, which was tested for the first time in Giurgiu.\n\nAs an Architect for the Belgian Architecture Office ORIGIN - Architecture & Engineering\u2019 specialised in the restoration of historical monuments, in 2018, I had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects, tackling various philosophies of interventions, contextual problematics, scales of intervention, and development phases. This practical experience concluded a formative path that began in 2008 with my work experience as a junior architect at the Romanian - American Architecture Office, \u2018Lauster & Radu\u2019, followed by an internship in 2011 at \u2018LAN Architecture\u2019 in Paris. In 2020, I co-founded an architecture office in Bucharest, ALA Studio, in association with two other female colleagues.\n\nEvery now and then, I do independent research, such as \u2018Bucharest, the little Paris?\u2019 [2010], or the more recent challenge, \u2018The theatres of Fellner & Helmer. Subtle reflections on local specificities and identitary values\u2019, a project supported by the Austrian Embassy in Romania that started in 2020 and it is about to step into the spotlight in the later part of 2023 with a traveling exhibition and multi-media content on a dedicated platform. \n\nFrom the volunteer based project in Bucharest, The Mourning Houses [2006] to the EU funded cross-sectoral international cooperation between more than 30 partners in 7 countries aiming for the sustainable urban rehabilitation of 7 lighthouse projects expected to be operative by 2025, my path has always been a process towards working on regenerating urban spaces and in intercultural contexts, which now comes in-line with this New European Bauhaus movement that I am so honoured, proud and grateful to be part of.",

Based on the results of a sociological study on adolescent attitudes towards national cultural heritage, the project proposes a national awareness and education campaign on the need to protect national cultural heritage and combat vandalism against historical monuments. The campaign calls for alternative education tools - augmented reality, new technologies and media forms, digital interactive education tools and digital art.",
