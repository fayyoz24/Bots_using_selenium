    "summary": "Hello dear viewer! You stumbled upon that crazy student, who felt bored at the lectures and afterward always run to do some \"board meeting\", \"project\" or \"event\" instead of a beer.\n\nDuring my bachelors I felt dissatisfied with largely theoretical nature of the studies, therefore I decided to run multiple of initiatives. Firstly, I led project Tea-at-5, where hundreds of students had a chance to practice conversations in English directly with foreigners. Lately,  I co-founded the first club of psychologist at our university, where we delivered workshops and brought alumni and external speakers to give practical advices. \n\nHowever, most of my activity of my bachelor studies belonged to youth leadership organization AIESEC which feed my need for experiences the most. From very first year I become a board member at AIESEC university office and later became a trainer at country level in Slovakia. All this knowledge & experience I utilized to get to a full-time position of country head of HR at AIESEC in Nepal. There I supported intensive growth and re-shaping of the organization, that was still recovering after massive earthquakes that happened a year before.\n\nLastly, I had also great opportunity to work at HR department in Dell in Slovakia. I am very grateful for a chance to meet a lot of HR professionals from whom I learned a lot about how human resources operates in the international company. \n\nThough above experiences shaped who I am, I'm would more likely define myself by my 3 core values of: Constant Improvement, Education & Honesty and my personal mission to contribute to improvement & innovation in education sector. \n\nAdditionally, my current hobbies include acting&public speaking, painting, movies, travelling (34 countries), mountain trekking & my baby siblings. \n\nI'm always looking for cooperation or idea where I can contribute my skills and experience.",
