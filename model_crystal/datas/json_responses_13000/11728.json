Since most of my team members were students and as I was in elementary school I have had an opportunity to cooperate at very young age with people older than me from whom I learned a lot. This was a new, exciting experience for me as a young person, to spend time and to learn from older colleagues and to feel that my work is contributing to the team and being valued in order to make things work well."
