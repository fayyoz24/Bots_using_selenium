    "summary": "I believe in the power of technology as a force for good in society and a competitive differentiator for Shell. \n\nI lead an organisation of more than 3,000 people who develop and deploy new technologies today, creating more and cleaner energy for the future. These teams are based at major technology centres in Amsterdam, Houston and Bangalore, and at smaller technical centres located close to Shell\u2019s customers and partners. I am committed to creating workplace diversity and an inclusive environment that allows everyone to bring their whole selves to work and be the best they can be.\n\nAs EVP Technology, I am responsible for new technology development and external technology commercialisation activities across areas as diverse as geology, chemistry, engineering and digital technologies. Our activities range from research and development programmes delivered in-house and through collaborations with external partners, to deployment of technologies across Shell\u2019s operations, as well as catalyst manufacturing and sales, and technology licensing and technical services to third parties. I also oversee the company\u2019s digitalisation activities to apply proven and new digital technology solutions to Shell\u2019s existing businesses and emerging new business models. \n\nThis is my private LinkedIn page, the views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of Shell.  \n\nI invite you to read my latest speech on digitalisation and the energy transition.",
