    "summary": "Born and raised in the warm northern Mexico, I am a woman of restless mind and passionate about urban landscapes and sustainable urban life. I have a BA in Architecture and a MSc in Urban Mangement and Development by Erasmus University Rotterdam, with a specialization on Infrastructure and Green Cities. \n\nAs of 2017, and on the occasion of the Mexico-Germany Dual Year, I was involved in a series of International Workshops in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, the Higher Technical School of Architecture of Barcelona (ETSAB) and UDLAP, around social urbanism, spatial planning and urban resilience.\n\nIn 2019 I joined the team of LABICI, a Mexicali-based NGO, as Urban Project Coordinator, where I developed, managed and coordinated community-led projects around road safety and placemaking.\n\nSince 2021 I am based in the Netherlands. After finishing my masters degree I am working as Project Coordinator at BYCS, an Amsterdam-based NGO with the belief that bicycles change cities, and cities change the world. My professional expertise revolve around active mobility, urban governance, gender equity, social innovation and infrastructure management.",
