    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my LinkedIn page! \n\nMy name is Jing Li and am currently working as an assistant professor at the Department of Business Law in Tilburg University (the Netherlands). I received her PhD in law from Tilburg University in 2015, and also hold master degrees in Finance & Law and International Commercial Arbitration. My research interests primarily lie in the legal and regulatory issues about the alternative investment funds industry and non-listed business forms in China, in particular Chinese hedge funds (trusts), venture capital / private equity, sovereign wealth funds, private secondary markets, and governance of entrepreneurial firms. Before joining the academia, I have also practiced Chinese law for three years mainly in the area of cross-border M&As, joint ventures, and private equity transactions, including with Paul Hastings Beijing Office and German Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to this experience of being an practitioner, I am also keenly interested in the topics of innovation in legal profession and education in general. \n\nI am also an accredited Dutch-Chinese literary translator certified by the Dutch and Flemish Literature Foundation. The love for language and translation has already been part of me since I was young, but now I am proud to say that I managed to make it into a career that I can pursue!",

On the basis of my PhD thesis, I aim to continue high-quality academic research on the legal and regulatory issues relating to the dynamic relationship between entrepreneurship, private firms, and alternative investment funds in China. In particular, by focusing on the role of government in regulating the fund industry, I also expect to shed on the broad but important question of fairness and efficiency. My other research interests lie broadly in the legal profession in China, and how does it interacts with the globalization of the legal profession in general.",
