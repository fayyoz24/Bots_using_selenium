We also won a beach soccer tournament.\n\nAlongside this I coached at all levels of the TCIFA Academy setup, with my main responsibility being coaching the Under 17's Boys National Team. I also coached the Women's National Team, the Under 15 Boys, Under 12 Boys and Under 7's co education grassroots programme. This also included me coordinating the grassroots programme one day whilst the TCIFA Technical Director was away.\n\nFinally, I organised the donation of hundreds of pairs of football boots, shin pads, goalkeeper gloves, goals and full kits to players on the islands.\n\nA massively rewarding trip and one I would not hesitate to organise again!",
