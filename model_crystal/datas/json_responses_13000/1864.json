These animals usually live in subtropical to temperate forests of eastern Asia. It also revealed a growing human-wildlife conflict with the depredation of livestock and raiding of fig orchards by bears, probably driven by food shortage due to climate change.\n\nTraining in aspects of animal monitoring research was also provided to Iranian counterparts by the Rewilding Foundation.\n\n",

The integral approach for this - as a first investigation is currently published in a living document called an EcoChapter, as part of a Strategic or development plan for the municipality. \n\nI recently performed an ecological appraisal of the region and its close relationship with the future national park, a pre-feasibility study for the rewilding with European bison and developed green business models based on success-stories elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time I am developing a collaborative framework to effectuate a community interest group of dedicated experts (entrepreneurs, teachers & students from Romanian and foreign institutes, researchers, companies and other exemplary community sustainability organisations) working and learning together to achieve a unique demonstrative working model for ecological sustainability.",

Hence this initiative to expose their plight to the scientific and public world. \n\nThe field research is currently focussed on the application of the 'Mostela' a camera trap box able to photo capture individual weasels and stoats. The presence of small mustelids is related to habitat features or qualities and prey availability.\n\nI am a co-founder of this group, active as field researcher, board member, author, public reader and as webmaster. \n\nI am also raising public attention to (fund study of the) ecotoxicological effects of second generation anticoagulatant rodenticides (SGARs) on small and other Mustelids in the Netherlands, proving indeed to be so as shown by studies elsewhere.",

This was performed to analyse the recovery of raptor breeding populations after the ban on the persistent pesticide DDT and its residues (DDE) in the environment.\n\nThis involved intensive yearly inventory of raptor breeding territories, monitoring of breeding success (fledgling based) and of survival of parent or territorial birds using a novel molt feather ID system. Yearly results were reported and collated in scientific publications by Dr. Paul Opdam et al. of the Dutch Research Institute for Nature Management ( Rijksinstituut voor Natuurbeheer, RIN).",
