    "summary": "Process ongoing change and change your process(es)!\n\nI could tell you about the 20 or so years of experience as learning and change process specialist; about my deep expertise in group/process design & facilitation, knowledge management, strategic communication, change management, monitoring & evaluation. About my experience and interest in working with individuals, organisations and multi-stakeholder collaboratives. About my strong footing in non-profit development work in gender, agriculture, water/sanitation/hygiene [WASH] in Africa, Latin America, Europe.\n\nBut really, what matters is this: If you care about improving this world, and want to work on this with people in an intelligent and respectful manner (for each other and for the environment); if you want your folks to connect deeply, meaningfully, in collective intelligence and heart, I\u2019m here to help! \n\nMy mission is to help people, networks and organisations realise, value and use the power of collaboration & learning. I want to work with you and help understand, use and develop your collaboration capacity (your\u2019 process literacy\u2019) so you can connect with people deeply and effectively, across functions, disciplines and cultures. And particularly to get a crack at complex problems we can't address on our own...\n\nMy work is thus social: I want to help people connect, learn and transform themselves, the communities they are part of and discover new networks and ways of being and doing. For this I work with participatory facilitation and engagement techniques, face-to-face and online. I have managed, facilitated, trained, coached people and 150 groups (of 4 up to 300 people).  \n\nMy work is also analytical: I love concepts, strategies, processes and approaches; I engage in action-research, develop proposals, strategies, concept notes, working plans, tools, training materials, thought pieces, papers, articles and particularly blog posts around knowledge management/learning and group facilitation. \n \nI love languages and speak five of them at the moment (French, English, Dutch, Spanish, German) -\nwith some notions of Amharic (the main language in Ethiopia). \n\nMy vision: a world where people realise their connection to the world and each other, become and help others become leaders through empathy, personal reflection and collaboration. Love, light and learning for a better world. \n\nMore information on: http://km4meu.wordpress.com/about-me/",
