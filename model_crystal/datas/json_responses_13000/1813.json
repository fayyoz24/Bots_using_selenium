THat\u2019s why I believe that change starts with you, actually, it starts with me. Thats the reason why everything I do, see feel and create is with my heart. It is my purpose to inspire you, that everything is within you, it is all around you and created by you. \n\nMy biggest inspiration is mother nature, the beautiful animals and our galactic universe. They teach me everyday that the smallest teach us the biggest lessons. With the biggest message. They teach us that the smallest whisperers are the message of the heart.\n\nMy heart whispers everyday, that we are peacekeepers of our planet. We protect her, our animals, our nature, our children and teach them that our mother earth provides us, gives us all that we need, if we love her, care for her and ask her. That is why I lead with my heart, I speak with my heart, and I create with my heart and I always listen to my heart. \u2028\u2028Please connect with me, if you believe that small voices can have a big message and we can talk from the heart.",
