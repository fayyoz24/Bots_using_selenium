    "summary": "I am an open-minded explorer with..\n\n\t.. an entrepreneurial attitude: Always exploring new industries and building innovative programs from scratch, uncovering new perspectives and turning them into tangible results,\n\t.. conceptual skills: Translating complex global trends and relevant challenges in appealing and actionable programmes, carefully addressing the variety of stakeholder interests and political sensitivities \n\t.. people skills; Developing formal and informal teams, leading them through deep listening, empowerment and most of all love. Never shying away from the questions that need to be asked.\n\nAs an expedition leader I am intrigued by the issues that truly matter. Where do you/ your company want or need to go? And why, why you, and why now or why not? To answer these strategic questions we\u2019ll build a team that\u2019s brave enough to go out there and explore. That will find you the answers you need, through experiments and validated learning, through personal development and the power of stories on how they got there in the first place. Always operating on the border of various systems or worlds, as that\u2019s the place where radical innovation can happen. I love to work with multi-nationals, start-ups and non-profits simultaneously, creating unexpected alliances when of value. Especially interested in the development of sustainable new business models, building of unholy alliances, and the unleashing of talent. Areas of expertise: sustainability, systems innovation, leadership development, and creation of (mass) movements.\n\nIf you want to know more, do contact me at: carin@offthemap.nl.",
