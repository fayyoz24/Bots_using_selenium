    "summary": "My background is in reservoir engineering with classical academic knowledge of Fluid mechanics and subsurface hydrodynamics. Aquired practical knowledge in: Petroleum Engineering, Energy Trading, Oil and Gas Field Exploration, Production, Development, Drilling, Reservoir Engineering, Front End Engineering & construction. Past ten years, I was occupied in oil & gas upstream operations, subsurface studies, implementation of integrated projects and upstream business development.\n\nMy strength is in combination of my experience in integrated subsurface knowledge base, and my skills in managing people, operations and assets. Therefore I can function either as a team leader or an individual in areas of multidisciplinary subsurface and front-end engineering studies and its construction realisation on-site, business development, integrated project management, exploration /development / production practices.\n\nI possess of an experience in providing of \u201cturn-key\u201d solutions for both upstream green field development and brown field rehabilitation; and am able to manage an entire life cycle of the oil/gas field from exploration- to abandonment stage. An example of a successfully completed project was the gas-condensate production assets development project in Tomsk region (W. Siberia), where the entire subsurface and surface facilities of Ust-Silga gas-condensate field were brought \u201cfrom scratch\u201d to the delivery of the refined gas to the Gazprom\u2019s gas pipeline system ( http://www.lngworldnews.com/alliance-oil-starts-gas-production-in-tomsk-region-russia/ ).",

By 3D seismic and wildcat drilling, the recoverable gas reserves, proved 17 bln m3 and probable 55 bln m3, were ascertained. Annual gas production of 700 mln m3, starts in February 2013, currently the gas first field - Ust-Silga under commissioning. Together with a consultant partner, I co-authored a unique subsurface development concept by drilling long (500m) slanted well drainages within tight Jurassic reservoir of thin, layered and folded nature, which turned to be economic. In 3 years time the following has been built and put into operation: 9 km all-the-year-round road built on swamps, 5 wildcat wells, 200 sq km 3D field seismic with interpretation, 5 slanted gas production wells (with 500 m horizontal slotted liners in Jurassic layered strata), gas processing plant (purified gas, propane-butane fraction, disel), power station for own needs, 42 km D128 inch gaspipeline to transconitinetal pipeline system of Gazprom, certified metering station. Number of employees in three years increased from 5 (at the time of license aquisition) to 53 technical, logistics, financial etc specialists.

I've created this business for Gazprombank \"from scratch\" in order to manage both its exploration programmes and just acquired by Gazprombank E & P license rights. The principal purpose - exploration and preparation of hydrocarbon reserves for the consequent industrial development. Principal activities field exploration planning, seismic field surveying and processing, exploration wildcat drilling, etc. LLC \u201cGazoil\u201d is managing 11 exploration licenses on Gydan peninsula in Western Siberia of total exploration area of 38000 km2, resulted in discovery of a number of oil and gas fields with 300 mln ton possible recoverable reserves of oil equivalent. Other major studies and activities during this period: consulting and supporting Gazprombank on exploration and production opportunities within PSA programmes in Libya and in Central Africa. Potential reserves and PSA-numbers calculation. Representing Gazprom in Tripoli on EPSA-IV bid rounds. Feasibility studies on development of Gydan Peninsula and Barents see fields.

First time in Sidanco\u2019s history, delivered a number of horizontal wells, with record production rates - varying within 2000 and 5000 barrels of waterless crude oil per day per well. Introduced the cluster 3D hydrodynamic simulation to substantiate the rational well placing and the type of completion, the modern geosteering technologies in drilling. \nNews reference: https://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/5255/sidanco_starts_output_from_1st_horizontal_well_at_vke_field/\nIntroduced 3D hydrodynamic modeling for planning waterflood and workover activities. I established the process of building and ranking the investment portfolios with documental support, and submitting them to Sidanco. Later on, Sidanco has disseminated this practice throughout all its subsidiaries.\nField development studies for 3 fields,  3D seismic survey 500 km2 for one field, formulating strategy realized in investment proposals for fields development, increased to 17 rig drilling operations, workowers, idle stock reactivation program, sidetrack wells and infill well drilling program, hydraulic fracturing etc.",
