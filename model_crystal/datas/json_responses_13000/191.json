    "summary": "I am a professional and committed English teacher with over 8 years of teaching experience who enjoys helping learners succeed. As an expatriate who has lived and taught in Canada, Hong Kong and Germany, I have worked with people from diverse cultures and educational backgrounds. I have always viewed teaching as more than simply knowledge acquisition; communication is a vital part of the human experience and teaching a language allows people to share experience, knowledge and skills. Through individually tailored lessons, open communication and well-defined outcomes, I help my clients meet their learning goals. \n\nMy areas of expertise in language training include:\n\nBusiness English \nEnglish for young leaners\nGMAT preparation (verbal section)\nWriting coaching and editing",
