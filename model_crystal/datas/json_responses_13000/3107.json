Besides, within the scope of this project, a comprehensive morphological analysis will  be carried out for  all seven  basins:  i) Ramganga, ii) Barak, iii) Narmada, iv) Cauvery, v) Kuttiadipuzha, vi) Peechi, and vii) Mangalam.",

Due to the morphological behaviour of the river, navigation is subject to hindrance in some locations and frequent maintenance is being carried out. Morphological changes of the river are predicted to increase the number of nautical bottlenecks in the coming years. \nAccordingly, the decision was then taken to create a morphological model that covers the entire Rhine branches in the Netherlands.  A detailed numerical quasi-3D morphological model based on the numerical software package Delft3D has been set up. The model covers, nearly, the entire Rhine system in the Netherlands. The model is used to analyse the long-term large-scale evolution of the system. The model aims to provide a tool for river managers, which enables assessment of the morphological response of the river to different maintenance plans as well as changes in dredging activities for a sustainable navigation channel.  \n",

These dams are vital for ensuring the water security of the country; and they also constitute a major responsibility in terms of asset management and safety. In April 2012, the Central Water Commission (CWC) with assistance from the World Bank, embarked upon the six year Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) at an estimated cost of Rs. 2100 crore. The project originally envisaged the rehabilitation and improvement of about 223 dams within four states - namely, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha & Tamil Nadu - with provision for taking up some more dams in other states; the actual numbers may vary owing to the addition / deletion of dams during implementation (click current status). The project will also promote new technologies and improve Institutional capacities for dam safety evaluation and implementation at the Central and State levels and in some identified premier academic and research institutes of the country. The Central Dam Safety Organisation of Central Water Commission, assisted by an Engineering and Management Consulting firm, is coordinating and supervising the Project implementation.",
