I share my thoughts in Indian universities; yet consider myself a student of the fine arts, working in visual arts.\n\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\nAs my interest in reading and writing developed, I read history of art, as well as the economic, social and financial history of countries round the world. I also read the philosophies of the world and read about the human mind and its development, as described in various philosophical writings, in western and eastern cultures. Wanting to dig deep into Eastern thought, I became a researcher and activist of the human mind. When I read and tried to understand Spinoza, what did I feel?\nI questioned myself many times and walked through levels of positive and negative thinking. Why does immigration take place? The idea of finding a land which is promising in every way makes us move around the world. My situation was not complex; I followed my intuitions. Being sensitive by nature, I became a pathfinder of the mind. I needed to observe myself. I started to study myself, following different paths, as opportunities came my way.",

Even if we go as far back as Mohenjo-Daro, or ancient Egypt, we find artists travelling to other lands, in order to further develop their art. We find that the artist has always thrown himself into the tumult of new ideas. The entire span of the history of art consists in the rise of diverse cultures. The history of art is hidden in the nooks and crannies of cultural traditions. During my stay in Holland, I discovered this, not only in Indian culture but also in the culture of other countries. When archaeological investigation uncovers layers beneath layers of the past, pages of history can only then be filled. As we read those pages, we see before our eyes like moving pictures, the images of a society, its customs, and their transformation into a cultural tradition. These provoke us to think further. We start comparing, looking for resemblances, contrasts, differences, and equivalences and endlessly discuss them. As we go on exploring these, at innumerable levels, we recall, at times the prayers sung at school, the speeches made about the struggle for freedom at elocution competitions, the glorious careers of freedom-fighters, the teachings of the saints, stories and tales from history and mythology, schools of philosophy and ideology and so forth. At the same time, one sees that in the countries of Europe, there are tourists and students who undertake long journeys in order to see different cultures for themselves. They make efforts to understand other cultures and to extend their own knowledge. They try to study the finer aspects of different cultures.",

In 1990, I was engaged in publishing my first book of poems in Marathi, while holding an exhibition of paintings which were based on 10 selected poems from the same book entitled \u201cDashak\u201d (DECADE). When the exhibition was over, I was going through sentimental turmoil. Modes were different in circumstances, division in family, changes in parental property. Emotionally, I was discovering myself. I was reading books on India. A critique on Tukaramachi gatha, written by Dilip Chitre, made me think one step further for the challenge which were waiting. In an exhibition of \u201cDashak\u201d (Decade) I had painted an image of Vithoba that still makes me think innovatively in emotion.",
