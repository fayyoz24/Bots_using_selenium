    "summary": "I have a PhD in chemistry from the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence (GCCE) University of York, UK. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Chemistry, and a teaching qualification (Post Graduate Diploma in Education). \nMy PhD research covered a diverse area of synthetic organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and the synthesis, characterization and application of porous materials for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis towards the conversion of bio-renewable resources into top value platform chemicals for the generation of variety of non-fossil chemicals and fuels. I also have experience in the synthesis and purification of organic ligands (NHC) and metal complexes and their characterization by methods including NMR spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, CHN analysis, Thermogravimetry, ICP-MS, XPS and Mossbauer Spectroscopy.\nI am currently a Lecturer in Chemistry at University of Applied Sciences Arnhem and Nijmegen (Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen) in Netherlands.\n2018 to 2020 I was a Higher Education Lecturer at University Centre, Leeds, United Kingdom. \nPrior to this, I spent 6 years as a lecturer in Chemistry from 2008-2014 at a Higher Education Institution in Nigeria.\nI have a proven track record of journal publications in both high impact journals including ChemSusChem, ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering, and other Pan African Journals of Science. I also have a lot of conferences and workshops presented papers",
