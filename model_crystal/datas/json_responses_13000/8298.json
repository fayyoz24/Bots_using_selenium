    "summary": "Software developer | Machine learning engineer\n\nWould like to work in one/more than one of the following areas: machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, speech/sound recognition, self-driving cars, autonomous agents, robotics, assistive devices for disabled persons, quantum computing, aerospace, research in computer science or physics...\n\nFrom my childhood I was trying to understand how do I think? How do people think? It was right in front of me, I was able to \u201csee\u201d my thoughts and \u201cfeel\u201d how they are transforming into each other. It seemed so easy! Why can\u2019t we just implement the same in the machine? I was drawing rectangles in my school notebook with various phrases inside them and connecting these rectangles with arrows. I didn\u2019t know it was orgraph or state machine, but I was imagining, that some computer could read these phrases then go along arrows and select next phrase and so on. I was enthusiastically reading classical SciFi like \u201cThe Invincible\u201d of Stanis\u0142aw Lem or Asimov series about robots and thinking about how it will be possible in reality?",
