I achieved this by utilising my skills in building strong interpersonal relationships and by using a strengths based approach. This involved being \u2018matched\u2019 with a young person to support one-on-one as well as facilitating group work.\n\nI volunteered not only at the YMCA vocational school but, on request, helped to implement a trial of the project within a state school in QLDs south-east region.\n\nAs part of my involvement, I was also involved in developing a mentoring resource intended as a national resource for the YMCA mentoring program. This collaborative resource enabled me to utilise my writing skills and team work to produce a guide detailing the expectations for new staff as well as a program outlines centred around activities and engagement resulting in socially upskilling young people.  \n"
