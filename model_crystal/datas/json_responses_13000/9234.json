    "summary": "Dynamic Global Category Manager with 10+ years in Category Management and Procurement. Adaptable, with solid cultural intelligence and 13-year expat experience, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to live and work in the Netherlands, Cyprus, North Macedonia, Sweden, and Greece.\n\nNeedless to say I love traveling and, while a former amateur football player, my current hobbies include vinyl record collection and karting (since the closest I got to F1 has been watching live races).\n\nAs a person I am considerate, reliable, and curious. I have always enjoyed working with numbers and rationale, this is why I have studied Economics, Logistics Management and, more recently, the Six-Sigma principles. But besides all these, throughout my career I found great excitement in coaching people, particularly new recruits.\n\nIn my work, I love developing strategies, managing risk, and driving sustainable partnerships through collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I highly value and thrive in quality-focused and customer-centric working environments. My business acumen is strong and I am fond of fact-based decision-making.\n\nI get excited about opportunities where I am able to dig into current processes and data, identify patterns and improvement possibilities, discuss findings with stakeholders, do market research and come up with efficient solutions.",
