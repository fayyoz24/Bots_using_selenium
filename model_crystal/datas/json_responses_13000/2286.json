    "summary": "Gijs Vermeer received an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Technological University of Delft (TUD) in 1965. After military service he joined Shell Research where he carried out seismic processing research, followed by eight years of seismic processing in Shell Expro (London) and NAM (The Netherlands). After another seven years in research, now on seismic interpretation, Gijs joined Shell Canada in 1988, where he was involved in stratigraphic interpretation of carbonate reefs. In 1991 he went back to Shell Research, this time to work on seismic data acquisition techniques. \nIn February 1997 he started 3DSymSam - Geophysical Advice, a company specialized in 3D survey design and analysis. He is the author of \u201dSeismic Wavefield Sampling\u201d published in 1990 by the SEG in its Geophysical Reference Series. He also authored a number of papers on 3D symmetric sampling and related subjects. His main interests are seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing, and their interrelationships. February 2001 he obtained a PhD at Delft University of Technology with a dissertation titled \u201cFundamentals of 3-D seismic survey design\u201d. A commercial version of this thesis was published in October 2002 as \u201c3-D seismic survey design\u201d by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. \nSince 2001 many technological developments occurred in the field of seismic data acquisition. Many of those developments have been captured in a Second Edition of \"3D seismic survey design\", which was published by the SEG in October 2012. From time to time further supplemental notes will be published on his website.\nHe is a member of EAGE, SEG, and CSEG.\n\nSpecialties: 3D seismic survey design",
