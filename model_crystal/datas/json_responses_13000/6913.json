    "summary": "I am a business controller with a hands-on attitude and senior level experience in the field of accounting and finance. I am able to come up with pragmatic solutions to support the business and I enjoy improving financial processes and reporting. My key strengths are my ability to bring structure and to create reports tailored to the needs of the business. I am excellent at managing large and complex datasets and adept at pivots, lookups and writing macros.\n\nCurrently, I work as a Controller at Greif Netherlands BV, managing our forecasting, budgeting, monitoring the financial close off, counselling the GL, AP, AR departments and supporting the business with scenario analysises and other ad hoc reports, explaining results and following up on discrepancies between expectations and actuals.\n\nPreviously, I worked in the Shared Service Centre of Greif in Hungary as an Accounting Team Leader, supervising and providing guidance to a team of 4-6 General Ledger accountants supporting 4 countries. I've set up new processes, improved existing ones and migrated some from the business to the SSC.\n\nMy competencies: providing insightful analysis, implementing controls and new tools, business partnering, motivating team members, developing more junior members of staff, explaining financial terms to non-finance professionals, effective communication and a can-do attitude.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not on the job I enjoy computer and board games and I am in love with all things nerdy.",
