    "summary": "After 35 great years in Unilever, of which more than 20 years in director's roles across R&D, Engineering & Technology and Manufacturing, I founded in 2017 Askainos Consulting b.v.. \n\nIn the last 5 years I had the pleasure, as Manufacturing & Technology consultant, to work for the Capri-Sun Group and a.o. selected new pouch filling technology, for Greyston Bakery, Tony\u2019s Chocolonely and for Dara\u2019s ice cream creating conceptual designs for new factories including selection of main production technologies; supported Oppo Brothers Ice Cream and Nijland Foods in 3pm contract analysis and negotiations, Northern Bloc ice cream in evaluation of new factory building; was involved as technology expert in Due Diligences assessing Althea, Belgium (chocolate) and Little Moons, UK (ice cream). \n\nAs Principal Consultant I deliver Manufacturing, Technology and Innovation expertise to FMCG leaders. I support them in dealing with challenges as: how to develop a site Masterplan and how to scope and write a brief for new production facilities or a factory extension? But also: how can I improve my Supply Chain organisation?  The performance of my factory? Optimise my product portfolio? How can I get more synergy out of factory networks in the country or around the globe? How can I set-up a multi-year value improvement project portfolio? \n\nAs a knowledgeable and challenging sparring partner I can support Boards and teams crack their strategic and tactical challenges and set-up sound projects. Inspiring, advising, coaching. Balancing content and process is key to reach the desired business impact. \n\nI am a strategic thinker, curious, creative and well versed in working with (virtual) teams. Having lived in 4 European countries and working in roles that made me travel across the globe has greatly strengthened my interpersonal and cultural sensitivities, I connect easily with people on all levels. Deeply rooted in the FMCG world in general, I have specialist knowledge in the area of Ice Cream. \n\nIn my 5 years as Global Supply Chain Program Director for Ben & Jerry's I have had day-to-day experience in what it takes to run and grow a purpose-led business. \n\nMy unique selling point is that I can give the support in Manufacturing & Technology with a sound understanding of the Marketing, R&D, and End-to-End Supply Chain aspects. From local to global, also in an acquisition / due diligence. \n\nAskainos Consulting: your Sparring Partner for the Manufacturing & Technology side of your Business.\n\nContact me, Ask Askainos!\ne-mail albert@askainos.nl tel +31681524480\n",
