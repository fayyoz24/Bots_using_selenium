    "summary": "Over a period of more than 10 years of language teaching, I have been developing a revolutionary new language-learning programme.  It is centred exclusively around structure, focussing on key elements of language that are essential to proficient communication.  It is visual and logical, building up from the simplest of structures, with lots of repetition, at the student's own pace.  \n\nHaving taught English, Dutch, French and German at a variety of levels, I have felt let down by materials on the market, be it books, online courses or apps.  The progression is too quick and too much is assumed of students, who may well have little or no understanding about the subject.  \n\nMy system is centred around simple logic.  The key to ability in confidence and my aim is to boost it.\n\nFind out about the system, and much more on: https://cup-of-english.com",
