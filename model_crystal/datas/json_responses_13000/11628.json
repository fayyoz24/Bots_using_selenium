Developed signal quality analysis algorithms for multi-sensor inputs for fusion. Methods developed use statistical methods implemented in Matlab and machine learning methods using scikit-learn and TensorFlow in python.\n2. Designed a collaborative fusion model for heartbeat detection from multimodal signals, namely electrocardiogram and photoplethsymogram, using wavelet features in the transform domain. The algorithms were implemented and tested in Matlab.\n3. Designed a multi-resolution and multi-modal fusion network for second-by second sleep apnea detection by fusing electrocardiogram, peripheral oxygen saturation, and abdominal movement. The individual models and fused models use a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network structure and was implemented and tested using TensorFlow.\n4. Developed a multi-level fusion network for atrial fibrillation detection from electrocardiogram and photoplethsymogram signals to improve upon the detection accuracies obtained from the individual sensors. The multi-level fusion network was implemented and tested using PyTorch.\n\nSkilled in project management, manuscript preparation, and grant applications.\n\nCoursework credited: Advanced Machine Learning, Academic Writing for Science for Postgraduate students, Machine Learning, Experimental Design and Statistics for Engineers, Creative Thinking and Innovation, Mathematica for Research, Teaching Assistant for EECE.",
