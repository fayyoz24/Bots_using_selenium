    "summary": "Proverbs 3:13 - Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding.\n\nCurrently I am studying at the Erasmus University Rotterdam for my Master in Tax Law. After high school I started with Tax Law due to the fact that it assembles my passions which are strategy, policy, reasoning and economics. Next to my studies I have increased my Tax Law knowledge at BDO, EY and PwC as an intern.\n\nI am Christian and believe that we are given the oppurtunity to develop ourselves to the fullest as human beings; to use these talents and make ethical and just decisions.\n\nAfter work I can be found playing chess, cycling or on the couch reading a book. Besides those hobby's, my biggest passion will remain travel. My favourite destinations have been Hawaii, Iceland and Rwanda.",
