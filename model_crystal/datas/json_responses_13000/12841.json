Developed new materials for RI including flex banners, posters, signboards, business cards and flyers to improve the visibility of the organization and educate people about the Rainbo Centres.\n\n\u2022\tMedia engagement: Conducted over 30 media engagements to date with national and international media platforms like Al Jazeera News Channel, BBC Network Africa on issues surrounding rape and sexual penetration in Sierra Leone. Appeared in two video interviews about RI made by the EU and BBC Media Action for the 2018 16 Days of Activism celebrations. \n\n\u2022\tAdvocacy work: With my line manager, designed and led the advocacy work around the 16 Days of Activism 2018 and 2019 through RI\u2019s participation of the local network The Community of Practice (on violence against women and girls). Used evidence and data collected from RI\u2019s programmes to evidence and back-up advocacy, which called for further women\u2019s rights in Sierra Leone regarding healthcare. \n\n\u2022\tFundraising: Helped to organize two major fundraising events for RI, a Sponsored Walk (November 2018) and film premiere (March 2019). Fundraised in-country over \u00a317,700 for RI from these events, a huge increase on amounts fundraised previously at RI. Engaged private organizations and received the first-ever corporate donations from Orange Sierra Leone and eHealth Africa in December 2018.",
