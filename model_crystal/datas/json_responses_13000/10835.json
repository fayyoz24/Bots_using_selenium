The stream of light that flows through each image represents their personal journeys and how ballet gave them hope to pursue their dreams. The light passes from one image to the next, weaving together the two dancers' stories until it converges in the middle where they're featured together in the center. Through this project, Spaan and Ballet Rising are not only highlighting the transformative power of dance but also raising funds for a documentary film series that showcases ballet in unexpected and underserved communities around the world. With \"A Moving Journey,\" Spaan and Ballet Rising are illuminating the beauty and resilience of the human spirit, inspiring us all to follow our own paths with hope and determination.",
