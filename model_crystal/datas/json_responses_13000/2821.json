    "summary": "I am an Assistant Professor in International History at Utrecht University, and a Visiting Research Fellow at the Department of War Studies, King's College London. I am a historian and a genocide scholar, and my work is on irregular armed groups, genocide and mass violence and transitional justice, especially criminal accountability. Before coming to The Hague in 2009, I spent three years in Sarajevo, where I worked as a researcher and analyst at the Special Department for War Crimes at the Office of the Prosecutor. I designed and taught an MA course on perpetrators and genocide prevention at Stockton University in the United States. My first book titled \u201cSerbian Paramilitaries and the Breakup of Yugoslavia: State Connections and Patterns of Violence\u201d came out in September 2022 with Routledge\u2019s Contemporary Security Studies series. This research was based on archives at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. I am also one of three editors of the new CEU Press series \u201cPerpetrators of Organized Violence: Eastern, Central and South-Eastern Europe\u201d.",

The second was the conduct of trials. The third was the impact beyond the courtroom on issues of peace and security.\n\nThe project had the goal to (i) identify, document, critically appraise and create data sets of examples of visual evidence at each of the three stages identified; (ii) conduct semi-structured interviews with judicial, policy, media and military-security practitioners to investigate knowledge, understanding and judgement on the relative importance of visual material at each of the three stages; (iii) carry out focus group research to investigate beliefs, values and attitudes regarding particular examples of visual evidence, in light of stages (i) and (ii), including generating processes and cases, use as evidence in trials, and impact on post-conflict societies and communities.",

It will also allow better cooperation with other prosecutors in the country and abroad. \n\nI worked with prosecutors on individual cases (these included charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes; cases of torture, rape and sexual violence, unlawful detention, beatings). I searched for documents in databases and analyzed them as well as compiled collections of documents relevant to the particular case. Occasionally I worked with legal officers on assembling documents and sorting forensic reports (particularly for Srebrenica) and massive amounts of related information.",
