    "summary": "Professional in sustainable water management and adaptation to climate change. My systems thinking approach allows me to combine qualitative and quantitative tools, as well as key sociotechnical aspects in solving problems around water resources. I have international experience working in public, private and cooperation entities; coordinating with local actors in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects with an emphasis on climate change. I conducted my undergraduate studies at the Zamorano EAP University in socioeconomic development and environment engineering. I have a double MSc. degree in water management for rural development from the Universities of Wageningen UR and Montpellier SupAgro. Likewise, I have a MSc. degree in water systems engineering, with specialization in territorial development and water resources for food security at UNESCO IHE. My training and work experience allow me to easily work in multicultural environments with multidisciplinary teams.\n\u2022\tMy main technical skills are: Data collection and processing, systems approach, climate change, GIS, remote sensing; I also have knowledge of the use and application of water and hydraulic models and programming.\n\u2022\tI am proficient in the following languages: Spanish (native), English(C2) and French(B1).\n\u2022\tThe values and social skills that characterize me are: Teamwork, responsibility and problem solving",

The above, based on a comprehensive approach based on green solutions (based on nature) in combination with gray and non-structural measures for drainage and stormwater management in urban basins. During this period, I provided technical advice on the planning, implementation of adaptation measures, as well as supervised the development of the technical and regulatory products of the project, specifically the methodology, water modeling, the climate change approach and the disaster risk analysis and assessment.",
