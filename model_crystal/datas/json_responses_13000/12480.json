    "summary": "Not afraid to get into trenches with the team. Try to understand the problem before pitching a solution. Getting the best out of those around me, with a track record of creating thriving team environments.\n\n\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c. Taking a step back to look at the longer term horizons. Work with teams to formulate the actions we need to achieve that longer term ambition. Able to be brutally honest with myself and those around me to pull us back on track.\n\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26.  Making sure the team around me is working together. Not afraid to seek advice and hire those that make my feel embarrassed.  Ensuring that we all get the best out of each other within a safe working environment. \n\n\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b. Get your hands dirty, work directly with your teams.
