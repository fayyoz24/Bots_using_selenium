    "summary": "Eversince working as an Interior Designer for television I have broadened my capacities. \nI don't have a signature when it comes to designing an interior | exterior. I talk to the owners, listen to their wishes and translate that into a formfitted design. \nWorking for television has taught me to take a design tot the next level and take one step further. Th\u00e1t is what makes a design different and unique. \nMy motto: Because class never goes out of style\n\n\nWhen it comes to the High Heel Workout, that is something I do from personal experience. Walking in high heels since I was 15, I'm well-trained. Combining that with the sporting-experience of Eline, we have a solid base for a great Workout. Our goal is to get so many requests for workouts, that we have to train other girls, so they can give the workout. \nEline en I would still be the ones developing the workouts furthermore and giving it when we decide to. Also the PR and Marketing would stay in our hands.\n\nSpecialties: Creating wonderfull designs for interiors | exteriors, taking that one step beyond. \n\nMaking walking on high heels an elegant, sexy and fun experience for everyone.",

The second part is on heels, where we teach being in heels from the base, all the way up to dancing in heels. And all of that in a workshop that can vary from a 60 minute Base Course to a  4 hour complete High Heel Experience. \nI also give in-corporate training to personel that have (high) heels in their uniform prescriptions.",
