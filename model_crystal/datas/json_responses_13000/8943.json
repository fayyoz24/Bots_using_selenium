    "summary": "A highly motivated goal-oriented professional with a strong background in customer service in logistics, business development, and project coordination.\nPassionate about sustainability, with a strong interest in supply chain transparency, agribusiness, international development, and corporate social responsibility.\n\nI started my professional career in the logistics sector as customer service in Colombia, where I gained experience in strengthening business relationships and providing customer support to clients and agents.\nIn the Netherlands, I worked for SCOPEinsight as Operational Officer, where I gained valuable insights working for capacity builders and value chain players in the professionalism of farmers.\n\nFor my master thesis, I developed a pioneering quantitative analysis of the urban agriculture program in Colombia entitled \"Impact of the Extension Services of Urban Agriculture in Poverty Reduction in Bogota\". In this research, I designed a tailor impact survey for urban farmers, collected information and performed a statistical analysis based on propensity score matching (PSM) with four matching methods to evaluate economic impacts and food security status with particular attention to the effect of extension services received by urban farmers. \nThis role also gave me the chance to be part of a mapping project in Bogota, where we are collecting information from agro-ecology initiatives in the city in a crowdmap in order to make it visible and accessible for the stakeholders.",
