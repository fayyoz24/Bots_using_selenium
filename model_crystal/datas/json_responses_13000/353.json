    "summary": "Experienced International sales leader in online payments, e-commerce and online Fraud\n\nM +31614951440 - E vantienenpieter@gmail.com  - available \n\nIn working for companies like eBay, PayPal, WorldPay and Experian I have developed myself to be a sales and sales leadership professional in the field of online payments, e-commerce and online fraud.\n\nValue-based selling, hard work, integrity and good interpersonal skills are, I believe, the basic ingredients to achieving desired results. This has been my basic philosophy in the several roles I have been carrying out during my career.\n\nFor many years I have been responsible for my own personal target, and I have led international sales teams of up to 15 fully targeted individuals. In the end the principles are the same;\n\n\u2022 Working together with people,\n\u2022 Setting goals which are clear, objective, measurable and realistic,\n\u2022 Define and agree on a plan of action,\n\u2022 Execute, Evaluate and Improve.\n\nI work this way whether I work with my team, with business partners or with a target of my own, and it has been proven a success.\n\nLiving the international life\n\nFeeling like a true global citizen, I have lived, worked and studied in several countries worldwide. Paris, where I studied French and French literature and Martinique, in the heart of the Caribbean, are some of the many places that have influenced me to become the person I am today. \n\nNowadays, work brings me virtually every month to another destination within the EMEA region, so I have learned to connect to and negotiate with many different cultures. Regularly, I speak on industry events, lead workshops and participate in panels to build the brand I represent and to further strengthen my professional network.\n\nI balance out my busy professional life by spending time with my children, family & friends and practising yoga.",
