Specifically, companies have faced challenges with constructing appropriate scenarios, understanding how scenario analysis informs strategy formulation, and determining and disclosing the resiliency of a company\u2019s strategy under different climate-related scenarios. In response to these challenges, the TCFD will provide guidance on implementing scenario analysis to better understand how climate-related issues could affect their business strategies. The TCFD\u2019s goal is to provide some of the building blocks that support disclosure of companies\u2019 strategy resilience. \n\nThe guidance targets companies that are in the early stages of implementing scenario analysis, and will cover:\n\u2022 Scenario concepts and processes\n\u2022 How business-relevant scenarios can be constructed \n\u2022 How scenarios can aid the identification of company-relevant climate-related risks and opportunities\n\u2022 How scenarios can inform strategic planning regarding different potential impacts from climate change\n\u2022 Disclosure considerations to demonstrate strategy resilience across scenarios, including financial implications",
