    "summary": "I am Italian and Iranian raised in Toronto and alumni of the University of Toronto, St. Michaels College with a double-major in Political Science and History. \n\nCurrently, a masters law student in Public International Law and a human rights researcher with three years of experience working with human rights organizations. I aspire to be a barrister with an interest in international dispute settlement, international criminal law and international humanitarian law. \n\nIn law school at the University of Essex, I led two teams running open-source investigation projects in a student based unit for Amnesty International conducted on Palestine and Lebanon and went on to become Manager of the Evidence Lab in my final year of law assisting on several OSINT investigations including contributing to UN Commissions of Inquiry. As Co-Founder, I pioneered the 10th site of an entrepreneurship and micro-enterprise program for Congolese youth in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",

I was taught how to correctly draft legal advice letters professionally. I was also trained on how to handle uncomfortable or difficult situations when dealing with clients that are entering the clinic on a walk-in basis. \n- In my role, I conduct client interviews under the supervision of a clinic staff member along with another student volunteer.\n- In meetings, I may write an attendance note including detailed meeting minutes or conduct the interview questions to inquire more about the client, their issue, and the legal matter at hand. As a team, the student volunteer and I provide a legal advice letter to the supervisor within 7 days and a final draft to the client within 30 working days. I have worked with six clients so far and continue working in the clinic.\n- As part of the clinic, I also took on project work where I volunteered at Refugee Action (an immigration law clinic) by observing interviews between legal aid workers and refugee/asylum seekers. Afterwards, I assisted in research and administrative work for the relevant applications.\n- I participated in the Open Justice Project where I attended virtual hearings and I commented on my experiences in the courtroom and whether I agree/disagree with the judgments given."
