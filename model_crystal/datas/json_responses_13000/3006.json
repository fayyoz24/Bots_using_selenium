The task was to combine point clouds from each lidar to obtain a complete dynamic 3D picture of a moving car. In this task, I used the knowledge gained at the university - rotation and shift matrices.\n\nIn this position, I learned to read the documentation in a foreign language to understand the operation of the device.
