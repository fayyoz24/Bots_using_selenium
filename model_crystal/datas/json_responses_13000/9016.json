    "summary": "My grandma always told me that as a child I wanted to live in London. My grandpa, on the other hand, had a vision of me working as a diplomat in Paris. I decided to meet them halfway, so here I am \u2013 a fresh marketing graduate living in Rotterdam.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nMy study path began in Zagreb, Croatia, where I obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Economics and a Master\u2019s degree in Managerial Informatics. After experiencing the Dutch study system during my exchange in Rotterdam, I decided to pursue my dream of studying abroad in the Netherlands.\n\nDuring my studies, I came to understand that HOW businesses approach customers and present their products is often more important than WHAT product or service they are offering. That's why I followed a Master\u2019s in Marketing Management at Tilburg University, where I learned how to analyze brands in a critical way and utilize relevant marketing skills on real business cases.\n\nI was able to apply the gained knowledge during my internship at Treebytree, a Dutch start-up that I joined at the very beginning of the company. There I participated in creating a digital service from scratch and in developing the business and marketing communications strategy. Working at Treebytree sparked my interest in specific areas of marketing such as user experience, marketing communications, and brand management.\n\nDuring my study, I was a member of 2 student associations, and working on both smaller and international projects allowed me to develop my communication and presentation skills, teamwork ability, connect with people with different mindsets or nationalities, and in general broadened my worldview.\n\nHowever, the most important skill I gained during my study time is how to learn new things in an efficient way. My current learning project is Dutch! For now, I am perfectly able to talk about \u201ckoetjes and kalfjes\u201d, with a goal of reaching a professional level of Dutch in the near future.\n\nOn a personal note, I am a wife, daughter, sister, friend, and generally a people person. \n\nI am currently looking for a position where I can work with passion and dedication, and kindness above everything.",
