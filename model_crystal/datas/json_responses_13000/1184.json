    "summary": "My name is Mauro Foglietta and I help people to meet and exceed their goals. Clients and business owners enjoy working with me because I can point them to best services, resources, and methods for oil & gas industry. I am highly skilled in implementing large-scale development and exploration projects and directing diverse teams to resolve complex project problems, while meeting deadlines and budgets. I have track record of success in reservoir modelling/assessment, volumetric estimate, and sedimentology and structural geology. I am a true leader, able to complete projects and manage global project delivery teams to drive process improvements and bottom-line gains, and competitive advantage. I have possessed pragmatic approach to integrate/interface with other disciplines, such as petrophysics and res Eng.\n\nSome of my key milestones including:\n\n\u25ba\tProvided advisory services to the O&G industry with respect to development and exploration matters, reviewed in place hydrocarbon estimates, and delivered support to manage reserves.\n\u25ba\tLed project from inception to completion and static modelling of large carbonate field. Provided G&G input to production optimisation, field development planning, and pilot water injection project.\n\u25ba\tIdentified new opportunities, such as planning/evaluation of activities along with 3rd-party operated assets, pro-active operator\u2019s activity assessment, and management of 3rd party specialist contractors.",
