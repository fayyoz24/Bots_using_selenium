    "summary": "Knowledge over the SCM through years of studying the subject from bachelor to master degree in South Korea and the Netherlands, which gave me insights into both Asian and European SCM. Further working as a demand & supply planner allowed the specialization of knowledge in SCM planning. \nNationalities from both South Korea and US, I grew up in a multicultural environment in which I develop cultural awareness that combines Eastern and Western values. Further studying in Europe enriched my cultural experiences and international mind-set. I am fluent in Korean and English, and studying Dutch and French to build fluency.\n\nMBTI Type: INFJ (1% of the population)",
