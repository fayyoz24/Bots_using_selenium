I took the jump into the cold water and moved from the Oil&Gas industry to the Water Industry (Environmental).\ud83c\udf0a\n\nWith that I went from Direct Sales to Technical Sales to sharpen my skills in other directions and gain deep insight on the software and its features - because, why not! \ud83d\ude0f I love to question everything so it's nice to be able to ask without people telling you to just focus on selling and not understanding.\n\nAnyway...with 2022 I have now started a new chapter in my life by moving my point of life to Netherlands, but nowadays it\u2019s easier to reach out to customers EMIA wide, so it certainly feels like a promotion of territory and I am pretty excited to get in touch with prospects and interested parties to explore the new world \ud83c\udf0e of Water management with AQUARIUS.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you want to know more about me, or Aquarius or just love to chat!\n\nIntan \ud83c\udf3b\ud83d\ude01",
