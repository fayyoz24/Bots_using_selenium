There is everything you\u2019d expect from Tuscany at Chiosco ai Renai, a rural eatery where it is possible to enjoy the tastes of the tradition, good wine and also a choice of original cocktails. With a garden with panoramic views and an internal dining room, the place is a reference point for those looking for tourist information, for those wishing to purchase a selection of organic products or for those hoping to come across a small art exhibition or to listen to a little live music. But, above all, it is an adorable place to stop by yourself, with your partner, family or friends, amid hammocks and tables, wine glasses and chopping boards, with Tuscany all around you. Lunches, aperitifs and snacks are all served over the course of the day. The eating place is located in Castelfiorentino, around 30 kilometres from Florence, in Val d\u2019Elsa; it is also known as \u201clittle Florence\u201d on account of its strategic importance in Florentine history and its wealth of architectural heritage.",
