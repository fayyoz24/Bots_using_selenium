    "summary": "Parallax Art Fair (Londen, UK)\nLondon May 16-18 2012\n\nIf you want to view my paintings at this Art Fair then please inform me.\n\nParallax Art Fair (Londen, UK)\nParallax AF grew out of an international exhibition called \u201cParallax\u201d that was conceived and curated by the art historian and theorist Dr Chris Barlow.\nParallax AF is different from other artists\u2019 fairs in that it is like a specialised exhibition.\nIt is a serious platform for international and national artists to present their work to national and international dealers, art industry people, collectors, critics and buyers without commission charges.\n\n\nJohn Haanstra offers selective collections of original paintings to art lovers and art buyers. At his website you can mainly see artworks which fall in the category of surrealism. Besides surrealism there are also paintings available in the category of impressionism. \n\nHe started his journey by applying elements of Greek mythology and surrealism. Central in this collection (Connecting Time) is the use of surrealistic factors. He advanced his way through the elements of fantastic realism and magic realism shown in the second collection (Circle of Tales) and the third collection (City Life). The latest works partly step away from the \"magic surrealistic world\" into a more impressionistic world. \n\nIn spite of the application of several art styles in his collections, John Haanstra follows a clear line with his artworks. The paintings of John Haanstra can be recognized by settings in which everything is in balance. He combines various elements into his paintings to portray the stories behind the works. In fact, it can be said that John Haanstra directs with paint. \n\nPaintings can be bought by contacting the artist by phone or mail. It will be appreciated if Art lovers leave there feedback by mail. These modern oil paintings can be seen in my atelier in the Netherlands. Watch the collections of surrealism and impressionism and enjoy my Gallery!\n\nSpecialties: These artworks are painted with oil paint on canvas using fine brush strokes. This method of painting requires a highly skilled technique and a particular feeling for composition. Several old and new painting techniques are used to create these paintings. These qualities make John Haanstra's paintings particularly unique.",
