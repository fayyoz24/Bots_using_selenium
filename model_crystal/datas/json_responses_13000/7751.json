As part of this research I interviewed a number of land owners and tenants in a defined rural area of North Yorkshire. The aim; to find out whether it is feasible for private water companies to offer incentives (to private, rural land users) to change land management practices in order to improve the quality of ground and surface water sources. The outcome of this research provided Yorkshire Water with the information needed to further safeguard themselves against both regulatory and consumer risk by proactively ensuring ground water quality in the future.",
