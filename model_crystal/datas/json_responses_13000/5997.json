            "description": "With MyTimePlanner you can easily manage your events, appointments, events, business appointments, game results and much more and communicate them to all authorized persons.\nRegistration is via your cell phone number. After you have entered your cell phone number, you will receive an SMS with a TAN number for verification.\nThe app is based on groups of people. This means that you either have to create a group yourself or have yourself included in a group.\nOnly the administrators of a group can create events and add members to a group.\nIf you are an admin of a group, you can create a new event and members of your group will now see the event once they have installed the app as well.\n\nWhy use MyTimePlanner:\n\n- Many use chat programs to organize their appointments. However, the important points are often lost or overlooked in the course of the chat. With MyTimePlanner this problem is solved because only administrators can send messages.\n\n- With MyTimePlanner, all W-questions can be answered in a clear and structured manner: When? Where? Who? How many people? etc.\n\n- Who takes part in an appointment? As soon as the group has been created, this question can easily be answered for all future appointments with the \"Accept/Reject\" function. It is enough to create the respective appointment and send a short message to the group.\n\n- An appointment repeats itself regularly? No problem with the \"Repeat\" function, recurring events can be created.\n\n- Appointments that are important to you personally can be entered quickly and easily in the calendar of your mobile phone.\n\n- Your group is small and manageable (e.g. your family) In this case you can make all group members administrators. Everyone in the family knows about upcoming appointments.\n\n- Assign or manage tasks. Would you like to organize a larger event? With the \"Tasks\" function you can allocate tasks to your group members.\n- Easily connect with your friends and groups using your phone's address book.",
