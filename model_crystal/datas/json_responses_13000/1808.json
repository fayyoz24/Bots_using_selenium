This assignment involved redesigning and redeveloping this solidly built warehouse and extending it to provide for broader company wide management information needs and data exchange requests.\n\nTo also provide for the operational reporting needs and solve some data logistic problems, four databases have been built into which the data from the contract management systems of 4 Alphabet markets is replicated every 5 minutes. The replication functionality was built in Oracle 12c and keeps around 470 tables in sync with the source. The replicated environment also provides the input for historicised contract data and a data mart layer for more complex reporting.\n\nFinally, the extracting and interfacing of vehicle information to a third party auction platform was developed and implemented, having a considerable positive impact on remarketing end-of-lease vehicles.",
