    "summary": "\u2018Intuitive, real, never perfect, vibrant and especially colorful. That\u2019s my aesthetic. I am simply obsessed with color and consider myself a \u201ccolor composer\u201d. Composing whatever I lay my eyes on and documenting it with my camera \u2013 a process that started since I was very little growing up in Muret, France, briefly Moscow and The Netherlands. While architecture also crossed my mind, I eventually graduated in fashion design at Willem de Kooning art academy in Rotterdam. I found that my way of storytelling channels best through photography, which nowadays touches on all types of genres from documentary to design. All in all, showing humanity and a certain emotive quality has always been a key component in my work.\u2019 ",
