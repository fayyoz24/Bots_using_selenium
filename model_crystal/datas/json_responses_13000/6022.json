    "summary": "\"Don't work for daily bread, Just work for sustainability (Uwitonze, 2021)\".\n\nMy name is Narcisse Uwitonze, I was born in Rwanda; a small, developing, and densely populated country with rich biodiversity. Since I was a boy, I have observed the great loss of natural ecosystems due to poor and intensive farming practices. Today I am part of a growing number of young conservationists who realize that our future and economy depend on maintaining our natural resources. Wageningen University, the University of Rwanda, and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International have provided me with opportunities for learning hands-on conservation biology applications.\n\nTo date, the state of biodiversity is deteriorating globally due to increasing human pressure and insufficient conservation responses. This tremendous species decline is associated with rapid urbanization and human population growth. Biodiversity continues to decline, with ongoing losses of species and habitats. This biodiversity decline is due to deforestation and landscape degradation. At the top of such tragic biodiversity loss, there are enormous negative impacts of climate change on species and landscapes like unpredicted wildfires and severe droughts.\n\nI am a quick learner and always strive for excellence. My motivations are always encircled in my motto\u201d Don\u2019t work for daily bread, just work for Sustainability\u201d. I am open to a new challenging position as it is the only way to develop as a scientist. I am the perfect person to get a group project rolling, but I also know how to sit back and let others take the lead. My cheerful nature and openness to feedback mean I am always learning and growing as a learner, a strength that will continue to serve in college and beyond.",

I applied For an MSc thesis opportunity in the Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group of Wageningen University in the Department of Environmental Sciences. Below is a short summary of the project:\n\nSeed rain dynamics are an important factor to understand secondary forest regeneration. The aim of this research was to determine the extent to which the plant reproductive strategies and environmental factors play a role in seed rain dynamics of lowland wet tropical rain forest. This study was carried out in a wet tropical forest landscape in Chiapas, southern Mexico. The seed rain has been collected twice a month in seven sites through established seed traps, and the environmental variables have been monthly recorded for five years from 2002-to 2006. The results showed that species identified in the seed rain have various reproductive strategies. About 72% of the species are supra-annual species (i.e they produce seeds less than once per year). Also, most of the species (67%) are aseasonal species as they can produce seeds in both dry and wet seasons. Seasonality-based reproductive strategies (dry and wet) do not differ in terms of seed rain abundance and biomass. However, the increase in temperature has a negative effect on the supra-annual species by reducing the flowering frequency. Thus, as supra-annual species dominated the Chiapas landscape, the landscape will be negatively affected by the increase in temperature. For landscape restoration, these findings call up on conservation managers to select species in annual and seasonal reproductive strategies in restoration projects.",
