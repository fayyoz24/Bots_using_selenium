    "summary": "I'm a legal professional with a diverse background and a knack for negotiation. With over 6 years of experience in commercial contract negotiation, legal research, and drafting, I've had the privilege of assisting companies worldwide in navigating  compliance matters and sealing the deal. From the United States to Canada, the United Kingdom to Brazil, and even places like Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan, I've worked with clients and organizations from all corners of the globe.\n\nI currently hold the position of Head of Legal at Foleon, where I lead the company's legal strategy and provide invaluable guidance to support our business growth. It's a role I take great pride in, as I work closely with the executive team and the CFO to ensure that our legal endeavors align with our commercial objectives.\n\nMy educational journey has taken me on an exciting path. I earned my qualifying law degree from the esteemed University of London and completed an Advanced LL.M in International Civil and Commercial Law from Leiden University. In fact, my thesis focused on how different countries, including the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the UK, handle unforeseen changes of circumstances and force majeure in commercial contracts, using COVID-19 as a prime example.\n\nThroughout my career, I've honed my skills in research, drafting, and communication, while deepening my knowledge of various legal systems. My competencies include contract law, legal research, crafting rock-solid legal agreements, corporate law, commercial law, and international law. It's this well-rounded expertise that allows me to bring valuable insights and solutions to the table.",
