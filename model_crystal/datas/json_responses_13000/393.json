    "summary": "Even when I was very little, it was clear that I had a thing for languages. Growing up, I watched episodes of MASH, Are you being served? and my favorite: A bit of Fry and Laurie. Throughout secondary school, I attended as many different language classes as possible: English, German, French, and Spanish. I would've picked Greek or Latin as well if I'd had the opportunity. Whereas my classmates would snore their way through Dutch classes, I was having a blast. With this love and talent for languages, the number of options I had was practically endless.\n\nNow, many years later, I am proud to be a freelance translator. I chose this path for various reasons. Firstly, I love problem solving, which is exactly what translating is 95% of the time. Secondly, I love fiddling around with words and expressions to get even the most minute nuance just right. Lastly, I have a roll-up-your-sleeves mentality and take pride in hard work, which is precisely what translating requires.\n\nAs a financial and marketing translator, I work hard to respectively stay up to date on economic terms and developments and expand on my Dutch vocabulary, so that I come equipped with a strong solution for every linguistic problem. My passion helps your words reach further.",
