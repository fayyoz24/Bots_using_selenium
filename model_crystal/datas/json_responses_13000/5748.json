            "description": "At the beginning of 1998 we received a request to help build a school for orphans and for children living on the streets.\r\n\r\nIn July 1999 I went into early retirement and the very next day I decided to devote myself to this school project. This was the beginning of the Help Burkina Foundation.It was an instant success: in September 2001 Sainte M\u00c3\u00a8re Teresa school opened with 225 pupils. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easy to collect money for this project because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything about collecting funds. Gradually I improved my skills and in the same year we managed to sink two wells in villages at a considerable distance  from the capital. \r\n\r\nEven during the opening celebrations of the school  people began to ask us for support for new projects. We have always tried to honour these requests and in this way we managed to realise two village clinics, a primary school, a large stable for cattle, a boarding school for girls who now can go to secondary school in the capital, a corn mill, a women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house and several wells. We have planted thousands of trees and built about fifteen public latrines in various villages. We are proud of our most recent project: a school for sewing for (orphaned) girls in Ouagadougou. Pascaline became our local contact and she founded her own Association de Soutien des Personnes D\u00c3\u00a9favoris\u00c3\u00a9es .\r\n\r\nWe exclusively honour request for help from the country itself and local people have to contribute 10% of the cost in cash or labour or building materials. This assures they will make the project their own and that they will show good governance. Most projects cost less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 20.000 but even this relatively small sum of money has to be raised.  So we are thankful for every gift. With many small contributions we can eventually realise bigger projects.
