    "summary": "Working towards empowerment of vulnerable populations and communities is at the core of what drives me. Over the years I have been fortunate enough to gain broad experience in managing complex development programmes on a global level. As a result my experience is multi-disciplinary and covers agricultural livelihoods, food systems, agrobiodiversity, poverty reduction, community resilience, migration, diaspora engagement, social policy, human rights, child protection, youth development, gender mainstreaming, sexual reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS and WASH working within the United Nations and international NGOs. In addition, I have conducted research for organisations such as the AU, ODI, GIZ, FHI360 and the UN. Drawing on my academic background in development studies and my vast work experience I continue to contribute towards an equitable world.",
