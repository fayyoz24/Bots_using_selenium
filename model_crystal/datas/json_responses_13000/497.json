    "summary": "Focus of research:\n\n\"Healthcare consumption by ethnic minority people in their country of origin: threatening or complementary?\"\n\nCurrently, about 12% (2 million people) of the Dutch general population is of non-western ethnic origin. More than half of the Turkish and Moroccan migrants aged 55 or older make use of healthcare in their country of origin, partially because of lack of trust in the Dutch healthcare system. Dutch healthcare professionals and insurance companies are confronted with the consequences of healthcare consumption in the country of origin in terms of additional consultations, diagnostics, treatments, and costs upon return in the Netherlands. However, healthcare consumption in the country of origin cannot automatically be deemed as inappropriate. It can be a necessary continuation of healthcare in the Netherlands, or be associated with acute disease. Ideally, the quality of continued chronic care and medically appropriate acute care in the country of origin is similar or better to the Netherlands, whereas inappropriate healthcare consumption in the country of origin is avoided. \nIn this, first of its kind, proposed study, I will analyse size, reasons, and appropriateness of healthcare consumption in the country of origin by ethnic minority groups. I will make use of unique complementary data sources: the HELIUS cohort and the Achmea Health Database. The results will provide health policy makers, insurance companies and healthcare professionals with essential knowledge to develop effective strategies to prevent overconsumption and to improve the cultural competence of healthcare provision in the Netherlands.\n\nAMC themes:\tCardiovascular Diseases, Public Health & Epidemiology\nDepartments:\tCardiology, Social Medicine\n\nhttp://www.amc.nl/web/Research/Who-is-Who-in-Research/Who-is-Who-in-Research.htm?p=4624",

More than half of the Turkish and Moroccan migrants aged 55 or older make use of healthcare in their country of origin, partially because of lack of trust in the Dutch healthcare system. Dutch healthcare professionals and insurance companies are confronted with the consequences of healthcare consumption in the country of origin in terms of additional consultations, diagnostics, treatments, and costs upon return in the Netherlands. However, healthcare consumption in the country of origin cannot automatically be deemed as inappropriate. It can be a necessary continuation of healthcare in the Netherlands, or be associated with acute disease. Ideally, the quality of continued chronic care and medically appropriate acute care in the country of origin is similar or better to the Netherlands, whereas inappropriate healthcare consumption in the country of origin is avoided. \n\nIn this, first of its kind, proposed project, I will analyse size, reasons, and appropriateness of healthcare consumption in the country of origin by ethnic minority groups. I will make use of unique complementary data sources: the HELIUS cohort and the Achmea Health Database. The results will provide health policy makers, insurance companies and healthcare professionals with essential knowledge to develop effective strategies to prevent overconsumption and to improve the cultural competence of healthcare provision in the Netherlands.",
