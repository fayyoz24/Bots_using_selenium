    "summary": "This is the story of one woman who was fascinated by umami.\n\nI studied English at university in the Faculty of Foreign Languages though, I started my career in sales for an advertising production company because, the beauty and impact of advertising fascinated me so much.And then,I studied graphic design while working as a sales representative and became a graphic designer.\n\nFrom my actual career, I know that advertising is about beauty and a way of communicating with customers. I also know that times are changing and that we use different tools such as websites, emails and social networks to express our brand and communicate with our customers.\n\nI started fasting to lose weight almost seven years ago.\nFasting was an excellent opportunity to awaken my senses, reset my taste buds and reflect on my diet. There, I was reintroduced to dashi, which is at the heart of Japanese food culture.\nI started a webmedia called Oishiidashi to promote the excellence of dashi.\n\nI then embarked on an experimental journey to Europe to spread the wonders of dashi throughout the world.\nIt is difficult to promote dashi in Europe because the food culture and water are different from those in Japan, but I was convinced that umami could be spread worldwide.\n\nUmami is a flavour with health benefits, but unlike salt and sugar, it is difficult to detect.\nHowever, umami has a cultural and historical background and is closely linked to industry.\n\nAnd umami is not unique to Japan; people worldwide can taste it in local foods. Umami makes people healthier and happier. And it changes lives.\n\nI want to do everything we can to spread the goodness of umami.",
