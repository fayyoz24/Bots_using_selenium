    "summary": "At present, we're ramping up operations at our new venture, Enhance That B.V. We're passionate about empowering our fashion partners on their thrilling 3D journey. Through working hand in glove to set strategic goals and define efficient workflows for their teams, we're bringing tech solutions to the table. All this, coupled with insightful advisory and meticulous planning, are done whilst maintaining a close relationship with the client's IT teams.\n\nI'm one of the 3 founders, engaged in working closely with clients and supporting the growth of our new company.\n\nMy previous experience at STITCH comes in handy as I was in the leadership team and switched two roles operationally, where as Head of Technology I kicked off the development of our SaaS products and started growing the engineering team, later switching to the Head of Product to continue on the vision for building up our great 3D toolset for the fashion brands.\n\ni come from the engineering background, but I only like technology for the sake of solving real problems. Countless hours of logical reasoning, deep diving into details, and unraveling tech intricacies have equipped me to make informed choices and decisive decisions. The realm of 3D caught my fancy from the young age of 15 and professionally anchored me since 2006, working with industry giants like Boeing, Airbus, and Dassault Systemes.\n\nCollaborating with people and creating a homely, risk-tolerant, and collaborative  workspace is my ultimate goal and pressure. It's amazing to see these grounds making us combat any hurdle, together. I enjoy fostering a motivating and pleasant place that encourages people to step outside their comfort zone, challenge conventions, dare to take risks - all while knowing that we've got each other's back!",
