    "summary": "Ahu has been always in the education sector starting from giving free lessons to her cousins first then to the students who need support in poor areas of Istanbul. She discovered very early that teaching and coaching students and her parents was her passion. From 2nd year of university, she started to give private lessons to middle and high school students. \nHer expertise is absolutely on maths, not only to prepare the students for the high school and university exams but also to make sure that the students pass their class with high scores in maths. She has been so successful to take each student as an individual case and to determine what her specific need is and to focus on those areas rather than to give one solution fits all approach. \nShe has been collaborating for a long time with a strong team of teachers from different disciplines such as Turkish, Applied and social sciences. \nThroughout her 20+ years career, many students of her succesfully entered Robert College, Uskudar American College, Saint Joseph High School, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Koc University and so on.",
