What about the bad, cyber-driven crimes within Dark Markets or in general on the Dark Web. Or the ugly, like online extremism or terrorism on a diversity of domains on the internet. \n\nTo make our societies more secure, we are doing the following. First, we develop deep understanding of specific phenomena. We live in a big data era, so nearly all information is available in open sources. Challenge is to discover, aggregate and filter data towards actionable intelligence. Second, these items can be of value at strategic, tactical or operational levels. In cooperation with our partners we experiment with big data concepts, close to practice, to experience the added value. Third, in case of successful experiments we support the implementation of the concept within the partner organization(s), mainly by supporting quality assurance.",

The subject was the automatic search and discovery of paper used in the time of Rembrandt van Rhijn. This is relevant because pieces of paper with identical paper structures are used in the same period. This logic can be declared as following. Pieces of paper are equal to each other if they are produced using the same scoop sieve. The identity is determined by patterns that are recognized in the paper, which have their origin in the sieve. Consider for example a watermark, but actually more important chain and water lines. The solutions described in my thesis. These line characteristics are detected in X-ray images of the paper so that similar pieces of paper can be found quickly using an optimized data representation.",
