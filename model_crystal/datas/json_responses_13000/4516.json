    "summary": "Reviewing my past: typical builder of organisations and structures. Having been born in the city that harbours one of the biggest ports in the world, I share the city's mentality: see what needs to be done, and then let's do it. Not being a micro-manager, I have a more operational, hands on approach. Love the challenge of setting up a structure or re-structure a sales organisation. Customer relationships (the first thing you sell is YOU) and relationship-management. That first sale is the nicest challenge. But it does not stop there. Will you get the second sell, and the third and.... Sales and customer relationships are a dynamic animal, be pro-active and listen to your markets. We all (try to) sell, we all have product. But do we have the service, the structure to service? Ask yourself: why does a customer buy from me? Or why doesn't he buy from me? Never forget, in the end of the day business is  between people. Your customer buys from YOU!\nI do not see problems, I see challenges, solutions and opportunities!",
