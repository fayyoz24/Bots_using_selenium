The subject of my MSc thesis was the interaction between long-term wedge growth and the occurrence of earthquakes in subduction zones. Analogue modelling was used as a method to get new insights in the interaction between the short-term (seismicity) and long-term (permanent wedge growth) deformation processes. This project was done in the Earth Simulation Laboratory and was a collaboration between the Teclab and the HPT-lab. Image data was acquired using a high speed camera (high spatial and temporal resolution) producing so-called 'big data'. Mechanical data was produced by a loadcell and displacement sensor. The data were processed using Matlab and Python. The skills I achieved during this project allow me to obtain and process data with different types of apparatus and software and to find practical solutions to experimental challenges. \nThe thesis was supervised by dr. Ernst Willingshofer and dr. Andr\u00e9 Niemeijer. Grade: 8.",
