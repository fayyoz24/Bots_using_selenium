    "summary": "Hi i'm Shin,\n\nI'm in my second year of my master Bio Mechanical Engineering, specialisation: Bio Inspired Design, at the TU Delft. For my Electives I have chosen the specialisation courses of Bio Robotics. I'm looking for an internship to broaden my insight in my future career and for study points of my second year of my master. In my master I had quite some design courses and I can say I developed myself in this field. Within these design groups I was usually the person who did the calculation, by hand or with use of Matlab. Next to this I have developed expertise in advanced dynamics. This development is thanks to a big course which involved weekly Matlab assignments where advanced dynamical systems where simulated. Preferably I would like to do an internship in the Bio mechanical industry which involve a mechanical or robotic system, but i'm open for other suggestions as well!",
