    "summary": "I am a city-dweller, animal-lover, and dedicated people person who loves developing new relationships; finding ways to solving customer problems that help businesses grow while providing the secret sauce of customer care: an uplifting and positive customer experience.\n\nWith 8+ years in the service industry (both B2C & B2B), throughout my career, I have developed relationships with customers that are just as dear to me as any blood relative. My goal is to create positive customer experiences for businesses by solving their problems while providing an uplifting and positive experience at the same time.\n\nI have grown to learn the value of customers by bringing customer-centricity to every interaction. I love getting up each morning knowing that my work will impact both our customers' lives as well as those on my team.\n\nAt this point in my career, I\u2019m constantly expanding my knowledge on business operations, sales, marketing, design, and anything in-between. I\u2019ve always loved learning new things and try new things. My constant curiosity has led me to many different careers that have helped me shape the person I am today.\n\nOutside of work you can most probably find me in the kitchen making my signature guacamole or doing some singing/songwriting...and a few other creative stuff.",
