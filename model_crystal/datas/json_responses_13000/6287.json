Collaborating with governmental bodies, ministries, CEOs, managers, and engineers, I played a pivotal role in crafting tailor-made solutions that significantly contributed to country development and job creation. Each interaction called for unique approaches, making my experience incredibly fulfilling and rewarding. I embraced challenges with humor and resilience, navigating tough negotiations and financing hurdles. This approach fostered an open and engaging atmosphere that strengthened connections with both clients and colleagues.\n\nThe dynamic world of vessel sales demanded swift adaptability to ever-changing government regulations and budget adjustments. In pursuit of ambitious objectives, I continuously sought innovative solutions.\n\nAs the driving force behind Marketing and Sales, my responsibilities spanned across a wide scope, including Algeria, Senegal, Sudan, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Comoros, Reunion, and Mayotte. Within this diverse portfolio, I diligently identified new business development opportunities and confidently took charge of the full commercial cycle for vessel sales, parts, and services, catering to both private and government clients.\n\nFrom the initial client contact to tender preparation, contract and price negotiation, delivery, payment conditions, and providing invaluable financing advice, my role encompassed diverse responsibilities that enriched my professional journey. I found profound fulfillment in contributing to Damen's success and forging lasting relationships across the African region.",
