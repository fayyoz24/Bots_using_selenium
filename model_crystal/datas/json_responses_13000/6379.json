    "summary": "MENYA IWACU-IJWI RY\u2019IMUHIRA\n\nBackground of the Organization\n\nThe idea of establishing Menya Iwacu, as a community-based organization, was initiated by Congolese young generation, mainly composed of asylum seekers across the globe.\n\nInitiators accordingly felt accountable to overcome challenges facing the Eastern DR of Congo including; ongoing atrocities, bad ideologies that kept on being spread out, and an increasing number of asylum seekers flowing outside the country. As it is a problem closely linked to the history of the whole region especially implicating ethnicity and discrimination aspects, in case there is no adequate intervention, still inhabitants are exposed to worsened situation.\n\nTherefore, founders came up with an intervention, by contributing not only towards press (newsworthiness) but also airing relevant programs necessary for the sustainable peace building and social economic welfare in the great lakes region and Eastern DR Congo specifically.\n\nOur Objectives\n\nTo contribute towards sustainable peace building in the great lake region especially in the Eastern DR of Congo by broadcasting newsworthy information and airing relevant programs.\nTo promote social and economic welfare for the strong civil society in the Eastern DR of Congo.\nTo safeguard Congolese cultural values.\nTo preserve archives regarding historical events taken place specifically in the DR of Congo, especially Eastern DR of Congo.\nTo reinforce Congolese global network",
