    "summary": "After spending 2 years working in Suriname in two different sectors (Gold sector and Agricultural sector) I came to the realization that I had to expand my educational horizons. This was needed in order to be eligible for opportunities that would normally not be easily granted to an entr\u00e9e-level with a B.Sc. title.\nI am currently working on finishing my M.Sc. at the Vrye Universiteit van Amsterdam, furthermore I am looking for an opportunity to prove myself. My master course is about Geology and Geochemistry, which is a very broad area in itself, educating students about expertise such as forensics and ranging until basic geologic processes in the Earth\u2019s mantle.\nI enjoy meeting new people, enjoy cooking, hear exiting new stories about adventures from others (also share my own). \nProfessionally I am very  goal orientated, reliable, punctual, ready to learn, and if the job demands, make long distance travels. As I enjoy seeing new places quite a lot. \nMy skill-sets include: core-logging, geological mapping, 2-D seismic data interpretation, well correlation, using different gamma ray logs as tools, arc-GIS maps generation. Hope to add alot more in the near future. \nAlso, the basics from Microsoft office such as: words, excel, PowerPoint. \n",
