    "summary": "I recently completed LL.M. programme in European Law which I successfully combined with professional career in Human Resources. My master\u2019s thesis was focused on labour law (Working Time Directive and case law of the CJEU), being it my favourite area of law. \n\nI have experience working in the international environment as an HR Specialist and Recruitment Coordinator. Law and foreign languages are my great passion - I also graduated in Polish Law and Spanish Philology. I\u2019m a well-organised and highly motivated person. During my professional career, I have been performing all kinds of HR-related tasks, including full employee lifecycle management and performance and benefits administration. \n\nDuring my second master\u2019s programme, I gained knowledge of various areas of European law, including data protection law, comparative company law, competition and state aid law, labour law and social security law. \n\nTo sum up, I am all about working with people and for people.",
