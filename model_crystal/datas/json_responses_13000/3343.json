Their goal was to gain more scalability and to increase volume. Their ideas about deploying gamification and e-services reached project researcher Jesse Kaukola and lecturer Antti Tuomisto from ICT-portti at the Innostu! ICT:st\u00e4 -seminar in October 2015.\n\nThere were immediate agreement on the research project, and the project plan was established by December 2015. The project included specification of the new service and a design of the gamified parts of the service. These two parts are delivered together with University of Turku and Turku School of Applied Sciences.\n\nGet Listed (GL) service took care of the team creation at Turku University. The team was formed: Lisa Ratz (IoT and machine learning), Mahri Charyyeva (IT and business communications), Nella Sarapelto (games and holistic systems), and Esa Gr\u00f6nberg (IT system specialist). Esa is currently studying at IT department, and the others are students at Turku School of Economics.",

Taking various courses on self-development, leadership, team building, public speaking, and more, I have also provided some courses to other fellow volunteers and students. The courses were organized on a volunteering basis at the library of American Councils. I held courses in \"TOEFL for beginners\" and \"Vocabulary for SAT\". Additionally, I have taken an active role in preparation various summer schools in collaboration with American Councils and Information Resource Center (IRC) in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. Moreover, I have organized several community projects like visits to elderly care houses and city cleaning activities. The last, but not the least, is my involvement as an organizer of Ultimate Frisbee Tournament in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan."
