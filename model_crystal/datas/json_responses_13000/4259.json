            "description": "Pharmaceutical and biotech companies must continually innovate in their R&D programmes to stay ahead in a highly challenging economic and technological environment. The R&D productivity has declined over the last decade despite increasing investments, and it is very difficult for pharma companies to boost their ROI. While the objectives of drug discovery don\u2019t change, the methods and techniques by which pharmaceutical companies, biotechs and academia discover new drugs are evolving at a significant pace. Join the 2nd Annual Pharma 2020: The Future of R&D Summit, meet professionals from the best pharma companies and academia and learn about the new trends in drug discovery, explore the future promise of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, listen to some case studies about innovations in High Throughput Screening, Big Data and precision medicine, targeting the Protein-Protein Interactions, scientific collaborations, and many other topics.",
