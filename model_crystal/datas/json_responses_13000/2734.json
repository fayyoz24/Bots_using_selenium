    "summary": "Writer, lecturer, researcher and editor trained as an English literary scholar and gender historian. In 2016, I received my PhD in history and gender studies from Radboud University Nijmegen. I am an experienced researcher with a focus on history, gender and literature, and have taught widely in these fields. \n\nBesides teaching classes in literature at Utrecht University and University College Utrecht, I am currently focused on reaching a broader audience with my writing and research. My interests include women's writing, literary history and (historical) topics related to gender and feminism. \n\nAs researcher, I have worked on a variety of scholarly research projects both inside and outside academia (government-commissioned). Currently, I am working in a project on the history of adoption (1956-1984) in the Netherlands (to be finalized at the end of 2022). I am also writing a non-fiction book on Dutch delinquent girls based on my PhD research. Besides this, I have my own editing business, SWYM Editing, which offers academic proofreading and editing services in the humanities. \n\nCurrently accepting assignments as freelance writer, researcher and English editor. For speaking engagements on women's writing, literary history and gender and feminism (in history), send me a message. \n\nI am Dutch/Irish (native speaker of Dutch and English) and based in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

This honour is awarded annually to the best article published in History of Psychology in the previous year. \n\nFrom the report by the Award Committee:\n'This exceptionally interesting and theoretically imaginative article analyzes the practice of using Rorschach testing at a Dutch reform school for working-class girls in the mid-twentieth century. As Bultman effectively details, the Rorschach inkblot test often had punitive consequences for girls caught up in the child protection system; inkblot testing thus became an unsubtle method for asserting institutional authority over female bodies and minds. Bultman\u2019s writing is insightful and engaging; her use of evidence is thoroughly fascinating and original. Her article substantially expands our historical understanding of how Rorschach testing was mobilized within the context of the reformatory not only to pass (moral) judgment on the allegedly aberrant behavior of young women, but also to legitimate the expertise of psychology'.",

This four-episode programme showed how contemporary society is organized around men, and demonstrated the consequences of this for women. Per episode, I gave historical commentary on the various gender-related topics that were addressed (including: men being the norm, women's legal incompetence in the Netherlands until 1956 (handelingsonbekwaamheid), pink tax, technology and programming, so-called men's work and women's work, and the body).",
