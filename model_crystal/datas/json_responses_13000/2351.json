    "summary": "I am a seasoned, results-driven leader with extensive experience in the data science and artificial intelligence fields. As the Head of Security Analytics at ING, I lead the strategic direction and execution of high-quality analytics and data strategy. My expertise in AI, data science, and analytics has been honed through a series of progressive leadership roles, including serving as the AI Practice Leader for IBM Benelux and Principal Data Scientist for IBM Europe, where I played a key role in defining the AI strategy at the EU level and developing industry-aligned AI-powered solutions.\n\nI have a proven track record of delivering value through data-driven insights, with experience in building and validating AI models and consulting for clients at IBM, Mobiquity and Easytobook. My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Physics from Wageningen University, the Netherlands, and several well-cited papers in top-tier international scientific journals. I have received a number of honours and awards in the US, Europe, and Brazil. I am certified as a Distinguished Data Scientist by the OpenGroup, and as of 2022, I act as a board member for the Data Scientist profession certification. In 2023, I became a visiting researcher at the Cybersecurity Lab of the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University.\n\nI am adept at leading cross-functional teams and have a proven ability to drive strategic initiatives, leveraging my deep understanding of data science and AI to drive business growth. I am committed to staying at the forefront of the industry and am always looking for ways to bring the latest technologies and best practices to the organisation.\n\nYou can check my portfolio here: https://www.edbarbaro.com./",

In this research, we are interested in investigating innovative ways to personalize the user experience. To do so, we advocate the use of a range of intervention strategies. Firstly, we propose a methodology to characterize User Engagement in mobile applications. To achieve that, we will explore three different frameworks: (i) survival analysis models, (ii) regression models, and (iii) random forest models. In doing so, we aim to gain understanding if (and when) a user will disengage after a given period of time. Secondly, we evaluate the performance of our framework in modeling User Engagement. Thirdly, we design a behavior change platform based on the outcome of our modeling framework. ",

In this multi-dimensional algorithm, we use information about the car hyperspace: mileage, status, brand-model-type, year of build, and first/second order statistics. Coupled to that, behavioral information and geographical location are also used to train our models. The results show that our modeling approach is able to explain over 96% of the price variance for all car segments. Moreover, our approach flags potential opportunities for a diverse set of cross-selling businesses, such as automotive parts and insurance companies.",

We used the limited memory Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm with bounds to optimize the weights of the Gower\u2019s metric. We validated our approach using both artificial and real data sets and highlighted that the weights are a crucial part of obtaining a more accurate clustering. Our algorithm increased the CPCC from 0.84 to 0.97, in the case of a data set obtained from a mobile application. Furthermore, we can statistically confirm that our optimized hierarchical clustering algorithm performed better than all the benchmark algorithms tested in this thesis on multiple internal evaluation metrics. In addition to that, we extended our framework using an optimized K-medoids implementation with equally good results. Finally, we showed that it is possible to analytically obtain a derivative of the CPCC when certain weights are set constant relative to each other. ",
