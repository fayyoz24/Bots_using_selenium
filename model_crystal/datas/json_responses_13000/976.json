    "summary": "I consider myself as a hard working and dedicated person. For me it is important to be reliable and I will do everything to keep that reputation. I like to help others, although I am learning now not to overdo that and mark my boundaries. That matches with delivering high quality work.\n\nIn my life and work I found out that it is satifying to always have a goal and some sort of challenge. So when a job is finished I will look for another task, no matter how big or small. I see a disappointment as a chance to learm something new. It keeps me flexible, awake and optimistic.\n\nI am happy with my part-time job as a high school teacher biology. It appears to be fitting me and I love to work with so many people. As a hobby I work with horses, and sometimes other animals. I train my own Dartmoor pony in academic dressage, driving, and allround skills. I like to train people and animals. My dream is to do this at the same time.\n\nBesides that I feel like a real scientist. I am especially interested in animal ethology (behaviour), anatomy, physiology, and parasitology. According to me spirituality and science can exist side by side, which will bring great things in the future. \n\nWith my own bussiness Wonderpony, where I do horse and donkey worm egg counts in dung samples, I can perform the thouroughness and science skills I like to keep up. The advising of the horse owners and the networking is one of the advantages of this part-time job.\n\nNature simply fascinates me. I am outside as much as I can and I like to share that with others. I use intuition a lot while working with nature or animals. It has learned me so much in the past. \n\nI the future I would love to stay a teacher. I would like to combine that with biology or educational research, scientific research, or other activities. Like horseback riding, animal training and care/health, working outdoors or field work, lab work or anything like this. Any job that contains the elements of my passions is interesting for me.",

According to the foundation \u201cWakker Dier\u201d the % might decrease if no measures are taken. This research uses information from farmers who recently built a new housing system or are planning to do so. This group of dairy farmers is interesting, because the trend of a decreasing number of grazing dairy cows should be more clear in this group of dairy farmers.\nThe purpose of this research is to study the number of dairy farmers that let their cows graze after building new housing systems and the number with zero-grazing policy. With this information a trend can be predicted for the % of dairy cows that is grazed in the coming 10 years in The Netherlands. Next to this, the most important reasons for the dairy farmers to choose for grazing or zero-grazing after building new housing systems are studied. To answer the research questions, dairy farmers who built a new housing system or are planning to do so are interviewed. The interview is taken by telephone in a quantitative way. In the end, information from one hundred dairy farmers is collected. \nThe trend of decreased grazing of dairy cows in The Netherlands seems to stabilize. 13% of the dairy farmers agree with that. The other 87% thinks that the number of dairy cows that is grazing will keep on decreasing the coming 10y. Dairy farmers that let their cows graze after building new housing systems mention that animal welfare and personal values were the most important factors in their decision for grazing. Dairy farmers that apply zero-grazing say that economics and labour were the most important factors for choosing zero-grazing.",
