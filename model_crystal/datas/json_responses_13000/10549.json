    "summary": "I am a telecoms engineer manager with over 15 years' experience covering various emerging technologies across different sectors and working in a number of international markets with a track-record of achieving and exceeding sales and performance quotas within my field. \n\nMy career path started in 2005 with a Telecommunications Researcher role at Aalborg University (DK), then in 2006 I moved to Cisco where I worked for 4 years as a Systems Engineer in the Enterprise, Finance, Retail, Pubblic Sector and Commercial markets. I then decided to focus on Unified Communications technologies and in 2011 moved into a consultant role: as such, I was responsible for a broad portfolio of technologies, including video, unified communications and collaboration architectures, instant messaging and presence, digital signage. \n\nIn these years as pre-sales engineer I gained experience in how to qualify opportunities, develop customer relations, provide technical advisory, support commercial partners, run technology demos or pilots and deploy collaboration solutions. I also gained extensive multitasking project management experience. \n\nSince 2014 I have moved into IoT and discovered an incredibly interesting world where everything can be connected and data can be translated into knowledge and business outcomes. My passion for IoT has grown stronger every year and I have been promoted to technical leader and then manager of the IoT unit within my department. \n\nI've then expanded my role as manager taking over further responsibilities and leading more teams, moving eventually to Security. I currently manage the Network Security Customer Success organization, composed of over 25 team members, for South and Central Europe (CEUR/CEUR) in Palo Alto Networks.\n\nOn a personal side, I lived and worked in several countries, among them Great Britain, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands and Switzerland, I am very used to an international and diversified environment, I am fluent in English and have a basic knowledge of German, French and Spanish. I am also a passionate scuba diver and have enjoyed diving and teaching to dive in several countries.",
