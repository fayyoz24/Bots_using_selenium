    "summary": "I'm an experienced cultural researcher, strategy director, and consultant with a background in sociology and anthropology. I deeply care about combining creativity and strategy with an entrepreneurial way of thinking that serves people and the brightest ideas at the same time. \n\nMy career has never been linear, simply as life isn't linear either. I have always followed my diverse interests trusting in the flow of things. My creative and strategic interests are crossing discipline borders and I enjoy drawing outside of the classic lines. Based on my own experience I firmly believe that diversity and empathy are the keys to building interesting workplaces and successful brands.  \n\nIn 2012 I wrote the first sociological thesis about millennials in Germany and began consulting companies like Vitra, Volksbank, Bayer and many more on holistic talent management and community building. I'm an experienced speaker at conferences and ambassador for a new way of working.",

We kicked off the project with a workshop and brand sprint week in London and agreed on a \u201cbuilding the plane while flying\u201d approach in which we applied the idea of a new service brand positioning to several projects to reposition the brand in an active more consumer-focused way. My role was the creation of a holistic brand strategy and leading the marketing team with the implementation and execution of the strategy in several e-commerce projects. During this whole process, I managed my team (based in London & Hong Kong) remotely and virtually. \n\nUnfortunately, my project with Trendwatching was cut short due to Covid19 restructurings.",

The main focus of my thesis was the analysis of a potential generational habitus and the implications of such a habitus for Millennial talent management and organizational cultures. \n\nBased on the thesis I began consulting companies like Vitra, Bayer, Volksbank and many more about the future of work, intergenerational change management, and employer branding from a Millennial perspective. I've assisted companies in defining new working environments, understanding the importance of building collaborative workspaces and creating cultures that help to unlock their employees full potential. \n\nMarch 2018 I finished my Master Thesis in Anthropology at Humboldt University Berlin with the title \"Metamorphosis of Work - Community Management in Coworking Spaces\" in which I've analyzed and mapped out what classic organizations can learn from the management of such collaborative spaces.",
