    "summary": "I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for over 30 years of making a difference & inspiring and motivating students as an educator. Also through projects undertaken and acting as a mentor to young persons under 30 years. \n\nIn 2008, I achieved one of my dreams of raising funds for SOS orphans charity while trekking up Mt Kilimanjaro to 5000m. Swam an open water one mile sea swim 2019 to prove to myself a set challenge can be achieved. Working on regaining identity of being an athlete. Climbed United Kingdom\u2019s highest mountain, Ben Nevis in June 2022! \n\nMBA at the University of Liverpool has inspired me to engage in diverse entrepreneurial and social entrepreneurial ventures creating further opportunities with people and for people.\nThese have enabled me to finance the Future of Learning Centre and travel widely. \n\n The FOL Centre was created in 2014-2020 after attending the Future of Learning Institute at Harvard Graduate School of Education in summer 2010. \nInspiration drawn from spending some time with leading academics such as Howard Gardner and David Perkins in 2010 keeps my educational research interests at the forefront.\nAs a holistic lifelong learner, I draw inspiration by attending 21st-century  cutting-edge conferences. These have added to the momentum to create further projects and educational research that can shape the future leaders and be a change agent.\n\"TASTE OF SRI LANKA\" is a project on educating; on the use of spices and Sri Lankan cuisine. I am a recipe developer combining my passion for healthy food on the go and the love of Sri Lankan cuisine. Due to COVID-19 creating a sustainable projects to fund vulnerable at the economic margins.\nI am honoured & humbled to be the face of Cinnamon & narrating my Cinnamon story at the Amsterdam Museum ( Hermitage). The exhibition is called Collecting the City # 1 : Spiced Up! Asia to Amsterdam. ( March 2022 - August 2022 )",
