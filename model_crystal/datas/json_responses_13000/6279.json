Growth came in many forms. Finding a job, studying a new subject or overcoming oneself.\n\nThat modern guild in which all kinds of people further develop their own craft and responsibilities was rewarded in 2015 with an amount of 245,000 Euros in Rotterdam's CityLab 010.\n\nOur felt products were made to the highest standards a reached a wide range of customers.

Thus we highlight the connection between poverty and ecological destruction, ecological and social problems and sustainable and humane solutions."

That requires some self-motivation. On the other hand, you help develop a real alternative to commercial insurance. That feels good. And more importantly, it really works.  I noticed that when I suddenly had to have surgery in 2017 and 2018. For that reason alone, I think it is important to make my contribution first as a board member and then as a director. If you would like to know more about this or become a member of a Broodfonds, please get in touch."
