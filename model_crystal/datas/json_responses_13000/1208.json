The scientific question was to understand the origins and the degree of heterogeneity to consider to best describe deep groundwater movements in such low porosity and low permeability host rocks which are analogue to unconventional reservoirs.\nFirst, I established links between burial/uplift history and the porosity evolution of these limestones. I show that compaction of such micritic carbonated sediments is characterized by compaction bands which density depends on their initial grain content. Huge amounts of fluid can be stored in tectonically reactivated areas of the compaction bands (open stylolites) or/and in facies with preserved initial matrix porosity (turbiditic/contouritic facies) while fractures that remain located close to a few major fault zones play a relatively limited role in storage. I propose to use these simple criteria to classify a large variety of unconventional reservoirs. \nThen, I focused on permeability/storativity estimations from injection well tests and of the ways to best upscale these properties to the entire reservoir. I combined the reservoir geological model with various multivariate statistical approaches to explore the relationships between the hydraulic properties, the rocks facies, the pore types, the distance to major fault zones, the depth, etc. Final result is a method to better consider the heterogeneity at the infra-stratigraphic scale which is typical of such tight carbonate series.",

I have worked essentially on Petrel software (seismic interpretation).\n\nDuring this internship. My work was firstly attached to the picking of seismic horizons. Afterwards, I applied my academic and field geology knowledge to propose:\n- An interpretation of identified sedimentary architectures (processes, depositional environment\u2026)\n- A classification of tectonics features and a reconstruction of the structural history of the studied area",
