We setup the Lucence manufacturing facility and laid the robust roadmap for future medical device productisation. Lucence's ability to rapidly scale novel medical devices production allows us to navigate regulatory uncertainties of new products yet tap fleeting opportunities as they appear. We worked tirelessly to put these products out to the world including SAFER Inactivating Specimen Collection Kits and DeepMARK Next Generation Sequencing Kit.  \n\nThis episode (ongoing) is an unprecedented opportunity in the history of medical device companies.

I'm happy to announce that we have reached out to more than 50 institutions annually and have impacted more than 15,000 bubs till date.  This program is currently partnered with AIG Limited as we push for safer road user knowledge for our next generation. \n\nApart from product and corporate sales development, I am also involved with all digital marketing activities and creation within the company. It is important for a small company to \"know where to fight, and how to win\" , and therefore we looked very closely at strategising how we stretch the marketing budget on Google Adwords as well as various other online marketing channels o that we increase the quality of our onsite traffic. The team works closely to ensure the monthly marketing initiatives are aligned to the monthly growth objectives and targets set by the management.\n\nAs of March 2017, we have sold the company to a wedding planning firm to have the services integrated as part of their larger plans. I am currently pursuing interest in the area of Maker Education via Makedemy. \n\nSingapore Toy Club believes in Delivering Joy to every child we touch. Every kid should be themselves during their Big Day and that means, being full of smiles, laughter and anticipation for what the party brings - and that is Fun. Lots of them. At Singapore Toy Club, we provide the largest range of Bouncy Castles and Battery Operated Rides in Singapore.\n\nDelivering Joy - http://www.SingaporeToyClub.com\n\nFrom leasing of Bouncy Castles to home parties and corporate events, we have grown the competency to design and manufacture of inflatables with some notable projects being showcased at the National Heritage Board during the annual Children's Festival.",

Heavily involved in the initial testing of market hypothesis, hitting the grounds and knocking door to door at hospitals to seek audience with doctors. Developed and executed customer acquisition strategy for getting user base as well as being the main designer for the team, creating all necessary artwork required for publishing. This multi-hatting of roles was extremely interesting and rewarding as it was integral to the challenge of running a startup company.    \n\nHighs:\n1. Co-created the MedF1.com from scratch, together with my co-founders, Toh Hong Pang and Ryan Teo. \n2. Partnered with a clinical chain transacting over 100k of drug purchases in a single week.\n3. Alarmed the Sales Manager of one of the biggest Pharmaceutical company in the world, that one of her most important clients are no longer interfacing with her sales representatives but with MedF1.com.\n\nUnboxs Solutions powers MedF1.com, an online drug procurement platform allowing doctors to manage their drug inventory and ordering process all in one place. \n\nUnboxs Solutions believed that Doctors, Nurses and Clinical Assistants should devote their effort to the healthcare service of patients in their clinic. MedF1 replaces the need for clinics to manually call up pharmaceutical companies every week for drug replenishments so that both time and resource is better spent serving patients. The clinic-specific drug pricing and spending analysis of MedF1 helps clinics to be on top of new drug inventories that are introduced to market in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry. \n\nhttp://www.MedF1.com/",
