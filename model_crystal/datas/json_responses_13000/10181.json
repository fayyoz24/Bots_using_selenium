            "description": "this is the second game I made for my Game Design 2 Class, this time we focused on the following three subjects: Dynamics, Narrative and Polish. Just as before I had two weeks for each assignment, so here we go!\n\nI came up for the idea when thinking of dynamics, our first assignment. It meant we had to create a game where players would be switching play styles during play, I chose for a 2 player 2D platformer where players would try and shoot each other with bullets they had to pick up individually. this made the players switch between collecting bullets, shooting bullets and dodging bullets very quickly, i added triple jumping to make it more fast-paced and action-oriented.\n\nafter dynamics I got working on Narrative, I chose to go for pacing instead of an actual story as I thought it would support the game in the best way. both players got 5 lives, once all of them are depleted, that player loses. each time a player loses another life he will start running a little faster and jump a little higher, to make it seem like he is fighting for his life more and more desperately. this is also visualized by drops of sweat on his head. And the more lives a player lost, the more he will be sweating. After losing 3 lives that player will now no longer shoot in the direction the player moves in, but instead shoot in the direction the other player is, making in possible to shoot while on the run.\n\nAnd finally polish, in this subject we were to make the game more juicy. To let the game make the player feel like a bad-ass. I did this by adding sprites to the characters, adding camera shakes, gun sounds and music (made by Immediate Music, I take no credit).",

I also wrote an algorithm to make sure there would be no choke points in the level, but that was turned off due to design decisions. ",

This system was created by me without any previous pathfinding knowledge and I designed a system on my own that, in hindsight, closely resembled the Dijkstra algorithm. I am also proud that I was able to do this without any knowledge of Recursive functions, which I learned one year later.\n\nFurthermore I was responsible for all the math that calculated if a customer would buy an item and some of the design.",

It used two laptops, each with their own beamer that the player could see. one of them played video's that shows information on the subject of the game, which runs on the other beamer. The programming languages used were Actionscript 3, Java, a very small amount of C++ and also had some games that were made with gamemaker.",
