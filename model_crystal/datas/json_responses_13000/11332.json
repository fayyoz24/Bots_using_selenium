    "summary": "I carry out social science research covering themes such as migration and acculturation, public health, gender issues, population scenarios. At times I give lectures on demographic analysis methods and on my research-related topics.\n\nIn the past, I worked as a consultant to design, implement, monitor and evaluate social science surveys in different settings (e.g. American Samoa, Armenia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania). Upon request, I designed and delivered tailored training courses in Analytical Demography (including Population Projections) for government staff in several countries (e.g. Botswana, Eritrea, Egypt, Suriname (Dutch Guyana)). \n\nI try applying lateral thinking to resolve research and personal-life questions (E. de Bono,1969).
