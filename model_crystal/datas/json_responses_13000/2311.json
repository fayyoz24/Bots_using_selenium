            "description": "Recently, experiments and atomistic simulations have shown that metallic glasses display hardening behavior akin to metals. However, the underlying physical mechanism governing this behavior remains to be explained. In order to explain this, inspiration is drawn from earlier work on crystalline metals. As the sample volume reduces, the deformation behavior becomes sensitive to the imposed boundary conditions on the microstructural variables in crystalline materials. (Bittencourt,2003). In this work, an attempt has been made to study the corresponding effect in metallic glasses, by imposing microscopically free and microscopically hard boundary conditions. The simple shear simulations conducted show that small volume metallic glass samples display hardening when a sink-like micro hard condition is imposed. The result of \u201csmaller is stronger\u201d, which has been widely accepted in literature, has also been shown in this work. The plane strain tension and compression simulations show that as the length scale is increased (which equivalent is to reducing sample size), the deformation behavior approaches homogeneous conditions, and the ductility is increased to a large extent. Further, tension tests are conducted on notched specimens to study notch sensitivity effect in metallic glasses. It is seen that although there is an apparent reduction in the yield strength of the metallic glass with increasing notch size, the normalized ultimate tensile strength (strength of the unnotched specimen over the strength of ligament) remains insensitive to the presence of the notch. Also, it is seen that the plastic zone nucleates at the notch tip, and upon reaching a critical size, leads to the branching of a shear band. This effort is the first of its kind, where a continuum theory has reproduced the results of earlier atomistic simulations on notched metallic glass samples.  ",
