    "summary": "Does your speech resonate with your peers, clients, and stakeholders? \nDo you feel that you project less credibility because of your pronunciation?\ud83d\udde3\nIf your accent stands in the way of communication, then you are probably experiencing other symptoms such as:\n\n\u2714\ufe0f your accent interferes with your speech\n\u2714\ufe0f you have difficulty understanding others\n\u2714\ufe0f you\u2019re saying the right words but never in the right way\n\u2714\ufe0f your speech looks perfect on paper, but the delivery is underwhelming\n\u2714\ufe0f you experience interpersonal mishaps because of how you say things\n\nIf your answer has been a resounding yes to most of these questions, then it\u2019s high time you did something about it.\nSounding confident and well-versed is a major concern for any leader.\nIf you want to sound bolder, make a first step towards change and start taking Pronunciation classes.\n\nWHY WORK WITH ME\nI have successfully coached my clients on English and Accent Reduction Classes for over 10 years and have learned valuable lessons along the way.

Apart from pronunciation classes, I support my clients to reach the confidence to speak English in any environment.\nCommunicate authentically with your clients now.\n\nCURIOUS?
