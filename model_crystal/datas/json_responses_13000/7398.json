    "summary": "I am an active entrepreneur, and over the years I established various companies and businesses in different countries over the world. My main focus is in our family business in The Netherlands being the Verbruggen Group of companies.\n\nA special example is that over the years I gained a lot of experience in Bangladesh through our self established entity Deltadesh, and I believe to be your one-stop-shop to any type of setup you want to start in Bangladesh. I am also very honored and privileged to have been assigned as a honory consul to Bangladesh in The Netherlands.\n\nI am passionate about opportunities, where my main focus lies on enabling opportunity for the less privileged in the world.",
