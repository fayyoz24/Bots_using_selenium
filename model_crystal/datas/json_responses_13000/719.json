    "summary": "Global energy demand is expected to double by the second half of this century, driven by population growth and increase in energy use per capita in developing countries. Providing this energy in a sustainable manner is one of the key challenges of our generation.\n\nI am an energy business professional with broad technical and commercial background, motivated to bring scale to the energy transition to meet sustainable energy needs.\n\nAfter graduation I worked on large scale energy projects around the world in various technical and business development roles in Shell. Learning the energy business I realized its importance for prosperity but also its impact on our environment and wanted to make a difference in the energy transition. I joined the New Energies business as an Investment Principal at Shell Ventures, where I was responsible for the non-fossil fuels portfolio. Subsequently I was appointed the Commercial Head Europe for Shell Hydrogen and responsible for developing an industrial and mobility clean hydrogen business.\n\nCurrently I am the CEO of Battolyser Systems, a cleantech scale-up that develops and manufactures a breakthrough integrated battery/electrolyser product that can store electricity and produce green hydrogen from renewable power to balance societal demand with supply.",
