Successfully negotiated with NGO's about a Gray Whale monitoring programme, delivering a rationalised monitoring and mitigation plan, ref. http://www.iucn.org/wgwap. \nAchieved excellent data quality, while remaining within allocated budget thanks to good planning and efficient acquisition. \nAdministered interpretation of resulting 4D data; identified possible well interventions for several wells in one of the fields. The 4D data supports the field development planning for next 4-5 years. I presented results at the 2016 Russian EAGE meeting.   \nEnsured quality of Geoscience input into company's well delivery process. Efficiently dealt with typical issues which included formation top prediction, geo hazards assessment, well trajectory definition, casing point selection with respect to fault position, pilot hole definition and appraisal strategies.\nSpearheaded an investigation into an incident on a well that accidentally hit an over pressured hydrocarbon bearing zone. The investigation revealed shortcomings in the Company's Well Delivery Process. Provided potential and applicable recommendations for short and long term process improvements. The proposed changes are being implemented and the lessons learned were shared within the company and across the Shell operating companies.   \nFunctioned as 'Technical Authority' for all Geophysical work; accountable for shallow hazard assessment of all new production wells. Managed the planning, data processing and interpretation of a geophysical high-resolution survey conducted for the placement of a planned new platform and relief wells nearby existing facilities.",
