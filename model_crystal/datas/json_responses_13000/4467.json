    "summary": "I research and advise on the politics of inclusive development in complex and conflicted places. I focus on Asia, particularly Myanmar/Burma, in a global context. I lead a range of research projects on political and socio-economic inequality and political order in Southeast Asia, especially in the wake of COVID-19. Since the pandemic I am also focusing on the governance of the gig-economy in developing country contexts. My book, \"Outsourcing the Polity: Non-State Welfare, Inequality and Resistance in Myanmar\" is out in 2023 with Cornell University Press: https://bit.ly/3FLIzwR\n\nIn 2023 I commenced as Assistant Professor of Social Policy and Development at International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague (part of Erasmus University of Rotterdam). Prior to this I was a Research Fellow at National University of Singapore's Asia Research Institute from 2020-2023, and Associate Director of the ANU Myanmar Research Centre from 2017 till 2019. \n\nI regularly advise and collaborate with a range of like-minded agencies including Asian Development Bank, The Asia Foundation, Innovations for Poverty Action, Oxfam Myanmar, International Growth Centre, Centre for Good Governance Myanmar, United States Institute of Peace, The Carter Centre and TechChange. My writing and commentary on Southeast Asia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, South Sudan and Australia has been published in outlets including the Journal of Contemporary Asia, South East Asian Research, Institute of South East Asian Studies, The New York Times, The Economist, New Mandala, The Myanmar Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Lowy Institute for International Affairs and ABC News.\n\nI have been a Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics Saw Swee Hock Southeast Asia Centre (2022), Yusof-Ishak Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore (2018), St Antony's College, University of Oxford (2017), and University of Yangon\u2019s Department of International Relations (2015-16). I earned my Bachelors in Economic & Social Sciences (Honours I) from the University of Sydney, studied urban development and post-conflict governance at Georgetown University and took coursework in urban economics and strategic leadership at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).\n\nSpecialties: Social Policy; Democratic Transitions; Market Reform and Inequality; Conflict Management; Political Parties; Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs); Stakeholder Relations; Emerging Markets; Natural Resource Management;  Public-Private Partnerships;  Intergovernmental Relations",
