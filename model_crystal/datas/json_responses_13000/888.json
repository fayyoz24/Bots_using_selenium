    "summary": "Currently looking for internship opportunities in Europe (October 2016 - August 2017).\n\nI am enrolled in the Bsc in Mathematics at Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento (Italy), where I have enriched my knowledge of basic and pure mathematics since 2013.\nAt the moment, taking  part at  the Erasmus+ Program, I am spending a year abroad in the Netherlands at \u201cUtrecht Universiteit\u201d (September 2015 - June 2016). Here, with great interest in the application of mathematics to economics and finance, I invested my studies into the fields of Financial Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics and Econometrics. \nMy goal is to graduate in November 2016 and, after a year of internship, start a master in \u201cMathematics for Finance\u201d in a prestigious European university.\n\nI have been interested in the beauty of maths since I was a child, and this passion helped me develop a rational and critical mindset that I apply in every circumstance.  \n\nMy traveling experiences helped me discover and appreciate new cultures and have shaped me as an open-minded person. I have always given a great importance to my language formation. This has influenced me to explore close and far foreign countries to improve my English communication skills, to places such as the USA and the Netherlands.\n\nDuring the last nine years I have developed important teamwork skills by working in my parents\u2019 restaurant, first as a waiter and later as a chef\u2019s assistant. I value this experience as an important phase of my life since I felt part of a team, I polished my organization skills and learned how to work efficiently within a team environment, giving great attention to the quality of the outcome. Moreover I developed useful manual skills\n\nOther people usually describe me as an empathic and motivated individual.",
