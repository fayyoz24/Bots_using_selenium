            "description": "Geological mapping, sedimentological analysis and characterization of the Dwyka Group of the Karoo Supergroup and the Witteberg Group of the Cape Supergroup adjacent to the Breede River, Robertson area were conducted. The study area is in the Breede River Valley of the Cape Fold Belt syntaxis in the Robertson Area. The area lies between latitudes S33\u02da48\u030d1.44\u030e and S33\u02da48\u030d53.28\u030e, and longitudes E019\u02da38\u030d16.8\u030e and E019\u02da39\u030d8.64\u030d. Newton et al.  (2006) concluded that the Cape Fold Belt is largely ambiguous, for instance, the presence of two orthogonal converging trends, the low grade metamorphism and the apparent lack of significant igneous activity in preserved part of the fold belt pose problems for conventional plate-tectonic explanations and structures are poorly mapped in many areas in the fold belt. For these reasons, the study was carried out to determine the depositional environment, palaeocurrent directions, structural features, deformation and metamorphism, structural and tectonic evolution of the Cape Fold Belt, and of the Witteberg and Dwyka Groups in particular. Results were obtained by traversing, while analyzing and mapping the lithologies of the area.",
