I took on an internship with the University Museum of Groningen, where we were tasked to develop an exhibition proposal focused on the colonial nature of the museum\u2019s ethnographic collection. During the internship we learnt about the inner workings of the museum, the process of exhibition curation and development. This internship required us to both learn from the museum while bringing in our own ideas to create an exhibition that employed a variety of creative digital strategies. An exhibition proposal, or bidbook, was the final product of this internship. The proposal not only required the development of an exhibition concept, but also public relations and communications strategies, budgeting and the creation of visual designs. The internship taught us the stages in the development, creation and realisation of an exhibition. Overall the purpose of the internship was to develop our skills as heritage professionals and further our knowledge in museal practices.",

In my time there I assisted with administrative work, aided in the organisation of the \"Print REbels exhibition\" showcasing from July-August 2021 by managing the social media and PR behind the project as well as gaining experience in exhibition curating and management of the exhibition's invigilators. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to be given the time to explore Dublin's museums and cultural landmarks in an effort to broaden my understanding of Ireland's heritage and architectural landscape.",
