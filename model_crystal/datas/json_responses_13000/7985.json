    "summary": "Nice to have you here! Let me introduce myself. My name is  Siyana Koleva, I am from Bulgaria and currently, I am a second-year International Business and Languages student. I take Spanish and Dutch, and I have studied Russian and English at school. \nAfter I graduated from high school, I studied one year of Agriculture in Bulgaria but I decided that I want to do something else. That's why I came to the Netherlands to study business. Going abroad and living on my own in a foreign country was something that took me out of my comfort zone but I think that I made the right choice. \nSince I am in a more international environment I have learned to be more adaptive, flexible, communicative, and open-minded. My studies at the university developed my skills further. I worked in team groups, made projects, and extended made me \"think out of the box\". \nI look forward to my future developments in every aspect and especially, I look forward to the minor and the internship that I have to do during my third year.  \nAnd one last thing-I love traveling and exploring new countries, cultures, and cuisines.",
