To achieve this objective, the programme is aligned with the priorities of the National Treasury to address  weak procurement practices and poor infrastructure management. These are considered main causes of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure on basic service delivery within municipalities. \n\nThe overall objective will be achieved through two complementary key result areas (KRA):\nKRA 1 \u2013 More effective supply chain management (procurement) at local government level.\nKRA 2 \u2013 Enhanced infrastructure management (budgeting, planning and asset management) at local government level.\n\nWhile the ultimate impact of the programme will be at local government level, both KRAs include support to National Treasury and some Provincial Treasuries to strengthen them in their (constitutional and legal) role to provide support to the municipalities. Both KRAs also rely heavily on knowledge management and peer learning, which, together with Ecorys support are included as cross-cutting activities for both KRAs.",

Up to now, civil society organisations in South Sudan remained overwhelmingly dependent on meeting donors\u2019 programmatic priorities for financial support. The CSF aims to depart from this practice and build stronger organisations that deepen linkages with citizens and build up constituencies around certain thematic areas or for certain geographic locations. Civil society organisations have a central role to fulfil in mobilizing public opinion to increase influence on national, regional and local policies and demand greater accountability of use of public resources.\n\nThe initial phase of the CSF will run for five years and will have an initial budget of $20 million. An important aspect of the CSF is to provide grants to local civil society organizations to build up stronger organisations and alliances and to undertake governance and advocacy projects. Ecorys will set up the fund management system through four funding windows. As Fund Manager, Ecorys will take responsibility for devising and managing the grant application process, conducting due diligence checks, selection of grantees, overall financial management, output monitoring and reporting and capacity building of local organizations. In order deliver this suite of services Ecorys has teamed up with VNG International, the International NGO Training and Research Centre (INTRAC) and AKVO.",
