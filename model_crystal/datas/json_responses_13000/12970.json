In June 2013, a delegation of 20 women leaders from the Northwest visited Rwanda for almost two weeks. The program highlights included visits with elected leaders in Parliament, high-level ministry staff, NGO's and service organizations and educators from the Kigali Institute of Education and the Gashora Girls Academy.",
