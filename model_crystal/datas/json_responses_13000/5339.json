Our goal is to accelerate the transition to sustainable heating in the Netherlands and abroad. Our first product is a smart, hybrid heat pump for the Dutch market.\n\nThe Dutch government is strongly incentivizing 8 million homeowners to get rid of natural gas and start heating sustainably within the next few decades. Unfortunately, the current pace of heat pump installations is far too low. Therefore, Quatt is improving the overall customer experience, adding smart control software, simplifying the installation job and, last but not least, greatly enhancing the aesthetics. By doing so, we want to increase adoption by an order of magnitude.\n\nWe are developing a highly advanced control system based on several AI technologies, like Machine learning and Deep learning. This system enables us to operate our heat pumps, in conjunction with already installed natural gas heaters, in the most cost- or energy-efficient way, at any given day. We estimate this can reduce heating costs by about 20%. By combining this with D2C sales & installation, Quatt is aiming to reach a payback time of 3-4 years; and thus a very quick uplift in sales.\n\nQuatt is working towards an installed base of 1 million heat pumps.",
