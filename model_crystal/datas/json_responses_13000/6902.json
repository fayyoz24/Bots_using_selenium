    "summary": "As a professional learning development specialist focusing on languages with 6 years of experience, I work with young adults and professionals in both academic and industrial settings. I support them to make better improvements in their work, not only in overcoming language barriers, but also in better understanding their roles and goals. I work on innovating teaching methods, I am also skilled in competency-based learning and development, training design, training needs analysis, developing training solutions, training evaluation and stakeholder management.\n\nI completed a PhD in language teaching development to create a more effective model of language learning in Hungarian to help the integration of foreigners. As a certified language teacher and mentor, I seek to find the best ways to teach Hungarian language to real-life situations. \n\nI am experienced in working in offline, online and hybrid environments. I have a strong interest in innovation. \n\nIn volunteer programmes, I also work as a coach and trainer coordinator with international communities, creating a platform for international doctoral students for their integration in Hungary. As the founder of the Talented Youth Workshop Association, I work on improving the supportive environment for young talented artists, finding the best trainers, organising skill-building workshops, summarising feedback and providing financial resources. \n\nI have experience working with a variety of partners in academic, scientific, industrial and cultural fields. I have excellent communication and organisational skills, I am enthusiastic, creative and results-oriented. I am also skilled in project management, stakeholder management, and managing and adapting to business change.",
