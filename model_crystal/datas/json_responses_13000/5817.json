    "summary": "In health system strengthening, my expertise is primarily in the area of health financing and the use of data for decision making - often through the application of performance-based financing (PBF) and strategic purchasing mechanisms. Since 2016, I have been closely involved in the piloting and scaling up of PBF in Ethiopia. In a range of other countries (including Zimbabwe, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, CAR and DRC), I provided technical assistance \u2013 including design and revision of programmes, training and capacity building.\n\nCurrently, I also support the WHO Health Financing team as a long term consultant, through country case studies as well as conceptual and thematic publications on the use of digital technologies for health financing and UHC. \n\nBeyond my work in health systems, I have experience with the introduction of PBF in primary education in the DRC and Ethiopia, as well as recent feasibility studies in Mali (2022) and Burkina Faso (2023). I believe in the use of performance-based mechanisms for human capital development and for the promotion of planetary health.",

Thanks to a successful pilot project, we generated interest at the highest government levels and are now scaling up PBF.
