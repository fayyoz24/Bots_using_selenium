    "summary": "Geologist specializing in carbonate diagenesis, sedimentology, and integrated subsurface modeling, I have worked on several integrated projects in a variety of basins mainly within the Middle East, the US, and the UK, with different levels of stratigraphic and structural complexity. I have experience in areas such as exploration, production, brownfield development, and potential alternative energies.\n\nIn 2012, I transitioned from academia to the hydrocarbon industry to broaden my skills in Production Geosciences. Currently, I combine my strong Geosciences expertise with software development and data analysis. I aim to continue to strengthen my current skill-set, expand my technical abilities further, and explore new aspects of applied geosciences.\n\nTechnical strengths:\n\nProduction geology domain expert\n\nCarbonate geology & diagenesis\n\nLean & Scrum, Agile, software development (POPM)",
