    "summary": "I am a self-motivated international development professional with over ten years of experience in working in the academe, government agencies, and multilateral organizations such as UNICEF, UNDP, and UNESCO with international experience in Brazil, France, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom.\n\nPart of my expertise is based on Impact Evaluation and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) with eight years of evaluating development projects. Identified effective school-based intervention projects for UNDP, Government and NGO`s and monitored its implementation in several municipalities reaching more than 22,000 underprivileged children. \n\nI am highly-experienced in conducting high-level policy research and analysis and produced the Brazilian Human Development Report in 2010, a result of a point-by-point nationwide consultation giving a voice to over half a million Brazilians. Provided evidence-based information which led to the build-up of the new Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) indicators for the State of Minas Gerais in Brazil. \n\nIn addition to that I am qualified in public and project management as well as proposal writing for local and national governments, besides being skilled in data and knowledge management with experience in handling large datasets (surveys) for UNICEF`s equity-focused evaluation using STATA. Able to author technical research, statistical analyses, and briefings while maintaining high professional and unbiased standards. \n\nTo conclude, I am able to successfully handle stakeholder relations and represent organizations in high-level meetings with authorities and elected officials. Proven experience in serving in an advisory capacity to political figures resulting to significant changes in public policy and reviewing specialised journal articles for the International Review of Administrative Science (SAGE).",
