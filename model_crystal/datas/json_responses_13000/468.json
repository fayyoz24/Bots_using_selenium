Success in e-commerce is determined by laws of conversion, use of conventions and by enabling choice. Not by exceeding expectations and offering serendipity. This is why all profitable online fashion stores look more and more the same. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Pieter Jongerius will bring together the worlds of fashion, touchpoint strategy and e-commerce design. After this talk, you will have learnt a very concrete approach to obtaining success in fashion e-commerce, illustrated with recent best practices.",

We have respectfully come to call this form of scrum \u00c3\u009cberScrum.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Pieter Jongerius has shared his best-kept scrumming secrets with experienced Scrum practitioners. What tools, what deliverables and what rhythms should you use to actually succeed in designing & developing at the same time?
