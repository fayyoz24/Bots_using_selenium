They interviewed about more than a thousand people about their concerns for their communities, politics and economic future. The result was a comprehensive snapshot of opinions across racial, socio-economic and political lines from Americans from all walks of life. The challenge to us was to visualise this as an engaging digital experience, encouraging users to explore the many insights and points of view. \n\nThe creative strategy was to create a seamless journey from one sound bite to another, emphasising the human element of the project by having portraits of the interviewees front and center. The line also serves as a metaphor for the road trip journey itself, and for the connections between people, places and ideas. The audio is stitched together so that each section can be listened to in isolation or explored quickly, simulating the chatter of a crowd.",
