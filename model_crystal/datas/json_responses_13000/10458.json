    "summary": "- Highly experienced software and embedded systems engineer with degrees in: Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry & Biophysics and Computer Science.\n- Extensive real-time, embedded systems and hardware design experience, including medical devices and communication equipment. \n- US citizen with valid Dutch residence/work permit\n- Looking for new customers/projects in either the Netherlands or USA (June 2017). \n\nCurrent internal project(s):\n- Aging research: developing software in R for a novel form of RNA sequencing data analysis.\n\nExamples of past project work includes:\n- Web and user interface - part of a small team which created an integrated server for online customer ordering, production management and product shipment.\n- Performance optimization - designed a new algorithm to reduce computational time by between one and two orders of magnitude on a processor which failed to meet real-time requirements.\n- Memory optimization - reduced memory requirements on a data acquisition system by 40%, greatly increasing its data buffering capabilities.\n- Code cleanup/refactoring - rewrote a kidney dialysis machine, converted 130,000 lines of  C to C++, reduced source code by 40% and made the software far easier to  maintain.\n- Hardware - designed a PCB which plugged into an existing CPU socket to provide a field installable fix for multiple hardware design errors in a communication system.\n- I have written well over a hundred device drivers for new and existing embedded systems and desktop computers, as well as debugging problems with numerous drivers written by other developers.\n\nFor additional information, see below, visit my company web site at: www.deatech.com or contact me: dealy@deatech.com\n\nWhen I'm not doing Software, Biology or Electronics:\n- Natural building instruction and talks on environmental and lifestyle issues. Primarily cob (earthen building) and ultra high efficiency wood stoves (rocket stoves).\n- Martial arts: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Tae Kwon Do",

Features included secure command interface to the radio relay units, web based system administration and status monitoring, configuration of data acquisition parameters, security protocols to allow customers to only access data and configuration for their units and user configurable data report generation / display. Worked with MCC's software developers to create system and software specifications; designed and coded all of the server software; configured and installed a Linux based server platform.\nCreated device drivers and hardware diagnostics in C and assembly language for a MC68332 microcontroller to manage an RF data communication link.\nAnalyzed a network of 8051 micro controllers controlling an RF communication link for causes of performance problems and numerous bugs. Made major software changes (in 8051 assembly and PLM-51) and devised field installable modifications to fix the hardware bugs, increasing system throughput to more than four times its best prior data rate.\nOther projects performed for Meteor Communications include: development of test/diagnostic software for use in PC board manufacturing; custom QNX device driver written in C for data acquisition; debugged several existing products, correcting a number of core hardware and software design problems; developed software to interface a GPS unit to a data communication system; ported a data acquisition and RF communication program to a new hardware platform; re-designed and coded software on a data acquisition unit to reduce memory consumption by 40%.",

This not only helps people to provide themselves with housing they may not otherwise be able to afford, but by using local, natural materials, eliminates most, if not all of the pollution created in the construction of modern housing. Through my business, I have donated web development, computer services, and web hosting to Cob Cottage Company since the mid 1990's. I have also on occasion assisted them in course preparation and as a guest speaker discussing my experimental work on earthen buildings and off-grid living."
