To elucidate the effect of vitamin B12 deficiency on Macrophages, Liquid Chromatography based MS-MS was performed to investigate the alterations in the lipidome of Macrophages after a 48-hr long period of deficiency in the media.\n\nTHP1 cell lines were cultured in the presence of RPMI media and the cell line was treated with PMA for their differentiation into macrophages.The cultured macrophages is grown in vitamin B12 media. Vitamin B12 assay was performed to measure the intracellular vitamin B 12 in the Thp1 cell line. The lipids were extracted from the cells and Liquid chromatography- Mass spectrometry was performed for the identification and quantitation of lipids. In order to measure the net efflux of cholesterol in Thp1 cell line after B12 treatment, Cholesterol efflux assay was performed. Proteomics quantification technique such as Isobaric Tags for relative and absolute quantification(itraq) was conducted to identify the differentially expressed proteins in vitamin B 12 treatment.",

The variants were analysed in 500 diseased samples and 96 control samples.\nThe GG genotype was high among the control group  , while CC genotype had the highest frequency in the patient group.  CC genotype and C allele of TCF 21(12190287) polymorphism are considered as genetic risk factors for CAD",
