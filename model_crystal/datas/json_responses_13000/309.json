    "summary": "I am a graduate in possession of two degrees and a Masters. \n\nThe first was International Relations and Policy which I obtained from the University of Political Science in Palermo, Italy. The latter was gained in Milan, where I studied International Relations. Then, I obtained a Masters in Diplomacy at ISPI (Institute of International Political Studies) in Milan, Italy. After my studies, I did an internship at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium. \n\nThroughout my education and professional experience within various sectors my sales, customer and communicative skills have developed to an excellent level.\n\nI have experienced studying and working in many high pressure environments and have vast experience in working to set targets.\n\nI would like to state that my primary ambition is to find a role which will give me a new invaluable experience of working within an international organization such as private or public institutions which represent Italian interests abroad.",
