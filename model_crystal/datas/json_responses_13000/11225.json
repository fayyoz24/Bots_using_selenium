    "summary": "As a business professional seeking growth through continuous learning opportunities, I obtained my Masters' Degree in Economics & Business, specializing in Behavioral Economics. My interest in this field stemmed from my work experiences which exposed me to various types of customers, clients, and other stakeholders, as well as the increasingly crucial role that data plays in business. I find analyzing data to derive insights beneficial for strategic decision-making to be interesting, challenging, and fulfilling.\n\nThroughout my work experiences, I have a demonstrated history of working in B2B services, food & beverages and non-profit sectors across three countries. My career journey has brought me to my current track of market research, marketing, and data analysis, where my experiences include research within the manufacturing, trading, oil & gas, services, and development sectors.
