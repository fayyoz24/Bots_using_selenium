    "summary": "Me as a spark. Worlds as gases.\n\nEvery possibility is a spark that I allow to catch fire. Every spark is a trigger for different worlds. These worlds catch fire, illuminating infinite possible routes as if they were gases in contact with a spark. Routes that take shape and come together with one goal: to create value. As in life, this is my approach to solutions engineering: select and move the puzzle pieces until you find the perfect size, until everything is in its place in the smallest detail. \"Everything In Its Right Place,\" as Radiohead says.\n\nAnd the creation of value is possible only thanks to people. I strongly believe in people and in sharing know-how to achieve common goals. I am an extremely empathetic person and a careful observer. My overall vision, curiosity, ability to synthesize, and attention to detail allow me to be a point of reference in any context I find myself in.",
