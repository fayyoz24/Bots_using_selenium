    "summary": "I recently finished my studies as MA \u201cArchaeology Theory & Practice\u201d at Lund University. Over the span of my Bachelors at the University of Amsterdam my interest in Digital Archaeology grew. In pursuit of this I followed electives in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and digital 3D modelling at the 4D research Lab. My BA thesis consisted of the development of a cumulative viewshed analysis within GIS. My ambition for further development and gathering of these skillsets brought me to Sweden were I followed a two year Master program. Within this program I was further taught in the use of GIS and 3D modelling tools, worked with different kind of laser scanners, satellite data and frequently with image-based modelling. A combination of (most of) the above mentioned techniques and methods form the foundation of my MA thesis, in which I researched how to increase the transparency of conduct of digital archaeological 3D reconstructions within the boundaries of a 3D GIS environment.\n\nMy passion lies foremost in 3D modelling, making reconstruction within the framework of cultural heritage and (building) archaeology and discovering/researching ways to communicate the underlying process to peers and the public.",
