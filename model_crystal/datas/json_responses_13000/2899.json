    "summary": "Product manager with extensive hands-on experience building and shipping successful b2b, b2c, e-commerce, data analytical, educational, open-source, and technology products globally. In my work I always look for ways to efficiently move forward while ensuring we have fun on the way ;)\n\nOutside of my daily product job I am a practicing certified ICF coach. I do life coaching and help individuals with all sort of changes and moving forward building the life they want to live and enjoy every day. \n\nMy anthropologist nature gets pleasure from meeting people. learning from their experiences, and helping their unique lives. It is not a surprise that I get inspired by traveling, discovering new cultures, reading biographies and observing people during my usual running in the city excersizes. \n\nI relocated to Amsterdam from Moscow 5 years ago and found here home. Of course, I miss my home in Almaty, Kazakhstan, but I carry a piece of it in my heart, always.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to get in touch or try out free 30-min coaching session, feel free to say hello through InMail or schedule it using https://taplink.cc/mursya",
