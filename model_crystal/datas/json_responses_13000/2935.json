    "summary": "I am still surprised to see how there are several \"big/global/multinational/how you want to call it\" companies underestimating the power of pricing in their businesses. For sure, success of any business depends on all the departments however one fact to keep in mind: pricing generates revenue.\n\nI am a 10+ years experienced Pricing Professional with a demonstrated history of working for international and multinational companies operating in very different industries and countries. Another fact, a competent pricing person can easily adapt to any industry/company in a short span of time, as myself did by moving from the fastest pricing industry (tourism/airline) to the slowest (mining).\n\nI have a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Finance and Investments from Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University (the Netherlands), and also an MSc degree in Tourism Management/Business Administration from Hacettepe University (Turkey).",
