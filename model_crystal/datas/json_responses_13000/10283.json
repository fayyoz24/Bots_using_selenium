    "summary": "After experiencing a talented Marcom team within a leading Fortune 200 tech company in Arizona, I decided I wanted to try new things and develop my career outside of the US.\n\nFast forward to today\u2026\n\nI\u2019m exploring my Dutch roots and working abroad in Amsterdam.\n\nI dove into the startup world with bunq, online bank and European fintech powerhouse, when I first moved to the Netherlands. I\u2019m proud to say that I successfully built and led the first Content Marketing team from the ground up.\n\nThen it was time to take on a new challenge.\n\nI entered into the world of hospitality during (unexpectedly) one of the most unstable years for the industry yet. But as a wise man once said... \"with no risk, comes no reward\". Now overseeing my talented team of 4, I manage all Marketing, PR & Communications for Zoku International: hybrid hospitality frontrunner and \u201cone of the 25 coolest hotels in the world\u201d as quoted by Forbes. \n\nOne of the proudest accomplishments in my career so far? Being a key player in tripling Zoku\u2019s portfolio across Europe during a pandemic. \n\nOperating in 4 countries, we successfully expanded to Copenhagen and Vienna in 2021, Paris in April 2023, and can now call ourselves an international home base for business travelers in some of Europe\u2019s most livable cities.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 As we\u2019re all about connecting people and ideas here at Zoku, shoot me a message if you have any Marketing, PR or Communications related inquiries, collaboration requests, ideas - you name it.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Feel free to follow me for the occasional marketing tip, work abroad opinion piece, or funny meme.",
