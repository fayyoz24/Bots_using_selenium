    "summary": "I am doing my masters in Earth, Structure and Dynamics (Geophysics) with an additional program Earth & Sustainability at Utrecht University. One of my strongest skills is the ability to oversee, and get a grasp of, entire processes as I do this on a daily basis, being specialized in mantle dynamics. This requires a strong background in mathematics, physics, geology and numerical modeling as well. However, during my master in Earth, Structure and Dynamics the link towards society was not always there and made me enroll for the Earth & Sustainability program, in which I have to follow courses and do an internship of 6 months. Ideally I would like to be able to use my analytic skills and work together with others to produce something that is beneficial for society. \n\nNext to my study program I engage in social activities, do sports, have done different committees and had side jobs. I am interested in the world around me, which also triggered me to travel, mostly solo, for 11 months to South-East Asia, Australia and New Zealand, in between my bachelor and master. This interest in the world is also the reason why I am trying to learn some Japenese as I am intrigued by the country. Furthermore, I like being in nature and do all kinds of outdoor activities, like hiking or kayaking for instance. Other passions of me are sports (watching and doing it myself), at the moment I do snowboarding and climbing, and music. I like going to festivals and search for new music to listen to.",
