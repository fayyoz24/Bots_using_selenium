I teach tailor-made courses for English, and Dutch as a second language (NT2). \n\nFor the Atletiek Unie I teach athletics coaches. I teach them how to train children aged between 6 and 18. Technical elements as well as pedagogic and didactic elements are part of the course.\n\nA group of disabled persons who want to improve their didactic and pedagogic qualities were trained by me for over four years. The disabled work together in a group called GIPS (Gehandicapten Informatie Project Scholen) and visit schools (GIPS Spelen & Leren) and companies and organisations (GIPS Training & Advies). Their goal is that they will be treated as people and not as disabled. They want to teach the others that they can speak for themselves and that they will ask for help if they need it. I help them making interactive programmes they use to reach their goal.",
