            "description": "The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region experienced violent conflict between Indigenous and Bengali settler community during 1976-1997. The Bangladesh government sponsored the settlement of Bengali speaking people in the region, which was the main cause of violent conflict as it uprooted a large number of indigenous people from their homes and cultivable land. The aim of this experiment is to investigate current trust levels among indigenous and settler Bengali populations following a peace accord in the CHT of Bangladesh. \nThis paper investigates the effect of long-lasting conflict and ethnicity on trust and trustworthiness among indigenous and settler Bengali populations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh using lab-in-the-field experiments. We ran an incentivized trust game in the field with two interacted, experimental conditions: (i) whether the participants lived in an area where violent conflict took place; and (ii) whether they have been matched with participants of the same or opposing ethnic group. We used standard trust game designed by Berg et al (1995) in the field to examine this question. \nThe regression results show that conflict experience tends people to be more trusted as well as trustworthy while group cohesion has significant effect on trust and trustworthiness. Although ethnicity does not have any significant effect on the trust and trustworthiness investigation into the effect heterogeneity for ethnicity reveals that for indigenous people both conflict location and out group decision has negative significant effect on the amount sent (trust). On returned amount conflict does not have any effect but group heterogeneity has positive significant effect. The results are robust across OLS and Tobit regression model. The result also implies that previous conflict experience and out group interaction motivate both the communities to build trust and trustworthiness in other words positive social capital in the CHT region of Bangladesh.",

            "description": "Research on refugees\u2019 involvement in cross-border trade is in its infancy. The world has an estimated 26 million registered refugees and 4 million asylum seekers. Many people from conflict-affected settings move to neighboring states, settling in border zones characterised by intense commercial flows and informal cross-border trade. Despite humanitarian assumptions that refugees enter countries of asylum to remain, many use diaspora links to engage in cross-border trade, supporting both their own livelihoods and expanding host-country enterprise. Yet trade in legitimate goods faces many challenges, e.g. weak governance, political tensions, fluctuating border regulations, and arms/drug controls. Refugee cross-border traders are vulnerable to coercion, while the positive impacts of this trade remain unnoticed. Centre for Peace and Justice of Brac University in collaboration with School of Geography and Planning at Cardiff University, UK has been implementing a pioneering study on informal cross-border trade in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh. This research has been undertaken as a part of a multi-country study where the other two collaborators are School of Women and Gender Studies, Makerere University, Uganda; and Universidad Simon Bolivar, Colombia. The research examines case studies in three continents: Bangladesh/Myanmar border, Colombia/Venezuela border, and Uganda/South Sudan border, all low-income countries.",

The Grand Bargain drafted at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit recognised the need for humanitarian financing to be efficacious and cost-effective as global fragility increases and aid dollars are stretched. Localisation has been widely recognised as a strategy toward achieving effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and equitable participation due to the unique capacities of local actors to understand and respond to the needs of conflict and disaster-affected populations. CPJ has been commissioned by UNDP, Bangladesh to formulate a \u2018Localisation Roadmap\u2019 for the humanitarian response in Cox\u2019s Bazaar. CPJ was entrusted to facilitate inter-stakeholder discussions as well as incorporating input from other relevant stakeholders in Cox\u2019s Bazaar District (e.g. government, refugee, host community and private sector representatives), and put together a pragmatic localisation strategy. The \u2018localisation roadmap\u2019 is to incorporate global localisation principles and adapt them to the particular context of Cox\u2019s Bazar. Finally, the roadmap will set clear targets to be achieved within the specific timelines through a delineated process. This study will support the Localisation Taskforce (LTF) formed under the leadership of IFRC and UNDP and comprised of donors, UN agencies, international NGOs, and Bangladeshi NGOs to take this process in to implementation.",

In addition to the massive refugee crisis, widespread irregular migration has also led to significant shifts within the population. As a result, a vast number of Rohingya families now live splintered across borders. Most separated family members possess no travel documents and have little prospect of reuniting.\n\nThe study aims to provide insight into the processes of decision-making and risk-taking by the Rohingya in relation to transnational mobility. It explores implications for personnel security and wellbeing of the refugees themselves and of their families, but also regional conflict and security dynamics. Finally, it aims to identify the positive and negative effects of interventions by state and development actors on the refugees\u2019 access to relatives abroad and remittances, and on cross-border movement, with a view to informing more effective programming and policymaking. CPJ has been implementing this study as part of X-Border Local Research Network which consists of The Asia Foundation, the Carnegie Middle East Center, and the Rift Valley Institute.",

Hundred of thousands of Rohingya were affected and an unknown number were killed, resulting in nearly a million people fleeing their homeland and taking shelter in the neighboring country of Bangladesh. Hosting such a large number of refugees has had significant impacts on the host population of Cox\u2019s Bazar.\nThese impacts have led to a lack of social cohesion and negatively affected the potential for inter-communal harmony between the two communities.\nA study was undertaken by BRAC University Centre for Peace and Justice (CPJ) between January to April\n2019 to identify factors affecting social cohesion, resilience and peace building between the host and Rohingya refugee communities. The study consisted of a series of consultations conducted in order to compile the perspectives of different groups of host community stakeholders",
