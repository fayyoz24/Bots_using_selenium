    "summary": "In pursuit of my dream job - becoming an ATCO. Currently working on that within the EUROCONTROL Ab Initio programme that prepares future ATCOs to take up the role at the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC).\nPreviously worked as an Airline Data Researcher at ch-aviation - a global provider of commercial aviation-related data via the DaaS concept - Data as a Service. An excellent experience which gave me an insight into numerous aspects of commercial aviation.\nAlso volunteered and worked as an airside operations assistant at an aerodrome in the vicinity of Zagreb (LDZL). \nIn the summer of 2021, I obtained my Master's Degree in Economics at the University of Rijeka. \nI am a glider pilot and a private pilot, further perfecting and learning about concepts such as airmanship, communications, meteorology and many more, alongside enjoying soaring. These concepts, I believe, will work significantly in my favour through my future aviation endeavours.\nExtensive experience in tourism and hospitality where I have worked at the positions of bartender, waiter and receptionist in various bars, restaurants and hotels. Developed communication skills, workplace management and coordination.\nValuable international experience gained during the 4-month long Erasmus student exchange in Poland.\nMy hobbies include reading up on general aviation literature, including news, history, aerobatics etc., static and RC model making, helping restore and fix aircraft, as well as watching sports - WC Air Race, F1 and ice hockey.",

Throughout the paper, the importance of tourism, air transport and logistics chains planning is stressed and explained. The airports of Zagreb and Krakow are analysed in detail, as well as the transport systems and logistics flows to and from six airports. The airports in question are Zagreb, Krakow, Frankfurt am Main, Schiphol (Amsterdam), Heathrow and Stansted. Zagreb and Krakow airports are focused on as the primary analyzing points in this paper as they differ in business models. This has direct implications on cities as destinations and vice-versa, by forming logistics flows of different values and participants. The airports at Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London are observed as secondary objects of analysis, as they all have approximately the same distances from Zagreb and Krakow and they each represent specific logistics flows solutions, including different business models by airports and airlines. They are analysed by the expected time consumption as well as the expenses required. After identifying and analyzing every important and relevant transportation system to and from the airports, they are formed in logistics chains that are graded based on their average values. A complete picture is then formed through which certain parts of the logistics flows are recognized as advantageous or disadvantageous based on their variables. Complete logistics flows are then graded based on the expenses associated with them, as well as the time required to cover them.",

The initial part of the paper is referring to the historical development of tourism and air transport as well as their correlation, and subsequently on the basic characteristics of air transport. The main parts of air transport - airports, airlines, routes and passengers, have been segmented in the initial part of the paper. The following part is orientated to the most important segments of air transport in the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Poland \u2013 their similarities, differences and touching points with tourism. The final part of the paper is based on the main subject \u2013 determining the role of air transport in the tourism of Zagreb and Krakow and their comparison. All of the basic characteristics of tourism as a group of activities and the air transport industry have been analysed in great detail for both cities and compared to each other. At the very end, a conclusion has been made, regarding the advantages and disadvantages of both destinations and the possibilities of improving the business model of the Zagreb International Airport and the role of air transport in the tourism of Zagreb.",
