Because of my experience in a variety of IT specialisms and business environments, I can easily adapt to new and different work environments and surroundings. \nMy current position (as well as some previous positions) have a heavy focus on collaboration with various business partners, department heads and leaders. Through this collaboration I have a strong advantage in working closely with any part of an organization, because I can understand the business needs quickly and can easily identify with the stakeholders' position.\n\nGallup Strength Leadership Top 5: Adaptability, Harmony, Developer, Belief and Deliberative",

Every day I wake up to try and make each department reach its full potential by using Bioventus' IT systems the way the department and its users would like to use it. I listen to requirements and the current ways of working and procedures and recognize the key factors that can or need to be improved or adjusted. Depending on what's required by the business stakeholder we may conclude that a change in IT systems is needed, a change in the way the business is working is needed, or we need additional IT resources and or systems to satisfy and kickstart the business's work and successes. \nFurthermore I've been more involved in global initiatives regarding IT Infrastructure and Operations; e.g. a new cloud contact center platform for our various Customer Service departments across the globe. This allowed me to renew my understanding of that side of the business and work together with all involved and making sure requirements were understood and the transition to the new system to be without any issues but all together smooth. I've also been more involved with developing, securing and streamlining our corporate websites and the update process for content, security and server updates. I'm helping to evolve our mobile device management platform to the next level after I've piloted the first implementation process in our company.\nTo summarize, I'm helping the business grow and become more professional when it comes to IT and the use of IT products, systems and services.",
