I am aware of differences in culture including the way people do business. My globe-trotting has contributed to my worldwide network, where I can, more often than not, find people who have the information and skills I am looking for. That, added to my language and computer skills, assures my customers get the high-quality services they deserve!\n\nI love new challenges, ideas and information, which is why I enjoy my work, every day!\n\nAmong translators I am known as the Hugging Translator. This is because I believe in the personal touch. I hug my projects, look at projects from various perspectives and keep close to both my customers and the freelance colleagues I work with.\n\nHaving a small company means I can pick and choose the projects I work on and the colleagues I work with...",

It is a wonderful example of the difference an erudite translation can have on the product. In Germany, the Netherlands and a few other countries everyone reads the magazine. In the USA where Donald was born the magazine is no longer printed. The difference is based on the quality of the texts, on the knowledge of the translator, of the writers.",
