    "summary": "If you\u2019re looking for an English teacher, please hang up and try someone else. \nI\u2019m not an English teacher.\n\nSo\u2026.what do I do?\n\nI help highly-motivated people redesign their English communication strategies so they can share their business, passion, and talent with the world in order to create true impact, value and growth, both personally and professionally. \n\n\nI\u2019m a Word Wardrobe Wizard, a Confidence Catapult, and a Mindset Magician.\nAt least that\u2019s what my clients say.  Het Parool called me \u2018radically compassionate\u2019, the Volkskrant said that I was a \u2018grammar fairy\u2019, Jinek called me \u2018the English coach to the stars\u2019, and the de Telegraaf said \u2018I was a super ball full of positivity\u2019. \n\nWhether I\u2019m working with a global CEO in Brussels, coaching a startup in New York, in the recording studio in Amsterdam, or volunteering for the English Corner program on Bali, I\u2019m here to make a difference in how you talk to the world. \n\nAnd how you talk to yourself.\n\nJust like everyone else, I have a long story and a short story. You can find the long story (from Jan 1!) on BuffiDuberman.com, and the short story is below.\n\nThe short story:\n\nI'm originally from Brooklyn, New York and gave my first English lesson in 1987, while working as a refugee volunteer. \n\nFast forward to today -  I\u2019ve written many books, and coached over 10,000 clients since then.\n\nI\u2019ve worked on 15 TV shows as an English coach or consultant, have been a guest on 100+ shows, and have high-performing private coaching clients in 7 different countries. 20% of my clients are native English speakers. I\u2019ve won 2 awards, worked on over 500 songs, hold the world record for the World's Biggest English Lesson (Bravo stage, Lowlands, at the age of 48, wearing glitter boots and a cape #NeverTooLate), coached for 10 movies, and have tried about 13 different cheesecake recipes, many of which have sadly failed the Does It Taste Like It Should test. I\u2019ve written 160 workbooks, lost 3 pairs of glasses, created Communication Nation (the World\u2019s First Business English Membership Program) and have created 2 amazing people with one fabulous person. \n\nI am here to serve as an English coach and consultant, and my love for my life, just like my Instagram, is unfiltered. \n\nToday will only be here once- so how are you going to spend it? \nMore fun and games on www.buffiduberman.com.",
