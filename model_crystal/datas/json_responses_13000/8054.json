In consultation with administrators, councilors and policy officials of the municipality of Sarhan, a practical design was made for a park with sports and game facilities close to the mosque and to the children's library.  \n\nTrees can grow by terrassing the terrain and storing rainwater.\nThe park is constructed via the GIZ Cash For Work program.  Led by a local contractor, a team of 15 Jordanians and 15 Syrian refugees will construct the park.  These people will gain experience and grow a network while giving a public space to their community.",
