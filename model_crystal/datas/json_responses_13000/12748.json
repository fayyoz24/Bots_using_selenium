The models for the project included individuals with conditions such as Down Syndrome, Autism, HAE, Gaucher's disease, Tuberous sclerosis, Juvenile dermatomyositis, Spinal muscle dystrophy, hearing loss, and other rare diseases.\n\nBy highlighting their abilities rather than their disabilities, the project challenged stereotypes and showed what people with these conditions are capable of achieving. The project has been a great success in raising awareness and promoting inclusivity for people with disabilities and rare conditions in Macedonia.",
