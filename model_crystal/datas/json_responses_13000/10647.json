    "summary": "I\u2019m a former Big 4 Auditor who made a career switch into the recruitment industry 6 years ago, naturally blossoming into an Accounting & Finance specialist over the years. I have placed over 100 candidates in the Asset & Wealth Management space, mostly in APAC. Life has brought me to Amsterdam in 2023, and I now lead the Treasury & Specialist Finance desk (Benelux) for Brewer Morris (part of The SR Group).\n\nBeing a huge people person, I love getting to speak to people of different personalities and backgrounds on a daily basis. It is also incredibly fulfilling to help discover and nurture the brightest talents in my space.\n\nWhat sets me apart from other recruiters, is my empathy and open-mindedness. I enjoy thinking out of the box and finding candidates that may not necessarily tick all of my clients\u2019 requirements but have the right skills and attitude for the job. \n\nWhen I'm not busy working, you can probably find me exploring the world, eating yummy food, or hitting the gym to burn off said yummy food!\n\nIf you're interested in opportunities in the Treasury & Specialist Finance industry, would like to work with me to fulfill your firm\u2019s hiring needs, or connect for the future, I\u2019d love to hear from you.",
