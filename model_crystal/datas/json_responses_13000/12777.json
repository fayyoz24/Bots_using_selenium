    "summary": "A geoscientist by profession, I used to look for the oil and gas you\u2019d need to drive your cars and heat your homes. I have worked across roles from subsurface project delivery, to business planning, portfolio management, and strategy, all up to a group level. It\u2019s afforded me the priceless opportunities to grow outside of my comfort zone in Trinidad, by taking on increasingly complex assignments in the U.K., the USA and Netherlands.\n\nMore recently, I\u2019d moved to The Netherlands to join Shell\u2019s Strategy Team in The Hague, as Group Portfolio Advisor, supporting the Shell Board and Executive Committee in ensuring resources are invested in the most attractive, resilient and competitive projects and assets across the Group in line with the our strategy, and in response to the Energy Transition.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion, with a focus on sexual orientation and gender identity (LGBT+), is an area in which I am a bold and vocal advocate, both at work and in societies at large. Location permitting, I volunteer with Diversity Role Models in the UK: an education-sector charity focused on embedding inclusion, empathy and self-belief in the developing minds of minorities--truly rewarding, as well as entertaining!",
