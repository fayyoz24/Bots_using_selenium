    "summary": "I am an enterprising and determined Mechanical Engineer always looking for new challenges. \n\nAfter a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I decided to pursue my Master's degree in Product Innovation engineering in order to reach solid management competences while improving my technical knowledge. My desire to always face new challenges brought me to conduct my master thesis project at Budapest University of technology and economics. \n\nI am a dynamic and open minded person with a strong \"can do, will do\" attitude and great communication skills. \n\nI started my engineering career as System Install Engineers in ASML, as I was looking for a dynamic traveling position in a cutting edge international environment. \nAfter then I decided to focus my growth in the project management area, moving to Project Coordinator for EUV install at ASML.",

During this project, two main research activities have been conducted:\n-the effects of laser beam welding on super duplex SAF 2507 previously cold rolled;\n-the effects of gas metal arc welding on lean duplex LDX 2101 and LDX 2404 with different backing gasses.\nThe samples have been characterized by OM analysis, several magnetic tests and corrosion test.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENT:\n-Increase my organization skills;\n-Gained great English language skills (written and verbal);\n-Improve my knowledge of Microsoft Word, powerpoint, excel",
