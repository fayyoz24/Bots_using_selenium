    "summary": "Approach\n\nStudio Kontou creates spatial experiences and sensorial interiors to enhance well-being and mindfulness in particular. Central to Kontou's work is the holistic integration of mindful design, natural elements and art; all to stimulate the senses. With a multi-disciplinary network, Kontou puts together the best team for each project, to be able to create qualitative experiences and interiors.\n\nResearch as base\n\nBiophilic design and related research serve as a steady platform for Kontou. Taking nature as the greatest example and source of inspiration, its restorative and relaxing qualities are being translated in holistic environments. To benefit the physical and mental state of its beholders and elating sensory awareness into everyday life.\nExtensive research in various fields as introspection, serenity and mindful interconnection, led to launching the first multi sensorial experience \u201cContemplation Spaces\u201d during Dutch Design Week 2017. Followed by research project The Design of Spatial Well-being to investigate methods and developments to create healthy environments, in a broader perspective. \n\nThe Founder \n\nJustine Kontou, educated as a commercial economist with degrees in trend forecasting & concept development, is specialised in art and design. Her years as curator and projectmanager a.o. for Eindhoven365 and Dutch Design Week led to Justine combining these elements with the purpose of affecting wellbeing. \nJustine is about strategy without losing the imperative creativity and finesse to visualise and materialise her beliefs. Her purpose is to create meaningful, healthy environments that are soothing and empathetic to its users. This holistic approach in optimising the whole spatial experience to enhance well-being, is still very new and innovative. By nurturing her infinite curiosity for the sake of new insights and additional experts to work with, she keeps ahead of social developments.",

Tessa Koot was the art director. The design of the exhibition expressed how artists and designers are currently positioned by the creative industry. Since OXI was more than a exposition only; it aimed to draw attention to the social problem that alternative business models for designers and artists are urgently needed.\nWith OXI we presented a new exhibition concept. Govert Flint showed a possible alternative business model for designers and artists in the exhibition. By measuring and analyzing the emotional respond of visitors to the items with help of software, using cameras. \nThe aim of our concept is to stimulate a public debate to jointly restore the occupational form of work for talented designers and artists.",

In these spaces your senses will be stimulated by a fine selection of art, design, sound, tactility, and also by the use of scent, to immediately put you in a different mindstate.\nDue to distinct and unique features of selected objects and installations, you consider yourself in a world of its own. This one of a kind atmosphere is enhanced by water-themed installations, the usage of a variety of tactile materials, and matching fragrances and audio to create the best experience possible. To execute this concept, I collaborated with architect Lex Hildenbrant, psychologist Florijn Vriend, students of University of Amsterdam and a wide selection of twenty designers and experts. Research has been done on existing scientific studies that focus on the stress-reducing effects of art, light, sound and (references) to nature.\n\nThe first edition will take place in The Student Hotel Eindhoven during Dutch Design Week, from 21 to 29 of October. Everyone is invited to experience Contemplation Spaces themselves. Visitors\u2019 feedback will be collected and used for further development, to create permanent Contemplation Spaces. These permanent locations could be hotels, workspaces but also healthcare facilities or residential communities. The final goal is that as many people as possible can one day benefit from the stress reductive effects of art and design. \n\nTo finance its experimental launch & research during DDW 2017, I started a crowdfunding campaign hosted by voordekunst.nl. Contemplation Spaces is the result of a deep collaboration between artists, designers, and scientists who believe in the importance of creating healthier, more peaceful spaces to balance out the stressors presented by modern living. As a work of passion, the project is unpaid, yet requires significant time and money to bring to fruition. Until 4 October you can find the campaign through the link below.",

A multidisciplinary approach and connecting design/art with business/retail can be seen as the main focus of this collaboration. Most of these projects were executed for the likes of the annually held event Dutch Design Week. Justine Kontou was entitled project manager in most of these cases. \n\nSome examples:\n- Project management for the exhibition MAARTEN BAAS MAKES TIME during Dutch Design Week 2016.\n- Justine Kontou created a strategic format for custom-made tours during Dutch Design Week (2014, 2015 and 2016). This way she connected companies and government institutions with matching designers to encourage possible future collaborations and/or projects. \n- Another example is a custom-made program Justine set up for a group of designers from Beijing in July 2015. This program consisted of five days of lectures and visits to a variety of different Dutch Designers and Design studios. \n- Justine Kontou executed different projects to visualise the substantive collaboration between main sponsor ABN AMRO and Dutch Design Week. For example, the annually held ABN AMRO DDW preview (2014 and 2015) but also by creating inspiring programs and custom-made tours during Dutch Design Week for ABN AMRO officials. (2014, 2015 and 2016). \n- In 2015, she also was in charge of concept and execution (again as project manager) of different projects to visualise the substantive collaboration between partner Eneco and Dutch Design Week. This partnership led to a variety of activities such as \u201cToon design challenge\u201d, \u201cEneco laadplein\u201d and \u201cSmart home day\u201d during Dutch Design Week 2015.",

To create a better involvement of  the city center of Eindhoven during Dutch Design Week, Eindhoven365 initiated a special project: Unexpected Interaction. \nIn my role as project manager for Unexpected Interaction I developed, together with Daan Melis, a concept to connect designers, retailers/ restaurants and cultural institutions and I organized the whole project. Which resulted in an energetic city center during Dutch Design Week 2013; at six different public squares in the city center appeared design installations created by Nacho Carbonell, Maarten Baas, Kiki en Joost, La Bolleur, Lucas Maassen en Martin Schuurmans. The squares were connected with a laser beam to create a route through \u2018Area Innercity\u2019. Nex to this, I connected 36 shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s with 36 different designers for expositions and other special events to complete Unexptected Interaction. All the locations were signed with special displays made by Joost Gehem, Tiddo Bakker and Victor Sonna (all members of Collaboration-O).",

With all that information \u2013 as well as the inspiration we picked up on the way \u2013 we are creating concepts for companies that are linked to fashion.\n\nStyling is one of the main ingredients for our concepts, along with innovative trends and marketing.

Therefore we don\u2019t border our creativity to fashion, we also seek inspiration in the field of architecture, design, music, lifestyle etc.\n\nOur mission is to create concepts for companies, that are truly distinctive and also help reach the goals of the concerning company. Depending on the project, we create and perform a concept on our own, or we unite talents, visions and ideas to create and/or perform a concept together. In the second case, we act as a mediator. We create the concept and bring creative talents and commercial companies together to create a win-win situation for all parties. We will organize everything and make sure there is clear communication and planning during the project\n\nExamples of our projects:\n- trend forecasts for (concept)stores and labels\n- events for (concept) stores and  labels like fashion shows, expositions etc.\n- photoshoots for (concept) stores, labels and magazines",
