    "summary": "Are you looking for an experienced trainer and facilitator in international development cooperation? Do you want to strengthen capacities of your organisation, team, staff members or yourself? Are you lost in approaches to make your trainings and workshop more interactive, sticky and with real impact? Or how to set up a monitoring system using theory of change and other tools? \n\nI can assist you with developing learning trajectories; project development and management;  results based monitoring; and capacity strengthening processes of your organisation, your company, your team and yourself for example. I do this through interactive training, facilitation, advise and coaching in English, French and Dutch.\n\nI am a geographer with a broad interest, I am a generalist with several areas of expertise in international project development \u2013 and management which are: organisational strengthening, training and facilitation skills (online and blended), project management, results based monitoring, proposal writing, responsible tourism management, leadership and (intercultural) communication skills. I have a background in Human Geography, Development Studies and Responsible Tourism Management and I am a certified skills trainer. I have worked and lived in several African countries and in conflict prone areas. I have practical handson experience with a diverse multicultural target audience and I love to cocreate.\n\nMy approach is pragmatic, dynamic, safe and with an eye for people and collaboration. My passion lies with people and organisations with a mission to improve life for people, flaura and fauna all over the world. I enjoy working with those who are eager to critically assess themselves, their organisation and their projects, and who strive to become more professional and improve the quality of their work and collaboration. My geographic experience is mainly West and Central Africa (WCAF), however my interest is global. I work fluently in French, English and Dutch.\n\nFeel free to contact me for any inquiry you have or have a look around on my website www.josefiendekwaadsteniet.nl.",
