    "summary": "After finishing my studies I worked for seven years in different developing countries (Burundi, the Gambia and Solomon Islands),  after this period I worked as generaal practitioner in a health centre in the Netherlands for 22 years.  Two different worlds but both fascinating. I am motivated , have a strong feeling for social justice and realise how priviliged I am.  With an open mind and real interest in  others I hope to be able to support the less priviledged ones and to learn from them, whether it is  abroad or in the Netherlands.       \n\nIn 2014 and 2015 I participated in two Rotary projects in Ethiopia (Nekemte and Dembidolo area) the main focus was on upgrading the Health centres with on- the- job training of the nurses. There are no Doctors in those  health centres.In october  2015  I was on a short mission to Malawi for a possible new Rotary project in collaboration with the college of medicin.\n\nFrom march to may  2016 I will do an interim as generaal practitioner in a Centre for Refugees (AZC) in Tilburg and in june- july I will participate in a Rotary Doctors project in West Kenya naar Kisumu. \nThe  introduction of the NCD Programme in 5 Health centres has  started in january 2016. NCD stands for  communicable  diseases, the new  threat of the developing world with diseases as Diabetes and Hypertension, cancer, asthma and epilepsy.In Kenya we concentrate on prevention and treatment of Diabetes and Hypertension and their long term effects  like cardio vasculair diseases etc.\n",
