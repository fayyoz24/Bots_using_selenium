    "summary": "After two years of working in China as an English teacher, I recognized two recurring themes: 1. My Chinese friends and coworkers were always tired from too much work. 2. My students were so stressed about school work that they didn't even have time to have fun... And my work was only adding to it.\n\nI set out to create a solution instead of being part of the problem. That's why I started my own company called Feel Good Productions (or \"ShengQu - Life's Joy\" in Chinese). Feel Good Productions aims to boost well-being and help people live life to the fullest by creating experiences that connect, inspire and entertain.\n\nI'm Eline and I believe learning new things and self-development are the most important things in life. I'm always looking for new experiences and challenges to help me grow. Furthermore, I love different cultures and languages. Besides my mother tongue Dutch, I speak English, German, Spanish, and Chinese. \n\nFor more info about my skills, education, and experience, please read my profile. If you have any questions or remarks, don't hesitate to contact me!\nI'd love to see how we can work together.",
