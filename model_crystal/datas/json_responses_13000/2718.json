            "description": "What makes science science? What would make philosophy science? These questions dominated 19th century philosophy and determined the structure of academia as we know it today, in particular in conceptualizing the contrast between human and natural sciences. One of the most radical and influential proponents of the idea of philosophy as science was Franz Brentano. On July 14, 1866 Brentano stepped up to the pulpit to defend his thesis that the true method of philosophy is none other than that of the natural sciences. This became the north star of his school. Brentano considered the mind as the main field for philosophy, a descriptive science of consciousness: empirical, but not experimental, and subjective, but not introspective. This engendered the misconception that Brentano wanted merely to establish psychology as a science, but his project was far more ambitious. Only if we grasp the true scope of Brentano\u2019s project, we can understand the theoretical unity of his school. Brentano\u2019s students Stumpf, Marty, Meinong, Von Ehrenfels, Husserl and Twardowski, put his ideal in practice in the movements they founded and influenced: Gestalt psychology, Prague linguistics, phenomenology and Polish logic. Their diversity and success eclipsed the common origin of the underlying ideal and their unity as a school, acknowledging Brentano merely as precursor. My project will show that their shared mission of elaborating philosophy as science fundamentally determined the development of these diverse movements. Contrary to current mainstream interpretations, which dismiss any psychological foundation of science as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, I will avoid such pigeonholing. Overly broad and dismissive labels hide the subtlety and nuance of the foundational debates in the 19th century, which cut across disciplinary sub-divisions. I will show how the ideal of philosophy as science enabled the School of Brentano to overcome the false dichotomy between logical and psychological foundationalism.",

            "description": "The research project aims at developing a systematical and historical account of the philosophy of mathematics and logic in the School of Brentano, focusing on the most prominent member of this school, Edmund Husserl. Husserl was a highly systematic philosopher, integrating research from disparate fields: mathematics, logic, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, etc. Moreover, like his master Franz Brentano, Husserl considered philosophy itself as a science. As a first question, we should ask what the role of mathematics and, broader, formal sciences in Husserl's philosophical system is. To address this question correctly it is important to place it in its relevant context and proceed by examining the position of logic and mathematics in the philosophical theories of the other members of the School of Brentano. Can we speak of a Brentanist philosophy of mathematics? To answer such questions we must understand the relation between mathematics, logic and philosophy in their positions.",
