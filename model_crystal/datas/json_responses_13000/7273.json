    "summary": "As a PhD Candidate at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS) at Maastricht University, I am passionate about advancing federated learning, a novel paradigm of machine learning that enables distributed and collaborative learning without compromising data privacy. \n\nMy research focuses on developing concepts, techniques, and prototype technologies for federated learning on vertically partitioned data, which is a challenging and underexplored scenario where different parties hold different features of the same data instances. I aim to apply my research to real-world domains such as healthcare, maintenance, or logistics, where federated learning can offer significant benefits in terms of data quality, scalability, and security.\n\nI am eager to learn new things, collaborate with diverse and talented researchers, and contribute to the state-of-the-art in federated learning. I am also interested in exploring the ethical, social, and legal implications of this emerging technology, and how it can be used for social good.",
