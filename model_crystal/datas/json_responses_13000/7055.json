    "summary": "I have a degree in Biotechnology and a Postgraduate Certification in Project Management. I have 10 years of experience working in the Quality area within the pharmaceutical industry, where I developed a deep interest in the concepts of GxP, Operational and Laboratory Excellence, Continuous Improvement, Lean and Right First Time. \nWorking in the pharmaceutical industry has allowed me to develop my flexibility and adaptability to change: I am a professional trained to work in a demanding and fast-paced work environment, and I can perform well under pressure. \nI have managed or supported challenging and cross-functional projects, experience that enhanced my organizing, planning and prioritization skills. \nI have also worked as a Quality Control Analyst for several years, a position in which I developed an analytical, logical and Quality mindset. \nI love working in multicultural and collaborative environments, where the team's mission is to improve people's lives and well-being. My professional goal is to develop my career in the Life Sciences industry (Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices, CROs) or other industries, in areas such as Quality, Manufacturing, R&D, Supply Chain, Engineering, Clinical Research or Project Management.",
