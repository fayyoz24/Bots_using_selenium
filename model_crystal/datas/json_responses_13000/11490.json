    "summary": "Growing up in Venezuela as part of a large and close family, I was always surrounded with activity, optimism, laughter and passion. Values I take with me in everything I do. I thrive in fast paced environments where diversity of thought and background make ideas flourish. Living in 7 vibrant cities worldwide made me appreciate the challenges and excitement of working with multicultural teams.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nAlways keen to learn and grow, I did a MBA in Boston and continue to participate in professional development programs. My curiosity motivated me to move abroad and take different marketing and management roles with local, regional and global scope in organizations like Mattel, Mead Johnson Nutrition and Nickelodeon. \n\nLEADERSHIP\nI am a participative team leader, easily identify a course of action and facilitate teams to find their own way to approach challenges. Having been in many business situations I know how to pivot to get the right result. I am demanding but fair, I am a coach and mentor. I am curious, passionate and a little goofy. I promote environments where people feel heard and comfortable to speak up resulting in commitment to work harder to reach common goals. I strive to be a role model.\n\nBACKGROUND\nI embraced opportunities in my career to develop cross media marketing plans; research consumer journeys; accelerate digital transformation and lead cross functional team on apps development.\nAlthough my experience was gained at large corporations, I worked internationally where resources are limited. I quickly learned to be willing and able to wear many hats and roll up my sleeves. I adapt easily. I get things done!\n\nFUTURE\nMy passion for business results derives from strong team collaboration. I am a self starter, looking to share my wisdom :) and experience. Happy to share thoughts and act as a soundboard.\n",

After 6 months though, I was promoted to General Manager Nickelodeon Northern Europe. \n\nSuddenly I found myself not only responsible for the commercial area, but also for the programming, production, creative and marketing for linear TV Channels (20 feeds); digital platforms (verticals, apps, social media); and Consumer Products in 11 countries with a revenue of $115M. To say I hit the ground running is an understatement.\n\nWith a team of over 70 people, I was able to move Nickelodeon to the next level turning back declining ratings in Germany. Guiding a multidisciplinary team, we worked towards the launch of Nickelodeon into a 24-hour channel in GSA. The Nicknight brand targeting millennials was born,  rapidly gained loyal fans due to relevant content, interactive multiscreen events, social media engagement and original language programming.  We successfully relaunched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with new content and a comprehensive consumer products program.\n\nWith my interest in digital, I loved leading the team that created and launched a VOD app (IOS and Android) for Nick Jr called \u201cWatch and Learn\u201d. The app was the winner of a Lovie Award in the category: \u201cMobile: Education & Reference\u201d in 2014 and set the base for the rollout of additional mobile products in the region.",

In order to reach out to parents more efficiently across Europe, and establish direct communication, I initiated a digital transformation project working on an European platform and content strategy together with LBI Lost Boys. \n\nI created and led the European rollout for Enfamil\u2019s first consumer campaign messaging the benefit of DHA (Omega 3 fatty acid) on infant formulas.
