Reasons are many, but the most important ones are that prosthetic care is worldwide highly centralized, local clinicians face several obstacles to start their own clinic and the current supply of prosthetic clinicians worldwide falls short by 40.000+\n\nLegBank combines a social entrepreneurial strategy to decentralize and professionalize care to vulnerable rural communities, empowered by technology. We delivered:\n\u2022  an app that eases data collection, guides clinicians in treatment protocols, stores patient information safely and gives patients the opportunity to share their satisfaction\n\u2022  an orthopedic product, called the Majicast that creates a prosthetic socket in 5 minutes automatically. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1r490s5bds\n\nLegBank was initiated in June 2014 in order to bring orthopedic care right to those who need it most. We started in Colombia, where OCHA states 'a forgotten humanitarian crisis'; 17 million people live in areas of (post)conflict and it is highly affected by landmines. \n\nLegBank won several awards. Also, we received significant financial support from the Dutch government and Google.org.",

One of the major problems is the lack of resources, which leads to insufficient educational performances.  ProPortion proposes a new sustainable model.\n\nThe main idea behind this model is that schools can become self-reliant through optimization of operational costs, and by securing own revenue streams through social entrepreneurial activities. With more financial stability, schools are empowered to fulfill their primary function to enable children to develop and realize their full potentials and aspirations, which are essential building blocks of a society.\n\nIn collaboration with two Ugandan Organisations (The Child is Innocent and Grassroots Innovation Uganda), we researched the local context in Uganda, where a big number of children in especially North and East Uganda do not have access to quality education.  We executed a baseline study, created a detailed stakeholder map, elaborated the concept, and prepared a feasibility study together. ",
