Responsible of delivering the design of three oil processing modules, two power generation modules, and four manifold modules weighing a total of 8,500 metric tons. F4W became and is still a huge success for SBM offshore.\n\n2] FPSO Topsides Engineering Project Manager, for a new FPSO, to be located offshore Angola. Joined the team within the last 4 months to further optimise the FEED design and finalise the updated proposal. The topsides facility consists of 17 modules, weighing a total of 14,500 metric tons. The main technical challenges are the high Gas to Oil ratio, the local content, and the stringent client requirements. \n\n3] Part of Pre-FEED proposal engineering team, for a new FPSO in the Gulf of Mexico. The topsides facility consists of 10 modules, weighing a total of 8,250 metric tons. The main technical challenges are the heavy crude, high H2S and salt contents and the very low hydrocarbon gas content.",
