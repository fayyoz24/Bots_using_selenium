    "summary": "To me, everything starts with relationships, with people. Business flows from personal contact. There are few industries or regions where I haven't been able to deal with people. I see opportunities and I grasp them. I bring parties together and break new markets open in a friendly and expeditious manner. In doing so, I can turn opportunities into transactions.\n\nI've lived and worked in France, Sweden and Zimbabwe. I' ve broken open the Swedish and Norwegian markets for the Dutch concrete products industry, and facilitated the purchase of Dutch products in developing countries. In the early 1990s, I expanded into mediating real estate transactions. From a base in Stockholm, I guided Swedish investors through real estate purchases in the Dutch, German and Belgian markets. I also introduced Dutch parties, such as PGGM and Rodamco, into Sweden. Since 2007, I have worked as director of H\u00f6rnstenen B.V., an originally Swedish company that invests in real estate in the Dutch market.\n\nThe diversity of countries and industries in which I have worked have helped to develop my feeling for business and my people skills. And I reap the fruits of that experience every day. Over the years, building relationships and negotiating have become second nature. It's what I love most: opening doors and initiating and guiding transactions. I enjoy using my experience to help others in their activities in the international business market.\n\nAt the moment, H\u00f6rnstenen has commercial properties for trade, industry or logistics available for the Dutch market. At one of the most important crossroads for road and air transport, right next to the A4 motorway conveniently close to Amsterdam, Aalsmeer and Schiphol: see www.halA4.nl We also have office spaces available, such as the office building at Westeinde 10 in Voorburg.
