The program was arranged together with public and private sector entities in Gothenburg, Sweden\n\n2) Wale Wale community development in Kenya - Hands-on volunteering and community development experiences for Engineering students in a developing context, where students can utilise their Engineering studies practically. During my year, we enabled 6 students to travel Nairobi, Kenya, for 6 weeks to carry out projects with the local NGO Wale Wale which works to create stable and sustainable living environments for youths in the city",

The program was arranged together with public and private sector entities in Gothenburg, Sweden\n\n2) Wale Wale community development in Kenya - Hands-on volunteering and community development experiences for Engineering students in a developing context, where students can utilise their Engineering studies practically. During my year, we enabled 6 students to travel Nairobi, Kenya, for 6 weeks to carry out projects with the local NGO Wale Wale which works to create stable and sustainable living environments for youths in the city"
