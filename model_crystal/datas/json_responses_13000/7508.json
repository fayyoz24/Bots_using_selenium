This helps to avoid negative environmental consequences like climate change, and also to supplement farmer revenues.\nThrough the combination of satellites with blockchain technology, farmers in the carbon market will be able to use our solution to generate a credit for each unit of nitrous oxide emissions avoided by a change in nutrient application practices. This credit can then be sold to a company or other entity that wishes to offset its own emissions.\nThe project applies Sentinel-1 and -2 data to provide information about crop state. Sentinel-3 data is used to monitor and analyse the complete carbon cycle, and Sentinel-5p data is used to measure the amount of CO2. Together with cognitive techniques, this data will improve the traceability of a farmer\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nhttps://www.copernicus-masters.com/winner/soil-carbon-sequestration-in-agricultural-systems-yes-we-carbon/",

Every single user will be guaranteed information at any time of the day and in any area of the world.

OLCI is placed on Sentinel-3A; B platforms and is planned to be launched on Sentinel-3 C, D as well.\n\nThe instruments operates in the spectral range 400-1020nm. It is known that OLCI spectrum is influenced by ozone absoption in the Chappuis band with a maximum located at 603nm. Therefore, OLCI atmospheric aerosol/ocean colour retrievals are corrected for the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). On the other hand, total ozone column can be retrieved from OLCI measurements themselves over bright underlying surfaces such as snow. As a matter of fact, the snow spectral reflectance around 620nm, which is mostly due to light absorption by ozone molecules. The degree of this decrease can be related to the total ozone column. This has been demonstrated previously using the data of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on board ENVISAT.\n\nThe first results of TOC retrieval over Antarctica using OLCI have been published by Kokhanovsky et al. (2020).\n\nAlthough the total ozone is currently retrieved by many instruments, they have quite large spatial resolution. OLCI provides TOC on the scale 300m, which makes it possible to study inter-pixel TOC variability and also improves understanding the total ozone change in areas, where gradients of TOC are large.\n\nCurrent activities related to this project are aimed at the development of better cloud screening and atmospheric correction algorithms over snow.\n\nThe algorithm for the total ozone column retrieval will be prepared lather this year. It will be based on the minimization of the cost function (derived using radiative transfer theory) with respect to TOC and some other atmospheric parameters including aerosol optical thickness.\n\nThe work is performed by Vitrociset Belgium\u2019s employees Dr. Alexander Kokhanovsky and Filippo Iodice.",
