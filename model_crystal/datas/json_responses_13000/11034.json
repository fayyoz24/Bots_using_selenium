Most importantly, I engaged with a highly diverse and talent team of predominantly young professionals \u2013 this is an organization with an incredible future if it can harness the creativity and motivation of this team, and link it strongly to the evolving business needs to the members. The sustainability challenges for global supply chains are very diverse and seem to be increasing over time, thus requiring a robust support that only an organization like amfori can provide.\n\namfori is the leading global business association for open and sustainable trade, It brings together over 2,400 retailers, importers, brands and associations from more than 40 countries.

The Resident Coordinator's assignment is to position the United Nations County Team and the UN's programme activities towards national priorities and ensure  collectively we support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The challenge is therefore two fold; first, we need to ensure that there is a unity of analysis and purpose amongst the 26 UN agencies active in Egypt. Since my arrival we have been building internal coalitions for action, developing joint programmes and ensuring we speak with one voice to key reform issues. The second part of the assignment focusses on the relationship with the Government. Adopting a SDG focus, the UN system needs to increasingly engage the development financing discussion. The knowledge and experience of the UN needs to be taken to a new level, where it will impact the lives of all poor, marginalized and deprived men and women. One major issue is Egypt's rapidly growing  population and the need to provide jobs, education and health services for a young and growing population. UNDP therefore continues to focus on poverty and the major disparities within society. It is looking to upscale successful programmes and bolster the national capacity to results and reform.",
