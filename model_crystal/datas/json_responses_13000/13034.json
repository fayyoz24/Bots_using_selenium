    "summary": "I am a social scientist specialized in transitional justice, conflict analysis and community involvement in Africa and work as a freelance consultant. \nFrom early 2009 until the beginning of 2011 I worked for Impunity Watch helping to prepare its new project in the Great Lakes region of Africa (Burundi) and develop its collaborative research approach and I am still a member of its Advisory Board.\nFrom 1998 to 2005, I worked in Rwanda with Penal Reform International (PRI), coordinating its research into the Gacaca jurisdictions and programme of support to the prison administration.\nI have also served as a consultant to various organizations on participative action research and traditional community protection mechanisms in relation to women and children in DR Congo, and to IDEA on African traditional justice mechanisms in the context of grave and massive human rights violations. \nMy considerable experience in this field extends to five years as a member of the military wing of the African National Congress/ANC in South Africa. This led to my arrest in 1985, followed by asylum in the Dutch embassy until I was exchanged for a commander of the apartheid regime in 1987. \nI also have held various academic positions, including at the University of Brasilia, where I was Visiting Professor for African and Race Studies from 1989-1994. From 1968-1981 I have been Senior Research Fellow at the Africa Studies Centre (ASC) in Leiden (Holland). Besides research, I lectured at Universities and other Institutions dealing with Third World affairs.\n\nSpecialties: Concerning my professional experiences, education, recommendations and additional information, see my CV in English or French, obtainable by writing to: Klaas de Jonge <dejonge.klaas@gmail.com>\n\nAs a hobby I have built up a collection of African Art.",

These jurisdictions can be seen as a highly decentralised system of participatory justice (a kind of reinvented traditional way of community based conflict resolution) to answer the justice problems Rwanda was facing after the genocide. PRI\u2019s research objectives were: To study the development and implementation of the Gacaca process and to document the whole process. PRI adopted a research-action approach and it had a social change agenda, such as to identify the problems and solutions together with the stakeholders (victims, perpetrators, population, authorities).\n- From 1998 until 2001 I was the head of a Programme of Support to the Prison Administration in Rwanda. Its objectives were the training of prison officers and personnel and the establishment and/or development of production activities in a selected number of prisons.",
