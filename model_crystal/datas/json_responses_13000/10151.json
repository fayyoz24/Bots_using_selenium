The modules we presently can offer are:\n\n- Summer school: cross-cultural country knowledge of all European Union member states. Always organised in a Southern-European country towards the end of June. Duration: two weeks abroad, predeparture assignments at home\n- Market research for Dutch Embassy. Depending on the prefered market and availability of adequate students and project funding, we opt for one or two Embassies per semester\n- Winter school: communication skills, from a Euro-Asian perspective. \nLocation: always organised in an Asian location in February. Our partner school is in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Duration: two weeks abroad, predeparture assignments at home.\n\nWe afterwards plan to add a distance learning module as well (in English), on European Leadership.\n",
