It has funded a wide range of access programmes in early years, school and university settings, with a focus on research, policy and innovative practical projects with a system-wide relevance. \n\nThe Trust works to combat educational inequality and prevent the subsequent waste of talent. It is particularly concerned with breaking the link between educational opportunities and family background, and in realising a system in which young people are given the chance to prosper, regardless of their family background, school or neighbourhood. \n\nSince 1997, the Trust has commissioned over 135 research studies and funded over 200 programmes helping tens of thousands of young people and addressing social mobility. \ufeff"
