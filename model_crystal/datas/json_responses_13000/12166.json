    "summary": "I am a Seasoned Chemical Engineering, Research and Analytics professional. I am having 10+ years of industrial experience in process development, concept development, R&D, data analytics, software development, modeling and optimization. I hold PhD in Chemical (Reaction) Engineering.\n\nI have wealth of experience in developing process concept from inception, catalyst testing, building process models, using flowsheeting and equation oriented tools for development of novel process concepts, and working out concepts via front end development framework. I also have first hand experience on manufacturing sites as well as technical support for troubleshooting/technology/operational support. I have  experience in building numerical and data analytics tools that use high fidelity models, to improve operational performance of production sites. I have acquired leadership skills in leading small teams of process engineers or data scientists.\n\nMy professional passion is development new routes for sustainable fuels and chemicals, as it combines all of my strong sides such as mathematical modeling and optimization, process development, reaction engineering, catalysis and chemistry. I believe one needs deep expertise in all of the subjects to be sucsessful in the area.\n\nI am strong advocate for STEM education and people development. I am enthusiastic about the role of mathematics and data analytics in the future of process industries.",
