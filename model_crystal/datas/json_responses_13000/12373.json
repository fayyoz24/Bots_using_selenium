I applied a population genomics approach and performed genome-wide mining of highly-diagnostic SNPs and developed a cost-efficient genotyping panel of 20-40 markers in a planktonic snail from the Atlantic Ocean. This genotyping panel increased the number of screened individuals by 5-fold with significantly less costs compared to reduced-genome representation methods.  This helped us to better understand the barriers of dispersals in the open ocean and gain more insight into population structure dynamics. The latter is of great importance when assessing the adaptability of the population towards the changing ocean environment and selection processes in the open ocean.\n\nThe poster presentation was presented at the SCOR MetaZooGene Symposium in September (2022), Dublin, Ireland.",

We organized courses and prepared students for fieldwork. By organizing short excursions and longer fieldwork expeditions Macedonian and international students were trained in different field methodologies and had the opportunity to actively contribute to the knowledge of North Macedonia's biodiversity. Some of our members appeared on TV and radio with the aim to promote the importance of biodiversity conservation.\n\nThe fieldwork results were usually published in the Society's bulletin which enabled the students to learn and have hands-on experience with writing scientific articles with their mentors. This system overcomes the limits of formal education and is a great opportunity for networking among students, professors, assistants, policymakers, NGOs, and the general public.\n\nWe also organized a Student Symposium part of a Congress of ecologists of North Macedonia with international participation where I presented a poster presentation on  Conservation-important butterflies in an under-researched part of North Macedonia-Platchkovitsa and Maleshevo Mountains-Trencheva, Kamchev, Bozhinovska, and Melovski, 2016",
