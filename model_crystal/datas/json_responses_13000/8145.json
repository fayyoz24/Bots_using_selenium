Since then, she has been working with a variety of actors to improve the management of natural resources through a/o facilitating multi-stakeholder processes to generate broadly supported solutions to complex issues such as illegal timber production and trade. She has also worked directly with private companies to improve the sustainability of their production, both for timber and agriculture supply chains. Since 2015 she works for FCDO's Forest Governance Markets and Climate Programme, a 10-year programme focusing on policy and legal reforms that eliminate illegal logging and illegal deforestation, establish transparency, promote legal trade and ensure rights and benefits for local communities.",

The project is being implemented by Tropenbos International in collaboration with the Forestry Commission and the Forestry Research Institute of Ghana in Ghana, and the Forestry Training Centre and Iwokrama in Guyana.",
