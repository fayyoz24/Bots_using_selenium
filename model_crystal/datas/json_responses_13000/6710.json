    "summary": "I am an archaeologist, dress anthropologist and heritage specialist. Over the last thirty years I have worked on several excavations in Egypt (at present at Tell el-Amarna) and the Netherlands on sites ranging from the Neolithic period to the Late Middle Ages, as well as on museum exhibits both in the Netherlands and in Egypt. For my studies at the  Leiden University (NL) I have received a master degree in Egyptian archaeology (1998).\nAt present I study ancient Egyptian hairstyles from Tell el-Amarna, Egypt, as part of my PhD research. My other archaeological research field comprises archaeological beadwork analysis. Over the years my career has shifted from mainly archaeology to a combination with more recent cultural heritage and its social implications. As dress anthropologist, I study contemporary costume and personal adornment (the combination of dress, body augmentation and scent, veils, jewelry and amulets). \nAs a heritage consultant I research the economic and social values of heritage in new (spatial) developments and the management of archaeological sites. I have conducted research on the relationship between heritage, environment and tourism, archaeological risk and site management, and policy making (both in Egypt and in the Netherlands). The protection of archaeological sites from detrimental effects by visitors, waste accumulation and industrial pollution have been main subjects of interest. Because of these subjects, my focus has also shifted towards the \u2018Archaeology of the Now\u2019 or Garbology, and - eventually - marine litter.",
