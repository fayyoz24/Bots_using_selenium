    "summary": "With over ten years of experience in foreign service and government administration, I am a skilled and passionate program officer at the Global Center on Adaptation, a leading international organisation that works to accelerate adaptation action.\n\nAs a program officer, I leverage my strong diplomatic, organizational, and strategic thinking skills to strengthen international cooperation and advocacy in the field of climate adaptation and resilience, as well as to draft policy papers and oversee organistional issues. I also have a proven track record of managing complex projects and campaigns, such as the one I led in Hungary in 2022 to raise awareness about the danger of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in the region, reaching around 100,000 people. \n\nI hold a master's degree in international relations and European integration from Corvinus University of Budapest, and I have completed various trainings and courses in diplomacy, protocol, and public administration. I am fluent in English, German, and Dutch, and  I have a keen interest in global affairs, human rights, and sustainability. \n\nMy mission is to contribute to the global efforts to address the challenges and opportunities of our times. I am always eager to learn new skills, expand my network, and explore new opportunities.",
