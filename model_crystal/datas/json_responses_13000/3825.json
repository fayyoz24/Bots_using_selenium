            "description": "In this presentation, I used \"cherry tree\" as the metaphor of the coworking community: a coworking community isn't about delivering a few successful startups and business idea's, it is about creating a system which makes more of its \"products\"than it needs for its own success to serve a rich and varied needs. In fact, the tree's fecundity nourishes just about everything around it, - the same thing with coworking space. \r\n\r\nBesides, I elaborate the reasons why you cannot simply copy a community management model into another context. In fact, one  should take their approach based on the needs of their community. There is no need to copy other models. \r\n\r\nLastly, I called the coworking space/startup owners to open up to establish connection with others in town. Xindanwei has started to take the lead by sharing its business models and practices in a wiki project - Coworking Manual Apps. \r\n\r\nMy conclusion, Xindanwei is not Garage Cafe(a famous startup cafe in Beijing) Garage Cafe will never become Xindanwei, we should learn from one another and leverage our resources to serve our community better.
