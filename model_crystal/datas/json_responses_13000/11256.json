    "summary": "My work to date as a Football Coach & Performance Analyst has been supported and informed by a university background, professional coaching licenses and a diverse set of professional experiences, spanning 9 years and accrued in the Republic of Seychelles, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and most recently Kuwait.\n\nI employ the most modern training principles and coach these through a holistic approach in a session with the ability to isolate and coach the physical, technical, tactical and social corners of player development to inform my coaching methods. My aim is to maximise individual and collective capability within a vibrant and competitive sporting environment.\n\nI work to the best of my ability, and have demonstrated myself to be a forward-thinking versatile player developer. I incorporate Sport Science and Performance Analysis within the context of player development.\n\nI welcome assigned roles of responsibility, initiative and leadership, and flourish when given them, while remaining first and foremost in common with the players I work with a team member. It is of most importance to treat every person with kindness.\n\nCurrently I am searching for a new full-time professional challenge and am enthusiastic to relocate internationally in pursuit of this objective.",
