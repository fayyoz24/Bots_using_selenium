Before I was Employed as a Senior Project Manager with TAUW consultancy firm in The Netherlands for more than 15 years. I managed numerous (training) projects related to Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (mainly pesticides) in Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, China, Central Asia and Asia. Besides this I was involved in projects such as are preliminary and detailed environmental site assessments, and the design of soil and groundwater clean-up operations on MNI\u2019s sites (petrochemical industry, underground and above oil/fuel/chemical depots) and brown fields. I worked as project manager for a road building contractor in the Netherlands before, for three years and as project manager on soil and groundwater remediation for two Dutch consultancies (Royal Haskoning and Geofox) in The Netherlands from 1987 till 1999. The project sites were petrol stations, fuel depots and oil fields. Before this period I worked as a project manager for a rural drinking water project in Northern Ghana for three years and as a soil mapping team leader in Suriname also for three years. Before I went to Suriname I trained foreign students of a post graduate course in remote sensing techniques for soil survey purposes for almost one year on the International Institute for Aerial Survey & Earth Sciences in Enschede, The Netherlands. I graduated from the Dutch Royal Higher Agricultural College (BSc.), and the International Institute for Aerial Survey & Earth Sciences. I followed the Standard post-graduate course in Soil Erosion Survey.\nI am registered for VCA management (Health and Safety Certificate Contractors), Ambassador of the International HCH and Pesticides Association (IHPA). Recently I am assisting the BAT BEP expert group of the Stockholm Convention on drafting guidelines on the sustainable management of contaminated sites.",
