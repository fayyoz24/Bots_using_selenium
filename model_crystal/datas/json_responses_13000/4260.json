    "summary": "As a passionate project management professional, my career has been focused on working with national and international organizations to deliver projects aimed at enhancing cybersecurity and internet safety in Western Balkan countries. I believe that sustainable change in the business industry and society comes from the collaborative effort of all stakeholders, guided by structured policies and supported by disciplined administrative management and effective coordination. Finding the right human capital and a group of dedicated individuals to execute the overall mission is crucial for success.\n\nThroughout my career, I have provided support to various functional areas of organizations, ensuring the smooth continuity of daily operations and project practices. Currently, I am a Project Coordinator at ITU and NAECCS, where I manage activities, ensure proper project roll-out, and facilitate coordination between NAECCS and ITU for the implementation of the global project \"Creating a Safe and Prosperous Cyberspace for Children\". This role has enhanced my expertise in cyber and child online protection.\n\nDuring the same period, I served as a research consultant at DCAF, providing expert support services on background research and logistical support for DCAF's Western Balkan Country Assessments on CNI and cyber-attacks. Previously, I worked as a Project Coordinator and Communication Consultant at IDCT, where I coordinated a project focused on building the capacity of police officers in cybersecurity. My experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously, coupled with my great multitasking and organizational skills, led to successful project outcomes at the required standard.\n\nIn addition, I have worked as a communication consultant for various national and international organizations, primarily focused on cybersecurity governance and the prevention of violent extremism and radicalization. My work in these challenging environments has enabled me to develop a structured mindset, strong analytical and financial-oriented background, effective communication and coordination skills, and a rigorous work ethic.",
