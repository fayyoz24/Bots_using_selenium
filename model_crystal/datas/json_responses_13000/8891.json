    "summary": "My perspective on the cultural  is unique in focusing on aesthetics and art forms that reveal linkages between cultures,  that raise methodological issues of how to verify patterns of history that defy usual procedures of historical and cultural research. My most important publication is La Escultura sagrada Choc\u00f3 en el contexto de las memorias de Africa y su Diaspora Ritual y Arte, which was awarded the Prize of Fundacion Alejandro Angel Escobar, considered the highest scientific recognition in Colombia. The book on Choc\u00f3 focuses on the region in Colombia along the Pacific Coast where the majority of people of African descent reside in that country.\nI have developed an interdisciplinary approach to social science that combines the history of art with the study of multicultural societies and interethnic relationships. I have considerable experience as a curator, having mounted four exhibitions about Africa and the African Diaspora. I have built a digital collection of sacred sculptures of the Amerindian peoples of Choc\u00f3 that is based on analysis of objects in national and international collections.\nMy experience as a social scientist and as an expert on the different ethnic groups of Colombia is formed by a decade of research in rural black communities on both the Pacific Coast and Atlantic Littoral in Colombia. As a consultant and adviser of Afro-Colombian communities, I have been fully engaged with labor leaders, whom I have helped to empower through film. I have written about the economic, political and cultural rights of ethnicities.\nMy training in communications gives me the tools to make links and permits me to maintain international networks. I organized international meetings and I have been arranging agreements with different strata of society, nationals in Colombia and in the international arena. \n",

My focus, inspired by the work of Lubkemann, will be on war as a process of social and cultural transformation. I feel that, despite its relevance, the ethnic communities\u2019 heritage is unprotected, and therefore the lack of knowledge concerning it places it in a vulnerable position considering the impact of the war. The lack of knowledge is a factor that has contributed to its marginalization, far from public policies and laws that could ensure its protection. Within this framework, the creation of tangible archives of such cultural manifestations could help salvage the heritage. ",

                    "description": "\u2022\tThe Sacred Sculpture Choc\u00f3 in the context of the Aesthetic of Africa and her Diaspora: Ritual an art: is a book about the sacred sculpture of the Choc\u00f3 of the indigenous people, who dwell in the Colombian shore of the Pacific. Through a study of the sacred carvings of these Indians, I point out how in their religion, myths and aesthetics, there is a manifest presence of the arts of African civilizations, the ancestors of Afro-Colombians. By means of detailed comparison, I represent how it is that the art of African civilizations is reflected in the aesthetics, the religion and myths of the Choc\u00f3 indigenous groups. \n In October 2011, I won the Alejandro \u00c1ngel Escobar Prize, the most important award for science in Colombia. I received this award in the field of social studies and humanism.\n\u2022\tAs cultural entrepeneur I am editing a book entitled African Diaspora; a legacy of resistance and emancipation. This book is a compendium of nineteen international experts on the subject of African Diaspora. The book discuses different subjects like forms of emancipation, cultural legacy, cultural persistence; resistance; as well exclusion, racism as a legacy of slavery. \n\u2022\tI am leading the international project: \u201cDutch slavery: Curacao at the Crossroad of South America and the Caribbean: History and Prospective\u201d. This project is aimed to reset the Dutch colonial boundaries by researching their colonial influences from an intercolonial perspective. In it we intend to explore the Dutch slave trade outside of its own colonial boundaries. The project will mainly focus on the slave trade between the ports of Cura\u00e7ao and the Atlantic coast of Colombia.",
