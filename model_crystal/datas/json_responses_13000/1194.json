            "description": "The collapsing events associated to karst is an important geohazard affecting vast zones of the United Kingdom. Areas such as the south of England has a high collapsing occurrence rate increasing the risk for the population. To mitigate this problem, some techniques that can characterize the affected areas were developed in previous research. \nThe application of the GIS and geodata help to detect possible sinkhole areas, but this is not sufficient due to there has not been implemented yet a method to monitor the behaviour of the terrain before and after the collapsing event. \n In United Kingdom the land use categorized as agricultural or forestry is 75%, this fact could hinder the prediction process of possible sinkholes due to the difficulties of doing geology in areas with a high level vegetation development. However, the vegetation is susceptible to hydrological and terrain changes which is well known as \u201cstress vegetation\u201d. In this direction, satellite images can add this component with the NDVI index which can provide information about the vegetation stress related to the soil behavior. In addition, the monitoring of subsidence with satellite imagery can open another way to advise local authorities and the community of collapsing events and therefore, increase the reaction time and mitigate the consequences.",

Obtaining these data from with in-situ measurements in field trips and subsequent interpolation provides a coverage with insufficient quality and a high economic cost. For this reason, the study of snow cover from satellite imaginery together with a Digital Terrain Model provides a digital mapping of the snow coverage with lower costs, data inaccessible areas and a daily check thanks to the use of MODIS images, the snow cover. This dissertation proposes the use of remote sensing techniques for mapping of snow coverage in the Pyrenees as well as the study of its temporal and spatial evolution along the period comprised between November 2009 - May 2010 with a special attention to the orientation, slope and height of the terrain.",
