    "summary": "I am a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam interested in a career that addresses the effects of global change on marine ecosystems. For my PhD, I am interested in increasing our understanding of how multiple environmental stressors affect the resilience of tropical corals on reefs and in the inland bays of Cura\u00e7ao by studying their ecophysiology. \n\nI'm interested in translating research into actionable solutions to the most pressing environmental problems. As a research assistant, I have collected, processed, and analyzed data on the effects of climate change on coral reef physiology. I have gained valuable skills including project management, budget and proposal writing, and extensive field experience. I've also worked outside of academia with the public as a natural resource management intern and have leadership experience in STEM outreach programs designed for elementary/middle school students.
