    "summary": "Being an electrical and electronic engineer with motivation in Sustainable Energy System, I have recently graduated in an Erasmus Mundus Masters program named Environomical Pathways for Sustainable Energy System (SELECT). In my first year at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), courses focused on energy generation, utilization and management gave me a broad insight of modern energy system and its technology. Apart from regular courses, I have successfully completed three international projects works during my graduate study. I have conducted my master thesis in Electrical Energy System at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and finished my graduation in August, 2013. Previous work experiences in project based engineering position at leading companies in Bangladesh helped me to acquire the familiarity of working in an International team under substantial pressure to meet strict deadlines and requirements of the projects. Together with my four school friends I have founded 'YES Foundation' aimed to help poor people in the rural northern part of Bangladesh. Internship experiences in Aalto University and Ghorashal Thermal Power Plant have prepared me further for the toughest of challenges in the respective field. Moreover certification program at ESADE business school on \u2018Business Management and Entrepreneurship\u2019 gave me an insight into business features of an engineering industry. I am highly motivated with heartfelt desire to excel and contribute in the sustainable energy system and prepare me as a successful future leader.",
