    "summary": "Richard Paul Singh is the founder and Managing Director of Ricatech- the only consumer electronics company that retails retro electronics in its most sophisticated way. Richard is an entrepreneur who found an attractive niche in the overcrowded market of consumer electronics.\n\nBorn by an Indian father and Dutch mother, Richard Singh inherited both European and Indian entrepreneurial skills. The entire family in India is entrepreneurial where his father was working at Philips Holland as a engineer and was active in the leather business as well. It did not trigger Richard to step into the same type of business. He started his journey into the consumer electronics market. \n\nIn 2005, Richard pitched his business concept, carrying his self-made suitcase containing MP3 players, to the CEO of Media Markt in Holland. This giant in consumer electronics and part of the Metro Group, largest in Europe and second largest in the world is till date a proud reseller for Ricatech electronics.\n\nWhile Ricatech became the largest manufacturer in Retro electronics in Europe, Richard pushed borders and reached out to America for some very exclusive projects. There he approached the Elvis Presley Enterprises for the production of an exclusive Elvis Presley product line. Hereafter he was approached by Playboy USA to come up with special edition jukebox as a tribute to the brand and magazine founder Hugh Hefner. Richard worked almost 2 years on this project and released The Iconic Playboy Jukebox in 2016 for the first time at The Playboy Mansion, Beverly Hills USA. The most current venture is a product line for Asia\u2019s most celebrated superstar, Amitabh Bachchan under the official license and in association with the living legend himself.",
