    "summary": "I am a self-motivated and dedicated Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights enthusiast in Sierra Leone. \nI started a career in Healthcare as a volunteer in high school for the Nova Scotia Peer Health Education program in Sierra Leone in 2008. I engaged in multiple advocacies and behavioral change interventions at the local level. Also involved in climate change mitigation activities as a Green Scenery Club member in high school. \nI participated in environmental protection and sanitation throughout medical school. I contributed to implementing the Supplementary Immunization Activities projects at the university as a national supervisor and technical advisor. I worked in 60% of the district health management teams in Sierra Leone. I supported the DHMTs at the national and district teams and mentored staff in each domain of the project. \nI have worked in the four clinical disciplines as an intern for two years. \nOver the past four years, I have supported the country's Healthcare delivery teams at the upper, middle, and intervention levels in Sierra Leone. Recently,  I helped a team at Princess Christian Maternity Hospital, the largest maternity center in Sierra Leone, and focused on attending equitably to all walk-in obstetrics and gynecology clients with the best outcomes in mind.\n\nFurthermore, I am experienced in healthcare delivery in the Mining sector. I worked with the Sierra Rutile mining company as a Medical Officer. I led the reproductive, maternal, and child health units in the health and safety context of best-practice in health delivery in the mining sector. \n\nAs the District Medical Superintendent at Magburaka Government Hospital, I led a team of 300 clinical and other technical staff to provide Healthcare to over 500,000 people.  \nAdditionally, I am involved in advocacies linked to SDGs. Recently, I committed to Act Against Hospital hunger by raising funds to provide, at our hospital, food for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children who seek Healthcare in the most deprived areas in Sierra Leone. Ensuring Zero Hunger, Improve Health, and Well-being are all relevant to achieving SDGs (2 &3). Please see what we do at https://facedonate.org/drtejan. \nI am managing the Port Loko Regional hospital and leading a team of over 400 staff, and working with partners to ensure to serve over 1 million people in the North Western  Sierra Leone.\n\nI stand for equity, honesty, dedication, and hard work.\nI am an early career public health professional, transitioning clinician, and looking forward to a more challenging job in Sierra Leone and Africa.",
