    "summary": "Life is an adventure and it has taken me to live in some of the world's most beautiful places: Geneva, Amsterdam and Singapore - not forgetting my beautiful Yorkshire!  Through these moves, I have been fortunate to see talent and people practices in action in more than 30 countries and across startups, scaleups and major tech. These experiences and learnings fuel my passion for talent, engagement, diversity, inclusion and culture every day.\n\nBeing part of Uber's journey in the period of hypergrowth, transformation and the path to IPO was an incredible experience in scaling people and talent.  I now get to see the earliest possible phase of startups, right from company creation, as Head of People at Entrepreneur First (early-stage VC).  Our mission is to create the next wave of globally important companies, with our portfolio already including the UK's 100th tech unicorn, Tractable.  Collectively, EF companies exceed $10b in enterprise value and have created 3,000+ employment opportunities globally to date!\n\nHaving relocated back from Singapore in 2020, Amsterdam is 'home' and I work remotely at EF alongside the London leadership team, my People team of four, and our global office network in Europe, Asia and the US.",
