    "summary": "WHAT I DO: I help senior business leaders struggling with team performance, collaboration, and conflict to create high-performing teams that consistently meet company goals. Teams learn to communicate, collaborate, and manage conflict.\n\nClients reach out to me during several instances, such as a company reorganization or restructuring, a new leader taking a post (you or someone else), conflict cannot be managed internally, or team performance/organization is struggling.\n\nBehavioral science, documented research, proven methods, and group psychology are at the root of my approach. My three-pronged approach includes:\n\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 the current situation to understand the dynamics, challenges, strengths, weaknesses, and developmental needs of the company using interviews, evaluations, questionnaires, and benchmarking.\n\n\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 participants, getting them motivated and engaged through bespoke interventions, creating the need to step up.\n\n\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 teams for lasting improvements by providing a psychologically safe environment for them to try new things, make mistakes and develop; helping individuals and the team gain new perspectives and internalize improvements; helping them when they inevitably get stuck, and sustainably achieving results.\n\nWHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE:\n\u27a4 First-hand experience improving team performance by leading both high-performing and non-performing teams. I recognize the need for fast improvements while maintaining the efficiency of everyday operations.\n\n\u27a4 I use behavioral science to transform a team into a long-lasting, effective group. Science proves that skill is no guarantee for success. I have watched teams with intelligent, highly skilled people fail and teams with less skilled people soar to success.\n\n\u27a4 The design of my interventions is unique, combining high-energy experiential workshops and coaching, challenging the participants, and supporting teams as they return to their everyday work lives. Follow-up coaching ensures that the team maintains momentum and is critical to sustaining results over time.\n\n\nPAST CLIENTS INCLUDE: \n\u2022 AkzoNobel\n\u2022 Exxon\n\u2022 General Electric\n\u2022 Accenture\n\u2022 CapGemini\n\u2022 DAF Trucks (Paccar)\n\u2022 Oce (Canon)\n\u2022 Xerox\n\u2022 Syngenta\n\u2022 BASF\n\u2022 Nashuatec\n\u2022 ASML\n\u2022 The Center for Creative Leadership\n\u2022 Aptean\n\u2022 Jet Aviation\n\u2022 Vion Food Group\n\u2022 Marquard & Bahls\n\nCONTACT: Email hello@topteam.academy or call +31 6 348 78 179",
