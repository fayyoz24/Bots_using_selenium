    "summary": "I am a hydrologist specialized in groundwater with 40 years experience in research, consultancy and teaching in the Netherlands and 24 other countries all over the world. I graduated in 1980 at the Faculty of Earth Sciences of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Until 1994 I worked as consultant for IWACO in various projects related to groundwater exploration and mapping, drinking water supply, irrigation, drainage, groundwater remediation and water management studies. During this period I lived for long periods in Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Pakistan and Suriname. \n\nIn 1994 I joined the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and obtained my PhD in 2002 (coastal and offshore groundwater in Suriname). With Albert Tuinhof I established Acacia Water in 2003. Initially it was a university foundation for applied research in hydrology, but was privatized in 2008. I remained employed by the University until 2015 and by Acacia Water until 2020. In 2018 and 2019 I lived and worked in Ethiopia for UNICEF as project manager of a groundwater mapping project. \n\nNowadays, I am a private consultant (Groen Water Solutions) and guest lecturer at the IHE Institute for Water Education and the University of Suriname (lecturing and supervision of MSc and PhD students). I am also member of the Dutch commission for environmental impact assessment. \n\nMy expertise and interests covers the fields of groundwater exploration and mapping, hydrological systems analysis, , geophysics, hydrogeochemistry, isotope hydrology, water harvesting, managed aquifer recharge, well drilling, modelling, identification and evaluation of projects and, decision support techniques. \n\n",
