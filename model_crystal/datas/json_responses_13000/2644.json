    "summary": "I am an internationally oriented storyteller with ambitions to develop myself further as a researcher, a journalist, and an author. Through a combination of creativity and analysis, I continuously try to improve my understanding of the world and bring others along on that journey. At the moment, I am putting my passions for research and writing to use as a doctoral student at the University of Helsinki. My dissertation project concerns the role of music in United States boarding schools for Native American children in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDuring my time as a student of American Studies and History at Radboud University in Nijmegen, I became acquainted with the different ways of conveying a story, from academic publications and journalistic articles to literature and photography. I switch effortlessly between Dutch and English, and time spent living in the United States has made me culturally versatile as well. In addition, my role as a member of various (editorial) boards and committees has taught me to work in a team, exercise leadership, and above all to be open to new challenges.",
