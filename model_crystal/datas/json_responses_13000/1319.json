    "summary": "I am a successful researcher with a diverse, creative background. As an academic archaeologist, I have over fourteen years of research experience. Since 2005, I have worked at research institutes and archaeological projects across the Middle East (Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Jordan), undertaking primary research, writing research reports (for government agencies, journals and the general public) contributing to multi-authored monographs and publishing original research articles for academic journals. I have presented my research at international conferences, university seminars, international research institutions and archaeological projects across the UK, Turkey and the Middle East. I am able to communicate my research to people from all backgrounds and of all ages, with a wealth of experience in public engagement activities. I have participated in various events aimed at widening participation to higher education, and directed educational activities at archaeological excavation open days. Currently working as the inaugural Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Leiden University's Netherlands Institute for the Near East (NINO); https://www.nino-leiden.nl/staffmember/dr-le-bennison-chapman.
