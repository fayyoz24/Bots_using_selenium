    "summary": "As you can see in my experience below, I had many different jobs. But the majority of them involve(d) working with and for others, both in English as well as in Spanish. Even working as a translator I like to make sure that the client is satisfied. \n\nBesides, outside of my work I've always been very social: throughout the years I met and connected (frequently more than I expected) with so many people from so many different places, each with their unique background, personality and views of the world. And so, I became someone who is a good listener, who understands, feels, respects and care about the others. Because, even though we can have a lot of differences, we all have the same human fundamental needs, particularly the one of being heard, valued and understood.\n\nAs a result, I've managed to not only keep and preserve (even from early childhood) many relationships in my life in a good state, but also in a way that the trust, the enjoyment and the benefits of the connection keep growing. \n\nOn top of that, as years passed I've been learning to get satisfaction from being responsible and excel in whatever I decide to do, and that includes a job when I accept it. Also, whenever I do something wrong, I make up for it. No excuses. Although, of course, if I don't agree with something, I'll open a respectful discussion about it, unless there's something more urgent to do.\n\nSo if you're looking for someone that can and will do his absolute best to listen to, understand, respect, value and assist both your customers as much as you (and/or your boss or team), and who you can trust, well... Look no further.\n\nAlso, I've developed (and it keeps getting better) a good balance between being results-oriented while also enjoying the process towards success, and I consider this a key thing for myself as well as for whole teams, because what's the point of getting results if we are not enjoying often (which is also something super important to our long term health and wellbeing)?\n\nAny questions? Don't hesitate to contact me and ask me what you'd like to know.",

All this keeping great efficiency and really good vibes with the whole team. On top of that I've been taking care, together with my boss and my colleagues of the core team, of the building and unbuilding of the team camping site (tents, inflatable mattresses, gazebo, cooking elements, foods and drinks).\n\nSo far I've worked in the following festivals (all of them within the Netherlands and in 2022):\n\n\u00b7 Concert at Sea\n\u00b7 Wonderfeel\n\u00b7 Down The Rabbit Hole\n\u00b7 Landjuweel\n\u00b7 Lowlands\n\u00b7 Mysteryland\n\u00b7 Into The Great Wide Open",
