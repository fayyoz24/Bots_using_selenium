As a result of the report, I have learnt how to present my findings clearly and efficiently; time management; innovative ways for data visualization; report writing; apply scientific rationale; project management and to work independently with my own ideas with minimal supervision. \n\n",

The Company has extensive tenement holdings in Australia: a portfolio of projects with the potential for significant deposits of copper-nickel PGM\u2019s, gold-silver-base metals and uranium.\n\nMy role within the company was to work on the Commonwealth Project, a site located in NSW, Australia. This involved geological mapping of Cu and Pb soil anomalies and the use of scientific rationale to determine the probable cause. In addition I was actively involved with the on-going drill program in the south of the site. As a member of the geological team I had to record XRF measurements of RC drill bags and log diamond core samples.",
