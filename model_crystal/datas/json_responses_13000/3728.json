    "summary": "As a global citizen I am infused with multiple cultures, languages and skills that in retrospect, one could only gain by living and working across different countries. On my path, I have challenged myself to refine a deep understanding of several industries, growing a uniquely rich skill set and approach along the way. I am used to a very diverse and cross-cultural environment having managed a number of international projects and multi-disciplinary teams. Having also been deeply involved in implementing these projects, I have developed a passion for innovation and collaboration at a large and often very complex scale. I am eager to evaluate and interpret the holistic picture, zooming out to broader perspectives and zooming back in to bring details into sharp focus for the projects I manage.\n\nWith my background in law, I also possess both strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. I find practical solutions for daily challenges. Being a passioned learner, I have studied Project Management at the University of Massachusetts Boston and have obtained the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, in addition to my Master\u2019s Degree in Law.  Most recently, I have obtained a professional diploma in Strategy, Development and Innovation from the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. \n\nI\u2019m always excited to work for vibrant communities with a strong vision where I thrive on daily change. I aspire to remove the barriers that often restrict efficiency and communication across multi-disciplinary teams while connecting dots to discover new opportunities to collaborate and innovate. I truly believe that in order to make meaningful and impactful things, different people with a multitude of skills must find a way to work together.",

This includes:\n\u2022\tIntroducing Passive Control Systems such as low boundary walls, trees and hedge-rows, green walls and roofs, photocatalytic coatings and green urban spaces to affect the dispersion of pollutants.\u00a0\n\u2022\tEmbracing smart city technology by deploying a network of low-cost interconnected air quality sensors to gather real-time data.\n\u2022\t Creating Living Labs in each of the pilot cities (Dublin, Bottrop, Bologna, Vantaa, Hasselt, and Guilford) to bring together scientists, businesses, city stakeholders and citizens in an open collaborative spirit for the deployment and testing of these interventions.\u00a0\n\u2022\tTraining citizens with air quality monitoring kits to increase their awareness about air pollution and foster behavioral change through education.\n\u2022\tSharing the results of these innovations with policy-makers and planners to make cities less harmful to the local climate and help create cleaner air for everyone.\n",
