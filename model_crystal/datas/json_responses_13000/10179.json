I am showing that studying, working and multitasking does not preclude leading a healthy and environmentally-friendly lifestyle.\n\nFood is a fundamental part of living sustainably and it is extremely important for us to understand the origins of our food and connect the dots between climate change and the food system to see just how unsustainable animal agriculture is in its current form. By eating sustainably, individuals can contribute to reducing their environmental impact.\n\nNot only are sustainable foods helpful to the environment, but they\u2019re healthy for our bodies and are beneficial to the economies where they\u2019re sourced.",
