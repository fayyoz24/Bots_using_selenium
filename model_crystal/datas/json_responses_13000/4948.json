    "summary": "\u201cEngineers make things, Industrial Engineers make things better!\u201d\n\nLet me break down the series of events that led to the person you are currently reading about today. From a very early age, problem solving has been a hobby and motivation that has constantly been an integral part of many decisions I\u2019ve made in life. Starting from school, my love for math and science directed my interests to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. I spent 4 years studying those areas of engineering that required problem solving though design and modeling, analytics, experiments and workshops. \n\nI secured my first job opportunity at Harris Pye as an instrumentation technician. The company specialized in engineering services - repairs and conversions in the marine, offshore oil and gas and associated onshore industries. Although the job profile was different and challenging from what I was specialized in, I saw it as an opportunity to diversify my knowledge in electrical engineering and operating systems. \n\nAfter a year of working at the docks in the Kingdom of Bahrain, I shifted my field of engineering once again. I secured an offer from STACK Group International, an intralogistics firm in Kuwait that hired me as the sales engineer for material handling equipment. It was from this point that my calling for Supply Chain and Logistics grew extensively. The guidance, and the experience gained there helped me build a bridge between engineering and management. In time, I started to realize that this job extruded the perfect use of my skill set and personality combined. \n\nHowever, as every sector or industry advances with technology, science and innovation, a more advanced skill set and knowledge base is required to foresee and overcome the challenges posed at the time. To achieve this, I enrolled myself at the University of Groningen and got accepted to study Industrial Engineering and Management (Specializing in Product Technology and Logistics). \n\nOn successfully completing my Master\u2019s Degree, I have secured a position at PVH Corp., as the Material Strategy Analyst of the Supply Value Chain Business Unit. \n\nWant to get in touch?
