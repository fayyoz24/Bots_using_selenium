I combine hands-on experience in capacity building projects in Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans with leadership skills that inspire project teams and beneficiaries to take ownership for development and change. I believe that a comprehensive holistic approach involving all actors in a chain is essential for sustainable development. I have a keen eye for the strengths, limitations, ideas and experiences that individual team members bring in and a gift for identifying how people who are different can work together productively. I keep an eye on the bigger picture, spot opportunities and threats swiftly and know how to mobilise my network and my team members to plan actions and find solutions.",

I worked as project director of various international projects on criminal justice, court administration, judicial governance and legal ethics in Ukraine, Serbia and Montenegro. These projects were geared towards transferring knowledge and skills and upgrading working procedures, allowing the legal professionals abroad to work more effectively and efficiently. All projects aimed to strengthen the rule of law and to contribute to a more safe, sustainable and just society. In close collaboration with my team members I determined the approach and I maintained the relations with project partners, donors and beneficiaries in the target countries. Together with the project experts I also co-designed and facilitated a variety of activities. I monitored the project progress, project spending, reporting, and the evaluation and learning cycle. In addition, I contributed to the organisational development at CILC and I coached several colleagues.",
