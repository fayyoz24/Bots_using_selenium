    "summary": "Supporting circular initiatives with advisory and marketing. I see circular businesses as complementary forces that can work together to achieve sustainability goals, rather than competing against each other.\n\nI'm transforming Palanta (from B2C fashion rentals) into a B2B service to support other stakeholders such as rental companies and brands to provide a software solution for them to start their circular journey. \n\nIn addition, I'm excited to focus on the future of the circular economy and work towards further collaborations and initiatives in this space.\n\nMy goal is to make a lasting impact on the circular economy by creating a space for trailblazers, trendsetters, and change-makers from consumers to brands and circular initiatives. We are excited to grow even bigger and invite you to join our circular movement in the name of THINK\u2014, LIVE\u2014, BUY\u2014, and ultimately, BE\u2014responsibly.\n\nVisit my circular project: http://palanta.co/ \n\nLet's grab a coffee, I'm always up for a chat!",
