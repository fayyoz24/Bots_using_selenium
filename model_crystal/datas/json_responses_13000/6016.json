    "summary": "For more than 25 years I have been helping organizations large and small achieve their goals of streamlining processes and realizing profits. \n\nIn 2011, I immigrated from the Netherlands to West Kelowna in British Columbia, Canada. With two decades of experience in management roles in the food, entertainment, technology and travel sector, I began looking for opportunities to harness my background and abilities for businesses in the Okanagan Valley and across Canada. \n\nThree years later, I started my own company called On The Shelf Opportunities (www.otso.ca). I discovered a market for helping small and medium-sized organizations get their projects off the shelf and into action. With my passion for planning and improving processes I was able to find solutions and get projects moving. \n\nOne of the projects in 2016 was to do some guided tours as independent tour guide in British Columbia and Alberta. This worked out great (and it still does). Combined with my passion for photography this created a spin-off, my website www.olafincanada.ca. Its focus is on landscapes, wildlife and abandoned places.",
