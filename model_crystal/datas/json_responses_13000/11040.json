    "summary": "As a risk management and Innovation Management postgraduate, I aim to work in an innovative company where I can exercise both of the skillsets I got from these academic programs. \nGiven my versatile professional profile, I believe I can fit into any sector as I demonstrated great adaptability and fast learning skills through my 3 years of internships from research laboratories to an airline company to the ministry of higher education and scientific research. \n\nMy experience at the Tunisian National Air Operator \u00abTunisair\u00bb gave me the opportunity to apply my risk management knowledge in a highly confidential and challenging field such as the Aviation Security. Since security remains one of the principle risk areas, I focused on achieving a thorough risk analysis from the identification of risks to the establishment of a mitigation plan. During the process I worked with the key department members and involved the expertise of the management to be able to have a clear understanding of the processes and to have accurate outcomes to the risk management process I established.\nFollowing this experience, I completed a master\u2019s program in Innovation Management. In a fast paced market, I find it essential to combine my risk management skills with the understanding of the innovation process from idea generation to launching the innovation on the market, in order to be able to study the risks that a potential innovation opportunity might represent to the company. To complete the program, I achieved a research project at the Fraunhofer Center for International Management and Knowledge Economics in Leipzig to identify the potential risk that ICT and Automobile companies represent on Healthcare and Pharmaceutical companies with their smart healthcare innovations.\n\nMy core skills include: Risk assessment, Risk monitoring and evaluation, Risk mitigation plan, Quality Management, Time management and organizational skills, Communication, Public speaking and Presentational skills, Event organization management and evaluation, Microsoft office proficiency and Microsoft Project, Project Management knowledge, Innovation Strategy, Marketing and User-lead Innovations.\n\n",
