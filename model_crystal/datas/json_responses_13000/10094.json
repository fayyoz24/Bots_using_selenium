    "summary": "I am molecular biologist specialized in medical and food biochemistry with seven years of research and academic experience gained during work at polish scientific institutions (University of Warmia and Mazury and Polish Academy of Science) and collaboration with European institutions due to participation in EU-funded project (EuroPrevall). \n\nI have a strong background in the field of proteomics, food and medical biochemistry, immunology and cell biology. The main areas of my interests are:\n\u2022\tCell biology \u2013 the mechanisms of inflammation and allergy in human\n\u2022\tMaillard reaction in food systems \n\u2022\tProtein chemistry and biochemistry \n\nDuring my PhD studies I studied the influence of food processing and Maillard reaction in food systems on physiochemical and biological properties of food proteins. I extended my research profile on immunogenicity and allergenicity of food proteins during collaboration with Cell Biology and Immunology Group at WU and realisation of individual research project funded by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. After my PhD I continued my research career as post-doc at University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. Since October 2012 I'm employed on the position of post-doc researcher at Wageningen University where I realise the research project on influence of food processing on immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties of food compounds.\n\nSpecialties: \u2022 Proteomics: protein extraction end purification, UV-Vis, fluorescence, DLS, chromatography - SPE, SEC, HPLC, FPLC; in vitro gastric hydrolysis, SDS-PAGE  1D&2D; \n\u2022 Immunology: ELISA, western-blot, antibodies production, vaccine preparation, immunization, purification of antibodies\n\u2022 Cell culture: Caco-2, PBMCs, THP-1, HepG2  knowledge of flow cytometry\n\u2022 Genetics: DNA/RNA isolation, PCR, gene expression analysis by QR-PCR",

During the PhD studies I successfully obtained the funds on the individual research project from Polish Ministry of Higher Education. It allowed me to expand my research area into molecular in vitro studies. Moreover I enhanced my knowdlege and experience due to participation in the several research projects from the area of nutrition funded by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. My PhD thesis defended in October 2010 has been awarded for outstanding achievements.",
