    "summary": "I am a driven International Business student in my final year at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, possessing a blend of academic and professional experiences in cross-border collaborations, financial management, and customer service. I have honed my skills in subsidy project management, playing a key role as a project assistant in the Startup Ems-Dollard-Region, a cross-border cooperation project that bridges the gap between startups and academic institutions in the Dutch and German regions.\n\nWith a minor in Accounting & Finance from OST Fachhochschule, St. Gallen, Switzerland, and proficiency in German, I've developed a comprehensive understanding of the European business landscape. Currently, as a Junior Project Manager at Ruber Acia, a leading Subsidy advice Institution, I handle a diverse set of responsibilities from supporting consultants with grant applications and managing customer interactions, to seeking new subsidies.\n\nI'm eager to contribute my insights on a larger scale as I prepare for my upcoming thesis project: analysing Ruber Acia's potential role as a European-level subsidy intermediary. Feel free to connect as I am always open to new opportunities and discussions!",
