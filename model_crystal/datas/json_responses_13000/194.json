    "summary": "I am a creative, detail-oriented, and independent person. Living, studying, and working in eight different countries worldwide have honed my skills as a high-level researcher, an educator, English language editor, and an (university) administrator. Through teaching and conducting research in the field of archaeology (specializing in archaeobotany, ancient agriculture and food studies) and in teaching English as a second language (certified TEFL/TESOL), I have become a good critical thinker, problem solver, and project planner. I have planned and coordinated large projects and detailed lesson plans, consisting of large international teams and students respectively from up to 10 countries in a single classroom. Furthermore, I am a strong team player in any work environment.  \n\nI am a dual citizen (American and Dutch), and I have developed my Dutch language skills and have a good working proficiency.  I have worked on several editing projects from masters and PhD dissertations, monographs, book chapters, grant proposals, articles, book reviews, annuals reports, recommendation letters, and all content management and editing of websites for former employers including the Groningen Institute of Archaeology (which uses a CMS) and Meade Laboratory at Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, USA). Since 2012, I have been the English Editor for the archaeological journal Tijdschrift voor Mediterrane Archeologie. I have also taught English at the University of Groningen Language Centre. I am a founding member of the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies (BrIAS); I have helped build its administrative structure and social media presence (with 900+ followers on LinkedIn) and coordinated several international hybrid-format workshops, lectures, fora, and other events for the program\u2019s pilot phase under the theme \u201cThe past, present, and future of food, climate, and sustainability.\u201d\n\nMy current research interests are agricultural economies, archaeobotany (the study of human-plant relationships in the past), crop selection, ethnographic studies of traditional food practices, and food security of both the present day and in the past. My main region of specialisation is the Levant and North Africa, with a particular focus on Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Sudan. I am the senior archaeobotanist on the Tall Hisban, Bayda, Shuqayra al-Gharbiyya, Ghor as-Safi complex (Khirbet as-Sheikh Isa, Tawahin as-Sukkar, Umm Tawabin), Khirbet Safra and al-Jumaiyil excavations in Jordan and Khirbet Beit Mazmil excavations in Israel. I am also an archaeobotanist on the EoS-funded AGROS project.",
