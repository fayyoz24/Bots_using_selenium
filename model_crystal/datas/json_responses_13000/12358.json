    "summary": "I completed my teacher training in Ireland, and I am currently employed as a Science and Biology Teacher in the International School of Utrecht,  Netherlands. In my current school I am responsible for monitoring their attendance, academic achievement and behaviour and to support them throughout their final years at secondary school (Grade 9-12).  Having taught IB, iGCSE and Irish State Curriculum, I have developed an interest in the area of curriculum reform.\n\nI have successfully employed an active learning approach, particularly the use of technology when teaching and found that this led to many positive student outcomes, such as improved engagement and classroom participation.  In Ireland I was Co-teaching with another Science teacher in some of my classes. I presented a poster about my experience of team teaching in China at a Team-Teaching Conference last year in Maynooth University, Ireland. \n\nI have previous experience teaching Biology at IGCSE level when I was chosen for teaching placement abroad in China. While I was teaching in China, I was responsible for organising an Irish Cultural week at the school. I also promoted the practice of team teaching in this Chinese school, an approach that hadn\u2019t been present in the school previously. I found teaching different nationalities to be a very rewarding experience. From this experience, I was inspired to pursue a TEFL course to aid my teaching of Science and Biology to students who have English as a second language.",
