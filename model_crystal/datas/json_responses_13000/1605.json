    "summary": "During my student years, passion for research and curiosity were my driving force in choosing my career path. On my adventures trip in science I have learned that close collaborations and the creation of synergy between technology and biomedical science are much more important. They will lead to expansion of collective knowledge leading to sustainable improvement of healthcare.\n\nAs a researcher with extensive track record in cardiac and cell biology, I\u2019m always seeking to leverage, apply and expand my experience in the multi-disciplinary medical field. I seek to dedicate my broad experience in biomedical sciences together with my critical view into the revision, assessment and supervision of research in a new challenge.\n\nI am passionate about supervising and coaching young researchers in their scientific careers. With my enthusiasm for science I like to inspire people and thereby continuously expanding collective knowledge aiming for sustainable improvement of healthcare. I aspire a versatile position with responsibility for the supervision and coordination in the field of biomedical or clinical research.\n\nSpecialties: team building \u2013 mediator \u2013 critical thinker \u2013 adviser - emphatic \u2013 supervising - coaching",

The first line of investigation concentrated on the role of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) in the development of the second heart field-derived cardiac structures, especially at the venous pole of the heart. For this purpose, expression  pattern of PDGF-A, -C and their receptor PDGFR-\u03b1 in the avian heart was described. Additionally, we studied mouse embryos in which the pdgfr\u03b1 gene was mutated. \n\nThe second part was based on in vitro investigations with the focus on epicardial cells and epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs), which also originate from the second heart field at the venous pole of the heart. The role of EPDCs in the differentiation of the myocardium was studied. Secondly, the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in human adult epicardial cells and effect of this process on electrical conductivity was outlined. \n\nSupervisors: Prof.  dr.
