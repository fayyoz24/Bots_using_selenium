    "summary": "A well-qualified and highly motivated geologist with over 25 years experience in the oil & gas industry. Highly competent in production and operations geology with significant expertise in conducting geological studies. My colleagues recognise me as an excellent team player, eager to share knowledge and learn from others.\n\nMain experience gained worldwide includes but is not limited to expertise in making conceptual and building 3D static reservoir models (Petrel tool/hands-on). As consequent duties were volume estimates, mapping, technical assurances (accredited TA3 & TA2 in Integrated Reservoir Modelling (IRM)), and frequent involvements in the field development planning (FDP), reservoir characterisation studies, stratigraphic and structural analyses, etc.\n\nAdditionally, I worked as a consulting Operations and Wellsite geologist (aSME) for over 12 years. As a result, I acquired broad experience in all stages of developing a well, including identifying potential drilling locations and assisting the drilling and WRFM teams with well planning, contract preparation & management, and execution of various geological operations. A significant part of my operations skills come from offshore drilling rigs, where I, as a wellsite geologist, supervised contractor staff, supported drilling operations, analysed rocks & reservoir fluids, etc.\n\nExtensive experience from joint venture (JV) companies: 2\u00bd years at Shell/CMOC in Kazakhstan; 5 years with Shell-SPDC in Nigeria; 4 years as Shell staff, seconded in Kuwait Oil Company (KOC); 3 years with ExxonMobile/RasGas (JV) in Qatar, etc. \n\nI have experience in clastic and carbonate reservoirs (both conventional & unconventional) with high H2S and CO2 gases (for 11 years with carbonates in Qatar and Kuwait).",
