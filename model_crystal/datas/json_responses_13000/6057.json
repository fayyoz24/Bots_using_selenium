    "summary": "I love working at the intersection between science and engineering, and plan to continue specializing in the development of instrumentation for astronomy and planetary sciences.\n\nI completed my MSc in Instrumentation for Astronomy at Leiden University and I am now part of the Optics section at the European Space Agency. For my master thesis, I worked at SRON on an instrument feasibility study for the high-altitude balloon mission CoPILOT led by CNES. Earlier in my masters, I was also involved in the development of the Life Signature Detection polarimeter.\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies in physics, I worked in four different countries in the fields of astronomy and quantum optics, I participated in the Caltech Space Callenge 2019, and I was also a team lead at the engineering society Space Concordia. \n\nLooking forward to continuing my journey down the space instrumentation rabbit hole!",
