    "summary": "PROFILE\n- Over 30 years of leadership and teaching experience at international schools in Tanzania, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Azerbaijan, and most recently China.  Held various positions including Athletic Director, Department Head, Team Leader, and Afterschool Activities Coordinator\n- Master\u2019s degrees in Curriculum and Teaching, and in K-12 Educational Administration, Michigan State University. Bachelor's degree in Physical Education in The Netherlands\n- Experienced in working closely with Leadership Team and Board of Trustees as Staff Representative, member Finance Facilities Committee; member Accreditation for Growth Steering Committee; chairperson Community-Home Partnership Group CIS/IBO Synchronised Reaccreditation Visit\n- Professional development courses in Europe and the US: Principals' Training Centre for International School Leadership, Association of International School Heads, Loughborough University, Winchester Summer School of Physical Education, Perform Better Functional Training Summit\n- Presented workshops at various international education conferences in Africa, Asia, and Europe\n\nAs a teacher, I always engage my students in activities that enhance their personal competence and self-confidence. My goal is to transfer my passion for lifelong fitness and instil in my students the value of effective teamwork and the benefits of an active lifestyle.  I am highly motivated and set high standards for myself and my students. I am proactive, innovative and well-organized.  These skills and qualities have greatly assisted me in initiating and organizing international sporting tournaments, charity runs, swim galas, and sports days, as well as in conducting online classes during the height of the pandemic. \nI have natural leadership skills, yet able to delegate and work well as a team member. I am known to be direct, yet sensitive and good-humoured. I am open-minded, sociable, and enjoy meeting and working with people from diverse cultures.  \n\nI am a non-smoker and have taken part in half-marathons and triathlons, including finishing three 70.3 IRONMAN events.  With Dutch as my mother tongue Dutch, I am fluent in English, functional in German, and enjoy speaking French and Swahili. \n\nOver the past thirty-plus years, I have endured typhoons, floods, spells of malaria, days without water and electricity, and political unrest. I enjoyed \"13 months of sunshine\", swam alongside a whale shark and camped surrounded by lions in the great savannah.  I look forward to adding more unique experiences to this list as I embark on new and exciting challenges!",
