    "summary": "I am a self supporting professional who`s good at planning and organising her tasks. I have a flexible personality and when things don`t go according to plan I see it as a challenge to make it work again. Thanks to my perseverance I can push myself to find the right solution for a problem and not take no for an answer. In my communication towards colleagues and customers I am very respectful and empathic. I am always busy developing myself further and I am eager to learn new things. At last I am not afraid of feedback. It`s a good opportunity to learn. \n\nBesides work, I love to spend time with my friends and family. I also love good food, dancing salsa, listen to music and spend my vacation in the Swedish nature.",
