Nature versus (or with/in/over/under) built-up areas, mobility and transit,- you name it.\n\nA magnetic attraction to the North. The wild and cold Arctic works mesmerising to me. Fresh snow under my boots, binos around my neck, some fulmar or stray gannet, and hopefully good company to explore with!",

This team forms the connection between the passenger and the location: We spot wildlife; we explain the guests about history, animals or climate change; we protect the passengers from wildlife coming too close (and vice versa); and we do all kinds of small jobs onboard. We also make sure that our footprint on the fragile tundra stays limited to footprints only.\n\nIy was a super wonderful experience and we had so much fun! I liked to be part of such a closely-knit team. I enjoyed interacting with the guests, which have so many different and interesting backgrounds. And I loved the stunning, sparkling places I was able to visit and share with others! I very much look forward to new opportunities in these cold expanses of our planet.",
