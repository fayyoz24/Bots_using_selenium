In the context of the European open science agenda there is a need to capitalise on past e-infrastructure investments and develop an e-infrastructure commons. To be able to achieve this there are a number of obstacles that need to address the issue of: service accessibility, interoperability and fragmentation, comprehensibility and clarity + inconsistent use of key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing added value.\nThe actions taken by the eInfraCentral project to address these obstacles are:\n- To structure an open and guided discussion between e-infrastructures to consensually define a common catalogue for their services.\n- Develop a single entry point (one-stop shop) - the eInfraCentral portal - for end users to browse the service catalogue, and enhance the monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) that focus on availability and quality of services and user satisfaction.\n- Draw policy and sustainability lessons for the future development of a European e-infrastructure \u2018market place\u2019 as an extension of the common service catalogue and portal so that it includes a much broader range of e-infrastructures and services.\nThese actions will help to fulfil the mission which is to: ensure that, by 2020, a broader and more varied set of users (including industry/SMEs) discover and accesses the existing and developing e-infrastructure capacity.",

The platform will leverage existing methodologies, initiatives and tools developed by the European Commission for the development of smart specialisation (RIS3) strategies, but it will also investigate, develop and test new and innovative technologies, tools and services aiming to strengthen the European capacity for knowledge-based policy advice. The platform and the accompanied services will constitute an online mechanism for policy advice, integrated with a well-defined, commonly accepted and broadly used methodology for regional policy (RIS3 Guide).\n\nData and sources of information to feed the platform and the services will be collected from institutional websites, RSS feeds, online databases, newsgroups and web forums, social networks data, web analytics, content management systems, measurement scoreboards, focus groups, and other online mechanisms for collaboration and policy co-design, and assessment. Taken together, these elements and architecture of integration will offer online all the necessary tools, methods, and roadmap to assist the elaboration, implementation, and impact analysis of smart specialisation policies.",

After the evaluation of the five projects, the project focuses on gathering evidence and opinions of Nordic stakeholders on possible future co-operation priorities with a view to informing a strategic workshop at Nordic level in September 2016.",
