The principal area of focus was M&A and project development and the total value of deals was more than \u20ac300 billion, most of which were in the energy space and specifically oil, gas and power (thermal, hydro and nuclear) and mining. Clients included various Governments (including those of the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Madagascar), the CEOs of State-owned companies and the Boards of many listed companies. The deals have ranged from M&A auction sales through to privatizations, restructuring of industries to complex pre-litigation, commodity financings to novel products including an NFT offering in South America as well as a variety of project developments such as: the first IPP in Russia, the rehabilitation of a Nigerian refinery complex, the construction of a road in Poland, a multi-modal transportation project in Colombia and the proposed siting of a power project in north Africa.",
