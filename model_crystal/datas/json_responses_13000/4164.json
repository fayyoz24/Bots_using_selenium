    "summary": "I am a busy-body who is not afraid to seek out new experiences or new challenges. I have studied and worked abroad in South Korea and Scotland. This international experience has helped me to develop my language proficiency and intercultural communication skills. My international experiences also adds to my open-minded approach to people and situations. I seek common ground and try to cross constructed boundaries to build meaningful relationships. Art and creative endeavors are important aspects of my search for common ground that can manifest itself through research topics and interests or the things I create.\n\nIn my spare time, I explore my own creativity by drawing and painting, read books whilst drinking a well-roasted freshly ground espresso surrounded by my plant family, practice yoga or solve (indoor) bouldering problems. I like to visit museums, art galleries and film festivals. When I spend time with friends, we cook, eat and enjoy food together.",

I expanded my knowledge on the history of East Asia, medicine and drugs, and critical theory both broadly and deeply. I engaged with different forms of primary and secondary source material and used my analytical- and language skills to analyse these sources.\n\nI learned how to manage a larger project by breaking it down to smaller goals, practice time-management, meet deadlines, and use software to keep track of writing, sources and references. In a stressful environment, I learned how to take care of my mental wellbeing by practicing mindfulness, and by learning where to cross or draw boundaries.\n\nBesides doing research, I engaged with the academic community by participating in international and local conferences and workshops of the History of Medicine and Korean Studies. I also organized a departmental Korean Studies seminar series at Leiden University, took seat in the LIAS-LUCSoR PhD council, and worked as a teaching assistant that gave me the opportunity to teach courses at the BA level.",

I assisted at several points of the digitizing process.\nFirst, I helped with determining the state of the posters before they were scanned. I checked whether the posters were damaged and if there were writings, stamps or marks on the posters that were added after printing.\nAfter the posters had been scanned and ready for adding to the database, I assisted with adding metadata in the database. I focused mainly on summarizing the image and adding metadata related to secondary text that appears on the posters (eg. book titles, newspaper headings, labels of food, details on pins and medals, and secondary slogans). I used my Korean language skills to translate the secondary text and developed my way of describing images by drawing from my knowledge of visual analysis. I took charge in managing the other assistants working on describing and adding metadata of secondary text. I divided the posters between the assistants and drew up a template to standardize the way we described the image of the posters and how to add metadata of secondary text."
