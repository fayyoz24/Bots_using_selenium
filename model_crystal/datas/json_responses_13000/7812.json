                    "description": "I started to study at Gaborone (Botswana) Northside School then at American School Barcelona (Spain). I was passionate about international economic development, which is the reason why I joined Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Netherland). I still have two years to get my diploma. I have an Idea of what I would like to do in the future. This is why during my courses I am especially focusing on supply chain and logistics management challenges and opportunities. I learned and gained experience during the three internships I did, two of them in Vanuatu (Port vila) and one in Spain (Barcelona). In my first Internship in Vanuatu, I was involved in the preparation of a conference dedicated to presenting the outcome of a feasibility study on the establishment of an Economic Development Zone in the country. This conference was organized by the Department of the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Commerce. I supported the logistics of this event by registering participants (farmers, development banks, public and private institutions and investors). The second internship at Vanuatu was with an NGO called \u2018\u2019Live and Learn\u2019\u2019 mandated to protect and keep Vanuatu's environment sustainable. I assisted in the design of a promotional brochure which informed the tourists on the levy tax and protection of coral guidances. Finally, my last internship was in Spain (Barcelona) was in Meeder Group Iberica (Headquarter in Netherland). Meeder Group Iberica is a logistical shipping company which distributes fresh foods. The Manager introduced the supply chain related to shipping companies (food, beverages and delivery). Then I got a tour of the whole facilities provided by his company (offices, storage, food market and transport.  We had a lot of meetings to discuss the impact COVID-19 in the logistics sector and particularly in his company.",
