Complex, multi-phase, advanced high strength steels are exemplary for such purposes, however still require improvements in application performance and production yield. These modern steels require tighter control over micro- and nanoscale to achieve their properties. Consequently, such steels are less easy to produce demanding more knowledge and control over the production processes such as rolling and annealing. This initiated the Digitally Enhanced New Steel Product Development (DENS) programme, where fundamental science will directly benefit industrial application.\n\nThe key objective is to connect currently available state-of-the-art sub models in one through process model framework and to create simplified models, suitable for online control. The through process modelling chain will be calibrated by high throughput laboratory experiments at the production site, making it directly suitable for production.",

Therefore, the end-of-life assessment of PLA after disposal (post-consumer waste) is important, concerning its biodegradability, compostability and its energy retrieval in the environment, based on the circular economy goals of the European Union (EU). The motivation of this research is focused on the need to increase the production of PLA single-use bioplastics by 2035, across the European scale. The research objective is confronted by assessing, testing and designing of the materials involvement in production, energy consumption, environmental effects, economic concerns, legislation amendments and societal impact. Furthermore, the results from the life cycle assessment (LCA) of PLA will be analyzed and externally validated with the golden standard(PBP\u2019s), in order to finally determine that PLA can be the sustainable solution for the SUP sector, amongst the three pillars of economic growth, ecological balance and social progress.",

However, over a long period of usage of these implants, numerous disadvantages are encountered, ultimately bringing about a drastic effect. These negative effects could be the frictional wear and tear of the femoral head or cytotoxicity of the neighbouring tissues due to the release of metal ions or debris formation that causes an aversion to the human body. Therefore, in order to reduce such negative impacts, this review is focusing on the biocompatibility and long-term stability of hip-joint replacement implants that need to be improved by using a thin film coating on the femoral head. DLC (Diamond-Like-Carbon) coatings show vital\nbiocompatibility based on attractive mechanical (high hardness and low frictional coefficient) and improved tribological properties (less wear) when it is deposited on the femoral head through Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) technique. However, the implants in this orthopedic field are encountered with a variety of concerns, regarding the DLC coating used for the hip implant. This review is particularly stressing on the related advances and improvements for the femoral head DLC coating, through the enhancement of hardness, reduced wear and friction, surface adherence and biocompatibility that can be achieved for hip implants by modification of the DLC microstructure and utilisation of the PECVD technique which is ideally suited for the uniform growth on the spherical substrate (femoral head) of the hip implant.",

An energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is vital. Current advancements in the research of renewable energy technologies reported that implementing Li-ion batteries into electric vehicles could cut carbon emissions, thereby mitigating climate change. Conventional Li-ion batteries exhibit decreased ionic conductivity at room temperature and high impedance at the electrode/solid electrolyte interface, which hinders stability and fast charging of the battery. An upcoming technology is the hybrid electrolyte which combines the safety properties provided by the solid electrolytes and high ionic conductivity resulting from the liquid electrolyte. Hence, a battery system with high performance is realized without compromising on the safety aspect. This report investigates a LAGP (lithium, aluminium, germanium and phosphorus) hybrid solid electrolyte battery combined with polyethylene oxide (PEO) and succinonitrile (SN) as additional constituents. LAGP, which crystallizes in the NASICON (Sodium Super Ionic Conductor) structure, enhances ionic conductivity and improves resistance of electrolyte to dendritic formation. The hybrid electrolyte is prepared by melt-quenching method and various characteristics of the electrolyte is studied. Finally, alternatives of the proposed hybrid solid electrolyte have been investigated and possible future improvements, such as recyclability of the materials are discussed.",

            "description": "Metal Matrix Composites (MMC\u2019S) are being widely used and developed for different technical applications. In this modern era Aluminum based MMC\u2019s are commonly used\nStructural, Aerospace, Marine and Automobile industries because of its high strength, light weight and economical production cost. Al MMC\u2019s have initially used as a substitute of Cast iron and Bronze alloys owing their poor wear rate. This project deals with the variation in the mechanical and metrological properties of Aluminum based Hybrid MMC\u2019s when casted with nine different composition ratios of Silicon Carbide and Graphite. Specimens containing varying proportions of Silicon Carbide and Graphite casted the Aluminum matrix are obtained separately. The results of the MMC are obtained\nthrough the application Hardness test, tensile test, SEM, EDAX are compared and evaluated with the result of ASCAST of Al 5083.",
