In this ongoing registry, we included up to 2000 patients to unravel the diagnostic and prognostic value of physical and physiological examination. Based on the variables included, physicians make clinical decisions in the sickest patients every day. The design paper is published in the BMJ Open.\n\nI was a leading investigator of clinical studies on critically ill patients. We were focussing on hemodynamics, the heart in non-cardiac disease, acute kidney failure at the ICU. Our team was involved in initiatives that combine the best of a prospective cohort study (like SICS-I, SOCCS and SICS-II) and randomised controlled trial design. The protocols were based upon results of systematic reviews (see Prospero).\n\nI was also a co-primary investigator in clinical studies on myocardial infarction and heart failure, especially about (glucose) metabolism. Like the Metformin to Reduce Heart Failure After Myocardial Infarction (GIPS-III), NCT01217307. With this study, we obtained a grant of the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMW; project no. 40-41200-98-9139). Over 20 publications out of this structured study have been published.\n\nTherefore, I was an investigator in the  Glucose Insulin Potassium Study (GIPS) I and II, both supported by the Netherlands Heart Foundation (99.028 and 2003B277).
