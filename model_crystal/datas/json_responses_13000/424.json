    "summary": "As an aspiring M&A Analyst, I am an incoming graduate of AVANS University and NEOMA Business School with a Bachelor of Business Administration in International Business and a Bachelor of Business Administration in CESEM program (Dual Degree). My academic focus includes relevant courses such as Currency Risk, Financial Management, Strategic Finance, Financial Accounting, Financial Analysis, Microeconomy, Quantitative Methods, and Foundation of Investments. My thesis on mitigating the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on Nike's financial performance exhibits my keen interest in finance.\n\nAs an EMEA Financial Data Analyst intern at Nike, I gained hands-on experience planning the numbers of 12 marketing teams and managing the books update related to the Nike stores of two Nike affiliated Football club. These experiences have honed my ability to work with complex financial data and use SAP for budgeting and forecasting. I am also excited to start my upcoming internship as a Junior Financial Auditor intern at EY, which will provide me with a solid foundation in financial analysis and audit.\n\nIn my previous role as a Business Development Manager Intern at Wayden, I managed thousands of e-mails to Top 100 French company executives and directed a marketing automation campaign targeting thousands of leaders. These experiences have helped me develop excellent communication skills, which I believe will be an asset in any M&A analyst role.\n\nI have also been involved in extracurricular activities, including my role as the Head of the events division at CESEM Student Association (Croc'odiles). I have collaborated with partners to successfully organize several events that energize the program's life.\n\nOverall, I possess strong technical skills, including proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, SAP, and Tableau. As a bilingual candidate, I am native in French and fluent in English with a C1 level (IELTS: 7/9). With my academic and professional experiences and skill set, I am confident in my ability to excel as an M&A analyst and contribute to any organization.",
