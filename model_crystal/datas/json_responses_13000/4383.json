    "summary": "In addition to consultancy I present training courses at all levels of expertise. Courses have always met with excellent student reviews. A portable analogue modelling sandbox is a unique and powerful training tool used in these courses. Participants are encouraged to bring their own current cases to the course as exercise material.  \nOne of NewTec\u2019s geo-mechanical field models resulted in adding 600 million bbls of oil to the reserves and accurate predictions of open fracture location and orientation, in-situ stresses and reservoir quality. It is the first successful predictive reservoir model in Algeria.\nThe complex South Furious field in Sabah (NW Borneo) was considered to be an unsolvable problem. I made a geomechanical model (in 1983, based on 2D seismic), which in essence is still in use today, but with much improved 3D seismic data.",
