The planning of the excursion consists of visiting various companies that have affinity with the field of geosciences, e.g. Shell, Wintershall, Statoil, Engie, Baker Hughes, IRIS, the University of Stavanger (UiS), meet fellow students there, a geological fieldtrip and experience the local culture and nature.  With a group of 6 students, we organized all the company visits, the budget, transport, accommodation and the communication with the contacts.\n\nTasks: I was responsible for the organization and communication of the visits to Wintershall, Shell, Engie, IRIS and the UiS, making the program schedule and arranging a visit to the Preikestolen. In addition, I arranged most of the sponsorship of several companies in the Netherlands to make this trip possible. ",
