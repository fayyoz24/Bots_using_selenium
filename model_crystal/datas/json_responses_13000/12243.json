    "summary": "I am a chemical engineer with a passion for sustainability. Because of this I moved to the Netherlands to pursue a MSc and PhD in renewable energy technologies. Throughout this path I have been able to combine a solid academic background with hands-on practical experience.  I enjoy learning new skills and working on multidisciplinary projects where communication skills are important to move forward. \n\nI've been involved in different projects related to sustainability and leadership, connecting with people all over the world to gain a better understanding of the energy tranistion and the skills necessary to accelerate it. I am looking forward for new opportunities to use these skills in practical applications to make a difference.  \n\n\n\n",
