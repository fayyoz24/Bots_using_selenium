During the Austin City Limits Festival, a group of my peers and I walked around the festival grounds, handing out recycling bags and talking to festival goers. In return for filling up a recycling bag with recyclable trash (cans, bottles, etc), we would hand out personalized ACL t-shirts. The event was a large success, as more than 100 60 liter recycling bags were filled, and the festival grounds were, for the majority, kept free of recyclable trash. "

However, due to their disability, they are often unable to do so without the risk of injuring themselves and/or the animal.  By leading the horse and holding the reins, a volunteer 'handler' is able to mitigate these risks. Apart from that, I was also responsible for grooming and taking care of the horse before and after riding. This activity was particularly rewarding, as I learned that I was able to improve someone's quality of life, quite visibly, with just a little bit of my time and compassion."
