I have worked there since I can remember, but actively, mostly part time during my studies - since I was 17. I helped customers buy and install hardware (Soundblaster cards, graphics cards, etc.) in their 386'es and 486's. IRQ, DMA, Vesa local bus....\n\nAs the stores were owned by my family, you can imagine I grew up using every imaginable (pc) system, starting with Commodore 64's, Amigas and Atari ST's, and every 286 / 386 / 486 there was, and started programming in BASIC, Amos, Stos, Visual Basic etc. I worked in almost every of our Dynabyte computer stores in almost every dutch city as a \"roaming\" sales representative; mostly in Enschede, Assen, Groningen and Zwolle.",
