I was the project manager in charge of the project proposal. Together with 3 my collaborators, I had the idea, built the project, wrote the proposal, and followed all the practical, budget-related and bureaucratic phases of the proposal submission. \n\nThe project developed in a one-week kick-off meeting, held in Copenhagen, in August 2012. As project manager, together with my collaborators, I organized this international meeting with 20 selected participants, members of the new-born scientific network, together with local scientists. \n\nThe declared aim of this meeting was to gather scientists at the forefront of cosmology and identify collaborative projects.\n\nThe website of CAANDY:  http://dark.nbi.ku.dk/caandy/",

In particular in a few of them I was the responsible head of the LOC and SOC committee, and I managed the organizational, scientific, and logistical task required, resulting in successful and profitable conference with very positive feedback from the participants.",
