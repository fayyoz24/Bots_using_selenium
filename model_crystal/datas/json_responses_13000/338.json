    "summary": "As a Senior engineer I am used to acquire customer needs, define and analyze requirements, develop product concepts and bring suitable solutions in the area of mobile communications technologies. Cost modeling of telecom networks and services from a Regulatory point of view represents the second pillar of my background.\n\nMy career path has consistently brought me in direct contact with large and complex corporate databases, applications and processes. As owner, architect, manager, power user or analyst, depending on the position and system. Yet always striving for an as simplified as possible, consistent and harmonized operating enterprise.\n\nBeing customer and result oriented is key to me. I take complex or unknown systems, technologies or issues as a challenge. I can solve problems or find solutions independently but the best comes out of me while working with others in a team. My track record includes coordination of different international expert teams and communication with different internal and external stakeholders.\n\nMy goal is getting closer to the business side while profiting from my technical and analytical background to bridge across different enterprise areas. I am looking for a position in a customer oriented environment where I can apply my abilities in the definition, development, introduction and integration of new systems, processes or services, as well as my analysis and optimization skills to improve the existing ones.\n\nI feel comfortable working with different people and establishing new contacts. Therefore I am looking forward to be involved in dealing with business partners in order to establish optimal long term solutions for customers.\n\nSpecialties: Mobile telecommunications. Analysis, solutions, integration, requirements definition, product and process development,  customer oriented, complex systems, team member, open, flexible.
