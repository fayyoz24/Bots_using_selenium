My educational background in Architecture has also given me a deep understanding of space and structure, which I apply to my 3D renderings for interior design and event production.\n\nOver the course of my 15-year career at an event production company, I have gained invaluable expertise in conceptualizing, designing, and producing all types of events, ranging from intimate weddings and corporate conferences to massive concerts for international artists like Chayanne, Ricardo Arjona, DJ Dimitri Vega & Like Mike, and more.\n\nAs a graphic designer, I am drawn to meticulous design, and I have developed a keen interest in the field of UX/UI design and the use of cutting-edge platforms like Figma. Additionally, I have been pursuing my passion for music by studying Audio Engineering at United Pop, which further enriches my ability to bring a unique creative perspective to all of my projects.\n\nOverall, I am a versatile and dynamic creative professional who is committed to delivering exceptional results for my clients across all disciplines, whether in music or design.\n\nAnd I can also play drums while speaking \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd41",
