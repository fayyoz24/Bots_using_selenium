    "summary": "Hi, glad you found me :)\n\nI am a behavioural change enthusiast, spoken word artist and coffee brewing addict, on a mission to make people feel more alive and workplaces more humane \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAs an adopted South Korean boy growing up in The Netherlands, identity, soul-searching, and discovery have always been important themes in my life. Although, it took me years before realising that my inner struggle of acceptance was in the way of my own personal transformation. An intense self-discovery journey back to South Korea catalysed that process.\n\nOver the years, I have been blessed to work with both the NGO and corporate sector. These different environments have shaped my beliefs on leadership and life balance. Today I get paid to kick people\u2019s butts so they turn their good intentions into real behavioural change, and use my voice as a spoken word artist to confront audiences with prejudices and unconscious biases they didn\u2019t even know they had.\n\nAnd when I am not doing any of the above, you\u2019ll probably find me somewhere enjoying a delicious specialty coffee! So catch me if you can and let's start a conversation...",
