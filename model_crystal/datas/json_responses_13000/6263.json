I have documented our trip with a sonic diary, a podcast called Radio Balthasar, which features the music we listen to on the road, field recordings, the people we meet and the adventures we have. Traveling for this extensive period through vast territories and landscapes, seeing different Indigenous cultures and the devastating effects of climate change, globalization and mass extinction of species, has greatly transformed my understanding of the world. \nwww.thismustbethepace.com\nhttps://soundcloud.com/radio-balthasar"
