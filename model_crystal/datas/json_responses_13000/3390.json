    "summary": "I've graduated from Samara State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering in Russia and then worked as interior designer for 5 years. Two years ago I started a career in game development and virtual reality. \n\nMy competence includes creating 3D game-ready assets, painting textures, baking maps and setting models into Unity or Unreal Engine. I've got an experience of developing the real-time interactive 3D training, worked with photogrammetry to rebuild the existing location into a game scene\n\nMy primary focus is to continue to refine the expertise of my current skillset and build new ones by becoming more proficient. As a team player, I am willing to reach a high quality work, share experience and build a friendly atmosphere with other members of the crew\n",
