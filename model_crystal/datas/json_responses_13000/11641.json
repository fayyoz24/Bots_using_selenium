Breeding programs mostly aim at increasing the levels of desired plant PSMs constitutively. In addition to this constitutive defence we can increase the level of relevant PSMs by administering them to seeds or seedlings or by induction of the plant signaling pathways. For thrips resistance especially the jasmonate (JA) pathway is relevant. For tomato we observed that in a highly resistant variety resistance was not fully developed during the first two weeks of plant growth. Because thrips is a vector of viruses it is extremely important that even the very young plant stages are well protected. The objective of this proposal is to develop methods for enhancement of resistance by (1) dipping cuttings and coating seeds with PSMs (2) induction of PSMs through activation of defence signaling pathways by (2) light treatments and (3) by non-pathogenic bacteria.

Phenols are secondary metabolites implicated to be involved in resistance to herbivores as well as being antioxidants implicated in human cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases as well as diabetes. Carrots are rich in phenols. Applying an eco-metabolomic approach the metabolomic profiles of herbivore resistant and susceptible carrots will be compared to identify candidate compounds involved in plant resistance. As  pest western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) and as pathogen  the fungus carrot leaf blight  (Alternaria dauci) will be used.  Eighty-four cultivated and wild carrots accessions are available, which currently are used to construct a genetic map. Promising candidate compounds can thus be linked to the corresponding genes. In addition the effect of phenol mixtures on host plant resistance will be studied developing in-vitro bioassays for mixture studies. Also the effect of resistance to different pest biotypes will be investigated.",

Up to now the study of chemical host plant resistance has, for technical reasons, been restricted to the identification of single compounds applying specific chemical analyses adapted to the compound in question. This is a major disadvantage because resistance is mainly based on a combination of compounds. Recent developments in plant metabolomics allow a more complete overview of secondary metabolites present in a plant. NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) is one of the most universally used metabolomic approaches. It permits the simultaneous detection of a wide range of metabolites without prior knowledge over potential candidate compounds. In this project we will develop a metabolomic resistance test, based on NMR, facilitating a high throughput screening of resistance. The research proposed is based on an eco-metabolomic approach we developed as a proof of principle to show that NMR constitutes a major advancement in the study of host plant resistance: The metabolomic profiles of resistant and susceptible varieties will be compared to identify candidate compounds involved in resistance. The candidate compounds will then validated with in-vitro bioassays.  Using multivariate statistics models will be developed to predict resistance based on the secondary metabolites patterns. These models will be validated with a second independent resistance test with different varieties. The end result of this project is a high throughput resistance test, based on NMR to substitute time consuming and costly in vivo resistance bioassays. ",

We intend to study a phenolic compound, chlorogenic acid (CGA), which acts as an antioxidant in plants and is expected to protect against degenerative, age related diseases. While most studies on CGA have focussed on human health aspects, our programme will study the importance of CGA for plant resistance against herbivorous insects. Specifically we want: to develop tomato lines resistant to western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) by increasing natural CGA levels. To do so we need 1) to explore the natural variation in CGA levels in tomatoes, 2) to identify the genetics behind CGA production levels, 3) to understand the relationship of CGA biosynthesis to other primary and secondary metabolite pathways, 4) to increase our understanding of the role of CGA in thrips resistance, in particular to identify possible synergy of CGA with other (phenolic) compounds and to determine the activity of various other cinnamic acid esters against thrips. When taken together this combination of targeted and broad genomic-level approaches should provide important information on the metabolic network of plant phenolic production and facilitate the engineering of plants containing elevated CGA levels without compromise in overall plant performance.",

Utilizing the plants own defenses forms an essential part of economic, environmental and health benefits not only for farmers but to society in general. The applied aspect of plant health has always been important to me.  Therefore, I closely co-laborated with farmers and plant breeders. This has resulted in co-laborative projects with the  agri- and horticultural industry. As  teamleader I was responsible for the development and implementation of plant health research, project acquisition- and management. Projects involved the development of in-vivo and and in-vitro bioassays, the use of metabolomic and molecular techniques. Research was conducted at laboratory, greenhouse and field level.  I guided and motivated my international team of researchers, technicians and graduate students so that together we came to result- oriented solutions.",
