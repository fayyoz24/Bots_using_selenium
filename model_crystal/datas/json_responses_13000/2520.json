The geometry of an S-Duct causes distortion of the flow inside the duct itself, thus affecting the turbomachinery downstream, leading to a decrease in the performance of the engine. In this thesis, the engine is approximated with a static fan simulator.\n\nResearch question:\nDoes the static fan have an effect on the unsteadiness levels of the S-duct?\n\nAims\n-Study the flow inside an S-duct with the fan simulator at the AIP position.\n-Assess the impact of the fan simulator at the exit of the S-duct on the flow distortion levels inside the duct itself.\n-Compare the results obtained with the case without a fan simulator.",
