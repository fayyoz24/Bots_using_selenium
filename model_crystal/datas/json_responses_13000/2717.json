STUDIO i aims to generate and promote diversity and accessibility in the Dutch cultural sector.\n\nLike many other cultural institutions in the Netherlands, the two project museums acknowledge that their audiences are quite exclusive: many of our visitors have similar cultural, socio-economical, hetero-normative backgrounds. Over the last few years the museums have therefore started programmes for audiences who previously did not visit: Onvergetelijk, Special Guests and Queering the Collection. With STUDIO i, they want to take another step towards inclusion and embrace diversity in their own museums as well as the broader cultural sector \u2013 considering public, programmes and personnel. They do this together with partners in the field and other cultural organisations.\n\nIn 2019, I was the interim projectleader of the project at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, to cover for the maternity leave of Marleen Hartjes. After the interim period, I was asked by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam to stay on as project officer for the project.",

Through the caucus we will ask how art can provide a productive, critical space where solidarities are formed and political visions rehearsed. In other words, it will ask: \u2018How can we become more?\u2019\n\nFor Becoming More, the Van Abbemuseum invited artists, organizers and thinkers working in the Netherlands to author distinct days, bringing different forms of knowledge and experiences into the museum. We believe at this critical juncture of unrest, it is vital to listen, consolidate and share. The programme is the outcome of these extensive discussions from which a series of urgent topics have emerged.\n\nIn May 2017 I became part of the project team of the ten day caucus Becoming More. Responsibilities included:\n- Creating and organizing an online communication strategy of the project on the museum website and social media channels.\n- Writing a press release for the project.\n- Editing the Dutch version of the programme booklet.\n- Editing wall texts for the exhibitions of the programme.\n- Organizing registration for the caucus through different channels (ticketing, We Are Public, Friends of the museum, and others), and keeping track of registrations.\n- Maintaining contact with the caterers of the event.",

An exhibition and public program, curated by Thiago de Paula Souza, who was one of the BAK 2018/2019 Fellows. Tony Cokes: To Live as Equals brings together selected video works from the past 30 years, tracing Cokes\u2019s unique formation of critique through visual and textual codes, and his changing relationship to archival material over several different global historical moments. The works draw a through line from these historical events to the present of systemic violence and ever-more-complex forms of social control. What are ways of seeing and responding to the seemingly endless cycles of inequality and oppression? How then, the exhibition queries, could one break those cycles and envision living as equals?  \n\nI was in charge of the production of this exhibition.",

The museum has an experimental approach towards art\u2019s role in society. Openness, hospitality and knowledge exchange are important to it.\n\nThe museum challenges itself and its visitors to think about art and its place in the world, covering a range of subjects, including the role of the collection as a cultural 'memory' and the museum as a public site. International collaboration and exchange have made the Van Abbemuseum a place for creative cross-fertilisation and a source of surprise, inspiration and imagination for its visitors and participants.\n\n\nAs project coordinator and communication employee for the Van Abbemuseum I have gained a broad experience within the museum: from education and communication to the production of exhibitions. I have worked on three very different projects, but all have one important aspect in common: working with several external partners is central to the project. Therefore I also developed an expertise in closely cooperating with other museums and organisations.",
