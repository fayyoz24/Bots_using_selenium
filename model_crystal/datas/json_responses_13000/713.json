    "summary": "As the leader of your organization, unit or department, you have your goals:\n\n\u2022 Serve your customers in the best possible way\n\u2022 Get and keep your people focused and inspired\n\u2022 Balance performance and organizational health\n\u2022 Center on the long-term purpose and continuity\n\u2026and a whole lot more\n\nDespite having in mind how you will achieve these goals, unforeseen things always happen that keep you from getting where you want your organization to be. As research shows, no less than two-third of formulated strategy plans fail. To beat these odds, you need an actionable and engaging strategy that your employees and stakeholders believe in.\n\nI help companies generate and execute exactly that type of strategy. Once we work together, I support you in your strategy and leadership skills and help you discover, formulate, and execute the right strategy for your organization.  Whether your existing strategy needs to be adjusted, or you need to build it from scratch, there are proven tools and clear steps to follow. Together, we can have a look at where your pain points are and where your moment of opportunity lies.\n\nBased on my combined academic and professional experience, my key strength is turning fragmented ideas and plans into a crisp and coherent strategy that your people will and want to execute.\n\nLet's have a virtual coffee!\n\n\u21b3 jeroenkraaijenbrink.com\n\u21b3 strategykickstart.com",
