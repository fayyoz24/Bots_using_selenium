Alert seeks to influence the policies and engagement strategies of governments, international organisations and practitioners to reduce conflict risks and support cooperative initiatives for lasting peace.\n\nI am leading Alert's work on climate security and conflicts around access and protection of land, water and forests. The aim is to enhance opportunities within fragile contexts for communities to build social resilience and adaptability in the face of the linked risks of climate change, natural resources and conflict. To this end, my goal is to ensure that environment and climate change considerations are factored into development, conservation  and peacebuilding policy and practice, and that conflict sensitivity is integrated into natural resource management and responses to climate change. I am managing research and advocacy projects at the global level and support country offices in design and implementation of projects with communities, governments and businesses.",
