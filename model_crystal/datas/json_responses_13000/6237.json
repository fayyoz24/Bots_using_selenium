    "summary": "I'm professional actress specialised in film & theater and Yoga teacher.\n\nI have a degree as bachelor of theater at the university Playa Ancha, valparaiso, Chile. I have experience in acting in front of camera which I partly gained during and after a specialisation course at Matus Actores, Santiago, Chile. The other part is as employee for different programs, tv shows, movies, short movies, video clips and photo shoots. In addition in the netherlands I patricipated in various shows like GTST, and video clips with Jonna Fraser, and 538 commercials.\n\nIn addition I teach yoga on which I like to elaborate a bid. My relationship with yoga began 7 years ago. After 4 years of practice a little nervous but full of excitement, I decided to travel to India to obtain 200 YYT teacher training certificate and deepen in knowledge of the practice. During this process I completely fell in love with teaching and found a sense of peace in teaching and enabling others to practice self care.  My goal is to empower people in their bodies and to give them the tools that they need to develop their personal practice. For people to feel that they have an opportunity to really be friends with themselves by showing them how to be self compassionate and deepen their self-awareness. I do everything I can to make the practice as safe and comfortable as possible by holding space and intending for everyone to feel grounded and amazing in body, mind & heart. \nMy teaching style is a fusion of Hatha, Ashtanga, and Vinyasa, interwoven with elements of mindfulness, influenced by my own healing journey. \n\nI'm very passionate and consider myself a hardworking and empathetic woman, I  like to take on new challenges in my life and explore new things. I am adventurous and I always like to learn new things.   I am motivating and have good communication skills.  I like to organize which I think is a gift that has to be exploited. \nPeople is my inspiration.",
