We review load-bearing capacity of whole structure. We analyse foundations, slabs, walls, stairs regarding cracks, deformations and also check roofs and chimneys. We recommend emergency activities and works to be executed by specialized companies. Also our task is to calm people and recommend them if they should return or not to their homes. "
