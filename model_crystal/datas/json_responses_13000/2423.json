    "summary": "I am an inquisitive, result-driven chemical/process engineer. \n\nAfter doing an Internship at Jacobs in the process engineering department during my bachelor studies, I choose to do my masters in chemical engineering in the process track at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Through my masters i have developed a diverse technical skillset such as thermodynamics, process development and scale-up, fluid flow, process analysis, unit operations to name a few. I have also been developed skills to work with Matlab, Simulink and ASPEN simulation software.\n\nMy peers and supervisors have often described me as Pro-active, structured and result-oriented.\n\nApart from academics, I am passionate about running, badminton and cooking. I also keep myself updated about current events, and particularly like to read about International relations and politics.\n",

            "description": "Crystallization is a common method with a long history for producing solid products in the chemical\nand pharmaceutical industry. Yet surprisingly, nucleation which is the initial step of crystallization is\npoorly understood. One of the reasons for this difficulty is the fact that it is impossible not to have\nhetero-nucleants (so called impurities) in solutions that ultimately induce nucleation. This has motivated\nincreased interest for research in studying and improving understanding of nucleation in recent\nyears by studying these hetero-nucleants. \n\nContributing towards this goal an attempt is made to design these\nimpurities in a way so that we can control their properties and functions. This is done by exploring\nthe possibility of using liquid-liquid interfaces, which is nanoemulsion in this case, to induce heterogeneous\nnucleation. \n\nThe nucleation kinetics of two model compounds, KCl and d-Mannitol have been\nestablished based on induction time experiments. Furthermore, a second system of nanoemulsion was\nprepared and its stability was studied. The induction time experiments were repeated in the nanoemulsion\nsystem and the effects were studied. Oil fraction in the nanoemulsion was observed to affect the\noverall kinetics and experiments. Ultimately, evidentiary support was established that the presence of\nnanoemulsion enhanced nucleation in a certain range of induction time by 28%.",
