ERAC is specialized in shaping, managing and evaluating programs and projects that are part of European, national and regional funding or development programmes. \n\nClients are municipalities, provinces, the central government and its ministries, the European Commission (DG Regio), knowledge institutes, waterboards and private businesses.\n\nAs a consultant on regional development I was involved in project development and composing project proposals for a variety of clients (e.g. municipalities, water boards and knowledge institutes) for (EU) financed programmes in cooperation with various project partners. Researching and evaluating EU and national policies and drafting strategies were also my responsibility. I advised (semi) governmental clients and enterprises  on  how to develop and implement (European) policy strategies.",
