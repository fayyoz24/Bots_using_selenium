    "summary": "I am an experienced seller and L&D Consultant with a clear focus towards value generation through the delivery of measurable returns for clients, stakeholders and the businesses alike. I have an exceptional capability to manage projects, from initial inception to successful completion, under tight resourcing constraints and to the specific needs of both internal and external client groups.\n\nI have been responsible for induction training programmes of 4-6 weeks that focussed on corporate policies and procedures, product knowledge, IT systems and the soft skills required to carry out a service based role. I was responsible for the ongoing development of the employees which included liaising with the CSM to conduct and report upon the full learning cycle.\n As a training consultant  and seller in the B2B, long cycle sales arena, I sold  and trained commercial skills (selling, negotiating, communicating) to organisations across the world. I've trained procurement professionals in negotiation skills in an Oil & Gas organisation in places such as Columbia, Trinidad, Pakistan, Angola and Algeria; I've trained Sales professionals in Selling in Manufacturing organisations in China, Singapore, UAE and most of Europe; for a financial services organisation I trained five commercial skills programmes on a train-the-trainer basis in over 30 countries including USA, Australia and New Zealand. This means I have a strong cultural awareness when selling and delivering training across borders and can adapt and be credible across the world. \n\nIn addition to the traditional classroom training, I have been instrumental in developing and delivering training in the virtual environment. I have used Microsoft Lync and Adobe Connect Pro to deliver skills development programmes to geographically spread learners to the same level of engagement and skill improvement as their traditional classroom colleagues.",
