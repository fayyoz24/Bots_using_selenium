    "summary": "I am Ana Alvarez, a passionate,  **curious** and dynamic individual driven by understanding change and innovation within ourselves and organizations. \n\nI was born in Colombia, studied law and qualified as a lawyer in 2016. I practiced for two years as a lawyer and pursued my LLM studies in Singapore (NUS). I have always been driven by doing things different, getting myself out of my comfort has been one of my major drivers. Singapore opened up my world. As a lawyer, I became profoundly interested in how innovation and technology can untapped ways of doing things differently. As a person, I discovered skills which in traditional legal roles; I would not develop. As I became fascinated with the above-mentioned topics, I joined the vibrant legal technology ecosystem. At beginning I thought technology and law was what I wanted to do, but soon I realized that what I wanted to keep digging in was in change and innovation in corporate environments. \n\nNowadays I work as an Innovation Advisor and I am on the mission of unlocking innovation and change while cultivating curiosity and courage.",
