    "summary": "Geologist, PhD in Earth Science and oil industry professional with more than 14 years of international experience in well logs acquisition and interpretation within high-profile corporations. I have started my career working at the wellsite as wireline engineer, and over time I have specialized in borehole image log processing and interpretation (structural and sedimentological), and petrophysical interpretation. My focus are data quality and integration and my objective is to increase image log data utilization, by using image log to complement and enhance petrophysical interpretations and geological and sedimentological models.\nI have  an extensive worldwide experience, acquired both living and working in several different countries in all continents (Netherlands, Malaysia, Qatar, Oman, Syria and United States) and I am used to deal and manage cultural differences.  I enjoy collaborating with other experts, and working in multidisciplinary projects. I am an excellent communicator and a true team player, very enthusiastic and highly motivated, I am eager to learn and to test and develop new workflows and technical solutions.\n\nA few of my skills include:\n\u2022 Borehole image processing and interpretations / Structural interpretations / Fracture characterization.\n\u2022 Image based sedimentological studies/ petrophysics/ Thin-bed analysis/ missed pay identification.\n\u2022 Quality control of petrophysical and image logs/well logging and wireline operations/ Operation support. \n\u2022 Data integration (image log, petrophysical logs, core, mud log, drilling parameters, well tests, seismic).\n\u2022 Geological mapping and outcrop studies.\n\u2022 XRD preparation and interpretation/core goniometry.\n\u2022 Technical Training/Technical Reporting/Technical presentations.",

This study integrated standard open-hole logs and CMR to differentiate facies based on their micro-, meso- and macro-porosity using the Carbonate Advisor workflow. Sedimentological techniques based on textural analysis and image features recognition, were integrated with the CMR results to produce 'porosity-based' geological electrofacies. Results were compared with MICP data to determine flow units using the Winland R35 method. Different flow units were defined on the basis of reservoir storage- and flow-capacities computed from the analyzed porosity and permeability data.",
