    "summary": "Studying rocks = Generating data-driven business insights?\n\nI wanted to be a scientist when I was a little kid and I studied geology in university. But now I\u2019m providing business insights and building data infrastructure. So what happened?\n\nWell, as I finished up my studies, I did some thinking about what I wanted out of my career. I realized that despite my love for geology, I didn\u2019t want to be a geologist forever. But I did want to do something with business (and definitely entrepreneurship at some point).\n\nIt was also at this time that I learned about data analytics as a career. I immediately saw similarities between what I love about geology research and the job of a data analyst. As I\u2019ve gained experience as an analyst, I\u2019ve only found more similarities. For both it boils down to processing a complex dataset and telling a story that is meaningful to the target audience. Simplifying complexity. \n\nFor example, in my geologic research I collected atomic data from individual, microscopic mineral grains and published new insights on millions of years of history of an entire mountain range. In my current role, I dug into the transactions of individual customers to gain insights on churn and developed a model to identify it as soon as it\u2019s detectable (and increased customer winbacks in the process). For both of these projects I took complex and minute details and turned them into useful knowledge. \n\nA related term I like is \u201clumpers and splitters\u201d, coined by Charles Darwin (himself a geologist better known for his other work). The gist of the term is that some people split every detail into its own category, whereas others lump things to focus on the broader story. Both of these are valid ways of looking at the world, but context drives whether you present the lumped or the split view to your audience.\n\nTaking notes in the field, I may call a rock a quartzofeldspathic gneiss, but when shopping for countertops I\u2019ll ask the salesperson for the granite section. \n\nI see the ability to lump complex data together as a key component of being a good analyst. You need to be able to understand and work with all of the details, but aggregate and relay only the key information that can be acted upon. \n\nUltimately, I see my job as taking something complex and making it understandable and actionable. Simplifying complexity. \n\nSo whether you need to learn how a mountain formed or why success early in the sales pipeline isn\u2019t leading to expected revenue, I\u2019m your guy. Also, I\u2019ll be happy to tell you some interesting facts about the countertop in the cafeteria if you ask.",
