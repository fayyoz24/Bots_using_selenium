    "summary": "Outstanding Emails\nI absolutely love that I'm able to create and send emails to my prospective clients. The platform that helps me design my emails is amazing, no need to learn HTML! This helps me advertise my business and untimely drives profile views which lead to sales. Customer support on email is the quickest around!\nFor the Premier version of Campaign Monitor I think $149 a month is kind of steep, however with the middle package still having unlimited email campaigns and auto emails at a much more reasonable price it\u2019s much more doable. I wish phone support was included with the other packages, but its only on the expensive package.\nI'm able to send out email campaigns for my business with ease, which untimely drives more sales. I have seen a huge spike in sales, and I believe Campaign Monitor is the reason why. With the time zone sending and automation process We can send email at the target time customers statistically check their emails, over all different time zones.\nDo not site on just using this as a tool for sending the typical email. Make a beautiful well put together email that catches everyone eye, so it helps drive sales. Build yourself a though database, you'll thank yourself later",
