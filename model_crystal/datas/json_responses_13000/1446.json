    "summary": "Open to challenges, ambitious, and ready to learn new skills. I have a passion for programming and it is something I am extremely interested in expanding my knowledge of. Having a good eye for detail and a background in physics and mathematics helps me tackle every challenge in a systematic way, but I'm also very flexible when it comes to learning new skills and adapting to new challenges. Being an adaptable person, I feel comfortable working in group projects, and communicating with colleagues about different ideas.\n\nOn a more technical side, I mostly work with computer graphics using C++ and OpenGL. When it comes to smaller applications or code that I want to write quickly, I make use of Python. Most of my programming time is spent on making YouTube tutorials, having a following of around 5k subscribers and growing rapidly. I also work on personal projects which are usually small games made from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.",
