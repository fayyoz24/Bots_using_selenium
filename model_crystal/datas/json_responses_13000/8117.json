However, some types of awareness messages are more effective than others. Usually, general statements \u2013 such as: \u201cFast driving kills\u201d \u2013 are not as effective as when real statistics are attached to it \u2013 like: \u201cDriving above speed limit causes 50% more severe accidents \u2013 where the person reading it can make a better sense of the risks involved though quantitative information. \nWith that in mind, the project involved downloading a traffic accident dataset for the city of Seattle, group it by different degrees of severity (e.g. fatality, serious injury, injury, prop damage) and apply a classification supervised model - Logistic Regression - to make predictions to categorical target label and further calculate the probability of a certain category to happen. \nThe dataset was download from the Department of Transportation of the city of Seattle, under ArcGIS Metadata Form.\nThree different evaluation algorithms were used in order to assess the accuracy of the results obtained by the Logistic Regression model: Jaccard Index, F1 Score and Log Loss.",
