Patent applications are texts and drawings describing an invention and submitted by individuals or companies seeking legal protection.\n\n- The purpose of the search is to find the most relevant previously published technical disclosures (\"prior art\") against which the patentability of the application can be assessed.\n\n- Substantive examination enables the applicant (or authorised representative such as a patent attorney) to be informed of any objections to the grant of a patent, with a view to resolving these through correspondence and, where necessary, oral proceedings.\n\n- Examiners may also be involved in opposition proceedings if the patent is contested.",
