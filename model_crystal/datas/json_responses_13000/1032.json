    "summary": "I am a PhD candidate in the Kokkoris group at the Vrije Universiteit (VU), Amsterdam. My work involves the use of advanced fluorescent microscopy techniques to study the intracellular dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AM fungi) networks. In addition, I am using similar techniques to understand the arrangement and structure of the AM fungal cell and cellular components. In the future, I shall be investigating nuclear dynamics.\n\nBefore my PhD position, I completed an MSc in Ecology & Evolution also at the VU. During this time, I developed a strong interest in studying AM fungi through two internship projects completed at the VU and AMOLF. I utilised various techniques to research AM fungi at different organisational scales. This work enabled me to spend nearly two years studying the same organism, using diverse approaches and adopting varied perspectives. \n\nThrough my PhD, I aim to advance my research skills and contribute to understanding the network and cellular dynamics of an ecologically important organism. There is much to learn!",
