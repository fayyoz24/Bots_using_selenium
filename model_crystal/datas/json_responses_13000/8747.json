    "summary": "A Dutch qualified employment lawyer with experience in cross-border employment and Dutch employment law. My experience comprises advising on a broad range of (international) employment law issues, employment litigation and negotiation. I work as a Senior Legal Company - Employment at Remote, a company that is on a mission to enable a world in which individuals are able to build wealth and financial freedom through equal access to employment opportunities in the global economy. \n\nI am passionate about technology and innovation in the legal field. Having always been creative and a visual thinker, my main interest and focus is making the law more accessible and understandable to mere mortals by applying legal design. \n\nI am an enthusiastic public speaker, always willing to share knowledge of employment law with different audiences, including expats, global mobility specialists, and people teams. Continuously eager to develop and learn. Fluent in Polish, Dutch, and English and forever learning German, Spanish, and lately Norwegian.\n\nI love bringing people together by organising events and sharing my worldwide network. In addition, I am giving back by guiding foreign lawyers and law students to set their first steps in the legal field in the Netherlands. Due to my bi-cultural background, I understand an outsider's perspective, but I can provide a local reality check if needed. \n\nLet\u2019s have a chat!",
