The European Commission is enthusiastic and the Netherlands has another sustainability showpiece. The process from idea to signing took 1 year and 1 day and was initiated by Acceleratio.\n\nGood background reading can be found on: http://www.wastematters.eu/news-from-europe/news-from-europe/north-sea-countries-agree-to-close-cross-border-value-chains.html\n\nThe formal green deal text can be found on: http://www.greendeals.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/International-Green-Deal-text-NSRR.pdf\n\nA video can be found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb7Poc2CcOM&feature=youtu.be",

They lead dialogue on the ground and Europe-wide on top circular issues within thematic working groups known as Leadership groups.\n\nThe Circular Europe Days took place during Dubai Expo Global Goals Week, coinciding with Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, and attracted an international audience including high-level state representatives.\n\nThe programme was rich and varied and covered various themes, such as buildings and infrastructure, circular procurement, electronics, economic incentives, food waste and more. European Commissioners, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the European institutions' highest levels, have joined the event to present Europe's vision for the circular economy.\n\nFive Member States (Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Poland and Finland) hosted the Circular Europe Days in their pavilions, highlighting national efforts to transition towards the circular economy.\n\nThere were matchmaking opportunities, supported by the Enterprise Europe Network, for businesses onsite and online to facilitate collaboration, urging further action towards a sustainable and inclusive future. For six days, you can book meetings with circular economy stakeholders from all over the world!\n\nFor the first two days (17-18 January) the meetings was hybrid: onsite for the people in Dubai and online for the others. From 19-22 January, the matchmaking was 24/7 online for all participants. The matchmaking event was free and open to all participants joining the Dubai EXPO, participating in missions and other organisations in the world, and active in the circular economy.",
