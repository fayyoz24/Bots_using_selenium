    "summary": "One of my favorite projects:\nI am acting in a global dream teamNL. My partners are business people ready to laugh and service/support each other. We work from the heart and help people, all over the world, to better their sustainable health and if they want to, with financial freedom (= leaving the 'employer model'). We share a breakthrough in health and science. It is about GETTING YOUR CELLS TALKING.\nIf you do not know the redox signaling molecukes then big pharma's silence campaign has succeeded untill now.\nThe redox product boosts your glutathione potential (your body's hero) and turns on several key communication genes of your cell's DNA. The latter normally turn of due to stress and ageing.\n\nI am  @ your service and looking for leaders to become their best selfs.\n\nMY PASSION\n#learning #SDG123\nI thrive to let and see students growing in chemistry and in learning in general. Including sustainability whenever I can.\n\nI strive to:\n- achieve a universal secondary chemistry  EDUCATION TOOLKIT to relieve the primary teaching process = the preparation of the activities in class with respect of the diversity of the learners and teachers\n- including environmental sustainability\n- how about trying again a GREENGROUNDS grassroots / institute to launch wandering starters in the working zone.\n- to service students and business partners according to the way they like to learn. I like to challenge, deregulate, picture by drawing and sensing, and ....\n- become one of the global learning lighthouses\nMindvalley, Edutopia, ASEAteamNL, the Kahn Academy, my family, music, The Hague and WIKIPEDIA are an ongoing inspiration.

We help people on sustainable health and freedom by sharing info on THE medical breakthrough. What are the physica and mental benefits? Connected heart, body and mind, extreme personal growth and a proven businessmodel. My journey is a like a natural working method, easy to duplicate. We both grow due to the connecting encounters we have. I like humble, serviing and creative people. You? Let us have fun and share this craft.\n\nMy greatest happiness comes from improving my listening and my deeper connecting with other cheerful people. It is a great journey :-) <3\n\nIf we decide to work together, I will NOT let you fail.\n\n1. Nobelprize 1999: Mitochondria produce particles when they free energy.\nThose particles are redox signaling molecules and they turn out to be crucial (a key!) in cell communication.\n2. Some years later:  A team of scientists made those particles outside the body. Naturally starting with salt water.\n3.   Some years later: A team of scientists succeeded in stabilizing the redoxmolecules outside the body.\n4. A small mistake: the investors/founders talked with a big pharma company to see if collaboration was possible. ASEA rejected a BIG check as they want to have the product available to everybody. The model of spreading: by word of mouth, since that is how the journey of the product started.\n5. Research shows the stuff turns on communicational genes in the cell in 5 key area'sm of the human body. This is fully in line with the growing insight in the redox science literature.",
