Even though the basic every workday followed the same pattern, they were all different because customers were different and had different problems or questions. I learned to deal with all kinds of people without getting hurt if someone was angry. And the most important thing was always to solve the customer's problem and make him/her happy. I also did all kinds of other things, for example organised the warehouse, wrote news to some customers and kept in contact with foreign colleagues. In summer 2014 I acquainted a trainee. I used English, Finnish and Swedish in my job.",
