My primary role was to field journalists questions on all aspects of Home Officer policy, including immigration, crime, prisons, the police, and criminal justice. This required an ability to grasp complex policy issues very quickly and the ability to work under extreme pressure and to very tight deadlines. Drafting, editing and issuing media advisories and press releases was a daily task, as was researching and writing briefing notes and occasionally inputting into Ministerial speeches. \nI was also called upon to assist in Ministerial interviews including for former Home Officer Minister (and former Secretary of Defence) Des Brown.",
