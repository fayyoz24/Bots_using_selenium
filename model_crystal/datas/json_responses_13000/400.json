I always meet deadlines and can work under stress conditions. I'm fluent in English and in Russian (which is my native language). I also have a good command of both written and oral French and Ukrainian. I'm currently studying Dutch. I like studying and learning something new from my work experience. I'm always ready to try some jobs and work duties which are new for me.\n\nMy objectives are self-development, working in a dynamic and fast-paced, international environment. I'm not afraid of a challenging and demanding job, in reality, I'll appreciate it!",
