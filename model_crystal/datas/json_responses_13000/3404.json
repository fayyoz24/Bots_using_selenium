    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my profile!\n\nI am a cultural ambassador who enjoys working in an international environment where every day is different.\n\nI grew up in Tokyo, where there is always something new to try. But I was always craving more. Ever since high school, my passion for learning about different cultures has led me to visit more than 35 countries and live in five: Japan, Poland, Sweden, Russia, and the Netherlands. \n\nFor the past 9 years, I have been away from Japan for my bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s studies and for my job. Throughout my international journey, I have developed cultural sensitivity that exists from everyday life to business. It is always my dream to work with people of different backgrounds in a dynamic environment.",
