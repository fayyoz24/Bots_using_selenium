            "description": "Invited to present a IAC '17 and Small Satellite Conference '17\n\nAbstract:\nCubeSats are small satellite platforms which have significantly reduced the cost of access to low Earth orbit over the past decade. Recent CubeSat missions have demonstrated the platform\u2019s ability to form in-orbit networks. CubeSat Network (CSN) missions enable low-cost applications in coordinated sensing and low-bandwidth communications.\nThis work addresses a trade-off unique to CSNs. CubeSat satellite-to-ground (S2G) communication requires high levels of energy consumption to achieve data rates in the order of kilobytes per second. In comparison, CubeSats are capable of more energy efficient satellite-to-satellite (S2S) communication at rates an order of magnitude above those of S2G communication. This asymmetry underpins this work\u2019s trade-off of interest, that of CSN power use against S2G data throughput.\nRelevant areas of prior art are examined and specialized Medium Access Control (MAC) and routing protocols are proposed. This work\u2019s proposed protocols are developed alongside a simulation of a hypothetical CSN mission using the open-source network simulator, OMNeT++. Proposed MAC protocol energy saving features are shown to decrease CSN energy consumption without a reduction in S2G throughput. This work\u2019s proposed routing protocol introduces the energy sensitive election of a CubeSat dedicated to performing S2G communication. This election approach is shown to reduce the energy consumption of previously \u201cover-worked\u201d CubeSats. Additional adjustments to route discovery behaviour are required to ensure this approach does not reduce the overall energy efficiency of S2G communication.\n",

I wanted to reach researchers and companies to really get a feel for where I could fit into the industry. It was frustrating to talk to so many people who were disconnected from the larger Irish space community. I felt if only I could find that one central connection then I would find all the information and advice I desired. In reality there's really no one out there enabling Irish university students and graduates to engage in the Irish and European space industry. As such I decided to make a start by founding the Trinity Space Society. A society within my home university dedicated to promoting interest and activity in the all aspects of space science, technology and exploration. There are amazing opportunities out there for Irish university students to learn, develop and explore. I'm on a mission to create a thriving community for fellow students and graduates. ",

I began by building a virtual cloud on my laptop with OpenStack. This quickly transitioned to using several machines in ND academic compute cluster to develop my designs. I developed a basic scripting interface which would allow researchers to specify a Condor pool onto which to schedule jobs. The back-end could then make decisions about available capacity and if needs be use the micro-OpenStack cloud to provision resources on the fly for researchers.",
