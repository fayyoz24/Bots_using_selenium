He built up management skills through his directorship of the Netherlands Rural Youth Association and later as a Team Leader to several projects in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.\n\nAs a socioeconomic specialist, Mr. Walstra has gained wide experience in calculating benefits of irrigation facilities and in farm restructuring as well as facilitating policy- and institutional and empowering Farmers and Water Users Associations.\n\nAs socio-economist, in the framework of establishing Water Users Cooperatives in Kazakhstan, he realized  successfully cost-benefit analyses of irrigation improvement schemes. In the early nineties he was active in restructuring former cooperative farms and calculating their future possibilities to be profitable again.\nAs team leader and economist he analysed the agricultural policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the nineties of the previous century (EU-Tacis 1994-1995). Furthermore he provided institutional support to the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Cabinet of Ministers in the field of policy formulation. \nAs team leader he supported Associations of private Farmers in Uzbekistan (EU-Tacis 1997-1999) in their efforts to raise farmer income with support in policy matters and in setting up an extension service.\nMr. Walstra gained tremendous experience in empowering young farmers groups during the eighties through his work as a staff member of the Dutch Young Farmers Association, an organisation that can be regarded as a co-inventor of a participatory approach in long-term planning in The Netherlands.\n\nThrough his many working visits to the (former) Soviet states (Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and other NIS countries), Mr. Walstra has gained key insight in the (former) social system and its implications for the sector and its developments today.",
