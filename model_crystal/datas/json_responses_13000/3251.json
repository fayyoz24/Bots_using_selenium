    "summary": "I'm taking agility back to its roots, beyond models and frameworks. True agility means being agile according to your own standards, regardless of outer references and models, where human intelligence is the central agency of agility. True agility takes your unique organisation as starting-point and goes beyond models and methodologies. \n\nDuring my 10 year experience in the Information Communication Technology industry, I've had the opportunity to embody a plethora of roles and responsibilities. My talent is to see what is working and what isn't, pointing this out with direct and clear language and igniting the change leading to growth on whatever scale. \n\nhttps://www.organite.nl/",
