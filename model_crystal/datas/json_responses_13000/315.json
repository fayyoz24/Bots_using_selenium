    "summary": "Analyst, author, commentator and speaker with twelve books to my name, including three for Oxford University Press (and about to publish my third for Oxford \"Future War and the Defence of Europe), My job is to speak truth unto power in an age when the gap between power, people and politics is growing dangerously wide.  My focus is the tension between strategy and politics with an emphasis on security and defence policy.  My analysis is the product of many years policy and practitioner experience, allied to long and deep research.  Sadly, I also support Sheffield United Football Club - the triumph of endless hope over long, hard, and painful experience!\n\n\nForthcoming Book:\n\nNATO: The Enduring Alliance 3rd edition (Routledge: London)\n\nLatest Book\n\nFuture War and the Defence of Europe (Oxford University Press English Edition and Kosmos Press German Edition)\n\nRecent Books:\n\n2017: The Geopolitics of Terror - Demons and Dragons (Routledge)\n2015: NATO: The Enduring Alliance 2015 (Routledge)\n2015: Little Britain: Twenty-First Century Strategy for a Middling European Power ( 2nd and paperback edition) (Amazon)\n2014; The Oxford Handbook of War (paperback edition) (Oxford University Press)\n2014: Little Britain: Twenty-First Century Strategy for a Middling European Power (Kindle e-book) \n2012: The Oxford Handbook of War (Oxford University Press)\n2007: A Chronology of European Security and Defence (Oxford University Press)\n2007; NATO: The Enduring Alliance 2007 (Routledge)\n2003: Terms of Engagement  (EUISS)\n1998:  Coalitions & the Future of Security Policy",
