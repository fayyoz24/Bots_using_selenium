I work with highly experienced Chinese crewmembers and artists, and together we have the best resources allowing you to bridge the gap between East and West, including access to Chinese copy-editors and opportunities to outsource part of the video production- or translation process to China, optimizing your branding for your target audience while utilizing the most economic resources.",
