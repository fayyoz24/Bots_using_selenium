I was responsible for performing measurements on a model vortex cell using techniques such as Laser-Doppler Anemometry, Particle Image Velocimetry, MEMS wall shear measurements and Continuous Temperature Anemometry. The results were used to validate numerical simulations and were presented at international conferences. The work lead to several refereed journal papers in Experiments in Fluids and the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.",

I developed a new measurement technique to measure the surface slope, was responsible for the design of a so-called active grid used to generate turbulence in the experiments, and performed measurements using Particle Image Velocimetry and Laser Doppler Velocimetry. I also developed a mathematical description of the statistical properties of isotropic free surface distortions. The results were presented at several international conferences and lead to a number of refereed Journal publications, including in Physical Review Letters and the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.",
