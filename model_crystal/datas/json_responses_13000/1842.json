In her new album \u2018Ke Haber\u2019 (What\u2019s New) she captures the spirit of the ancient, matriarchal language and culture and propels it into the 21st century with socially pertinent lyrics, celebrating migration, gender and female empowerment. \n\nThe soundscape bridges over tradition and modern life, capturing the sounds and smells of the marketplace and fuses them with raw, flamenco like vocals and surprising instrumentations. Soft choral-like trombones embellish mariachi guitars & percussion with glimpses of piano & cello tracks, make this record a magical realistic mosaic.

Forbidden by her father to speak Ladino, the only means for Noam to communicate with her grandmother was through singing. After performing in Tanjazz festival, Morocco, Noam took the opportunity to visit Fez, her grandmother\u2019s home town. During a walk down the narrow streets of the old town she heard a familiar tune being sung nearby. Following the sound she arrived at a square where hundreds of people were singing a song her grandmother used to sing to her as a child. Noam felt she arrived at an inner root that was waiting to be discovered and started a year long research to find out more about Ladino music. Throughout the album a magical atmosphere is set, featuring Noam\u2019s haunting vocals. In contrast to her previous albums, here Noam explores her alto range, giving a warm, deep feeling which illustrates her personal connection to the songs. The innovative arrangements present a scented brew of Middle Eastern music,   North   African   beats   &   Jazz   and   the   result   is   a   gorgeous,   fascinating   new   sound.",
