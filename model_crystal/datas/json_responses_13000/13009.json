I joined 100WEEKS in their Marketing, Communication and Fundraising team. My personal mission is to grow and diversify the individual donor base of 100WEEKS (with a focus on middle-major donors) and to deepen the engagement throughout the donor journey. \n\nFundraising might sound, to some people, like a surprising turn in my career trajectory. Yet, it presents the perfect opportunity to tie together my most valuable skills in communication and management consulting. Communicating with impact and strategic intent to drive the growth of the 100WEEKS private donor base, supported by a digital journey that underpins both a unique experience for donors and a data-driven approach to deliver insights.\n\n100WEEKS is an innovative direct cash giving international NGO addressing extreme poverty in rural communities in Rwanda, Ghana, Uganda and Ivory Coast. They invest in women's entrepreneurship to lift whole communities out of entrenched poverty. By giving unconditional cash directly to selected groups of women for 100 weeks, providing them with training and access to a saving and loan fund.",
