    "summary": "As a branding aficionado with a passion for creating impactful brand experiences, I'm dedicated to helping businesses build and elevate their brand identities. With 13 years of experience in branding, marketing, sales, and repositioning, I've honed my skills in developing successful branding strategies that resonate with target audiences and drive business growth.\n\nMy unique approach to branding is rooted in the belief that great branding is not just about creating a pretty logo or a catchy slogan, but rather about crafting an authentic and meaningful story that truly connects with customers. As a branding expert and IT leader, I have a knack for leveraging technology to uncover the unique essence of a business and using that insight to create compelling brand stories that inspire and engage.\n\nMy expertise in marketing and sales allows me to understand the needs and desires of customers, and use that knowledge to develop effective branding strategies that truly speak to them. I'm also experienced in repositioning brands that may have lost their way, giving them new life and relevance in today's ever-changing market.\n\nThroughout my experience, I've worked with businesses of all sizes and industries to establish and grow their brand identities through innovative marketing campaigns and strategic branding initiatives. At the same time, my expertise in IT has allowed me to lead successful technology projects that improve business operations, increase efficiency, and enhance customer experiences.\n\nHighly organized, methodical and skilled at building consensus across high-performance teams.",
