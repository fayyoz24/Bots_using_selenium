    "summary": "As a translator I convey messages across languages and cultures and connect people. I have been always passionate about languages, cultures and travelling. I have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. \nMy Bachelor degree is in Technical Translation (from/into English, Latvian and Russian). During my Bachelor I made an exchange program in University of Alicante at the faculty of Translation and Communication. Later on, I completed Master's in English Language and Culture at Vrije University of Amsterdam. \nI have got a vast experience in general and business translation, as well as translating promotional leaflets for hotels. I have been actively working as an interpreter for international business clients at business negotiations and presentations, as well as big fairs such as ISE and METS. My main working language pair is Russian and English. I also offer customised solutions for business clients such as combining business and local tours in the Netherlands.",
