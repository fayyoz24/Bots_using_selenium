On the day of the final event the seven most innovative ideas have been pitched in front of a jury and an audience, and at the end of the day the winners were selected. After the event, all of the seven ideas that were presented at the final event have been developed further with help of the Boskalis Research & Development Department.\n \nIn light of the success of the BIC 2014, it is decided to organize a new Boskalis Innovation Challenge in 2015. This year the goal will not only be to receive as much valuable and innovative ideas as possible. The aim is also to facilitate participation and interaction between as many colleagues as possible in developing the different ideas leading up to the final event. \n\n",

(Woodside), in its capacity as operator of the Scarborough Joint Venture, potentially carries a value of EUR 145 million if all options are called and is subject to a final investment decision which is expected in 2020. The preparatory activities for this multidisciplinary project have commenced recently. The seabed intervention and shore crossing works are scheduled to start in March 2021 with an expected completion mid-2022. The scope of activities includes the pre-trenching of the nearshore pipeline route along a 50 kilometers section, offshore deep water excavation works, pre-lay and post-lay rock installation for pipeline and fiber optic cable crossings, the post installation burial and other protection works to ensure the stability of the pipeline. Support for the shore crossing to the onshore processing facility on the Burrup Peninsula as well as rock supply are also part of the contract. Boskalis will work to make best use of local content, based on capability and competitiveness, for the delivery of its scope of work. \n\nBoskalis will deploy a wide variety of its in-house specialist expertise and equipment including a trailing suction hopper dredger, a backhoe dredger, a dynamically positioned fallpipe vessel and rock installation vessel, survey vessels and an offshore construction vessel. \n\nThe Scarborough gas field is situated approximately 375 kilometers offshore the Burrup Peninsula in North West Australia. The proposed export pipeline will transport natural gas between the Scarborough Floating Production Unit and the onshore processing plant. Woodside\u2019s preferred development option is to process the Scarborough gas through a brownfield expansion of Pluto LNG.",
