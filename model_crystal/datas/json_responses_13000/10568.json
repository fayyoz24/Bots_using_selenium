    "summary": "Have you ever read a blog post that engaged you at every sentence and married you at the end of its last word? \n\nWell you are about to! \n\nI am that writer that holds your audience\u2019s hands and captivates them while moving them to meaningful action. \n\nMy skills are vast, but my focus is very clear: to create proven focused content in English with words as fierce as Beyonce. \n\nI cover four main areas;\nBlog writing\nGuest posting/ link building\nVoice over recording for documentaries and commercials \nEditorial content for news websites and traditional print newspapers or magazines. \n\nI work a little differently to your traditional freelance writer; while I offer bespoke projects and work monthly for a handful of brands, magazines, and bloggers, I\u2019m not here to just offer good spelling, grammar, and syntax. \n\nI want to ensure that your ideas and the 'big picture' are being communicated effectively.\n\n\nGUEST POST & LINK BUILDING OUTREACH \n\nI have the privilege to guest post on high authority sites and can help you with your link-building. \n\nI write and post an article with a relevant, contextual link to your website, using a suitable anchor text. I use a few other links to authority sites (not your competitors\u2019 sites) to make everything look professional and natural. \n\nLink-building helps to build your authority, improve your SEO and amplify your content.\n\n\nNEWS WRITING\nI have 12 years of experience as a Journalist. For most of it, I reported for media houses in Germany, the USA, South Africa, Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. I can help you gather news, interview sources and craft both hard news and feature stories that are relevant, educative and informative. \n\nHere is exactly what you will get from me\n\n\nI GUARANTEE; \n\n\u2714 You'll get content that is conversational and appealing to your readers \n\n\u2714 I work with a partner that edits and revises all content So, if my content doesn't leave you fascinated, tell me where you need it improved and we will revise it to your satisfaction. \n\n\u2714 If you need a news story or a news idea for your website/newspaper/Magazine, I will send you a complete story pitch. I will identify sources for an interview, conduct the interviews and write the news story just like in a traditional newsroom setting. \n\n\u2714 I promise 100% confidentiality. Your content is under your rights and won't be shared anywhere else \n\n\u2714 You get your work delivered on time, not even a second late.",
