    "summary": "For the last 5 years I am manager in the energy sector. Now I am Head of Corporate Governance of DTEK Group. \n\nBefore this appointment I was responsible for the legal function of the electricity distribution business, its regulatory and anti-corruption compliance. I also took care to ensure that land under newly-built power facilities is allotted quickly and in time, and these newly-built power facilities receive title deeds. But that`s not all I did for the company. Throughout my work at DTEK GRIDS, I have built business processes from scratch and implemented projects that bring DTEK GRIDS closer to the international standarts of grid companies. My contribution is that DTEK GRIDS has successfully completed and complies with international standarts of unbundling. My thesis project on Executive MBA program was also aimed at developing an innovative solution that allows predictive control of the voltage in the grid to provide our customers with stable voltage in their homes.      \n\nOur electricity distribution business consist of 7 operating companies (distribution system operators in Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Odessa, Kyiv regions and the city of Kyiv) and 2 service companies. Thus, I ensure its sustainability through membership in the Supervisory Boards, Risk & Finance Committee, Purchasing Commission. I am also inspiring leader of the team numbering more than 150 people.     \n\nBefore I joined the DTEK GRIDS management team, I was corporate governace manager in DTEK Headquarters. I have 6 years of experience in building and administration of different corporate governance models in Ukrainian, Russian, British, Dutch, Swiss, Cyprus companies. I know how to establish company and create its governance system from scratch. I can share my experience of using golden shares, joint venture, M&A and other instruments of corporate structuring. I can confidently say that I am a high-class professional in the field of corporate governace of multy-national holdings. \n\nI have 14 years of legal experience in Banking, Corporate Finance, Corporate Governance, listing on Stock Exchanges (London, Irish), Contract law, M&A, Litigations, Energy Law, etc. My experience in the private banking sector has shaped my systemic and analytical thinking skills and sparked an interest in companies that create real value for society. This served as an impetus in my further career  and formed the basic principles of work and networking.",
