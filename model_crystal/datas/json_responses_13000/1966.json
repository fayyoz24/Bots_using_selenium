    "summary": "Experienced Petroleum Engineer responsible for enhancing the ultimate recovery (UR) and the net present value (NPV) for our oil and gas fields. Reserves and resources reporting as per PRMS guidelines. Led several Field Development Plans (FDP) for gas, gas condensate and oil fields. Responsible for the design and execution of data acquisition program, surveillance, monitoring, optimization and depletion strategies. Led and participated in various multidisciplinary reservoir studies, which includes geo-modeling, petrophysics, simulation (Eclipse, Petrel, T-navigator: Compositional and black-oil modeling), reserves estimate and decision analysis for various gas, gas condensate and oil fields. Involved in field development projects as a lead member of multidisciplinary team for various gas fields in North Sea. Experienced in EOR analysis, design and modeling. Practical experience in conducting PVT, SCAL and formation damage experiments. Responsible as a Lead internal auditor (ISO 45001) to review inhouse process and procedures.\nGiven short course and presentation on PVT, SCAL experiments and modeling to multidisciplinary group. Led multiple projects from select to execution phase in time and within budget for our gas fields.   \n\n\nSpecialties: Eclipse (Reservoir simulation, E100 and E300)\nPVT analysis & modeling (PVTi, PVTSIM)\nPetroleum Experts Suite (MBAL, PROSPER, GAP)\nFekette Harmony DCA analysis",
