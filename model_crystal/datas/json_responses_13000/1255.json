    "summary": "For my latest job experience as Hydrologist,  and Geohydrologist at Arcadis Use of knowledge in the field of hydrogeology and geohydrology. My experience in surface water and groundwater monitoring (data processing analysis). My specialism lies in geohydrological studies in which I use subsurface data such as drillings, probes, groundwater levels and groundwater analysis results to visualize the local situation and processes. Using a 3D-Model (CSM) conceptual site model to describe and visualize the correct translation in clear advice\nMy experience of working in this field and my findings about the earth are completely fascinating I have completed my education with a major in geology with different courses like Hydrology and Engineering I posses the ability to be in the field for conducting surveys.\nDuring my time in Utrecht University and UNESCO-IHE. I had the opportunity to do classes, field work, and research in Netherland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Switzland.\u00a0 It was an excellent way to experience these countries and put what i learn in the classroom into context.\u00a0 \n My experience has been diverse and challenging. I have worked as a hydrogeology supervisor at an International organization I believe that it possess some positive qualifications, creative thinking and the application of recent approaches.\nSummary of research and skills \n*Using ground-Water flow model, MODFLOW to simulate fluid flows with  MT3DMS  model to simulate solute transport which is an important tool that aids in the analysis of ground-water contamination problems.\n* Modeling flow and solute transport in tank experiments.\n*Estimation of ground water recharge and evaporation in Wadi Madoneh in Jordan.\nWithout following of any law study i got all knowldge in dutch law reagarding forigners law.Everything about assesment of assylum procedre by minstry of imigration & Dutch courts ,familiy reunification ,appeals & human rights law.",
