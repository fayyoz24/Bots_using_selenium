    "summary": "Having finished a Master degree at Utrecht University in Earth Structure and Dynamics I am actively looking for job opportunities as a geologist, geophysicist or geotechnical engineer mainly in the energy sector ( ie geothermal energy, CO2 storage or oil and gas fields) or other relevant to my studies job positions.\n\nRegarding my studies, during MSc studies, I followed a course for unconventional geo-resources which made me motivated to pursue a career in this field. For that reason, I am looking actively for full-time job opportunities in the sector of Energy as Geologist/ Geophysicist and optimally in Geothermal and Oil and Gas Exploration, or CO2 storage.\n\nMy thesis project was on researching Intra-oceanic subduction initiation with analogue modeling techniques which provided with important scientific and technical skills such as the use of laboratory equipment, process, analysis, documentation and interpretation of results with computer software. Subsequently, I started a research project on the exploration of Geothermal resource potential in mainland Greece developing a numerical model of the thermal structure of the Greek lithosphere. This was achieved by modelling the 3D geological structure of the area and use it as input for the thermal model.  During this project, I familiarized myself with the use of two different numerical modelling software. \n\nDuring my Bachelor in Geology department at the University of Athens, I did an Internship at the National Observatory of Athens having the opportunity to get an insight into how geological research in the field of Tectonics and Geodynamics works. Furthermore, I have worked along with Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL) team for 2 years after Bachelor graduation, contributing to several field expeditions in North Peloponnese, Greece for GPS and Seismic data acquisition   \n\nI describe myself as a committed and highly motivated scientist. Being curious, competitive, independent and seeking to expand my knowledge and skills are a few of my natural traits. I have good Fieldwork skills mainly obtained from the geological mapping of an area in Southern Greece as part of my BSc Thesis as well as spending 4 weeks in Spain collecting data for investigating the tectonic history and Inversion of Sorbas Basin in Almeria in June 2018 as part of one of my MSc courses. Throughout these projects, I learned to make meaningful interpretations of geological structures in the field and also of microstructures of rock samples to infer the deformation history of an area.\n\n          \n\n         ",

            "description": "Subduction is key for driving for plate tectonics. Yet it is still unclear where and how subduction initiates in the oceanic domain. It is widely accepted that it critically depends on the rheology of the oceanic lithosphere (Nikolaeve et al., 2010) and can occur upon failure of the load-bearing crustal and mantle layers. When oceanic lithosphere is too strong, high shear strength of the oceanic lithosphere does not permit failure, and subduction may occur by deforming a passive margin at ocean-continent transition.  However, weakening processes such as zones of serpentinized mantle may affect the strain localization (Maffione et al., 2015; Stern, 2004). Therefore, a series of experiments conducted to determine the favourable rheological and kinematic conditions that lead to the development of subduction zones in the intra-oceanic domain. These experiments involving both oceanic and continental domains which incorporate weak zones of realistic dimensions in the oceanic crust. Model results show that the key factor for the strain localisation is the difference in strength between the continental and oceanic upper crust. Analysis of deformation is used to define a boundary of rheological conditions enabling subduction in oceanic or in continental domain. Additionally, addition of a weak zones in a thick and strong oceanic lithosphere doesn\u2019t affect the deformation pattern. However, presence of a weak zone in a relatively younger oceanic lithosphere (60 \u00b1 10 My) may induce strain localization in the oceanic crust rather than at passive margin.   This shows the importance of geological inheritance and thermo-mechanical feed-backs for the locus and evolution of subduction zone. ",
