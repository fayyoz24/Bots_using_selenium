Our team has been formed and surrounding ecological systems will evolve towards circularity, re-use and upcycling as we are forming partnerships with universities in the Netherlands and Rwanda, along the way as Red Rocks Initiative for sustainable development is our connection with the community in Rwanda.\n\nFrom the coffee industry into community development, but we still have a long way ahead. Anyone who is interested is welcome to join us, please get in touch with one of our team members or connect through LinkedIn.",

Within my role as initiator, Red Rocks has provided me with new ways to learn and overcome challenges as we engage with the environment. \n\nAvailability of natural resources (e.g. drinking water) and industrial processes (coffee, agriculture) have a great impact on the wellbeing of Rwandan communities. Red Rocks Initiatives for sustainable development has formed a partnership with Brewanda and as Initator, I created and used this initiative to engage eco-tourism with the coffee-farming community. Most important topics are job creation (investing in youth) and women empowerment (gender equality). \nRwanda has some of the best coffees this planet has to offer. The absence of, or elimination of plastic in the process is a best practice to show the world alternative options on industry standards. We look forward to join local institutions and international collaborations on our quest for more and better access to reduce, reuse and most importantly, reconnect to nature and indigenous tribes that help us source this product and share it with connoisseurs all over the world.",
