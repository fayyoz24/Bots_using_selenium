In our projects we concentrate on healthcare, community-based rehabilitation, prevention of disability, advocacy, capacity building, education, stigma reduction and occasionally on disaster response and preparedness. Leprosy is not understood by most communities and as a result people are fearful of it, which means those affected by leprosy are often stigmatised.\n\nWe want to see a leprosy-free world. Our vision is for \u2018leprosy defeated, lives transformed\u2019. This is why our main focus is on leprosy, however, our work often includes other people with disabilities, other neglected tropical diseases, other marginalised people in society, and those living in extreme poverty.\n\nAround the world we have about 2,000 staff and implement or support about 200 projects in 18 countries. The largest number of projects is in India, but there are also a significant number in Bangladesh, Chad, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Nepal.",
