    "summary": "During the past year I have worked as HR/Administrative Assistant in one of the biggest Company within the Aerospace Industry. Thus, my competences portfolio includes all those functions used on a daily basis within most offices.\nAmong my strengths, I am particularly proud of my ability to take care of customers, skill that I have refined during many years working as shop manager. I also used this skill daily for my other activity, teaching.\nI am used to teach languages in my spare time. My attention to customers let me understand the specific needs of my students, so  I can plan a tailored studying program for each of them. Customer satisfaction is of primary importance to me, and my drive makes me not just reaching specific objectives but I strive to exceed customer expectations over the quality output of my work.\nOther strengths are definitively communication and team work, but I am also capable of working on my own. A humble and hard worker who is not afraid of new challenges.",
