    "summary": "I thrived in a small country receiving a well-respected education in Mathematics and Computer Science from an early age. Deepen analytically and filled with a desire in learning modern languages has helped me develop my critical understanding of the world by pushing the boundaries of my everyday communication to the next level, and later on - my international career journey.\n\nFlexibility, cooperation, and efficiency are prioritized personal characteristics to me, and the balance they bring within has always grabbed my attention in the business world. Having the opportunity to engage professionally in different industries while pursuing a Bachelor's in specialization Luxury Sales, Services, and Marketing provided me with the necessary analytical skills such as project management, creative problem-solving, and overall expertise to understand with excellence the CRM journey.\n\nThe positions obtained mainly related to the field of Client Relations for the luxury segment encouraged me to understand the niche market at a more profound level, create my own professional approach to connecting with other business individuals and implement outstanding punctuality and creativity to increase customer satisfaction for HNW and UHNW individuals.\n\nToday, I would like to describe myself as a global thinker. An individual with ideals, and ideas looking forward to setting their Customer Relationship Management career path.",
