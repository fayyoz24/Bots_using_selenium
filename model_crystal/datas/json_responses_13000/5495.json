                    "description": "As a Test Coordinator / Engineer I\u2019ve worked here at the Internet department on 8 projects/releases since the beginning of 2011. At that point there was basically no test team and no structured means of working. I actively worked on building / structuring the test team according to the TMAP method, making it a professional and efficient team that delivers a better quality end product to KPN/Telfort customers. \n\nTasks:\n\n-Mapping the Telfort Internet Test Environment Systems and interface (complete architecture);\n-Setting up the Master Test Plan, Detail Test Plan, Test Effort Estimation and the Test Planning;\n-Reviewing the Business Requirements & FD's and advising about improvements;\n-Reviewing and estimating RFC\u2019s;\n-Setting up templates for new projects;\n-Setting up and reviewing the System Test (ST), Functional Acceptance Test (FAT), System Integration Test (SIT) and User Acceptance Test (UAT);\n-Searching and preparation of test data;\n-Coordinating and executing the ST, FAT, SIT, UAT and Regression Test;\n-Coordinating and registration of defects in Jira, Mantis and Bugzilla;\n-Setting up the \u2018Summery Report\u2019;\n-Setting up the Sanity Test script for the GO live moment;\n-Coordinating and executing the Sanity Test script during GO live moment;\n-Coordinating and guiding new testers;\n-Communication with Project Managers, KPN, KPN NSO, Tiscali (Italy), HP, etc.;\n\nDuring the last two years I\u2019ve worked on successful releases of VDSL, Interactive Television, new Internet subscriptions and new VOIP products. Aside from that, substantial improvements to all business processes were made. \n\nTwo other projects I worked on, one in which within Telfort Mobile new or existing customers were given the opportunity to lease a mobile telephone. At the time this new proposition was completely new within the Dutch Telecom. The other project was Mail Migration project in which all the customer mail accounts were transferred from Tiscali Italy towards KPN.",
