    "summary": "Hi there! I am a Sports Design Engineer with a passion for sports and sports products. I hold a MEng degree with Merit (2:1) from the University of Strathclyde, where I developed a variety of traits that are beneficial for product creation on a very technical level. My levels of inspiration and creativity have significantly increased through working with various companies and clients, and I believe I have the necessary tools and ideas to make an impact with my passion for the brand, sneakers, and willingness to learn.\n\nCurrently, I work as an EKIN, where I educate store athletes about the amazing products we have, create content, share knowledge, and manage cross-functional projects consistently. I bring my own creative spin to each project to ensure that each one is different from the rest. My role also involves creating storyboards and scripts, on-camera work, product deep-dives, and providing product inspiration while seeing all aspects of the business. One of my notable projects was creating an EKIN TV for SP23 AJ37 Low, deep-diving product tech and details to our Firstline.\n\nBefore joining EKIN, I worked at the Nike Store in Glasgow for almost three years, where I learned a lot about Nike and grew my passion for the brand as a brand ambassador, not just wearing the clothes and shoes. As the Basketball and Jordan Specialist, I delivered premium service to consumers, understood what they wanted, and provided the best service possible.\n\nAlong with four other friends, I co-founded Kleurstof Apparel, a clothing brand with a mission to produce more sustainable fashion products than exploitative fast fashion, with our own unique design aspects. As a start-up company, we carry out a lot of the labour ourselves, which involves doing our own social media interactions, marketing, designs, and financing. High use of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create designs and marketing content to a high standard, but also drawing/sketching ideas.\n\nI have strong technical and project management skills, including content creation/editing, stakeholder management, budget management, and teamwork. I have excellent communication skills, and my ability to speak multiple languages fluently (English and French) and conversationally (Spanish) has been pivotal in working with many different cultures and people.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy expressing myself creatively through various means such as drawing, sculpting, and cooking. I also love to play basketball, go to the gym, golf, and travel to explore the world and learn about new cultures.",
