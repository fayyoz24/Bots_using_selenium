    "summary": "I currently work at Redivivus in The Hague, the Netherlands. I recently finished a year-long fellowship at the Mauritshuis as the Fulbright Fellow in paintings conservation. I completed my Postgraduate Diploma in the Conservation of Easel Paintings at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 2021. For my final year project I undertook research into Computed Tomography scanning for dendrochronology. I am particularly interested in the structural conservation of panel paintings and have been working toward this specialisation through my internship selections as well as taking supplementary courses in woodworking. I previously studied Historic Preservation at Pratt Institute, and Fine Art and History of Art at Stony Brook University.",
