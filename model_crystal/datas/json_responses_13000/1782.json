Mr. Barton explains everything to his customers with basic concepts and step-by-step instructions.\n\nThe name Midas Will Fix IT comes from Greek mythology, from King Midas, everything he touched became gold. Mr. Barton is often told that he has the 'Touch of Midas' when it comes to computers and he can do almost anything with computers quickly and professionally. The company name sounds like 'might as well fix it' which is also a central principle within the company, Mr. Barton moreover fixes the problem instead of resetting the computer in its entirety, this so that you can quickly pick up work where you left off.\n\n'A computer remains a computer' which is why Mr. Barton breathes new life into computers to build rich and powerful servers. In this fashion Mr. Barton can easily create a webshop with any computer, making the computer that he 'touches' a money making machine, figuratively 'gold'. In this way you can also easily host your own website, share files, build an E-mail server, build a media center, a router, a telephone exchange and much more.\n\nMidas Will Fix IT has helped over 100 individuals. Please see his site for more references.",

Shortly after the move, I handled the abundant service requests coming in, also for 3 other sites, and have been trying to keep the IT infra afloat for roughly 150+ employees. I've helped 2 sites with massive migrations during which I helped facilitate all network infra from setting up the WiFi connections, workplaces and telephones to the e-mail, file, print and phone servers and all the new colored and organised wiring. After successfully prioritizing and finishing bare necessities, I started to determine future projects including setting up the phone system in a more robust way, standardizing PC installations and cleaning up network access groups/levels throughout Atlas Copco Netherlands. For a System's Administrator this is not the most challenging function but the people are great, extremely happy with me and I'm becoming quite the Lotus Notes expert.",

One of the core components to Retail Management was to coordinate HardWare Refresh; a program to liaise among Fujitsu, Atos, ACS and Torex employees to coordinate the upgrade of all store hardware over night. I had to keep files up to date and in sync (robocopy, Altiris), and sometimes handle smaller IT issues such as fixing Traffic Counters and Cash Registers. In my short time here, I picked up the system quickly and even solved a small amount of ongoing colossal failures. This was also one of my favorite positions given the international nature of the company combined with the driving health aspects of working at a multinational sports and health concern.",
