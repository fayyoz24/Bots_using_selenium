    "summary": "I'm a communications leader with over 20 years of experience as a broadcast journalist, entrepreneur and executive. Armed with relentless curiosity, learning agility, and the ability to synthesize complex information into compelling narratives, I'm able to engage diverse stakeholders and consistently drive business value across roles and industries.\n\nI currently serve as Director Global Communications at Heineken N.V. responsible for providing the strategic direction and execution of external and internal comms. I lead a dynamic team driving corporate and financial comms, sustainability comms, issues and crisis comms, reputation research, leadership and employee engagement, brand PR and storytelling. \n\nFormerly, Executive Director of Chief Executive 50, Communications 50 and Finance 50 at World 50, I facilitated private communities for CEOs, Chief Communications Officers and Finance Officers from the world's biggest companies respectively.  In this role, I successfully built communities, made critical business connections, created environments for peer-to-peer learning and convened world-class gatherings.\n\nWith domain expertise at the nexus of communications and sustainability, I have been entrusted by corporations, governments and NGOs to bring energy, insight and international perspective to conferences and events as emcee. An accomplished moderator, my ability to ask incisive questions, improvise in the moment and include the audience, results in expertly guided conversations.\n\nPrior to joining World 50, I was Founder and CEO of Future360, a digital platform with a mission to educate audiences on the game-changing potential of clean technology and sustainable innovation. A former TV host, producer and journalist with 15 years of experience, I have credits on CNBC, BBC, PBS, Fine Living, Discovery Channel, Planet Green and Al Gore\u2019s 24 Hours of Reality.",
