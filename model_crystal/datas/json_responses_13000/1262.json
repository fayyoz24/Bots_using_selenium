    "summary": "I am a passionate researcher and a global citizen. I pursued my education in civil engineering with an interdisciplinary curriculum and particular emphasis on structural, geotechnical and hydraulic engineering. This is because one of my long term goals is becoming a designer of mass-transport-infrastructures, and because of the intensifying use of underground space in growing urban environments. I am interested in the underlying physical mechanisms ruling the coupled behavior of modern structures and their surroundings. For me it is all about understanding, modelling, monitoring and repeating by using information era tools. I have 4 years of experience specializing in the back-end development and validation of a Material Point Method fortran code for underwater slopes stability.",
