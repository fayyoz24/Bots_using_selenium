    "summary": "I have 23 years experience which bridge knowledge and practice between research universities, international development and individual consultancies.\n\nI am an analytical and motivated professional with extensive experience in developing fundraising and business development strategies, setting up consortia for collaborative research projects and leading proposal development process between consortium partners. Strategies for international profiling of institutions (public and non-for profit) are my forte.\n\nMy passion lies in reading strategies, research and project portfolios of different partners from different sectors, analyzing and mapping them with grant-givers. Thinking on research uptake as a way to develop the sustainability of research results is yet another element of my daily work which I do enjoy thinking along with lecturers and researchers while they are developing their proposals.\n\nFurther, I am dedicated to capacity-building of different target groups on creation of networks and consortium for collaborative research projects, on project proposal writing and project cycle management.\n\nI derive a lot of satisfaction from reading and giving feedback on research proposals as well as on evaluating collaborative research projects either for European Commission Programs or other Research Funding Institutes in Europe.\n\nDemonstrated success in managing projects and coordinating research, conducting research, collecting and analyzing data, solving problems, and communicating those results clearly to different audiences. \n\nDuring my research years (research master, PhD and Post-doc) my research interests were focused in: governing of service delivery in low (Sub-Saharan Africa - DRC) and middle income countries (Western Balkans - Albania); welfare and reconciliation policies in Europe, family planning and intergenerational division of child-care in extended families in the former communist EE Block and DRC, and gender and international development.",

In this multi-functional day, the invitants played football with representatives from other communities, tasted the Albanian culinaries, visited a book fair, visited the exhibitions of Albanian painters Eduard Bace and Arjeta Mala. Moreover the Albanian painter with an International fame Shefqet Avdush Emini offered painting workshops for children and adults during this day and Mr. Vranovcki showed a historical documentary for Albania. A group of Albanian dancers from \"Vatra\" association in Belgium, were invited to dance in this event.\n\nDuring this period I organized the 'Albanian Women of Kosovo' in meeting groups to discuss about women`s rights in Albania and in Kosovo and to celebrate together the International Women`s Day."
