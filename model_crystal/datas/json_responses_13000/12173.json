    "summary": "I successfully completed my studies in secondary education with 'Distinction' and BSc and MSc in Chemistry (Hons). I acquired knowledge about all different fields of Chemistry and I showed an exceptional interest in Inorganic and Analytical. The title of my BSc thesis was \u201cCarbonates and crystalline compounds they form with Na+ and NH4+, and Vanadium (IV/V) as a catalyst\u201d. \n\nMy studies in MSc Analytical Science for Industry at King's College London encouraged my interest in the field. I was instructed about the most modern analytical techniques applied in the industry and laboratories worldwide. Among advanced analytical techniques such as GC-MS and HPLC-MS, including all different types of mass analyzer and modes of ionization in mass spectrometry, I was also taught about emerging technologies, such as point of care testing, supercritical fluid chromatography, ICP-MS, orbitrap, lab-on-a-chip and micro-fluidics, evaporative light scattering detection, as well as immunoassay, ion pairing chromatography and electrophoresis. My MSc thesis was focused on hand dishwashing liquids and I studied their effects on glass surfaces by coupling Liquid Chromatography to Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) at Procter & Gamble and their Brussels Innovation Centre. \n\nI then completed my PGCE in Science (with a focus on Chemistry) and I was rated as 'Outstanding'. I was lucky enough to complete both of my school placements in 'Outstanding' Inner London schools, which helped me with developing the following skills up to a very high standard: lesson planning, behaviour management, use of literacy in science, assessment for learning and differentiation. I am passionate about Chemistry and thoroughly enjoy teaching it. My students, both in school and in one-to-one sessions, are of various abilities and as such I have developed methods that aim to stretch the more able, as well as support less able students through scaffolding to achieve their full potential. \n\nI know that every student has a different way of learning and therefore adapt my lessons accordingly and have a wealth of resources for all levels. I am well versed in teaching Science at Key Stage 3, as well as 11+ (\u2018Common Entrance\u2019), GCSE, and A-level. My strongest assets are deep subject knowledge as well as the ability to build positive relationships with my students, teaching focused lessons whilst ensuring my students are enjoying their learning. Outside of the classroom, I am a very keen skier and I love to travel. Thank you for taking the time to read my bio.",
