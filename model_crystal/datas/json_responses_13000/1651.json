    "summary": "My career in healthcare has been one of excitement and growth. I've worked alongside physicians in the interventional radiology and cardiology spaces, supported them through training on the Allura and Azurion imaging systems and interventional tools. I have helped with the global marketing launch of the state-of-the-art Azurion and Azurion FlexArm systems and created training curriculums and materials for our application specialists around the world. Coming full circle I then worked in post-market surveillance supporting quality and regulatory to help keep our systems safe. \nMy focus now is in Idea-to-Market which allows me to have my hand in several bowls like Usability, User Research, Validation, Capability Development, and growing my passion of bringing ideas to life.",
