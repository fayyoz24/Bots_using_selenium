One project is a tall ship sailing school on the St. Lawrence River. Another is a whale-watching kayak adventure. Award participants also improve their physical fitness, volunteer in local organizations, and acquire new skills.\n\nYou can make a real difference by joining us on Wednesday, October 8 in support of these exciting projects. Our Inaugural Gold & Silver Gala will take place at the beautiful Birks flagship store on Ste. Catherine Street in downtown Montreal. Oliver Jones, Montreal\u2019s world-renowned jazz pianist, composer, and arranger, will perform live at what is sure to be an evening of incredible entertainment and delicious food at an opulent venue!\n\n"

Technion\u2019s over 610 faculty members include three Nobel Laureates.\n\nIn 2011, a successful  bid by a consortium of Cornell University and Technion led to the present estabishment of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Innovation Institute (JTCII) in New York City. This is the first time any Israeli university has moved into establishing a center of global advanced research in the United States. In 2013, this was followed by another 1st, with the decision to set up a collaborative institute of technology in China in the form of the Technion Guangdong Institute of Technology\u2019 (TGIT).\n\nTechnion City generally refers to the 1.2 square kilometer site located on the forested slopes of Mount Carmel and is comprised of over 300 buildings occupied by thousands of people every day. The Technion has two additional campuses. Its historic building in midtown Haifa now houses the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology and Space. The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine is located next to the sea in the neighborhood of Bat Galim, adjacent to Rambam Hospital, the largest medical center in Northern Israel."
