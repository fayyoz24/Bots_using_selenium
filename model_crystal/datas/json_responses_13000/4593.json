    "summary": "I am a Singaporean born and raised chef, based in Melbourne. I graduated with an Honors\u2019 degree in Food Science and Technology but decided to trade in my lab coat for chef whites. I have since worked in restaurants in Singapore and Australia, including Candlenut and Carlton Wine Room. In 2019, I published the cookbook Wet Market to Table to encourage young Singaporeans to return to the wet markets and to be excited by regional produce. The book became a national bestseller and is currently in its fourth print. The celebration and preservation of Singapore\u2019s food heritage being my passion, I launched Singapore Noodles in 2020 as a go-to destination for anyone to discover real Singaporean food.",

These rich cultural exchanges have now become a rarity \u2013 we live alongside one another, but do we really know our neighbour?\n\nSeasonings Magazine explores the ways in which food is not only an expression of our identity, but can also bring us together and establish common ground. Through recipes, stories, and deep-dives, we hope that you will feel a sense of interconnectedness and be inspired to venture outside of your comfort zone.\n\n+ Editor\n+ Photographer\n+ Writer",

As much as it is a celebration of regional produce, it also pays tribute to the people who run it and a way of life that is gradually phasing out. Sprinkled with a scattering of stories, the book provides information and modern recipes on how best to select, store, prepare and cook with 25 ingredients that are unique to the wet market.
