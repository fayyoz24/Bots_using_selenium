    "summary": "A Bachelor graduate in International Business Communication at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The IBC study is a multifaceted program that comprises preparation in the spheres of language, (business)communication and organization, as well as academic and research skills. My study track involved the mastering not only of English, but of German as well. Besides presenting me with a thorough overview of the specificities of the German business environment, Radboud University gave me the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Vienna, following German Philology. I believe that the knowledge of German language and culture, as well as the skills I acquired throughout my university studies would allow me to successfully integrate and effectively work for a German company. During the significant number of qualitative and quantitative research-related courses I followed at Radboud University, I obtained understanding of statistics and communication research methods, which would potentially give me the chance to work in the field of research as well. \nFurthermore, during my summer job (July-November, 2021) as a sales agent at Red Tape Solutions, Bulgaria, I enhanced my intercultural communication skills. I had the duty to sell our services to clients from all over the world through phone conversations. I was responsible for the clear and precise presentation of what the company offers, as well as for choosing which service fits a particular client best, according to their wishes and goals. Communicating with clients in English and German contributed to the further development of my foreign-language skills. Moreover, working as a brand representative for Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister allowed me to dive in the specificities of the fashion industry business and gain a more thorough face-to-face experience with clients in the store.\nCurrently, I am pursuing my Masters in Business Administration (with a focus on entrepreneurship and management in the creative industries) at University of Amsterdam.",
