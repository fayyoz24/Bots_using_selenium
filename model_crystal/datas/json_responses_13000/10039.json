    "summary": "Having worked 10+ years in government, corporate and non-profit (international) environments and with a background in hospitality, I found that making positive impact and making connections are my main drivers. On individual level and on a larger scale.\n\nI love to put in some hard work and thinking in order to get us where we want to be. Ideal combo for me is to be active on a strategic level and then roll up my sleeves to make those plans happen. Ideally I\u2019m teaming up with colleagues to achieve this and working actively with organizational stakeholders.\n\nI have a positive approach to whatever is put in front of me and have found that there's always a way to make it happen. From personal experience I know that with a positive attitude and the willingness to learn, one can be of value in any environment (in my case: aerospace, innovation, foreign investments, hospitality).\n\nAnd in general in life I'm aiming to be a reliable colleague, good daughter and friend, supportive partner and loving mum to my son.",
