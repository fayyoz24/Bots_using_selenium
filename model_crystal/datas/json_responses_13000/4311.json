    "summary": "I am a quantitative economist = I am a storyteller who uses data to help clients to understand economic relations.\n\nBeing a quantitative economist who provides evidence-based insights to clients means a lot of things. It means knowing how to grasp the key elements of the question at hand \u2013 after all, a model is just a simplification of reality. You also need to know how to build your model using data. In addition, you must be able to translate the quantitative insights from your model into key messages and recommendations that help your clients \u2013 here good communication skills are quite handing. Last, but not least, you need to be a good project manager to make sure that your findings reach your clients on time and according to their standards.\n\nSince the completion of my Ph.D. (a decade ago), I have been given the opportunity of working as a quantitative economist for several organisations (Cambridge Econometrics, UK; Ecorys, The Netherlands) on a variety of fields: labour market, housing, social domain, telecom, social accountability, energy, agriculture, environment, etc. \n\nIn 2018, I joined Wageningen Economic Research to focus on the delivery of market outlooks for the EU agri-food markets. This position also offers me plenty of opportunities for simulating forward-looking scenarios to provide insights to policy-makers in the Netherlands and the EU.  Some topics of my interest are: primary production, environmental impacts of agricultural activities and the bioeconomy among others. \n\nI have working experience in Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. My previous jobs also gave me a chance to work for short periods of time in Cyprus, Lithuania, the Dominican Republic, Jordan and Albania. \n\nSince I believe that communicating and disseminating your research outcomes is nearly as important as the actual findings, I have published more than 30 academic papers in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nSpecialties: Economic modelling, including impact assessment, scenario analysis, policy simulation and forecasting | Market outlooks | Data analysis | Research design | Project management | Report writing | Proposal writing | Analysis of multidisciplinary topics from an economic perspective | Creative thinking | Getting to the point \u2013 at work, this means identifying the important elements which drive the relations that I am analysing; in my private life, this means capturing the essence of what see through the illustrations that I sketch.",
