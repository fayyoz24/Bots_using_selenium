We assumed the role of key decision-makers, analysing the issue of nuclear proliferation and making predictions of future possible scenarios as well as what the UK\u2019s role should be in each specific context.\n\n\uf0d8\t As part of the Grand Challenges, every student has realized a piece of applied writing in the form of a Ministerial Submission. This task was fulfilled after an intense research-based learning, presenting our personal understanding of the issue we have been tackling during the week. \n\n\uf0d8\tAs students of Strategic Security, we had the great opportunity to further our personal \nknowledge attending lectures led by key guests such Rob Wainwright (Director of Europol), Sir Jon Day (Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee), and Sir Paul Newton (he retired as a Lieutenant General (3*) in 2012) followed by a Q&A. We gained a valuable insight into general security, re-evaluating my ideas in confronting the complex problems.  \n",

The project consisted in a 3-day workshop during which we worked on the importance of self-branding, networking, time-management, the concepts of power and assertiveness, defining our core values and strenghts as well as learning valuable techniques to deal with negative feelings that may inhibit our personal development.  \n\nWe also had the great opportunity to get inspired by strong and incredible women such as Barbara Harvey (Managing Director - Accenture), Vicky Wilkinson (RBS) and Caroline Birkby (Project Manger: Dynamics Global Domain - Microsoft).\nThe project will end with a half day workshop in April, where my group will deliver a Presentation about \"Tomorrow's Women\", followed by a mock interview",
