    "summary": "   Driven by advancing companies and institutions in their research and development in the life sciences. I have extensive experience in management of the routine lab environment as well as technology development from proof-of-concept to the commercialization phase. As a manager I focus on quality, budget and time lines and have an eye for the relevant details. Situational leadership is how I operate best. I am decisive when needed and delegate when necessary. I prefer to operate at the strategic level in an organization. Designing strategic direction with input from my colleagues to create the most optimal result give me energy.\n   I quickly grasp unmet needs to match those with real solutions and will always choose the one solution that serves the company best. Strong communications skills allow me to advocate and advance ideas and proposals at the senior management and board level. They have confidence in me and in what I present. Reliability, openness and trust are essential values to me.\n   My main motivation is to let people excel.\n\n\nSpecialties: \n-  Line management routine lab environment\n-  Scientific project management\n-  Customer/partner alliance management\n-  Molecular biology/biochemistry\n-  Extensive understanding of biological and technological concepts\n",
