    "summary": "I have had the pleasure to be involved in several exciting adventures:\n\nEDORADO B.V.\nHaving fun at the expense of damaging our planet with oil and emissions just doesn\u2019t feel right any more. Powerboats consume more than 10 times as much petrol as internal combustion cars. The advent of electric cars is showing that there is a solution. Edorado brings that technology to the world of powerboats. With a young multi-disciplinary team of developers, designers and engineers we crafted the world's first fully electric powerboat brand.\n\nFAR CHINA Ltd.\nSince 2007 FAR introduces new architecture and design solutions and acts as consultant for various international and governmental institutions. Its aim is to stimulate professional discussion on topics that are relevant for China, such as use of public space and sustainability. Main projects worked on and realised so far: City of Jining athletic stadium (icw LOGON), Eindhoven Nanjing Friendship Park, Dutch Culture Centre & City of Rotterdam pavilion 2010 World Expo.\n\nDUTCH DESIGN WORKSPACE Wfoe.\nIn 2010 I founded this incubator programme for the creative industry with strong support from the Dutch government. DDWS assists creative companies with their start in the challenging Chinese market. It offers a tailor made support plan, including shared office space, business development & PR support. Our incubation participants are carefully selected, based on passion and track record, in order to present a dream team for Chinese clients. As part of the program DDWS has been organizing a wide variety of re-occuring activities, projects and events.",
