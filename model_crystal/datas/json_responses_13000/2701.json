I spoke with museum directors across Europe to discuss, and commit their institutions to, the campaign which focused on exploring Europe's connection - past and present - to migration. From these discussions, I wrote a report detailing the extent to which various institutions were willing to be involved and also where difficulties may arise within specific areas. This report has been used by senior management as a brief and as preparation to shape the final campaign.",

The initial focus of the ICR project is to connect people of different backgrounds together, to share their socio-cultural experiences in The Netherlands and minimise stereotypes and misunderstandings of one another. \nBetween March-April 2020, I oversaw the organisation of virtual trainings and execution of online ICRs. This included designing interesting & interactive sessions, facilitating large online meetings, coordinating communication strategies and writing up activity reports."
