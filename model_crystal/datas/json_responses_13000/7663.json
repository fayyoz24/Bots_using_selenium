    "summary": "*I\u2019m actively looking for my next opportunity in international supply chain.*\n\nI have devoted my whole career to setting up and managing supply chains that enable smooth operations, from large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Second Suez Canal in Egypt and the largest bio-diesel refinery in Europe to time-critical agricultural inputs and life-saving items for tens of thousands of people facing uncertainty.\n \nWith international experience and transactions spanning 30+ countries, I offer a consistent track record of sourcing suppliers that perform and deliver, driving multi-million dollar savings, breaking through bottlenecks, and complying with standards and regulations.\n\nI\u2019m not a supply chain professional who you can fit in one box though. And that\u2019s precisely my value \u2013 I have successfully devised, steered and implemented procurement strategies while setting up offices, training staff, cultivating supplier relationships and mitigating risks of stock-out for global companies and international NGOs alike.\n \n\ud83c\udf0f My added value comes from my wealth of experience with low- and middle-income countries. For instance:\n\n\u26f4I know what it takes to ship high-value medical equipment from the Netherlands to countries like Bhutan and Rwanda and reach the last mile, the final destination. I did this OTIF to 24 countries in Africa and Asia and overcame some COVID-19 obstacles in the process.\n\n\ud83d\udcbbI know what to do when you have just 2 months to set up an office, complete with a purchasing team and procurement processes, in a country you\u2019ve never set foot in before and you don\u2019t know the local language. In this case it was Egypt, and for a consortium of major marine engineering companies. \n\n\ud83d\udc8aI know how complicated 3rd party requirements can be, but I still managed to source hundreds of millions dollars\u2019 worth of medicines and work with ministries of health in countries like Vietnam and Zambia to fulfil their orders, all in compliance with The Global Fund\u2019s standards. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a talented international supply chain specialist, I\u2019m interested in having a conversation. Feel free to connect with me or email lucatrombella@yahoo.com.\n\n\u2714\ufe0fProcurement Strategy & Planning\n\u2714\ufe0fSupply Chain Management\n\u2714\ufe0fInternational Logistics/Transport \n\u2714\ufe0fContract Management\n\u2714\ufe0fClient-Vendor Relations\n\u2714\ufe0fNegotiations\n\u2714\ufe0fSOPs & Process Improvement\n\u2714\ufe0fRisk Mitigation & Management\n\u2714\ufe0fTechnical Assistance\n\u2714\ufe0fCIPS Level 4\n\u2714\ufe0fCAPM Project Management\n\u2714\ufe0fTrilingual in English, French and Italian",

Used a mix of strategic, proactive and responsive approaches. Oversaw the supply chain of goods and services for school, health and water network initiatives. Addressed challenges to guarantee prompt delivery when needed. Managed inventory of 3,000 units.\n\nLed the answer to the security challenge by applying different approaches to adapt logistics to the continuous mutation of security scenarios, such as centralized logistics with remote management, third party storage and/or deliveries, and safe temporary storage. Worked closely with senior managers to strengthen security for staff and assets. \n\n\u23e9IMPACT:\n\u27a2Offices were prepared to deal with insecurity events in terms of staff member safety and office/programme assets, with improved security SOPs and evacuation and contingency plans in place and up-to-date.\n\u27a23 schools and 2 water networks were rehabilitated and fully functioning.\n\u27a2100 schools received hygiene and first aid kits.\n\u27a22,300 households received packages of essential non-food items.\n\u27a2Closed operations at a field base without incident.",
