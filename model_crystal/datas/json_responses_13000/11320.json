    "summary": "Nice that you visit my LinkedIn profile and maybe you are looking for a podcast manager. In order to be able to make a choice to enter into a collaboration, I understand that you also want to get to know the person behind the laptop.\n\nMy name is Sofie and I live with my 7 year old son in the Amsterdam area. We have a good and healthy relationship and as a single mother I am proud of us. In recent years I have built up work experience in various sectors. However, I always remained in a role where I was allowed to help and advise people. This says about me that I am open-minded and cooperative, helpful and want to work towards a goal. I have always enjoyed my previous professions with great pleasure, but for years it has been haunted in my head that I can also work for myself.\n\nBut what was I going to do then?\n\nI listen to a lot of podcasts and I came into contact with an old friend. She is a Podcast manager herself and my interest in her story was immediately aroused. I definitely wanted to know more about this.\n\nAfter a few chats and coffee breaks with each other, my choice was made, I am going to work as a Podcast Manager. I knew I could offer the right service because of my accumulated expertise in providing services, thinking along and offering solutions.\n\nI've learned a lot and edited several podcasts and can't wait to work with you. So what can you expect from me?\n\n- You provide me a RAW audio and I'll make sure your podcast is edited. Adding the intro, outra and music. I am cutting out the oohh-ahhh, extra breaks etc. \n- Scheduling, uploading and publishing episodes to your hosting platform\n- You get audiograms per episode\n- Get basic shownotes for each episode\n- Adding the ID3 tags \n\nOr do you not have a podcast yet but would you like to start a podcast? I can help you with that too! I also offer Podcast Launch packages and we go through this journey together.\n\nPodcasts are a great opportunity to grow your business by getting more leads. I know from experience that it takes a lot of time to publish a podcast. If you get a good feeling about me, feel free to contact me. During a sales call we discuss your wishes and we get to know each other.\n\nI talk to you soon!\n\n\nWebsite: https://linktr.ee/ThePodcastDelivery\nInstagram: ThePodcastDelivery",
