This analysis was done two times using only RStudio and only Python with analytics packages.\n\nThe dataset contained departure and arrival stations and times for individual trips, location and names of stations, and weather data for the whole year. Based on this data, my aim was to uncover patterns of usage by time, location and weather conditions.\n\nThe project involved extensive data preparation and usage of Google's elevation API.\n \nMy analysis uncovered\n- Clusters of stations and most frequent itineraries\n- Spatiotemporal usage patterns\n- Different user types and usage types\n- 'Ideal' weather conditions, and change in usage based on weather\n\nFindings could be used to fine-tune maintenance operations of the system, better targeting promotion, planning extensions, and a possible introduction of different passes based on usage types.",

Using this dataset, we created a network of MEPs, based on joint membership in committees. Software used were Python, Excel and Gephi.\n\nWe were interested in increasing the efficiency of political lobbying, by identifying MEPs with the most influence on the legislative process. Our analysis uncovered the surprising insight that the most influential representatives are not the ones with highest political status, but the ones with memberships to some particular committees.\n\nThe findings could be used by advocacy organizations to more efficiently forward their agenda in the legislative process.",
