All of them will undergo computed tomography angiography, CMR and/ or SPECT, and Echo. One of the cohorts will be examined with multimodality invasive imaging including quantitative coronary angiography, FFR, QFR with or without further percutaneous coronary intervention, OCT, and some of them - with IVUS, VH-IVUS, NIRS. The plaque size and relevant stenosis, a composition of the atherosclerotic lesion, major adverse cardiovascular events (all-cause death, death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina, ischemia-driven revascularization) will be judged to be related to either originally treated (culprit) lesions or untreated (non-culprit) lesions. Moreover, the clinical potential of both non-invasive and invasive imaging, as well as anatomical vs functional modalities in two real-world patient flows, will be estimated with the special focus on the natural progression of atherosclerosis, clinical outcomes, and safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid dysfunction, and radiation dose). The diagnostic accuracy will be analyzed.\n\nThe follow-up period will achieve 12 months prospectively with collected clinical events and imaging outcomes which will be determined at the baseline and 12-month follow-up.\n\nThe project was suspended in March 2022 due to the sanctions on Russia.\nThe project is terminated in August 2022 due to the cessation of collaboration with Russian institutions.",

However, the effect of rosuvastatin use on the necrotic core in the coronary arteries remains to be evaluated. The IBIS-3 study (N=350) has been designed to address this question. All imaging procedures are performed immediately after the coronary angiography/PCI procedure. The study coronary vessel must have a <50% reduction in lumen diameter by angiographic visual estimation throughout a target segment of at least 40 mm in length. The region of interest (ROI) is defined as the longest coronary segment between two clearly identifiable landmarks (i.e., side branches). The length of the ROI is determined by the analysable matched segments on IVUS-VH and NIRS. The design was published in EuroIntervention 2012 with doi: 10.4244/EIJV8I2A37.",
