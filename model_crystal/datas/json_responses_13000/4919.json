These events included a bake sale, a concert and a football tournament. The events were advertised well online and with posters. As a team we tried very hard to get companies to sponsor us as we were also selling t-shirts. The bake sale was a success. The concert generated the most money and even attracted students from other schools. We generated over 1000 Bahraini Dinar for charity.\n\nThe Trip to Nepal consisted of 2 weeks. One of these weeks was spent hiking up mountains near Pokhara and the other was dedicated to charity. All the students were responsible for everything. We had one supervisor from World Challenge but he was only supposed to help us if we were in real danger. This meant that we would have a different leader of the group everyday. We chose two people to be in charge of our budget for the entire 2 weeks. The team would have to split up in groups to find restaurants that fit our budget. We had to find cheap accommodation, transport and supplies for the charity work we had to do. \n\nOn the first week we painted an orphanage and plastered walls in a local high school. A large amount of money generated from our concert was used to buy toys for the children at the orphanage. The second week consisted of climbing high mountains and dealing with a lot of leaches on the rocky trails."
