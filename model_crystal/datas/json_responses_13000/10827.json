This has left many of the Caribbean islands with a low level of food security as it increased their dependency on import. Climate change, which especially has a negative impact on these SIDS, makes that the Caribbean islands are vulnerable. In recent years more emphasis has been put on local agricultural development for food security as means of building resilience towards climate change. During my thesis i have been researching the possibilities and the cornerstones for Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) for these SIDS in the Caribbean. This has been done by conducting a case study in St. Kitts and Nevis where farmers and other local stakeholders have been interviewed, and workshops regarding CSA have been held.",

Karwang is also known as 'the rice shed of West-Java'. This district is known for the intensive production of cheap rice. This intensive production goes hand in hand with the profound use of agro-chemicals. This results in all kinds of environmental and health impacts in this region. Besides that a lot of old knowledge on rice cultivation gets lost. One of the goals of kaliaget farm is to prove that high quality rice can be grown without the use of agro-chemicals. Of the 9 hectare of land, 4 is now successfully producing organic rice. Another goal of the farm is to educate farmers in the direct neighborhood and to educate the children and students (future farms) on the basic principles of plant growth and soil science. This all in order to create a more sustainable production of rice. My tasks have been to help develop training and schooling material, and also I have learned the Indonesian language in order to personally teach students from the secondary agricultural school in Karawang city.",
