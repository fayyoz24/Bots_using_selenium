    "summary": "I am a Senior Geoscientist with 17 years of subsurface experience covering a range of exploration and development subsurface roles based in the Netherlands, UAE, Kuwait, and Egypt. I have been involved in E&P projects spanning the complete field cycle from greenfield development of multi-TCF dry gas fields through to a billion barrel mature oil field rehabilitation projects. My technical experience covers all play-types in a range of basin settings worldwide. Experienced in both Geology and Geophysics with broad experience in seismic interpretation, prospect generation and reservoir characterization. I have particular expertise in the construction and maintenance of integrated 3D reservoir models used for field development, reservoir management and production forecasting for business planning purposes. This expertise has been developed through my participation in delivering high technical quality asset projects through to course tuition and mentoring. My original education provided with the background to pursue a Geoscience career - I have enhanced this in my spare time by recently studding a master's in petroleum engineering at Heriot Watt. This provides me with a more integrated geoscience background and enables me to provide greater value to an asset business.\n\nSpecialties: \n3D Reservoir Modelling\nSeismic Interpretation\nProspects generation\nExploration studies\nIntegrating reservoir characterisation \nAssets evaluation\nReserve booking\nCarbonates & Clastics\nUnconventional Carbonates\nNaturally fractured reservoirs\nField development planning",

After completing the Seismic interpretation, I constructed a new 3D static model for the interpreted reservoirs in order to estimate the in-place resources and assess the reservoir uncertainties. My second project was B10 shallow gas fields. Where I have done a complete review and assessment of the in-place resources to see if it will pass the minimum economic cutoffs to develop that field which found to be marginal at the time because of low gas prices. The assessment started with an extensive QA/QC of the G&G and PP data available and building a new integrated 3D static model which has been used for dynamic simulation and helped in making the investment decision.",

The most significant contribution however was, I comprehensively illustrated the nature and variation of the seismic phase and polarity in the study area, and its implications on the AVO response. I found out at that many seismic data sets/vintages were having a wrong polarity which indeed affects the AVO response by giving a false misleading interpretation of the data available. By fixing it up to the correct polarity/phase, many prospects which were considered water bearing were suddenly have a positive AVO response and hence lower associated risk. That was a great achievement which I am still proud of and I believe it was an unforgettable contribution to my company and for their future success.",

I built a number of reservoir models at the time for the WDDM Mina and Sim Sat P2 gas & condensate field. I participate in Oligo-Miocene Prospectivity study for the WDDM where we identified a number of prospects and leads for the exploration portfolio.",
