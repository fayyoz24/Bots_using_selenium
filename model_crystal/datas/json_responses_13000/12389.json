            "description": "All over the world people are increasingly living in cities and urban areas. Cities are becoming more densely populated and the question arises: how do we maintain a good quality of life, which is sustainable, healthy, clean and comfortable? One important aspect in this context is the production and consumption of energy in buildings and houses, for lights, heating, cooling, machinery and the like.\n\nWith ongoing innovations in sustainable energy technologies, making them more powerful and reliable, the use of fossil energy finally is on the decline. The price of sustainable energy is dropping below that of fossil in various places in the world, even with the current oil prices, giving a huge boost to the energy transition.\n\nHowever, big challenges pop up, now that the experimental age is over and cities, countries and entire continents want to switch to this renewable energy source. How are we going to transform our current landscape and manage the \u2018smart energy grid\u2019, where local energy produced from sun, wind and water needs to be coordinated with energy consumption at different locations, at different times during the day?\n\nThe Business Marathon Energy is about these new challenges, set in the urban context. Going from real cases and problems, as brought in by the Challenge Partners, teams create innovative solutions and working prototypes in a 3-day 'hackathon', with 3 semi-finalists going for pitches on the main stage and win the big prize.",

            "description": "\nAll over the world people are increasingly living in cities and urban areas. Cities are becoming more densely populated and the question arises: how do we maintain a good quality of life, which is sustainable, healthy, clean and comfortable? One important aspect in this context is the production and consumption of energy in buildings and houses, for lights, heating, cooling, machinery and the like.\n\nWith ongoing innovations in sustainable energy technologies, making them more powerful and reliable, the use of fossil energy finally is on the decline. The price of sustainable energy is dropping below that of fossil in various places in the world, even with the current oil prices, giving a huge boost to the energy transition.\n\nHowever, big challenges pop up, now that the experimental age is over and cities, countries and entire continents want to switch to this renewable energy source. How are we going to transform our current landscape and manage the \u2018smart energy grid\u2019, where local energy produced from sun, wind and water needs to be coordinated with energy consumption at different locations, at different times during the day?\n\nThe Business Marathon Energy is about these new challenges, set in the urban context. Going from real cases and problems, as brought in by the Challenge Partners, teams create innovative solutions and working prototypes in a 3-day 'hackathon', with 3 semi-finalists going for pitches on the main stage and win the big prize.\n\n",

Specialized in the interaction between living nature and the atmospheric forces that steer weather, I worked with the latest approaches and techniques, mainly biological. During this project, I worked towards the publication of several peer-reviewed articles and ultimately bundled them in my doctoral dissertation. Working as a PhD-candidate granted me the opportunity to independently develop myself and my project, while under guidance of my doctoral advisors. For this research project, the planning and managing of time, money, energy, people and resources was very important. The experience gained through extensive fieldwork campaigns in extreme environments and long lab-work sessions contributed greatly to my understanding of the living and physical world. I also supervised and lead Master and Bachelor students in their thesis projects and associated lab- and fieldwork. \n\nhttps://www.uu.nl/staff/FEZErcan",

The lack of abundant data about the T-OAE from outside of the European Epicontinental Seaway (EES) has led to substantial debate about the spatial extent and ecological features outside the EES. The unique chance to palynologically analyse Kelimyar River Outcrop Section S-16 from North Siberia, consisting of Late-Pliensbachian to Early-Toarcian successions covering the T-OAE, gives the opportunity to unveil additional characteristics of the event outside the EES. The in earlier studies proposed order of events of the T-OAE in terms of sea-level rise and global warming is largely supported by the palynology from this study. Analysis of both the marine and terrestrial palynology revealed a strong transition from a situation dominated by terrestrial input to a marine dominated signal at the Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition, signifying a fast sea-level rise at the onset of the T-OAE. Increase in a representation of species associated with humid conditions represents the warming that occurred during the T-OAE. The abundant presence of dinoflagellate cysts during the T-OAE indicates the lack of a \u2018dinocyst blackout\u2019 that occurred in the EES at the time of the event. The dinoflagellate genus Batiacasphaera appears earlier in this section the High Arctic than previously known from other locations.",

                    "description": "Annual resolution needle length and cuticle property data have been obtained from needles of bristlecone pine, Pinus longaeva, from the White Mountains, California, USA. The bristlecone pine, living at the tree line in extreme alpine conditions is known for its longevity, some individuals are the world\u2019s oldest non-clonal organisms. The bristlecone pine\u2019s suitability for annual resolution studies is unique because the tree holds on to the needles longer than any other plant and the needles grow in annual fascicles that are clearly distinguishable. In the present study a continuous 44 years long series of annual needle-length and structural stomatal conductance have been analyzed from individual trees in extreme low P[CO2]-conditions and are compared to long and short term climate variability as well as global atmospheric P[CO2] change. Distinct annual needle-length variations corresponded highly among eight different individual trees that were sampled. In this data-set, two signals are distinguished, an overall declining trend in needle length and an annual variability. The declining long-term trend provides evidence for a negative correlation between atmospheric P[CO2] concentration and needle-length. The annual variation relates to summer temperature and reflects the dominant climate system in the area, the PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) which describes humidity and temperature regimes in the northern Pacific region. Our results for the first time demonstrate needle-length dependence on P[CO2] and temperature. A strong decline in structural stomatal conductance shows a strong response to changes in atmospheric P[CO2] and quantifies stomatal plasticity under near glacial P[CO2] not studied in-situ so far.",
