    "summary": "My professional activities include the following:\n\nResearcher specialized in large data systems. Creator of data systems (MonetDB, VectorWise) in the roles of developer, technical architect and team lead. Educator in data systems at BSc, Msc and PhD level. Manager of national and EU research projects, spin-off companies as well as at CWI. Innovator in analytical database systems, most well-known for column stores, cache-conscious data processing algorithms, vectorized query execution.  Co-founder of four startup companies (Data Distilleries BV, VectorWise BV, MonetDB BV, Celerata GmbH). Advisor of data systems companies involved in CWI research projects.  Member of program committees of academic conferences (ACM SIGMOD, VLDB, IEEE ICDE) in database systems as well as reviewer for journal publications (ACM TODS, VLDB Journal, IEEE TKDE). Past editor of VLDB Journal. Past member of the Dutch research council VENI committee. Co-founder of the DaMon and GRADES workshops at SIGMOD. Editor in Chief of PVLDB volume 10 (with Ken Salem), aka Program Committee Chair of VLDB 2017. Member of the PVLDB Advisory committee, as well as member of the board of trustees of the VLDB Endowment. General chair (with Stefan Manegold) of ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2019, in Amsterdam.  \n\nMy main focus is on my role as academic, but I always have an eye on (commercial) spin-off opportunities. I take pride in sharing knowledge, in the achievements of my students, in educating professionals, and in doing my part to make my home town Amsterdam a hub for data systems.",
