He is currently Executive Creative Director - International at Uber. He previously served as Executive Creative Director at Deutsch LA and Wieden+Kennedy NY working on some of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands such as Coca-Cola, Nike, Volkswagen, and ESPN. Jerome has collected over sixty international awards from some of the most prestigious competitions and has also been named one of fifty winners of the coveted ADC Young Guns 6 award, honoring the world\u2019s next generation of extraordinary creative talent in visual media and design. He has also been featured in a fashion editorial as one of Forbes Magazine\u2019s Mad Men of 2012 and made Business Insider\u2019s 25 Most Creative People in Advertising.\n\nHis career has many milestones including working on the pitch team that brought the Nike Digital Agency of Record business to R/GA, helping jump-start the newest AKQA office in NY with award-winning global work for Coca-Cola, and spending three years building a 20+ interactive team from scratch at Wieden+Kennedy NY and then eventually running the agency as co-executive creative director in 2010.
