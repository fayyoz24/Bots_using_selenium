    "summary": "Currently managing projects and company growth at Dusk Network. \n\nI am an experienced manager of startups and accelerator programs, leader, and problem-solver. I like improving the efficiency of companies, and I specialize in helping them to level-up and grow, through helping them to tell their stories to the world. I have worked in multiple levels in tech, from startup founder, to pitch trainer and mentor, to accelerator director, and as such, have a unique understanding of the challenges faced by tech companies as they grow and become mature firms in the modern economy. I sit at the intersection of business and technology and have a natural talent for \u2018translating\u2019 between the two groups and therefore can own products and represent customers\u2019 needs to tech teams and companies. I am extremely well-organized, have a history and a track record of success, and don\u2019t shy away from huge challenges. I am also comfortable in front of audiences and am willing and able to represent the company at gatherings and in meetings.\n\nI mentor at several accelerators where my focus is on pitch training for early-stage startups. I give talks and speeches from time to time on a variety of topics in and around technology and education. I also write for a number of publications, most recently the South China Morning Post and China Daily, as well as maintaining a personal blog on my website.",
