    "summary": "I am a project management professional who wants to act upon his own development. I am looking for an enterprise where I have the opportunity to chase my interests across roles and responsibilities. Where a job title is not the final definition of who am I, but the starting point of what I can become.\n\nWhen I am not in an office or a meeting, I am spending time with my significant other and child-o-mine. I also do enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, watching moving pictures entertainment, travelling to places and active relax generally known as sports.\n\nIf you like what you read in my profile and would like to know what else I can do to help your projects, please reach out to me via email <> oskar.sajka@gmail.com.",
