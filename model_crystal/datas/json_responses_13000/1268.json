    "summary": "I wanted to become a scientist ever since my mum and dad took me to the summit of an active volcano in Tenerife. I can still vividly recall their stories about the crystallisation history of molten rocks and the lethal power behind volcanic bombs. That is why it came to no one's surprise when I started my bachelor\u2019s in Earth Sciences at the university of Utrecht. During my bachelor, I became fascinated by the subfields of geochemistry, petrology, and volcanology, which eventually sent me off to central Mexico to monitor an active volcano. \n\nMy research in Mexico was a wonderful experience. Not only did it teach me invaluable lessons about science, but it also allowed me to explore my own personality and grow as a person. Above all, it motivated me to enrol in the masters of Earth Structure and Dynamics at the University of Utrecht. In the next few years, I graduated top of my class (with distinction), made some amazing friends (especially during the coffee breaks), and had some unforgettable field trips (Spain). I believe that I have grown a lot since I saw that volcano in Tenerife and my drive to pursue a scientific career is stronger than ever.\n\nMy quote to live by: ''Those who dwell among the beauties and mysteries of the Earth are never alone or weary in life.'' - Rachel Carson\n\nI am specialized in:\n\u2022 Stable Isotope Geochemistry\n\u2022 Geochronology \n\u2022 Metamorphic petrology \n\u2022 Petrography \n\n\nFor more information you can always contact me at sander.hoogendoorn@ziggo.nl.",
