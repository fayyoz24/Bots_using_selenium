This experience can inspire them and their students to go far beyond their own expectations.\n* Knowledge and skills - motivation to change cannot be sustained unless one sees real positive improvements in terms of the student learning in their own classrooms and schools. This requires sustained effort from teachers and school leaders to improve their knowledge and skills.\n* Conditions of learning - creating the right conditions for learning is paramount. Adults need to be in charge of their own learning, relevance is key, learning from peers and role models need to complement each other, learning needs to be sustained, stories are a powerful tool to communicate new ideas.",
