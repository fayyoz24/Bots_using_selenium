    "summary": "Bianca Carague is a Netherlands-based Filipino artist and designer. She creates captivating virtual landscapes and environments that allude to alternate worlds and possible futures. She uniquely blends design research with fiction and worldbuilding to create thought-provoking narratives that explore social issues and emerging technologies.\n\nHer unique perspective on worldbuilding and pioneering work in game world therapy have gained her recognition across prestigious platforms around the world such as Vogue, Elle Decor, and FRAME Magazine.\n\nBianca's recent solo exhibition, 'Gen C: Children of 2050,' demonstrated her ability to spark critical and creative thinking about the future through immersive installations and accompanying workshops, which allowed thousands of participants to build off of her work about the climate crisis. Her game-changing project, Bump Galaxy, where she created a Minecraft server for mental healthcare, showcased her ingenuity, as she provided virtual landscapes and gaming experiences for care during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, she grew it to 3,000,000+ sqm of digital biomes for various forms of therapy and proved that playing together could mean caring for each other.\n\nShe has exhibited in Dutch Design Week, London Design Biennale, Triennale di Milano, Het Nieuwe Instituut and Tetem. She has even collaborated with Vogue Philippines on a 16-page spread and cover story on Philippine identity in the metaverse.\n\nThrough her workshops across Europe and Asia, she also shares her expertise with young people to learn about Futures Literacy through art. Collaborating with esteemed institutions such as Tetem, Iceland University of the Arts, Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht (HKU) and University of San Marino, Bianca has made a significant impact in fostering creativity and futures thinking.\n\nBianca Carague's body of work serves as a testament to her dedication to provoke thought about the world we live in and the world we aspire to create.\n\nhttps://bianca-carague.com/",
