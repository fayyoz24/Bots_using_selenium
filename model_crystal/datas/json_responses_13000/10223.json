    "summary": "After an MA in Product Design at the Politecnico School of Design in Milan (2011) Francesco moved to The Netherlands to work for the Italian designers duo Formafantasma. \nAfter working there as Senior Designer & Senior Design Assistant (2012-2016), his interest in product design evolved towards a broader research-based practice, blurring the boundaries between design and visual arts.\n\n_\n\nIn 2015 he is founder of No-Rocket Studio, creative inter-disciplinary practice.\nExpanding his love for tactility and process, producing a fresh, eclectic yet coherent body of work distinguished by a strong \u2019hands-on\u2019 imprint. \nNo-Rocket finds inspiration on the borders between disciplines, transferring knowledge and methods between different fields, using design, installations, paintings and illustrations as tools for communicating ideas, visualising complexity in a \u2018human\u2019 way, giving tactility to the intangible and are often developed by juxtaposing contrasts: digital and analog, valuable and scraps, solemn and playful, personal and public.\n\nno-rocket.com\n\n_\n\nSince 2017 Francesco works actively as artist placed at the convergence between formal and conceptual, exploring human condition and everyday life events in the context of contemporary society, following a research where perception, intuition and memory play an essential role. \nHe explores new connections between the art world and his personal fascinations with scientific knowledge, combined together in open systems with which the audience can relate for investigating both their inner worlds and their surroundings. \nThe body of work in his current artistic research focuses on the limits of human perception and the blurry boundaries of our sensorial experience, the \u2018image of the self\u2019 and \u2018the image of reality\u2019. \nHis formal research is characterized by an abundance of materials and techniques, informed by his background in applied arts and further conceptualized within art. \nIn a constant balance between control and spontaneity, order and turmoil, tending to free-floating forms, he integrates new modalities of visual composition, gestural expressionism and meticulous formal re-configurations.\nIt is a process in which one action leads to the next in an ongoing echo that has much to do with reacting rather than acting.\nFZ\u2019s work goes beyond the single format of the art medium, ranging from large-scale paintings, drawings, object-like sculptures and installations, often in conversation with each other and creating multiple configurations and parallel narratives.\n\nfzorzi.com\n",

Each splash of color, gradient, cross-hatching is the result of advanced experimentation using heat, chemical agents and friction to reveal the color dyes embedded inside the paper itself.",

The artwork is a 287 square meters floor painting on the square of Largo Perestrello, Rome (IT). \nLagoon puts in dialogue the pre-existing installation present in the square (Iceberg, Perestrello 3.0, by Orizzontale) and the very history of the site, which used to be a ditch (Acqua Bullicante) then buried during the urbanization in the \u201830s.\nThe painting shows the melting of the iceberg, and its fragments are recombined to shape a calm painted bay, where the boat of the Argonauts can dock and liven up the community living in the area.\nThe painting becomes the platform to host the wooden installation Argonauti from Orizzontale architects built on the site in a second phase.",
