    "summary": "As someone taught me in Sierra Leone: \"If you listen to the noise of the market, you won't buy anything\".\n\nIf you wonder about my professional profile, I can't find just one word to define myself. My academic background is in Mental Health. I am now studying Local Development. My life experience taught me about Project Management, fundraising, diplomacy, child protection, resilience, policy writing. Recently, I also reinvented myself, and I've learned how to serve customers. \nI understood that I have just one passion, which is to be an instrument for others' successes. \nI can be everything, as long as I am working within a team, and I can be an element of support for others. \n\nSaid so, if you want me to describe what I did, and I can do:  I coordinated multiple development projects, including relationships with Government Institutions and Donors. My main interest is in projects about psychosocial support to adults, youths, and children experiencing severe traumas. I am also a Receptionist. \n\nNow, I wish you a peaceful day/night.",
