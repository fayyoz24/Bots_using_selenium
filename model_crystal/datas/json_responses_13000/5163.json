His study on adaptation to climate change in Benin was selected as an example by CGIAR\u2019s Climate Smart Agriculture. Sonneveld publishes articles in leading natural resource management and ecological economic journals. A central topic of his research is the modeling of the relation between land quality and agricultural production and eco-services.

Currently he coordinates projects on development of a water economy model in the Jordan River Basin with partners in Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestine Territories, an inland fishery project that investigates the carrying capacity of Lake Nokou\u00e9 and the Porto Novo Lagoon, Benin, and evaluates institutional arrangements among fishermen to share open access resources and an project that evaluates the impact of allotment gardens on food security of urban poor in the cities of Benin. Sonneveld was first author on a FAO pubkications on Nature Based Solutions and on Agricultural Water Management on Small Island Development States. Sonneveld was team leader for various Evaluation Studies (G4AW, FDW and WASH-Ghana) commisioned by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently he developed research collaborations on food security in the Arctic Regions.
