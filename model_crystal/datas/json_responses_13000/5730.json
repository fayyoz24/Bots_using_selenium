    "summary": "International development and child health professional, with 15+ years experience as an advisor, programme and grant (portfolio) manager in the public & health sector. Extensive experience in paediatric HIV grantmaking, global child health, and community leadership and systems strengthening in Africa. I\u2019m also a volunteer at Care4Neo - the Dutch association of parents of children who are born premature, too small, or sick - as a member of the neonatal care research, science and guidelines working group. \nI am a team player and quick learner, accustomed to working in a multi-stakeholder and multicultural environment. Comfortable communicating and working with a range of stakeholders, including grass roots or community based organisations, major donors, international NGOs, government and UN representatives, scientific researchers and medical professionals. Strong academic background with both a MSc in Health Sciences and a MSc in Global Challenges (global health, climate change & ecosystems and international development).\n\nWhat drives me?  \nCombining professional expertise and lived experience, I am determined to improve the health and wellbeing of all children in this world; it is unacceptable that child rights are too often neglected and too many children die of preventable causes. Children\u2019s chances in life, and even their survival, are largely determined by the place in the world a child is born and a child's family income. Addressing this inequity is at the heart of what I want to achieve. Because all children should grow up and develop in a safe, healthy and supportive environment!",
