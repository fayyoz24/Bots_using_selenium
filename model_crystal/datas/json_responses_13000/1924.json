    "summary": "I am critically obsessed with sonic branding. I touch the sound with my bare hands and turn it into an earworm. I am the goosebumps on your arm. I am the memories and feelings. I am the absolute connection between sound and visual content.\n\nNothing extraordinary, just my usual pipeline as the founder and creative director of WAVEME.PRO LLC Creative Audio Lab - an award-winning studio that has composed music and sound design for almost every A-list brand around the world, including Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, BMW, HP, Unilever, Porsche, Jaguar, Apple, Toyota, Genesis, etc.\n\nI've been responsible for music and sound for projects such as EXPO 2020 in Dubai, an immersive installation at Microsoft EBC in Redmond, the Nexus Arabia opening show in Riyadh, the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT launch in Beijing, the History Hall Museum in Montreal, the BMW 5-Series launch in Jakarta, the Jaguar Racing Formula season launches in London and many others. \n\n\u2028My 10+ years of experience as a sound producer inevitably led me to see, imagine and feel the sound. If I hear music - I automatically separate instruments, looking for hooks and details, and explore harmony and melodic patterns. I take sounds in the street by default as the noise painting that defines my existence. One day, I stopped resisting it, deciding to use this gift for the benefit of all life in our galaxy.\u2028\n\nInspired by the research work of Prof. Marcel Cobussen and Prof. Hafez Isma\u00efli M'Hamdi of Leiden University, a neurobiologist Prof. Dale Purves of Duke University, and Dr. James Humberstone of The University of Sydney, I started my own research activity. I began to study how audio content affects the emotional construct of the human brain. I immersed myself in a brand new direction of applied psychology. It is based on the theory of parallels and the evolutionary response of human genetic stages to specific rhythmic and melodic patterns. \n\nLater I started exploring the possibilities of AI in audio production and launched two startups aimed at simplifying the work of the sound designer and composer. \n\nMy background as a spacecraft engineer combined with my musical education and experience as a light artist gave me the opportunity to look at multimedia storytelling from both a technical and an artistic perspective. My move to Dubai has transformed these components into a single vector - a mission of creating a magnificent future around the world using all my skills and talents. \u2028\n\nBuckle up, our space shuttle is off!\nIn the meantime...\n\nGet in touch, and let's create something amazing together!\ncos@waveme.pro",
