    "summary": "Senior water and climate change specialist with about 19 years\u2019 experience in project financing, strategic advice, specialized consultancy, programme and project management and research. \n\nIn his current position at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Dr. Alessio Giardino is responsible in leading knowledge and innovation work to inform the design of climate change and resilience investment projects in the water sector. This include managing multi-million projects focusing on water and climate adaptation, providing technical assistance to operational departments and developing member countries (DMCs) agencies as well as liaising with external development partners among which MDBs/IFIs, knowledge/policy partners, private sector and the civil society. \n\nPrior to joining ADB, Dr. Alessio Giardino worked at Deltares as senior climate adaptation and disaster risk management specialist, providing both technical support to projects as well as strategic advice to make projects bankable. He has worked closely with the World Bank, ADB, the GCF, and several national governments in Africa, Asia, South America and the Pacific. \n\nDr. Alessio Giardino is also a lead specialist in adaptation work in Small Island Development States (SIDS).  He has developed a wide project experience in SIDS across all different regions. Additionally, he is actively involved as a reviewer for IPCC on the topic of climate change impacts on small islands. \nHe is author of dozens of publications on international journals and conference proceedings in the field of coastal zone management, climate adaptation and disaster risk management.\n\nHe graduated at the Faculty of Environmental Engineering in Turin in 2003. He was awarded this degree cum laude with a thesis carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Catholic University of Leuven (KULeuven, Belgium). In 2003, he enrolled for a PhD programme at KULeuven, in combination with a contract of assistance researcher at the Hydraulics Laboratory of  KULeuven.",

The small size of the outer islands and the infertile soil make inhabitants heavily reliant on shipping operations. The client (The World Bank) has approached Deltares to carry out an exploratory study to be used as a basis for the development of new maritime infrastructures at the two islands. The study will include the quantification of present and future coastal hazards at the two islands and, based on a multi-criteria analysis, the identification of potential locations for the development of two new ports. At those locations, preliminary port layouts will be outlined, including different configurations for different port sizes, accompanied by initial cost-estimates of the proposed infrastructures. The vulnerability of these infrastructures to present and future coastal hazards will be evaluated. Finally, the possible impact of the new maritime infrastructures on the surrounding coastline (i.e. in terms of morphodynamic changes and coastal flooding) will be analysed.",

            "description": "Small Island States around the globe are very susceptible to natural disasters: storm surges, coastal erosion, cyclones, tsunamis, flash floods from rivers, can have devastating consequences at those countries. Moreover, these effects are exacerbated by global climate change, climate variability and sea level rise. As their population, agricultural land and infrastructure tend to be concentrated in the coastal zone, any rise in sea level will have significant and profound effects on their economies and living conditions; the very survival of certain low-lying countries will be threatened. \nFor these reasons, the best way to support the socio-economic development of those islands is putting them in the conditions of predicting the occurrence and the effects of natural disasters which might affect them, providing them with suitable solutions to mitigate the relative effects. \nThe aim of SimpleCost is to develop simple and freely-available tools and knowledge notes downloadable from a website and combined with targeted capacity building actions. Among others, tools and instruments are being developed for the assessment of coastal engineering problems (e.g. coastal erosion, flooding), interventions (e.g. design of sand nourishments, structures, coral reefs), adaptive planning, simple monitoring techniques and facilitated by the use of serious games.\nThis activity targets practitioners from developing countries who are struggling with those issues and lack the expertise and data for more complex assessments, in particular practitioners from local and national governments, local universities or national consultants who do not have the means or skills to purchase and use complex modelling packages. \nThe project is financed by the Water Partnership Program, and frames within the Small Island State Resilient Initiative (SISRI) https://www.gfdrr.org/small-island-states-resilience-initiative implemented by the GFDRR (The World Bank).

The hazard information will be used to quantify the effects and consequences on the island of Ebeye (e.g. due to flooding and coastal erosion). \nThe quantification of the coastal hazards will make use of numerical models techniques (i.e. X-Beach and Delft3D) and state-of-the-art-knowledge developed specifically for coral reefs islands.  The information on coastal hazard will be combined with the information on exposure and vulnerability on the island in order to develop a risk assessment analysis for Ebeye. \nThis analysis will point out areas at highest risk, where interventions are required. A conceptual design of suitable intervention schemes will be proposed. The effectiveness of these interventions will also be tested based on the same methodology described above and for different time horizons, to assess how results may change due to climate change and sea level rise.\n",
