    "summary": "Kim van der Heiden is a vascular biologist, who aims to discover new treatment and/or diagnostic imaging targets for cardiovascular diseases by unravelling the interplay between cells, the extracellular matrix and their mechanical environment. In this regards, she makes use of tissue engineered human disease models in a physiologically relevant mechanical environment, suitable for live imaging and mechanical testing. \nHer multidisciplinary projects bring together biologists, engineers, imagers and clinicians, using pre-clinical, ex vivo and in vitro models to study mechanopathology in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and vein graft failure. \n\nShe studied Biomedical Sciences at VU University of Amsterdam and obtained her PhD degree in 2008 from the University of Leiden. She performed postdoctoral research at Imperial College London and at Erasmus MC. In 2010, she was awarded an NWO-Veni grant, in 2012 an Erasmus MC Fellowship grant, in 2014 a Dutch Heart Foundation Dekker Senior Postdoc grant, and in 2020 an NWO-Vidi grant. In 2021, she became associate professor in mechanopathology at the department of Biomedical Engineering, Erasmus MC.",

I subjected cultured endothelial cells to different flows in a bioreactor and analysed whether the endothelial shear response (shear-induced KLF2 expression) is dependent on the cytoskeleton and the role of primary cilia in this process.",
