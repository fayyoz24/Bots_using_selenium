    "summary": "MurchStudio brings together my love of building websites in WordPress and making it easy for people to bring their business and presence online with my passion for photography. I take care of all of the fiddly details so that you can get on with the work you want to do. Website building is provided for clients worldwide, while photography work is just local to the Netherlands. \n\nDuring my 12 years living in Argentina, I co-founded and ran a computer consulting company, started and built a freelance photography business, and edited photos and managed a team of photographers at an independent online newspaper. In 2013, I entered into the mobile development space as a customer support manager bridging the gap between user and developer at one company, and then working with a team of super users to bring paid content to life in another. From 2015 to 2019 I have dedicated my time to raising our young son and facilitating an international move from Argentina to the Netherlands. \n\nIn my \"previous life\" in the USA, I was a non-profit administrator focused on keeping the chaos down to a minimum by keeping things super organized and running smoothly. I am used to wearing multiple hats as necessary and getting the job done.",
