This is the ambitious mission that I've been leading since the past four years at mHS! We do believe in the critical role that access to construction technical inputs could play for low-income communities to improve quality and safety (resilience) of buildings! CTA (Construction Technical Assistance) leads also to better financial planning, maintenance, retrofitting and reconstruction practices. For our project we adopt digital and mobile connected platforms to bridge the gap between professionals and low-income communities to bring customized technical input at scale in a way never explored before. Look at our digital tool NEEV at thttps://web.neev.cloud/\n[Thanks to our supporter: CISCO USA, Access, SVAM International, NASSCOM]\n\nNEEV is a B2B digital platform that gives simple, efficient and expert housing solutions for end-users and agencies  offering housing products. Designed to make technical constructional information more accessible, it hopes to facilitate transparent and trustworthy relationships between homeowners and financial institutions.\n\n",
