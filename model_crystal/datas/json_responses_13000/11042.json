According to the different data available in soil sciences, hydrology and ecology, we prepared an educational exercise for the 1st year in Master students. This exercise includes several questions requiring for their resolution information hosted on a computer platform accessible from QR codes placed on different sectors of the area. These QR codes can be \"flashed\", from smartphones and tablets provided for the occasion, and refer to a platform where the necessary data are hosted. \nDue to these particular media, the format of the information had to be simple. To do this, we used the R Shiny package to be able to create interactive applications on the Internet and real-time updated data. The hosting on a linked web page allows, among others, a first protection concerning the access of these data by setting up, for example, a user name and password for their display.\n",

It highlights :\n- The waters various uses (surface water and groundwater resources)\n- Types of soils and land use planning practices\n- Landscaping and exploitation of different natural resources\n\nThe historical reconstitution and the perception in terms of vulnerability of the system has been questioned through surveys conducted with local stakeholders.",
