    "summary": "NATALIA SISTO \nSculptor, internationally recognized artist. Of Italian and Spanish origins. \nWith her extensive career in art, she has been living in Europe for more than 22 years. Her sculpture work is part of collections, museums, facades, monuments, private commissions and public entities. She has developed large-scale projects and has worked and exhibited in Argentina, Ecuador, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. \nToday Natalia continues to develop what she calls her vibrational realism, an innovative concept in art and writing her book \u201cLiberArte\u201d. She is also chairman of the AWAKE foundation. \n--\nNatalia Sisto was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February the 17th. 1977. \nShe studied at the school of Arts Prilidiano Pueyred\u00f3n, today National Institute of Art UNA, between 1994 and 1999. At the end of her degree, she made the postgrade course in Postgrade Direction of Visuals Arts Ernesto C\u00e1rcova until 2001.\nIn 1995 she travelled for the first time to Europe to pursue her life-search within creative art and  all sentient knowledge inherent to human beings.\nIn 1999 began working with her Master, D. Mariano Pag\u00e9s on the monument to Carlos Gardel, who taught her everyday and developed her love for sculpture.\nAt the end of the year, D. Enzo Bianchi comissioned her first sculpture, in which she imprinted her meaning of the realization of shared dreams.\nIn early 2001 she moved to Spain, where she lives still. Natalia has also lived in Madrid, Barcelona and Galicia. And worked with several Spanish sculptors on different projects throughout both Europe and America; generating fruitful creative experience. During this time, in 2006, she established her studio in the village of Chinch\u00f3n, Madrid.\nSince then, she has achieved several significant assignments, including a collection of sculptures that preside over the front of the building - Edifici Emperadriu Eugenia - in Monturiol, Barcelona. She has exhibited her art works in Argentina, Italy and Spain. \nNatalia\u2019s highly original creative style is best described as figurative realism with a strong innovative concept.\n\nSpecialties: Sculpture/ART - 3 Dimensiones",
