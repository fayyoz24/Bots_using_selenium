Currently, I am investigating heterogeneous outcomes among patients with the same cardiac disease and studying potential drugs to improve maladapted hearts.   \n\nMy specialties are cardiovascular diseases, omics data, project management, presentation skills, communications, team player, flexibility, solution-focused thinking, and creativity.",
