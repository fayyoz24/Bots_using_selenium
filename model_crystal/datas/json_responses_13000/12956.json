Moreover, we had to keep privacy issues, gender-inequality, and ethnicity into account. Besides doing research on technology and country-specific solutions, I evaluated the relevance of the proposals made by my fellow team members. I also organized group meetings, helped manage deadlines, and checked in with my colleagues to see how they were doing. Lastly, together with my colleague, I presented our recommendations in a pitch to the jury (consisting of WFP delegates and an academic jury), after which they proclaimed us the winning team.",
