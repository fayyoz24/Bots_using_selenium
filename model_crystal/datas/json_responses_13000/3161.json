    "summary": "I currently work as an independent consultant in the field of public health in developing countries, with a special interest in conflict and post-conflict settings. I have a range of interests but my passion is capacity building, which I have enjoyed doing formally since 2002. In addition, I have managed projects, conducted evaluations, advised on policy, written proposals for a wide variety of donors, and was involved in monitoring and evaluation of a number of health systems and disease control projects. I have written book chapters, articles, extensive survey reports, research reports and even set up websites. As a result of my diverse interest and experiences, I have built up a network of friends, colleagues, and professional contacts that keeps me happy and motivated. \n\nI love connecting people and ideas, and thinking outside the box to come up with creative solutions to problems\nI can look at issues from many different perspectives due to my diverse work experience, which includes academia, humanitarian field work, UN technical assistance, advisor to health ministries, project/programme management, evaluation, and teaching/training. \nI am a communicator and an optimist, and I enjoy initiating, motivating and stimulating ideas and discussions involving a diverse audience. \nI am by nature curious, and enjoy reading, learning, meeting new people, travelling off the beaten path, and international cuisine.\nMy motivators are people, nature, diversity, honesty and harmony.\n\nI can be contacted directly for short-term and longer-term consultancy work in public health, and am willing to travel internationally.",
