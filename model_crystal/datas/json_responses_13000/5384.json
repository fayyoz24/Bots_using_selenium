    "summary": "Currently I\u2019m working as senior research scientist as well as project manager at TNO, department Sustainable Process and Energy Systems \u2018SPES\u2019. I\u2019m involved in technology developments that support the energy transition and reduce CO2 emissions that cause climate change. Some focus areas are:\n1)\tMolten metal methane pyrolysis to produce hydrogen and solid carbon;\n2)\tProduction of syngas (CO/H2) through solid oxide electrolysis;\n3)\tNovel reactor concepts to produce synthetic fuels like methanol and DME;\n4)\tCO2 capture on ships (maritime sector);\n5)\tBiogas upgrading technology.\nIn the past I have been working for TNO Defence, Security and Safety for almost 10 years, on adsorption processes, characterization of porous materials, and individual protective equipment against chemical and biological warfare agents.\nSpecialties: Synthetic fuels, molten metal pyrolysis, CO2 capture, gas treatment, biogas upgrading, adsorption processes, characterization of porous materials, numerical modelling, computer programming (Fortran, Delphi)",

The long term goal of this collaboration is to combat climate change and contribute to a sustainable clean energy supply. The movable, robust, easy to use biogas lab will be used to select and test the potential of suitable local biomasses for biogas production.",
