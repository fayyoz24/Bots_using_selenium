This project will analyses the discourses of the circular economy within the three key fields of science, policy and market to understand the diversity of views and the perspectives they represent.  Using existing publications, policy documents, reports on public debates, roundtables, policy meetings and stakeholder interviews, the ESR will undertake a sociological discourse analysis focusing on the specific policies and market programmes in the countries participating in the ITN.\"\n\nObjectives:\n- Discourse and policy analysis of existing approaches to the CE across different contexts (geographic and sectoral, e.g., industry, governmental, academic)\n- Policy analysis of CE approaches, under lying policy theories and level of policy integration in selected EU member states and on European level, assessing alignment between political and academic discourses;\n- Discourse analysis of modes of conceptualizing CE in diverse industries and product markets and the substantiation of claiming\u2019s on positive impacts (circularity, sustainability);\n- Cross comparison of the discourses in the academic, policy and business domains and identification of implications for action.",
