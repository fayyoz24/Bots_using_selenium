    "summary": "My mission is to help create a world where every mind can thrive, by educating people and organizations on the power of neurodiversity. I do this through writing, speaking and photography.\n\nMy passion for neurodiversity stems from my lived experience being autistic. There are many hurdles I had to overcome in life towards understanding, accepting, and ultimately appreciating my differences. I now want to ease this path for others. And I believe organizations stand to gain a lot from embracing neurodiversity, too. Because together, we see more. And it\u2019s often the ones who think differently who can spark innovation and progress.\n\nIn my work as a neurodiversity advocate and educator, I combine lived experience with organizational insights acquired over 15+ years working as a communicator in leading international companies, including Deloitte and Philips. I founded and lead the Philips Neurodiversity Network, a global Employee Resource Group (ERG) with over 500 members that is dedicated to making Philips a place where every mind can thrive.\n\nI have presented on neurodiversity at a wide range of business and academic events, including Neurodiversity At Work, International HRC Square, Simply IC London, Utrecht University, and the Rotterdam School of Management. \n\nNext to writing and speaking, I am also an avid landscape and cityscape photographer who captures scenes of stillness in the rush of life. My work as a photographer has been awarded in the International Photography Awards (2019), the Fine Art Photography Awards (2018, 2022, 2023), and the Prix de la Photographie Paris (2019).\n\nGet in touch via a direct message if I may be able to help you in any of the following ways:\n\n- Writing a publication on neurodiversity or autism for your platform\n- Speaking about neurodiversity or autism at your event or conference\n- A creative collaboration that involves photography to raise awareness of neurodiversity\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n- My lived experience as an autistic individual is just one of many. Every autistic person is different.\n- My thoughts on this platform represent my personal views and not necessarily those of my employer.",
