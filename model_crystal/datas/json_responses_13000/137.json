    "summary": "My current professional focus and research:\n Inter-cultural awareness and pedagogical skills in the EAP classroom, specifically focusing on Chinese academic degree-seekers in Anglophone programs and academies.\n\nSince 2010, following from my ancillary university focus on Chinese language and culture, I and my colleagues Dr. Mark Vitullo and Dr. Yao (Amy) Hsiao have been involved in several projects relating to Chinese exchange students and their English language acquisition and production skills within the Anglophone academic environment (specifically EAP writing/oral skills at Tilburg University). We are currently exploring the practical English language acquisition and production difficulties with which these students struggle and which hinder their success in Anglophone programs. \n\nOur goal is twofold:\n1)\t To offer EAP (English for academic purposes) university teachers information about certain Chinese (Mandarin) language characteristics, Chinese rhetorical essay structures and logical conventions of idea development that Chinese exchange students learn in China. This information should enable the EAP teacher to identity and modify potential interference patterns during EAP courses.\n2)\tTo develop practical classroom methods to support and coach Chinese exchange students more efficiently and effectively so that they can acquire the academic English skills they need to succeed in the global, primarily Anglophone, academic environment. \nMy academic interest in this has its root in my Bachelor\u2019s education in Asian Studies, as well as my current work with Chinese PhD candidates at Tilburg University.\n\nDuring my undergraduate education, I took several courses in Mandarin Chinese. I have now resumed Mandarin language classes to gain a better insight into basic Mandarin  structures and pronunciation.\n\n",

The themes that I focused on in my dissertation involved ethnic identity, multiculturalism, gender theory and contemporary literary theory.\n\nAs a Language Skills teacher, I have taught writing and oral communication skills at all levels in various academic and business fields. At Tilburg University, I have taught students and Ph.D. candidates from all the faculties (sociology, psychology, law, humanities, and economics) as well as lectures and administrative staff. At the commercial language institutes, I taught courses (both at the institute and in-company trainings) which were tailor-made to suit the needs of the clients. These clients included salesmen/women, secretaries, technical personnel, managers, computer programmers, R&D staff and came from a variety of companies (from computer software companies to gas companies to ground sanitation companies).  \nI am currently focusing on intercultural awareness , specifically in relation to Chinese exchange students\n\nAs a lecturer in English and American literature at Utrecht University and the VU University Amsterdam, I taught introduction to American literature, poetry, film and literature, and contemporary Native American fiction. I also supervised B.A. and M.A. theses in English and American literature.\n\nNon-professional interests: \n\nI have played violin since I was a child. I was classically trained and was a member of the Chicago Youth Orchestra and the Nijmegen Student Orchestra. I studied classical violin for two years at the Arnhem Conservatory. However, I choose to follow English language and literature as a profession and continue violin as a hobby.\n\nFor the past 15 years I have dedicated myself to Irish traditional music and now travel throughout Ireland as well as the Netherlands and Belgium to play in open music sessions.\n\nI am also an avid hiker and hillwalker.",
