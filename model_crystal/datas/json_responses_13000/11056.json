    "summary": "Amgad Y A Omer is a civil engineer, specialized in Geotechnical and Hydraulic Engineering and water resources. He is presently working in team developing  morphological model  for  some  600  km  of  the  Danube River in Romania in order to evaluate the impact of engineering  measures to  improve  navigability of the old  Danube channel; and also testing/developing the morphological processes of the new Delft3D software (flexible mesh). He was the deputy resident Engineer of Dam Complex of Upper Atbara Project (DCUAP) and project coordinator of Gedaref Water Supply Project (GWSP). Both of them are international projects containing consultants and contractors companies from different countries such as Germany, China and Sudan. As a joint appointee, he was seconded to Hydraulic Research Center (HRC) as a senior morphdynamic modeller to perform a complex quasi3D morphodynamic models to study khashm ELgirba reservoir sedimentation and to generate operation rules to the new combined reservoir by testing different sediment management practises. \nAmgad has a respectable experience in hydraulic structures, dams and reservoir morphodynamic modelling. He started his career at the Irrigation Works Corporation-Sudan, in 2002, where he did irrigation water development. He obtained MSc in 2011 from UNESCO - IHE, Delft, the Netherlands. He used in his thesis project, quasi (3D) morphodynamic modelling of Roseires Reservoir (Sudan) by Delft3D software. The study is a part of the water resource management project of the Blue Nile. | As part of his civil engineering profession, he was further involved in management, design and supervision of heavy civil engineering works such as high earth dams and hydraulic structures.\n",

He is conducting research in the field of reservoir sedimentation and sediment management. His main focus is to improve the numerical modeling to mimic, the different and detailed components of dam operation.  Since 2015, he carried out  advisory works in many reservoirs and hydropower dams, such as Funagira reservoir (Japan), Akiba reservoir (Japan), Upper Atbara reservoir (Sudan), Merowe reservoir (Sudan), Ethiopian Renaissance reservoir (Ethiopia), Rosaries reservoir (Sudan), Dakpathar reservoir (India), Mekong proposed cascading reservoirs (Laos), Salto Grande reservoir (Argentina-Uruguay) etc.  In these projects he did (within the team) not just address the hydrology, hydraulics and morphology, but also their impacts on inland navigation, flood risk, ecology, hydropower and irrigation.\nIn several projects, Amgad has been responsible for the design of appropriate measures, in close co-operation with authorities, stake holders and industry. Examples of these measures are river-training structures, flood-plain lowering and development for lowering flood levels, dredging strategies for navigability and sediment management at hydropower dams.",
