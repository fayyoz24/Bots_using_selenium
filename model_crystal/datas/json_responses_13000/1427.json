    "summary": "An enthousiastic RMa graduate Archaeology at the University of Leiden with a passion for starch grains and Caribbean archaeology.\n\nDuring both my Bachelor as well as my Research master my focus lies on the research of starch grains from an archaeological context (especially in the Caribbean). Next to this, I followed courses on heritage issues and a minor in Postcolonial studies at the University of Utrecht. Because of this, I became a critical thinker who is not taken aback by theorethical texts. \n\nAfter my graduation I broadened my horizons by working as a (junior) consulant at Stantec B.V., advising companies when concerning soil contamination. After this, I followed my dreams and became projectengineer Archaeologie at Antea Group. Here my main task is to give advise on all things archaeology related when needed in the construction process, for example when one is installing new cables and drainages, or constructing new buildings.",

At the LUS, it is our biggest concern to broach problems within the university, to have open discussions about it with both students as well as the Executive Board of the university, and to suggest solutions to the Executive Board. We did this by organising \u2018breakfast clubs\u2019, where we, while enjoying a nice breakfast, gave room to the students to give their opinion on the matters.\n\nNext to organising the breakfast clubs, the LUS also works on the awarding of the Leiden Teaching Prize. Every year, students can nominate their teachers who they think provide innovative and good education. The members of the LUS then join one class of this teacher to assess them and, eventually, choose a winner. \n\nAdditionally, I joined the interviews for the new chair of the LUS, which gave me a better understanding of what is involved in organising these kinds of interviews and what are good points to take into consideration.",

Terra, the study association of archaeology at the University of Leiden, I was in charge of the communication between the members and the association and between our association and other study associations. This meant keeping the email inbox up to date and sent emails when necessary, writing and sending the weekly newsletter, creating and updating evens on Facebook in order to make people extra aware of our activities, and to keep the website up to date with photos, events and short texts. The communication with the members mainly was in English, as our study program has a lot of international students. This gave me an excellent command of English in both speech and writing.\nAdditionally to the general communication, I was in charge of the minutes of our general assembly of members. These were written in both Dutch and English. Next to this I also wrote and sent the invites for the assembly. Another task that came with the position of secretary was the updating of the membership database in Microsoft Access and the writing of the minutes of board meetings.\nDuring our board year, the other members and I have rewritten the internal rules of regulation. This was done in both Dutch and English. Next to the many administrative tasks, we of course also organised fun and educational events, such as lectures, a symposium, drinks and parties. Because of this, my organisational skills have grown a lot.",
