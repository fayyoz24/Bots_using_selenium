    "summary": "With over 20 years of work experience basically spread between Asia and Europe, I've always pursued the road less traveled. I have a background in business administration and always retained a broad interest in business dynamics and foster a genuine curiosity in why \"things are as they are\". Meanwhile, I love to touch the scales of risk and return as this is what drives dreams...\n\nI aim to combine my experience in venture capital & corporate finance with my strong interest in technology ventures where I can deploy my entrepreneurial drive to facilitate value acceleration projects for clients. Connect this competency with a passion for Asia and you can imagine me at work.\n\n\"Empires of the future are empires of the Mind\" (Winston Churchill)\n\nSpecialties: venture capital, ICT, ecommerce, new media, energy, food processing, industrial manufacturing, transportation & logistics.",
