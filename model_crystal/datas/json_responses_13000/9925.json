    "summary": "Hi everyone, I'm Li.  Recently finish my safety and security management bachelor study at the Hague University. I enjoyed my life as an international student in the Netherlands. Being positive, proactive, motivated to perform, detail-focus and creative, I love to step out my comfort zone to know new cultures, people with different backgrounds, and new skills. I'm the first Chinese student in safety and security management bachelor program in the Netherlands. It was a big challenge for me to start a new study in a brand new environment. In the last four years, besides finished all courses in the program, I also learned how to communicate and work with people with various cultural and personality differences. 'Li is a good team player, with good cooperation skills.' This is the comment of my internship tutor, the Administration Manager in the Shanghai Hotel Holland. \n\nI am not only passionate about traveling but also exploring new lifestyles and cultures. I have been to ten European countries, and I went to North Africa in 2013. During my spare time, I love to be a volunteer.  Since 2009 till now, I am continuing my voluntary work in a Chinese school in the Hague, and in July, 2014, I have been to Lisbon for voluntary work.  I love cook Chinese food and share with friends. Good food and nice conversation can always make my day. Believe in learning at every step of what to seek to accomplish, and having a lot of fun in what you do.\n\nCurrently looking for a new starting position where I can fully apply my skills and knowledge. My main fields of interest are Public safety and security management, Risk assessment, Risk control and prevention, Organizational communication and Media and Safety, also open to other opportunities.  I will be available for full-time positions form November 2014 onwards. Please feel free to contact me anytime at xinglili0315@gmail.com; I will respond as fast as I can.",
