    "summary": "25 years experience on international development in fragile states: Kosovo, North-Macedonia, Georgia, DRC, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Mali and Burkina Faso. I am passionate to make a difference for people in fragile states. I translate context analysis into conflict-sensitive high impact strategies that combine program, advocacy and publicity. I raised funds for more than \u20ac45M, managed multiple multi-annual programs including consortia, and managed teams up to 30 people. Experienced with policy engagement, advocacy and diplomacy, on sensitive files, at a very senior level. I am an inspiring and result-oriented coach and team leader. I have published on conflict in Kosovo, North-Macedonia, DRC and Afghanistan, spoke on radio, TV and international conferences on Kosovo, North-Macedonia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Until October 2021 I was Program Manager for Iraq and Yemen, and conflict-sensitivity  advisor for Afghanistan, Mali and Burkina Faso. Since December 2021 I am Partnership and Programme Developer at NUFFIC. I am guest lecturer at universities and think tanks. The experience of living in North-Macedonia, Afghanistan and Iraq during armed conflict inspires me. After university I followed courses humanitarian negotiations, conflict analysis, international security, international humanitarian law, and media training.",
