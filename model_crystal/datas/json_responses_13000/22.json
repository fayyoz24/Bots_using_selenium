    "summary": "I am an experienced English teacher with a strong passion for international education and English as a foreign language. Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to the field by combining my teaching expertise with administrative and operational responsibilities.\n\nTeaching has always been my foundation, providing me with a deep understanding of pedagogical practices and the ability to connect with students from diverse cultural backgrounds. I have successfully transitioned into administration and operations, where I have gained valuable experience in teacher and administrative staff recruitment. Utilizing the Top Grading Methodology, I have consistently identified and onboarded high-quality professionals to ensure educational excellence.\n\nFurthermore, I have honed my skills in invigilating international exams, including IELTS and Cambridge assessments. This experience has given me a comprehensive understanding of the assessment process, further enriching my ability to support students in their language learning journey.\n\nAdaptability has been a cornerstone of my career, enabling me to excel in different environments, countries, and multicultural settings. While my training and primary experience lie in in-person, face-to-face instruction, I seamlessly transitioned to the online working reality. Embracing the challenges presented by the pandemic, I actively sought opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge, integrating them into my online teaching practice.\n\nCurrently based in Groningen, Netherlands, I draw upon my skills of adaptability, flexibility, cultural awareness, and compassion to enrich the educational experience for students and colleagues alike. I am committed to providing high-quality instruction, promoting language proficiency, and fostering an inclusive learning environment.\n\nI am passionate about connecting with like-minded professionals, exploring opportunities for collaboration, and making a positive impact on the field of international education and English language and Professional Skills instruction.
