The validation of the methods included parameters such as, matrix effects and the limits of detection and quantification. The main goal of this research was the optimization of the sample preparation using online SPE for the in order to achieve  LOQs low enough for THs in  50\u03bc L of cell lysate to be able to be quantified (pg levels, <=0.3ng/m L ). The efficiency of offline SPE was also investigated.\nThe research was successfully completed and out of the three developed methods two will most likely be used in Vrije Universiteit's future research regarding thyroid hormone disruption.",
