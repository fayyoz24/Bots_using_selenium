    "summary": "I am open for immediate work: remote global, or locally in the Boxtel, Netherlands gemeente. My range of skills include visual content creation; licensing of art for business/commercial uses; visual and print work within my unique style and brand; art/design collaborations; data entry and data specialist skills; technical/software/process documentation; and many types of digital marketing.\n\nI am a Greater Boston native currently in the Netherlands. English is my native language, but I can also manage a bit of Dutch at A0 level as I have Dutch family. I am working on a paid Dutch language course towards A2 or better before I hopefully integrate at the beginning of March, 2023.\n\nI am also open to learning new trades and skills. My hobbies include abstract acrylic painting on anything that can take paint, introductory gelatin printing, and digital photography. I also love cooking with the European palate in mind and learning about world cuisine, as well as home baking artisan breads like sourdough, or pastries like star bread with jam or chocolate. I self-teach something (or several things!) every year or so to challenge myself.",
