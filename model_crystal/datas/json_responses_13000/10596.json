My main focus was to increase understanding among stakeholders (general population, government, civil society, journalists) about the mission's mandate. Together with the Human Rights Division and the Civil Affairs Department, I organised activities to promote human rights and decrease intercommunal violence. I have been an active contributor to the mission's website by providing news articles and photos. As a team leader I drafted the annual work plan, the communication strategy, managed the budget and built up the capacity of national staff. \n\nThe UN peacekeeping mission UNMISS has been in South Sudan since 2011. During the period I worked for them, the mission's mandate focused on protection of civilians, human rights, providing protection to human rights and supporting the peace process.",
