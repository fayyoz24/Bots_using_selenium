    "summary": "Because of my mathematics background and 7 years experience with backend development, I am good at solving complex challenges. Taking on algorithmic or mathematical challenges by means of programming, is my passion. I often work alone on a problem, and I am good at coordinating with management what exactly needs to be done. In addition I like explaining mathematical problems to management, so it becomes clear where the problems are and what solutions are possible and desirable.\n\nTechnologies: Java, C#, Python, C++, Javascript, React Native, BASIC,  Java Spring (Boot), Hibernate, AOP, AWS, Data Analysis, SQL, Docker, SOAP, REST-API, Linear Algebra, 3D-Geometry, A-Star, Douglas-Peucker, Bezier Curves, Direct-X\n\nPersonal Details:\n\u2022 7 years experience as a backend developer\n\u2022 programming language agnostic\n\u2022 very analytical\n\u2022 have been programming since the age of 7\n\u2022 loves brain-twisters in my work\n\u2022 have been working since 2015 as a software developer, before that I was alternately a mathematical tutor and software developer",

I worked on the system that gives orders to the forklifts where to pickup goods, and where to put them, and designed an algorithm that prevents forklifts from colliding with each other. To this end, I divided the warehouse in small squares, and calculated which squares the forklifts crossed during their travels. This way it was fast and easy to see which trucks occupied the same squares and collided with each other. In addition I designed an algorithm that calculates an approximation of a bezier curve with circular arcs.",

To make these smooth, the cubes were illuminated longer by the lightsource to turn the cubes into small spheres and have them blend into each other. Together with an anti-alias algorithm it was calculated how long each cube should be illuminated. By calculating for what percentage the volume of a cube lies inside the 3D object, it is possible to determine how many extra seconds the cube should be illuminated. Together with a thicker edge that made extra cube growth possible, objects could get a smoother surface.",
