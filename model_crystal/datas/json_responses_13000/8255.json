    "summary": "Born in Russia, I have lived for 17 years in a small town in Siberia, and then for the next 8 years, in Moscow where I studied and worked at the same time in various companies performing different jobs. The most relevant and interesting of my experiences during that time was a position at a radiostation where I started as a stenographer and eventually became a corrector and a writer. This position allowed me to develop enormously my language skills, in Russian, as well as in English, and awoke my interest in the Humanities and Social Sciences. \n\t\nThe following part of my life took place in Spain, where I formed my family, got a degree at the University of Barcelona. During 9 years I\u2019ve been taking care of my young children, studied and worked as an administrative assistant, a translator, a language teacher and a bookseller, until I became part of a very interesting international team in the new office of Michael Page Agency in Barcelona. I loved working in this company because of a friendly, creative, multilingual environment. Despite that, I took the decision to quit my job and follow my husband to his new job location in the Philippines, and later in China. During that time, I was able to work with the Russian translation agency AG Translate and fulfil a lot of different projects with them. \n\t\nSince 2018 I\u2019ve been living in the Netherland and looking for an opportunity to collaborate with different translation agencies where I could apply my knowledge and skills with efficiency. I am an easy-going person, fast learner and hard worker and believe that my formation and experience in administrative jobs and management of my own company will allow me to make a valuable contribution in the development and excellent functioning of any project and to guaranty the highest standard of my performance",
