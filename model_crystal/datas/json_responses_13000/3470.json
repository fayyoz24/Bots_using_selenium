I have worked with with Cordaid Organization as a Financial Administrator in Netherlands for Seven months. In addition,  i have worked with Cordaid Afghanistan as Monitoring Women's Peace and Security Project Officer. I  believe women have fundamental role to bring changes within a society and if where women struggle with GBV and lack of Access to basic Human rights, there is nowhere, more than conservative society and ruling system. A s women who lived in Afghanistan  where  women do not allow to study and specially now under the Taliban Regime, I have plan to continue my work for women Rights and women empowerment not only in Afghanistan but also in all around the world where women suffer from unjust society and system.  Women Deserve to be Educated.",
