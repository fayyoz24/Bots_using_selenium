With a passion for helping others and a strong interest in promoting culture, inclusion, and diversity, I bring adaptive and actionable solutions to serve teams and organizations. My diverse skills span operations, people management, financial management, grant management, and more \n\nCurrently seeking a project manager or operations role in an NGO with a social focus, I am driven by the opportunity to make a positive impact on society. Throughout my career, I have accelerated team growth by 400%, contributing to the expansion of companies from small teams to robust workforces. Notably, I am the youngest elected Director in the history of the RGMX, a testament to my dedication and leadership abilities.\n\nWith an academic background in Anthropology, Sociology, and International Development, complemented by professional experience in technology, start-up growth, and Mexican professionals in the Netherlands, I bring a unique perspective to my work. My ability to navigate diverse environments, foster collaboration, and implement strategic plans has consistently driven positive outcomes.\n\nLet's connect and explore opportunities to leverage my expertise in operations management, project management, and non-profit advocacy to drive sustainable change and social impact.",
