    "summary": "I am a Mechanical Engineer with more than 15 years of experience in the automotive, medical device, pharmaceutical primary packaging, and chemical industries. Throughout my career, I worked as a Project Manager in international teams with hands-on attitude, always willing to understand what is behind the curtain. I have built good relationships with customers, having a problem solving approach. \n\nMy strongest competencies are a solid understanding of mechanics, production processes and an outstanding sense of quality. I successfully apply required norms and customer needs into practice.\n\nI took an amazing overland trip through Central Asia to Mongolia and back through Russia and the Baltic countries. After a great time where I have grown so much thanks to an amazing team at Syngenta, I established my company and I am currently offering engineering services to my clients.",
