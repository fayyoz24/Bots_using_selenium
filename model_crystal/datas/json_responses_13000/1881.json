ActKnowledge is supporting the Center through the provision of a range of resources including the provision of guides and free access to Theory of Change on-line (TOCO), a tailor-made software tool designed to facilitate a conceptual understanding of Theory of Change and support the implementation of the approach in planning and evaluation work.\n\nThe imperative for the establishment of the Center arises from ActKnowledge\u2019s own experience. In particular, it arises from a concern that although the term is somewhat ubiquitous (especially in international development), understanding of what a Theory of Change approach involves conceptually and what is needed to support it\u2019s successful implementation varies widely. Such misunderstandings have the potential to undermine the reputation of the Theory of Change approach.\n\nThe Center is overseen by a Board of Advisers.
