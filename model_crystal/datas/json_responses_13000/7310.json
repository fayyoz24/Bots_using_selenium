Subsequently, the foresight provided by these predictions enabled business owners to take a looking-forward strategies. These strategies encompassed waste reduction for organic food products through targeted discounts, meticulous stock replenishment budgeting, and strategic manpower allocation.

I developed and implemented one of the top 10th algorithms of 20th century called \u2018Fast Multipole Method (FMM)\u2019 to simulate the interaction force and velocity field among a large number of particles. The particles were discreate and moving in a circular path inside of a Turbulence. The entire implementation was written by Fortran-90 programming language.",
