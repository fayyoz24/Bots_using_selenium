    "summary": "Growing up in the international capital of peace and justice and I started my interest in the international community from an early age. After completing high school, I worked in the hospitality branch with Mise en Place. Here, I had the opportunity to attend international conferences and diplomatic events as a garcon. This further inspired me to join this community. \n\nTherefore, I opted for the program of European Studies at the The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This program is a wide-ranging course that provides students with the know-how to become European professionals. During this program, I gained skills ranging from political science to marketing. \nAs an extracurricular activity, I joined the international organization of Enactus where I have developed a social enterprise that had the aim to empower women with a migrant background to improve the integration process as project leader. \n\nThe program of European Studies has allowed me to conduct an with the University of Malta. This was the place where both my interest in the Mediterranean region and the values for the EU came together. Consequently, I decided to write my bachelor's thesis on the adherence to the EU\u2019s Common Fundamental Values to protect the freedom of the press comparing Malta and Slovakia. \nAfter returning to The Hague, I decided to conduct my internship in Cyprus. The internship for DOREA Educational Institute allowed me to thoroughly analyze European policy together with the dynamics and needs of the European population. Based on this analysis I participated in developing training courses for DOREA. I am especially proud of the launch of the training course: \u201ceducation for sustainable development\u201d that I have developed from the early stages.\n\nAfter graduating from The Hague University of Applied Sciences, I have decided to further develop my knowledge on the Mediterranean region starting the Master\u2019s program of European Union and Human Rights Studies at the Catholic University of Murcia. The program connected me with peers from all continents discussing contemporary issues with highly skilled lecturers such as ambassador Javier Vallaure, Bichara Khader and director of Social Economy Europe, V\u00edctor Meseguer. I have conducted an internship with Social Economy Europe where I have gained insight into the social economy and advocacy, as well as social media content creation and monitoring. Finally, I have utilized my passion for Europe by writing my final master\u2019s thesis on the importance of European identity building by virtue of my participation in the Erasmus program.",

These tasks included, social media content creation and monitoring the various social media channels of Social Economy Europe. Furthermore, I have expanded my comprehension of the social economy sector. With the experience gained as a project manager of a social enterprise for Enactus The Hague, I have gained an understanding of both the practical and the advocacy side of the coin during this internship. At Social Economy Europe, I have gotten the opportunity to attend conferences of high-ranking social economy actors. This provided me with the possibility to experience advocacy from a close angle. Finally, I have gained experience reviewing and drafting Social Economy Europe publications. The beforementioned tasks have resulted in an unforgettable experience that has strengthened me as a European professional.",

DOREA Educational Institute is a non-profit non-governmental organization based in Cyprus that offers high-quality non-formal education to adults and youngsters who like to achieve professional development from a strong belief in the power of lifelong education. At DOREA I have mostly worked on tasks regarding project initiating and networking. The tasks consisted of researching topics for future training courses, writing project applications, maintaining social media channels, and attending (international) consortium meetings. The experience has provided me with the opportunity to launch the training course: \u201cSchools in Action: Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)\u201d. I am incredibly grateful that DOREA has provided me with the opportunity to develop the professional goals set at the beginning of the experience. This experience completed the European Studies course and gave me the last nudge towards becoming a European professional.",

This international student organization focusses on successfully establishing sustainable businesses ran by local communities. Together with a group of international students I started a project named heartfood. This project aimed to empower women with a migrant background who do not have a sufficient level of command of the Dutch language and therefore face difficulties integrating in Dutch society. The project focused on selling meals prepared by these women. The meals consist of ingredients saved from being disposed after a market day at the largest outdoor market in Europe, the The Hague Market. Besides the ecological impact of this project, the aim was to provide trainings and workshops for the women participating so that the integration process would be eased. This experience taught me to cooperate in international settings and initiate international projects. "
