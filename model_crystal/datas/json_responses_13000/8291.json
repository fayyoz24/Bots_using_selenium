The confinement due to the pandemic has offered time to explore my relationship to the dune landscape in The Hague: http://manondecourten.com/blog-a-sense-of-sand.html\n\nIn 2019, I set up the Ritlu project in partnership with artist and researcher Christina Stadlbauer. \nRitlu is an artistic project proposing explorations around the dramatic transformation of the Arctic region due to the rapid and irreversible melting of the Ocean and overall change of climatic conditions, as point of departure. 'Ritlu' is inspired by the Chukchi term for 'Gift from the Sea'. About our project, read my blog Arctic youth and the climate crisis. \n\nIn 2013-2016, I worked at developing a new sustainable product allowing to cross-country ski on the North sea beach sand. This playful response to climate change and innovative way to experience the North Sea shores was nominated for The Hague Innovators' Challenge contest 2016, 2nd round (www.impactcity.nl/innovator/skide).\nFor the research, I successfully completed the Summer School Entrepreneurship & Innovation organized by Venture Lab at University Twente (July 2013, Enschede), participated in the New Venture contest on innovation and sustainability (October 2013-January 2014)(www.newventure.nl), and joined the Information day Europese Instrumenten voor eco-innovatief mkb in Horizon 2020, organized by RVO in Amersfoort (19 May 2014, Amersfoort).",
