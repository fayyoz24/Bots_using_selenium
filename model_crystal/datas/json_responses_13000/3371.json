She facilitated data collection and exchange between DHInfrastructure's local and international teams and reviewed drafts of each project deliverable. She prepared Kenya's water sector PER, which involved preparing an overview of the country's institutional and policy framework, reviewing the sector's budgetary process, and budget allocations and expenditures. She analyzed sector allocation and expenditure trends by subsector, spending category, program, and government administration levels. She then assessed the targeting and relative efficiency of sector spending and estimated the funding, financing, and efficiency gaps in the sector up to 2030. Finally, she identified actionable recommendations for government to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sector spending.",

The assignment consists of four parts: 1.) a stocktaking of the legal, regulatory, and institutional environment and characteristics of the building sector including management, ownership, and financing procedures; 2.) an assessment of potential for energy efficiency improvements and investment needs; 3.) an analysis of the barriers and potential solutions to investment and 4.) development of a road map and areas for donor involvement.\n\nAs co-manager of the assignment, Deborah worked closely with the World Bank team to develop options for the financing and delivery of thermal retrofits to residential and public buildings. To this end she analysed current public financing arrangements, such as the flow of funds and researched alternative modes of public finance such as performance based budgeting and a budget capture mechanism to enable implementation agencies to retain savings from investments in energy efficiency.

For the of the cost-of-service study, AUWSA wanted a financial model that they could use for future tariff filings to the water sector regulator. They also wanted the model to allow them to forecast the impact of increased debt service on its financial performance and tariff levels. AUWSA wanted a willingness-to-pay study to understand how much they could charge for new water connections and septic tank vacuum truck services.\n\nDeborah managed the willingness-to-pay component of the assignment. She developed the survey instrument and recruited and trained a team of enumerators and a survey supervisor to administer the survey. She also worked with the local team to pretest the survey. Deborah also developed a questionnaire and outline to guide the local team in facilitating focus group discussions.

As part of this plan, the Ministry of Public Works Transport and Communications (MOPTC) is preparing a new National Water Supply Policy and revising tariff rates. DHInfrastructure was hired to i) review the Water Services Tariff Policy, ii) confirm that the principles for tariff setting are appropriate, iii) review tariff structure and rates and iv) provide adjustments to ensure that rates are consistent with tariff policy objectives and principles.\n\nDeborah reviewed the draft National Policy on Public Water Supply, ADB technical assistance reports on recent projects to improve the water supply systems in Dili and the district capitals and recent socio-economic surveys conducted in the country. She then traveled to Timor Leste to meet with stakeholders to discuss the proposed tariff principles and collect additional data necessary to building the tariff model. Finally, she and the DHInfrastructure team prepared the financial model which considered various tariff options for Dili and the district capitals. The analysis considered the affordability of new tariffs under various scenarios as well as possible alternative pro-poor measures to protect the vulnerable population.",

Consequently, there are looming concerns about the long-term sustainability of service provision by existing public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements. The World Bank Group (WBG) requested assistance in developing a water sector tariff study for Armenia to assess the levels of the current water and wastewater tariffs in terms of cost-recovery. The World Bank wanted a description of a number of tariff scenarios, taking into account financial, economic, efficiency and equity objectives. Lastly, a plan of actions would be developed to move from the current tariff levels and structure to an agreed future tariff level and structure.\n\nDeborah prepared the affordability and willingness to pay components of the assignment. She helped develop the survey which used the contingent valuation stated preference method. She analysed the results of the survey and reported the findings in the final report. For the affordability section of the study, Deborah calculated the maximum threshold of affordability by various sub groups such as the poor and non-poor. This was conducted using estimated 2012 household expenditures, average water consumption. The results were also projected to 2030, adjusted by % GDP growth, and price elasticity of demand for water. The results will enable the government of Armenia to introduce appropriate mitigation measures if water tariffs (prices) are above the affordability threshold. Finally, Deborah also assisted in building parts of the tariff model. She built a segment of the model which enables the user to determine each tariff block necessary to cover sector costs by customer class.",

            "description": "Belarus relies heavily on imported energy resources (mostly natural gas from Russia) to meet domestic energy demand. In 2009, the cost of natural gas imports constituted 5.2 percent of GDP. While still below the European market prices, import prices of natural gas have been increasing sharply over the last 5 years, as a result, the cost of district heating services has also increased increasing the fiscal burden to the government. The objective of this project was to understand the incidence of current energy subsidies in Belarus, to estimate the poverty and social impacts of proposed tariff and subsidies reform, and to identify and strengthen mechanisms to mitigate negative impacts of tariff increases.\n\nThe World Bank asked DHInfrastructure to analyze the district heating sector of Belarus. To this end, DHInfrastructure examined the legal and institutional framework, and national energy programs related to the district heating sector as well as the current performance and tariff structure of the sector. In addition, DHInfrastructure wrote the final report that incorporated all tasks related to this project, including the social and stakeholder analyses and energy efficiency components.",

Specifically, IDEV wanted to evaluate the quality at entry of the NDEA Strategy, benchmark the NDEA against other major energy initiatives in the region, and develop country case studies to assess ecosystems-based factors to the success or failure of the NDEA's implementation.\n\nDeborah benchmarked the NDEA strategy against comparator strategies from the World Bank, Power Africa, and Agence Franaise de Dveloppement to identify elements that characterize good, effective strategies at multilateral development banks. She analyzed donor reports from each strategy qualitatively using Atlas.ti to evaluate their logical framework, results monitoring framework, and level of commited and available resources (human and financial). Based on this analysis, Deborah scored each strategy and identified areas for improvement that AfDB could adopt in its NDEA strategy. She summarized her analysis in the benchmarking report.",
