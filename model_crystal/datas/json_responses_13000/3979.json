    "summary": "What do you wanna be when you grow up? \n\nMy mom often says that I used to go on and on about wanting to speak many foreign languages and travel all over the world to connect with a considerable amount of passionate, diverse and inspiring individuals. Today I am down to 3 languages (Italian-English-Mandarin Chinese; Spanish & Dutch on the way), 30 visited countries and I recently started calling myself a \"multipotentialite\", i.e. \"an individual with many interests and creative pursuits\" inspired by Emilie Wapnick's TED Talk.\n\nI have grown up being fully involved and positively transformed by my family business that has been operating in the Food & Beverage Industry for more than 45 years, so much that today I happily welcome challenges and hard work, making sure to set the example by doing while emphasising collaboration and communication when managing myself and others. \n\n14+ years in living, studying and working abroad (EU, China, Singapore, U.A.E., Canada & The Netherlands), I quickly identify valuable and strategic solutions to most common and uncommon customer\u2019s pain points, always driven by an entrepreneurial mind.\n\nMy specialties: \n- Management and enhancement of the guest's experience.\n- AM/PM & Night Hotel shifts as HM, Ambassador & Night Ambassador. \n- Performance & customer satisfaction improvement.\n- Capacity to train, coach, communicate & lead in Italian, English and Mandarin Chinese.\n- Ability to exceptionally and positively influence my workmates and my work environment.\n- Events feasibility, planning, build-up & implementation.\n- Curiosity that leads me to endless questions followed by satisfying answers. \n- Liaison and sincerely connect with staff, partners & suppliers.\n- Tour leader for medium size groups worldwide.\n\nI am constantly looking for new projects and teams that allow me to continue to leave an impact and being impacted at the same time, while preferably operating in the Hospitality, PR, Training and Development Industries.  \n\nAttracted to companies that leave space for trust, transparency and personal growth. \n\nVegetarian and sugar- free recipes are one of my favorite pastimes and so is a long walk in a nearby park, which let my imagination run wild while helping me better reconnect with the surrounding world.\nI motivate and network with fellow entrepreneurs, colleagues and friends to create eco-destinations and events, sustainable lifestyles and minds.",

An urge towards understanding how relationships really work and how \"small and big brains\" operate showed up immediately the day that my husband and I started this adventure together. \n\n\u2022 A true understanding of what it means to be empathetic, to offer unconditional love and care kicked in together with realising that the creation of a judgement-free environment requires a good dose of daily practice and the need of actively listening to people around us.",
