    "summary": "I am passionate about leading, energizing and supporting teams to solve technically complex problems that seemed impossible at first sight. To achieve that I am a firm believer in utilizing team diversity in an agile environment using lean tools such as Andon boards and Gemba walks.\n\nI have enjoyed many different roles in project management and petroleum engineering as individual performer, team leader and leader of a community in different cultural environments around the Globe. This is how I came to value diversity and how very different opinions ultimately lead to a better solution.  \n\nIn these roles I have implement lean and agile work practices which is, for someone who is result focussed like myself, really is an energizing experience. I noticed the change in peoples motivation and delivery happen before my eyes resulting in a 50% production increase from the existing assets in a 15 year old field and top quartile performance according to industry benchmarks for my department in multiple locations.\n\nIt also helped me challenge the status quo and drive innovation ranging from implementing new technologies to improve well integrity in the Netherlands to setting up a trial for new contract strategy to enhance execution of additional production optimization projects.\n\nIf you are keen to talk about some of these subjects please feel free to contact me.",
