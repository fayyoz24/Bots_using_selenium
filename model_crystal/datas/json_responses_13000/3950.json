    "summary": "As consultant I focus on the operationalization and commercialization of E-Commerce and E-Logistics networks. Because of my expertise and Asian network, I can give support to many different organizations from CE - to more Technical / Industrial range. Doing business within the Asian market is often underestimated. Without an existing network and knowledge about culture, regulations and strategies, a European company doesn\u2019t make a change in the Asian market. As consultant I also guide companies outside of Europe who would like to enter the European market, I have a broad experience in logistics, distribution models and tax options, and I have extensive knowledge of laws and regulations Customs processes in the EU as well product compliance.",
