    "summary": "\"As an artist, my main interest is to create artworks that evoke emotions in people and allow them to see the world in a different way. I am passionate about experimenting with different textile techniques and materials to find new forms of expression. Additionally, I am interested in promoting sustainability and circular economy in the fashion and art industry, and I have founded my own company for that purpose. I am committed to promoting the culture and art of my country, and I have had the honor of exhibiting my works in important galleries and museums in America, Europe, and Asia.\"\n\n-\nJuliana Garcia Bello (1989) is a native of Tierra del Fuego, a province in southern Argentina.
