    "summary": "I am a senior expert in payments and market infrastructures. As an electrotechnical  engineer by education, initially specialised in telecommunications, I broadened my experience into networks, complexity, economics, policy and strategy.  I have strong analytical skills, deep knowledge of various network applications, extensive international experience and adequate communication skills, particularly for policy advice to board-level. My focus is on getting things done and moved into the right direction, including through cooperation in international groups.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about learning. For me it\u2019s fun to find solutions for complicated topics, be it technical, policy or legal, especially in the more complicated international settings. I like to work with the mix of policy, economics and technology and profit in my daily work from a solid engineering background. Lately I dived into accelerating technologies and researched their increasing impact on society, the economy in particular. See the link here to my paper, that was fun to write: \nhttps://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/OS2_tcm47-372683.pdf\n ",

I made analysis on distributed ledger technology projects, and on the impact central bank digital currencies may have on the financial system. I actively participated in international working groups on payments, on digital innovation, web-payments and central counterparties. My achievements in a high-level Eurosystem Vision2020 task force on the future of the Eurosystem infrastructures included the inception of the Target Instant Payment Settlement service for fast and safe retail payments. Moreover, we commonly specified improved liquidity management of the Eurosystem real-time gross-settlement system, and made the blue print for a common collateral management system for Eurosystem central banks. I took care of both DNB\u2019s and banks\u2019 needs, and stimulated an efficient European solution.\n\nOther strategic work included a collaborative scenario-planning project, to get DNB better prepared for the future (technological) developments in payments. I also carried out a mayor research on the impact accelerating technologies may have on society, and on the way people deal with disruption, non-linearity and complexity theory.

For DNB I provided a wide range of analyses and board briefings for both the development and the go-live of the Eurosystem\u2019s interbank payments system Target2 in 2008, and its system management thereafter. My responsibilities were on preparing DNB for strategic choices of the Eurosystem, policies, the set-up of the legal system of Target2, its costs and pricing policies, requirements and specs. I actively participated in the Eurosystem Working Group on Target2 as well as in wide range of international task forces on legal, migration, cost, pricing, and joint work with oversight, Swift and the banking sector, in order to get things done in the interest of Europe and the Dutch market. I applied the principles for financial markets infrastructure (PFMI) to several payments systems. \n\nAs from 2008 I also worked on the Eurosystem\u2019s agenda to harmonise and integrate its collateral management. I participated in a steering group, a Eurosystem working group and a task force which negotiated the legal terms between the service providers and its users. I wrote a significant part of a system cost offer. In parallel, I ran an evaluation of central bank collateral service for CCP\u2019s.  \n\nAs from 2013 I carried out several analyses on immediate payments for retail, both functional, technical and legal, its fit with Sepa and PSD2, and the options for immediate settlement. I put the topic on the European agenda. I also participated in a BIS group on correspondent banking.\n\nI further developed my skills of getting things done in international meetings, and refined my communication skills (concise board-level briefings). I gained in-depth knowledge of clearing- and settlement systems and the payments market at large.",
