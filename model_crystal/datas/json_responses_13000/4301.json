The project seeks to address the challenges faced by the country's media sector, including political interference, weak institutional frameworks, and limited media independence.\n\nBy promoting good governance, transparency, and accountability, DHMEA aims to enhance the professionalism of journalism and strengthen the relationship between the media and the government. Through capacity-building activities, the project aims to improve media management and professionalism, ensuring higher-quality reporting and adherence to ethical standards and media codes of conduct.\n\nDHMEA also emphasizes the importance of information accuracy and reliability, working towards improving the quality of information provided to the public. By promoting transparency, accountability, and the rule of law, the project aims to create a healthier media environment that fosters democratic values and supports Albania's progress towards European Union accession.\n\nThrough collaborative efforts and partnerships with key stakeholders in the media sector, DHMEA strives to create a sustainable and independent media landscape in Albania, where media outlets can operate freely, journalists can work with integrity, and the public can access accurate and unbiased information.",

Through an interdisciplinary approach, the study explores the multifaceted dimensions of inequality faced by Saudi women, examining societal norms, gender roles, legal frameworks, and cultural barriers. It delves into the paradoxical situation where empowerment reforms coexist with persistent social and cultural disparities that often push women to seek asylum for safety and freedom.",
