    "summary": "I worked as a lawyer at a top tier law firm in New Zealand for approximately three years, where I practised public law, employment law, regulatory law, healthcare law, education law and M\u0101ori (indigenous) law. In addition, I bring a diverse set of skills from my experience in brand activation and social media content creation.\n\nMy experience ranges from assisting with judicial reviews, employment investigations, Treaty of Waitangi settlement negotiations, advocating for clients on their deathbed to have access to specific medication, to launching new FMCG products and increasing sales and ranging on shelves in stores, to capitalising on the latest social media trends. \n\nAside from my work, I have a passion for zumba, soccer, sustainable living, baking, sewing and Asian fusion cuisine. \n\nI have relocated to Amsterdam and am actively seeking new professional opportunities. If you feel I could bring value to your organisation or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.",
