    "summary": "\n\ud83c\udf0eAbout me \n\nAs a committed advocate for peace, social justice, and human rights, I believe in making a positive impact on communities worldwide. My academic journey in Peace and Conflict Studies at Fourah Bay College laid the foundation for my passion for conflict resolution and humanitarian efforts. My quest for a global perspective on development and human rights led me to pursue a Master's at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), specializing in Conflict and Peace Studies.\n\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd1d Mandela Washington Fellow:\nI am proud to be a 2023 Mandela Washington Fellow for Young African Leaders. During this transformative fellowship, I had the privilege of interacting with diverse professionals. These experiences deepened my commitment to community-focused service and advocating for vulnerable populations.\n\u00a0\n\ud83d\udcbc Professional Experience:\nMy journey has led me to work with the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) in Sierra Leone. Additionally, I am working for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to protect the rights and dignity of those in vulnerable situations.\n\u00a0\n\ud83c\udf1f Vision:\nWith a strong academic foundation and a passion for positive change, I am determined to create a more equitable and harmonious world. My ultimate goal is to foster sustainable peace, promote gender equality, and advocate for the rights of the marginalized.\n\u00a0\nJoin me on this journey of empowerment, and let's work together to build a brighter future for all.",
