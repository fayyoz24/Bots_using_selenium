    "summary": "It all started with music. Before I was born, my mother used to put headphones on her stomach so I could listen to Chopin. From that moment on, I\u2019ve sought harmony in everything I do.\n\nIt\u2019s in my DNA - looking for innovative ways of understanding and making sense of the world. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working in Artificial Intelligence for the last 8 years; starting with Biometrics, and then onto Educational Data Mining and Banking. Now, I\u2019m eager to apply my expertise directly to new business challenges!\n\nThanks to my memory and my ease in learning new things, I can quickly connect new problems with solutions, sometimes derived from different areas. I excel at breaking complex ideas down into easily digestible chunks of information, which are reflected in my clear and concise presentations, graphs and writings.\n\nI stay up-to-date with courses and feeds from industry forums, and I immediately put into practice what I learned. I have a practice of planning and documenting \"lessons learned\" in my notebook to avoid reworking.\n \nAs a result of my work excellence, I was named as a finalist in the biggest Spanish data competition. I also received one of six Excellency Fellowships in Spain. Moreover, my supervisor at MIT was so satisfied with my work that he kept me on for an additional 7 months past my original contract date.\n\nAnd as you might have guessed, I like to take my guitar with me when I\u2019m traveling to new places. I\u2019m a discoverer by nature, and I love exchanging ideas and thoughts with people from other cultures \u2013 different people have different approaches to learn from.\n\nMy colleagues and friends can speak highly of my commitment to helping others. They value my perspective and approachability, and they know that I\u2019m someone they can always count on.\n\nSpecialties: Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, Behavior Analysis, Pattern Discovery and Recognition, Big Data, Deep Learning.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: http://bit.ly/angelcv2207",
