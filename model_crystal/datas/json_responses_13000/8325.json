    "summary": "I have over 18 years of marketing and PR experience. After moving from Russia to the Netherlands in 2012, I enriched my knowledge of marketing and PR by taking courses in organizing events, digital marketing, and building business processes. I am attracted to complex projects, they do not allow me to \"stand still\", they force me to develop, and to look for new opportunities. \nI am full of energy, and I have a great desire to work. I like to make goals and achieve them. \nSince 2013, I have been conducting marketing projects, promoting Dutch companies in Eastern Europe and organizing support for Russian-speaking clients of European companies. In addition to commercial projects, I also organize charity events. Theater projects with the participation of blind-deaf actors take a special place in my life: in 2018, I was lucky to organize their tour in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nKnowledge of several foreign languages \u200b\u200b(English, French, Dutch and Russian) and more than 20 years of work in international companies taught me how to build trusting business relationships with colleagues, clients and partners, to respect the difference of cultures and business traditions, solve complex problems and diplomatically get out of difficult situations. And most importantly, to be a useful member of the team and bring the matter to the end. ",
