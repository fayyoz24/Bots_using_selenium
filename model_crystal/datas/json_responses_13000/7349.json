To date, Shakhipur Municipality is managing this co-compost plant. Being an environment-friendly project, it gained many awards. Moreover, it was chosen to exhibit in the 6th South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN VI).\nMy duties included:\nAs a 3d Modeler, I was recruited by WaterAid Bangladesh to prepare two sectional models, drawings on how to set it up, and 3D animations for SACOSAN VI. I also collaborated with Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School (MAWTS), a technical institute to make the models. It helped me make miniatures of the machinery used in the co-compost plan. Models, Drawing, and 3D animation were used as educational materials at the SACOSAN VI conference.",
