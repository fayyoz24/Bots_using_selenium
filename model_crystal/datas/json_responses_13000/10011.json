    "summary": "I recently graduated from Leiden University with a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies. During my studies, I also did a minor in Sustainable Development and took honors classes along with my major. I am interested in sustainable development, international development, international affairs, and \nhumanitarian aid. \n\nCurrently, I am doing an internship at Glocal Group. I am following news in the global economy and energy markets and doing a variety of tasks given by the team. Next to my internship, I am volunteering at Reach and Teach as an English teacher for refugees in The Netherlands. I also volunteer at ReadCYCLE as a PR Manager. \n\nPreviously, I had the experience of working as a student consultant for the municipality of The Hague, FreePressUnlimited, and Derksen and Drolsbach. Apart from my consultancy experiences, I received training in digital marketing from the International Institute of Digital Marketing(TM). During my bachelor's, I was the Vice President of the East Asia Committee in BASIS, a student organization, between 2020-2021.",
