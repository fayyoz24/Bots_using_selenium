Using neural network AI technologies, the game's system attempts to recognize the player's style and adapt the species and world accordingly. This means defensive players will be opposed by more aggressive species, while energetic players would see faster enemies that try to keep up. \n\nIn the world of Pine, human beings never reached the top of the foodchain, leaving them to be a physically inferior species in an exciting open world where other species have developed tools and languages of their own. In an engaging third person action adventure, Pine takes you through the cultures of different species that observe you and will do anything necessary to survive. ",
