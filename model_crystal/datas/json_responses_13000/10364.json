    "summary": "I am a Creative Director & Storyteller with a passion for crafting beautiful stories both in the digital and the physical world. Born & raised in Paris, I have lived in Italy, London and New York. Currently Amsterdam based. \n\nStories are one of the most powerful force shaping our human experience. They have the power to make us feel seen, connected, engaged, empowered. I love working with my clients to create compelling experiences that feel aligned with their mission and vision, from designing an exhibition for the group FIAT showroom on the Champs Elys\u00e9es to directing editorial photoshoots for magazines worldwide. \n\nOver the past 15 years, I have been growing my practice as a detail-oriented creative director, polishing my vision and constantly adding to my skill set. However, one thing hasn't changed: the passion I have for taking on new creative challenges and creating something beautiful out of it. \n\nAbout me: \n\nSHAPESHIFTER \nBeing curious and passionate about a lot of things means I love to take my creativity to new playing grounds. I am a fast learner and will infuse your project with both my enthusiasm and multi-faceted experience in a wide range of skills including:\n\u30fbcreative direction (exhibitions, photoshoots, events)\n\u30fbdigital strategy + storytelling\n\u30fbeditorial photography + interior design\n\u30fbpublic speaking + corporate training\n\u30fbAI architecture + design creation\nThis is a list I am always adding to. \n\nADVENTUROUS\nChange fuels me. I will take a different route to work everyday just to keep things interesting, and I think there\u2019s something to be learned from every experience, good or bad. Tuning in to my environment and the people around me is one of my major sources of inspiration, and I love exploring new concepts, places and ideas that I stumble upon. \n\nCURIOUS\nI am the kind of person who likes going under the skin of things as they seem, by practicing heightened awareness of her environment and maintaining an active curiosity for ideas and people alike. Interrogating the things around me rather than passively looking at them is a powerful way for me to stay mindful, engaged and connected. \n\nPURPOSEFUL\nAfter a very intense phase of my career, I have made the conscious choice a few years ago to slow down and move with intention towards a more purposeful chapter of my professional journey. I believe in sustainability and circularity as key concepts, not only as an absolute necessity in regard of climate urgency, but also in designing a new model of society based on connection rather than consumption, inclusion rather than exclusion.",
