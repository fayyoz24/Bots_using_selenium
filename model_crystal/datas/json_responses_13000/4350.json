A second experimental research line covers the catalytic activity of different oxygen carriers for tar reduction in biomass gasification. Additional activities include guiding Master Students during the graduation project and giving support in tutorials for different lectures, and writing research papers and abstract for conferences.",

The project achieved a 25% cycle time reduction and 35% throughput increase.\nCollaborating in the implementation of a new online viscosity estimation for the control of reaction time of alkyds reactors, batch-to-batch variations were decreased in 45%.",
