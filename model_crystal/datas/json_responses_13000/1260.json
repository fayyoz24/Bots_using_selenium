Through efficient stakeholder engagement, exploration and the production asset agreed to step away from booking small polygons around wells towards de-risking the entire area with a limited number of exploration wells, followed by a series of appraisal wells. The project went from initiation to first well in 6 months, and now fills the entire sequence for one rig in 2014. Authored the well proposals for the exploration wells, operational well owner for the first 3 wells.\n",

Rather than individual prospects, three projects (6 prospects) were included in the 5 year business plan for 2016. Another 96 prospects were handed over to the production assets for fast-tracked development.\nThe second project highlighted 3 potential areas for growth in the Ara play, and delivered one project (3 prospects) for the 2016 business plan.\n\nThe developed method was successfully applied to the rest of the exploration portfolio, driving the change from individual prospects to projects, and is taken up as a standard in the exploration-maturation process. The new process allows for value-drive, cost-neutral exploration and leads to more stability in the drill cycle.",
