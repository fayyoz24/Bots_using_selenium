    "summary": "Experienced and knowledgeable in the field of victims participation in international criminal proceedings. I also have strong analytical skills and experience in management of information within the international justice and law institutions. Excellent drafting skills in legal, para-legal, and public information material. Proficient in managing, organizing, and analyzing evidentiary and media material. Practiced in collecting information and conducting interviews with witnesses and victims.\n\nI have solid experience in interacting with vulnerable individuals, specifically victims of terrorism. I have worked directly in assisting victims in their participation in the proceedings, from assisting in the application process, to working in a legal team of representing their interests. Currently working on co-publishing a chapter on supporting traumatised victims in legal proceedings.\n\nI am a highly qualified professional, with skills in strategic planning, event organizing, public relations within the field of development and justice, seeking to share knowledge and learn at the same time.\n\nOn an academic level, I have recently been driven toward the field of law and victimisation from a psychological point of view. \n\nI am also interested in research work or post graduate studies on the forming of resistance movements from the grassroots. I am interested in  analyzing and drawing comparative lines to uncover the potential links and intersectionalities among different struggles in different parts of the world, and understand the basic formation of resistance to be able to produce a better foresight to the development of resistance in today's world. This interest stems from my voluntary work with Palestine Link, a Dutch NGO working to bring forth the Palestine question and create awareness about the conflict. It also stems from my work with alQaws and other initiatives on the struggle of sexual and gender diversity in the Palestinian society that is coupled with the struggle against the occupation.\n\nI have an experience working with NGOs in Palestine,whic have added a uniqueness to my professional experience.\n\nSpecialties&Skills: Interacting with [traumatised] vulnerable individuals + Victims' Participation in International Criminal Proceedings + Analysis of evidence and media + Managerial and Strategic Planning + Event organizing + Language skills",
