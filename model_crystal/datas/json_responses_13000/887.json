    "summary": "Victor joined the University of Cape Town\u2019in 2007. He then worked for Shell international in the Netherlands as Research Statistical analyst responsible for business mathematical modeling in the Knowledge Management Department. His research involves dynamic business modeling, including multilevel structural equation modeling, linear and non-linear interactive class modeling and latent growth curves. Past research endeavors included publications to repuatble journals (SACLA, IEEE and ICEL) on knowledge management systems models and inference. \n\nCurrently, apart from providing lectures in Functional Analysis and Mathematical Methods much of the work is focused on measure theories, in sigma algebras. It is anticipated that special fields and operational theories could be an effective way to induce synergy between far spaced domains, henceforth speeding up conversion of theory into practice.       \n\nOther research interests include, statistical inference in business processes, probability theories as applied to business modeling, knowledge management systems models, and e-Business Strategy. \n\n\nOther vested interests include applications of Mathematical modeling in business and inference; using Atlas ti in qualitative consultancy and research. \n\nFrom  mathematics to computing and modeling \"business\", it has all been trying to see what is transitory in what is permanent and what is permanent in what is transitory. Once some levels of mastery is obtained, we can then be more certain in isolating and applying our specific reasons to specific areas of need!",
