    "summary": "Let's talk about VIEC, because it's also me. \nWe believe that the supply chain from manufacturers to Consumers could be shorter and even be direct. Therefore in 2011 VIEC was found to serve this idea, to connect manufacturers directly to wholesalers, so that to make the supply chain more efficient, to add more value and profit to the whole supply chain and most importantly for the end users. \nIn 2017 we have accomplished to bring products directly from factory in the Netherlands to Vietnamese consumers via cross-border e-commerce in less than 10 days.",

A commercial representative acts as internal personnel for manufacturers, answering inquiries related to the products. Simultaneously, the representative also acts on behalf of the buyers, providing manufacturers with the latest updates about the market and distribution.\n\nRight now, the world is seeing a new trend in the modern world of international commerce. The modern supply chain needs to be and will be shorter, more efficient to create more profit and shorten the time from the factory to the door of the consumers. Factories want to engage directly with consumers to evolve their products, which better matches customers\u2019 needs. Simultaneously, consumers want to have their goods faster with more value. Especially in the case of the FMCG sector, it\u2019s getting even more rapidly. From Fast Moving Consumer Goods, people are now expecting Faster Moving Consumer Goods.  The traditional system of intermediary won\u2019t function properly and effectively in this new age. Instead, the ability to sell directly will significantly benefit all the parties.\n\nBring your products to The Netherlands and/or Vietnam - Let's Think BIGGER with VIEC",
