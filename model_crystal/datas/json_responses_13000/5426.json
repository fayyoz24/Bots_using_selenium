    "summary": "I am a financial engineer with 10 years of work experience in Bolivian banking. I started working in the commercial area to build experience, since I always aimed to work in risk assessment. The most important skill for this position is paying attention to details, and being myself perfectionist and demanding with my work helped me to be successful on this role.\nAfter working for so long in the Bolivian banking system, I felt that something was missing and I decided to move to The Netherlands. I want to broad my horizons and discover the world.  \nI am very eager to find new challenges in this country that will allow me to continue growing professionally. I adapt easily to new environments and leaving my comfort zone is not a problem for me.",
