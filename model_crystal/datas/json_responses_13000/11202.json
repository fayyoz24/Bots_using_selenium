    "summary": "\u201cVin is a discoverer of entrepreneurs. I think he has the powers to create ones. He is my guide to entrepreneurship.\u201d \n- Neli Benova, Manager of Apeiron Communication.\n\nDoing better business \n\nWhen companies want to boost efficiency, the first place they usually look is to where they can cut costs. This usually means by slashing personnel. \nWhat they forget is that company performance can also be boosted by getting more out of your people, rather than letting them go. \nBut how to do this? How to improve your people\u2019s performance both effectively and efficiently? Our answer: Entrepreneurship. By helping your people to work better together, communicate more effectively, and empowering them to see more opportunities, your human resources can also be your best resources in boosting performance and doing better business. \n\n\u201cVin is a person who can change your life. After you answer his questions he is able to exactly feel the weak point of business and suggest the concrete changes needed. His recommendations may hurt your feelings, because they immediately take your rose-colored glasses away. It\u2019s worth listening to his advice if you want to succeed in the future.\u201d\n- Lubomir Lekov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Investor.BG AD.\n",
