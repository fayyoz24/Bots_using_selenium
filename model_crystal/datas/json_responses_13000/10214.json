    "summary": "\" Environmentalism without social justice is just gardening\", Chico Mendes\n\nMSc graduate in Environmental Sciences at Wageningen University (The Netherlands) with a specialization in human rights in climate systems transformation.  \n\nCurrently, I am the youth Italian delegate at the Y20 India, the youth engagement group for the G20. I am also part of the Young Scientists Group at the World Food Forum where I am contributing with my lens in gender equity to agrifood systems. As a Climate Change researcher at LINKS Foundation, I am mostly working on European projects about sustainable cities and communities.  \n\nMy interests lie in connecting human rights and environmental discourse to local capacity-building initiatives. Creativity, empathy, critical thinking, diversity, cooperation and climate action are my key values in my professional and private life.\n\nI like thinking of negative life experiences as broken pots of Kintsugi Japanese art. This art shows that a person is more beautiful with her/his/their golden cracks.",

With this information, an advice was given about cultivation and agricultural methods, including a broad agricultural planning. Finally, processing opportunities of these medicinal plants were explored to examine which secondary products could be feasible for the Qashqai people to commercialise on local and international markets.
