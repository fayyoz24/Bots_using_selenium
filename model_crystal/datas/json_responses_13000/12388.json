    "summary": "SMATI Hadjer is a marine sciences and coastal planning engineer, specializing in marine biology and marine ecology with a focus on marine biotechnology. Currently, she is pursuing a master's degree in applied economics at the European Institute of Marine Studies and the Agrocampus Institute in Brittany, with a specialization in the sea, environment, and agriculture.\n\nMarine Biotechnology is a field gaining significant importance, combining various biotechnologies (white, green, red, and blue) with synthetic biology to create sustainable management solutions for genetic resources and food production. By integrating cutting-edge technologies with marine resources, it aims to develop valuable goods and services.\n\nHadjer's decision to pursue both marine biotechnology and applied economics was motivated by several factors. Firstly, the economic challenges posed by marine biotechnology and agricultural revolutions worldwide, in both northern and southern regions, require a comprehensive understanding of their impact and potential contributions to sustainable development. Secondly, her dual training allows her to analyze the broader implications of blue biotechnologies. \n\nHadjer's primary interests encompass:\n\n1) Algae Valorization: focusing on the extraction and utilization of bioactive compounds, including pigments, lipids, proteins and amino acids, polysaccharides, bioactive peptides, antimicrobial compounds, and biofertilizers. Fascinated by the characterization of polymers derived from algae. this approach contributes significantly to the development of a sustainable bio-based economy.\n\n2) Marine Bioprospecting: aims to explore the marine environment to identify novel genetic resources with commercial potential. Can lead to discoveries of new drugs, enzymes, and functional ingredients for various industries.\n\n3) Fisheries Management: regulating and conserving fish populations to ensure their long-term viability and maintain ecological balance within marine ecosystems.\n\nThese areas of interest serve as the foundation for Hadjer's potential research tasks, reflecting her personal motivation and dedication to advancing marine biotechnology and sustainable utilization of marine resources.",

Three sessions have been completed so far between 2018 and 2019; the pandemic of (COVID-19) has prevented the fourth session scheduled for 2020. The sessions were chaired by Ms Rena Lee of Singapore in New York (USA), who proposed an organisation of work into informal groups, which were discussed under four main themes.\n- Marine genetic resources (MGR), benefit sharing issues \n- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA);\n- Area-based management tools (ABMT), including marine protected areas;\n- Capacity building and transfer of marine technologies (CB & TT).\nIn this research, we first explain the origin of these debates between the different parliaments. We looked at marine genetic resources and benefit sharing. We also explored the management tools and capacity building for the exploitation of marine genetic resources. At the end, we discussed some perspectives for the fourth session 2022, issues under negotiation for the finalisation of the treaty.",

The present Master's degree is therefore conceived as a preliminary evaluation of the potential for the valorisation of marine macro-algae in Algeria. This analysis has enabled a first inventory of marine macro-algae species of biotechnological interest to be made. An attempt to evaluate the needs of the Algerian consumer and the position of Algeria in the world macro-algae market was also carried out, followed by a stage in which standard sheets were drawn up, based on mental maps and graphic design (originality of the work). \nFinally, this work enabled us to select the taxa that could meet these needs according to the criteria of abundance, environment, etc. \nWe constructed the analysis matrix (external factors: strengths and weaknesses, internal factors: opportunities and threats) to take stock of the main development areas of the marine macro-algae sector in Algeria, the good practices to be perpetuated, the obstacles and the avenues for improvement to be followed.\nAt the end we carried out a feasibility study for the valorisation of the species, and a study on the environmental impact.",
