    "summary": "My passion is to take sustainability into common agreements and practice! \n\nI have a Master's Degree in Development Studies with an Economic Development specialization from the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus Rotterdam University, and I am an Economist from the University of Antioquia. \n\nFrom 2014 to 2023, I worked at the NGO Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM), particularly in the creation, governance, multi-stakeholders consultations, assurance and maintenance of responsible mining standards: Fairmined and CRAFT, as well as managing multiple projects.\n\nI have interacted with all gold supply chains, from the Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining miners to downstream companies, standards setter\u2019s organizations, and thematic experts. I have created different procedures, methodologies and guidance documents related to the management of the Fairmined Certification and the creation of Standards for promoting better practices in the sector. \n\nMy areas of interest are Sustainable Development, Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainability, Standards, and Knowledge management.\n\nI consider myself an active woman, leader, responsible and passionate about contributing with my work to the current sustainability challenges. I am eager to learn and be better every day.",
