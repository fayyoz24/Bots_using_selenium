I did this out of an acknowledgment that: Investing in women and girls is not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do. That\u2019s because each action you take to increase a woman\u2019s access to equal opportunities benefits your community, country, and continent. As part of this campaign, I helped a group of 8 girls with money to pay for their school and exam fees in Zimbabwe. This ranged from paying for 2 -4 subjects. I also showcased the study project and creative hub I set up for children, mostly girls in Seke, Zimbabwe."
