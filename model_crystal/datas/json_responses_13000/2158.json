    "summary": "I am a geoscientist in oil and gas exploration by background, but have specialized in the field of data management / data science during my professional carreer. I have experience in data management, data science and leading data related projects. These data related projects range from exploration through asset operations to decom activities, supporting the entire Wintershall Noordzee company. Having worked as a seismic interpreter, petrophysicist and well log witnees have tought me to quickly understand the problems raised by those departments in the realm of data science, which enables me to translate the problems to solutions. Currently, I am leading a team of archivists, data managers and data engineers in the office in Rijswijk. In this role I also also manage the joint industry projects for the geoscience department (new technology studies mainly with TNO) and I am certified for (log witnessing) offshore work",
