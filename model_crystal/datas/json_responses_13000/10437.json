The use of these by-products brings an abundance of opportunities but also challenges on microbial threat. \n\nTherefore, I looked beyond the farmer, further into the food chain. This triggered me to create the Selko Revalet product line for preservation of by-products at the food and beverage production stage. Reducing the microbial challenge right at the source, while preserving the nutritional value and making them available as alternative raw materials for animal protein production.\n\nWith my background in animal health care and feed safety, a passion for upcycling by-products I like to think out of the box and in solutions to support Nutreco\u2019 purpose of \u201cFeeding the Future\u201d.",
