    "summary": "From 2002 till 2012 I wrote for the British Oxford-based magazine Contemporary Review. This magazine was founded in 1866 as a platform for intelligent discussion and debate. Contributors were, amongst others, W.E. Gladstone, J.M. Barrie and Aldous Huxley. In 1956 Contemporary Review acquired Fortnightly, founded by Anthony Trollope. Unfortunately, the last printed edition was published in 2013. Since then the magazine has been \u2018dormant\u2019.\nSpecializing in contemporary history and international affairs, I'd rather see myself more as a generalist than a specialist. In Contemporary Review I have published a wide variety of articles, book reviews and interviews. Some examples of my articles are:\n\u201cThe Netherlands: From Euroscepticism to Europhoria\u201d (2001)\n\u201cEurope and the New Constitution\u201d (2004)\n\u201cQueen Juliana of the Netherlands, 1909-2004\u201d (2004)\n\u201cMulticulturalism in the Netherlands and the Murder of Theo Van Gogh\u201d (2005)\n\u201cVoters in the Netherlands Defy the European Constitution\u201d\n\u201cGeorge Kennan: The Career of a Cold War Diplomat\u201d (2006)\n\u201cDutch Politics: Exchanging Neo-Liberalism for Social Conservatism\u201d (2007)\n\u201cThe Dutch Commission\u2019s Report on the Iraq War\u201d (2010)\n\u201cThe Netherlands and its Minority Government\u201d (2011)\n\u201cEurope: Quo Vadis?\u201d (2012)\nAside from articles I have also written many book reviews and conducted interviews. In 2014 I contributed to \u201cFarewell MD-11\u201d: this publication looks at the twenty years of service of this three-engined icon McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. \u201cFarewell MD-11\u201d was published in October 2014 by KLM Flight Operations.\n\nI am always on the lookout for writing opportunities and will continue to do so. It is, however, my aim to combine my work in aviation with a (new) career in education. When I was a student I gained my first experience in education through a course at university and I also taught for two years at a tourism and hospitality school. I want to find a school that is willing to give me the opportunity to teach whilst obtaining my teaching degree.",
