    "summary": "I have been interested in genetics and biology since secondary school and studied biomedical sciences at Oxford Brookes and biology at Liverpool John Moores for my undergraduate degree. It is during these years I became interested in working in bioinformatics and moved to Amsterdam and completed the bioinformatics and systems biology master course at the VU and UvA. \n\nI currently live in Groningen and work as a PhD student in the genetics department at the UMCG. My research focus is on linking genetic variation to phenotypic outcomes through gene expression using eQTL analysis in single-cell data. With this goal I work with the single-cell eQTL consortium which has created a pipeline to allow groups to easily collaborate and contribute to a meta-analysis method with high power to discover many cell type specific eQTLs.",
