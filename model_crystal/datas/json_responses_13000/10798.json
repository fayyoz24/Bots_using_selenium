    "summary": "Actively looking out for opportunities in NL. Previously, I was employed with Sony Gulf FZE for 6 years, as a Product Marketing Manager for Sony Portable Audio Division. Deep diving into the mind of the customer and competition, the logical reasoning behind one\u2019s buying decision, communicating convincingly and executing with conviction to the consumer to deliver the best brand experience of the marketed product, and finally scaling for upward future growth with an unwavering brand loyalty is a way of working I adopted in my journey as a Product Marketing manager. \n\nI slowly built on this foundation of marketing by taking the plunge into corporate sales for major IT firms Accenture and Capgemini prior to working at Sony, providing marketing and sales support to many of their energy and utility clients for 4 years. And from there paving my way into a Global MBA specializing in Marketing Management, thus being adept at interpersonal skills, cross-cultural communication and understanding the ways of working of big brands. \n\nApart from honing and utilising my marketing skills for the companies I work for; on a personal front, I work pro bono as a Marketing & Advertising consultant for a food services company in Mumbai which kicked off as an entrepreneurial stint. I enjoy travelling, obsessed with meeting new people and have documented my travel experiences, stories and photos from my travel in an online travel journal - www.amysmorningbrew.com. In addition to this, I am a seasoned Bharata Natyam dancer and a newbie in Kathak dancing. ",
