    "summary": "I enable leaders, teams and organisations in being relevant and purposeful. \n\nI work with two main types of organisations:\n\nThe first are those scaling up; they are growing their customer base so fast & onboarding so many newcomers so quickly they need support in creating focus and determining the pace of growth. I help them in building a coalition to setup and realise a critical path and creating the systems, behaviours, practices and mindset needed for execution-as-learning (knowing that as a scaleup, what got you here, won\u2019t get you there).\n\nThe second are those potentially reaching a growth stall point. I help them 1. reframe their assumptions for which customers they create value and how they make money by delivering what they promise at an appropriate cost; and 2. develop innovative capabilities by overcoming biases to spot new growth opportunities and create new product/service offerings.\n\nI work across industries and sectors (corporate, non-corporate, public). Leaders & teams I work with experience my ability to quickly learn and understand the nuances of their business without being an in-depth expert. I am uniquely masterful in translating abstract into pragmatic; helping teams go from insights and inspiration, to deciding & committing on shared vision & path forward and developing capabilities & practices to execute & realise their goals.\n\nI am a partner at ELP Network where we architect new ways of value creation that organisations need to stay relevant in today\u2019s complex world. \n\nAreas of expertise:\n\u2022\tcustomer engagement \n\u2022\tinnovation capability building\n\u2022\tvision development & realisation\n\u2022\tstrategic design & realisation\n\u2022\tstakeholder engagement & supplier partnerships\n\u2022\tteam & leadership development",
