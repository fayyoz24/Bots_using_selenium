    "summary": "Derk Loorbach is director of Drift and Professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam. He was amongst the first researchers to develop the concept and approach of transition management. He started his professional career working as researcher for the International Centre for Integrative Studies (ICIS), Maastricht University, directed by Prof. Jan Rotmans, founder of transition management research. Within his research, Derk focuses on the development of transition management in theory and practice through theory development and action research. In 2004 he started, together with Jan Rotmans, the Dutch Research Institute for Transitions (Drift) at the Erasmus University Rotterdam where he received his PhD in June 2007. In 2011 he became director of Drift.\nCentral theme in his research is the development of an integrated framework for structuring transition management activities and for organizing transition management processes. Transition management is a new governance-model based on complex systems\u2019 thinking and is aimed at facilitating and directing processes of societal change in the direction of sustainability.\nHe is at the forefront of developing science and practice of transitions. He is very well cited in this field and publishes frequently on new insights and practices of transitions as well as with colleagues in other parts of the world active in the field. He has an extensive network in Europe as well as Japan and Australia, where the transitions approach is used. He has been successful in bringing in research funds as well as funding from government and business for experimental applied transition projects. Examples are The Interreg funded MUSIC (applying transition management in 5 European cities), the FP7 funded InContext (applying transition management in the area of sustainable communities in three European countries) and an Australian ARC grant (focusing on actor dynamics in transitions), one of the most competitive researchs funds in Australia.",

                    "description": "Over the past few years, fundamental changes, or transitions, in the socio-economic domain have drawn increasing attention. The field of transition research started as experimental research and governance in typical sustainability areas (energy, mobility, housing, water management, resources), but has gradually focused more on domains such as health care and liveable neighbourhoods. The dynamics of transitional change in the social domain have however still been underconceptualized and potentially could play a major role in the broader transition to a sustainable society.\n\nI will focus on two interrelated perspectives. On the one hand the transition from the traditional top-down, market-based society based on institutions, representative democracy, liberalized but highly regulated social services to a society with a mix of democratice forms, effective and decentralized social services, ecologically and socially just. This includes a focus on social systems such as health care, education, welfare, labor market and neighbourhoods. On the other hand i will focus on the transition from a linear and monetary based economy to a circular value based economy. This includes the more fundamental debate upon transitions in the financial system as well as the shift from linear waste-based production to ciruclar models, complementary currencies and the social economy.\n\nI will explore these two perspectives simultaneously, as i see that these could potentially reinforce and strengthen each other. Ideally, we are able to use new possibilities of social organisation, technology and governance to move towards more inclusive, engaged, diverse and just societies in which living within ecological and economic boundaries is valued and normal and social serv ices are effective, affordable and accessible to all. From the experiences with transition research over the past decade, i will bring my theoretical as well as practical engagement to hopefully contribute to this transition.",
