    "summary": "After I finished my studies in French Language & Culture, I completed a master's degree in education. With my diplomas in my pocket, I spent a school year in France teaching at a lyc\u00e9e near Paris. Inspired by the French culture, and with solidified language skills I returned to the Netherlands to start a job in an international school in Amsterdam. I loved teaching, connecting with students from all over the world, seeing them learn. There is something about international education that really makes me tick. It's meaningful, it's this incredible intercultural space where we see young people grow, develop and become more and more independent, knowledgable and competent in navigating themselves in today's world. Let's not forget the things they teach us too. Not a day is the same. \n\nI'm still in education, at the same school, but in a different role. I've moved on to a Head of Campus position. I am responsible for the secondary school at our South East location. On a daily basis I think about how we can continue to provide high quality international education, where our IB students become life long learners. How we support our staff in delivering it and how we maintain valuable connections with our parent community are two other areas I look at. Our school is very dynamic, in constant transition from one phase to the next. I enjoy taking the AICS to the next level. ",
