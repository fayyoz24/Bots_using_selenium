    "summary": "I am a seasoned business developer with an MBA degree and 9+ years of experience across various areas - product and innovation management, digital and trade marketing, strategy development, and entrepreneurial environments. There is nothing I love more than solving complex challenges and bringing to life brands and business solutions that make an impact on consumers. I advocate the use of data as well as consumer and market insights in order to understand the evolving needs of society.\n\nMy experiences from working in a cross-functional and multi-cultural environment have taught me the values of empathy, collaboration, and resilience. I bring with me knowledge that has been shaped with both global and local perspectives, a journey that began from the Philippines, to France, to the US, and now based in the Netherlands. \n\nSome takeaways from my journey (so far):\n+ Energy and gusto come from understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d\n+ Embrace the art of pausing, allowing some space to reflect on the moment, that could have resulted in a different outcome\n+ In every journey, there\u2019s always an opportunity either to learn or to unlearn \n\nOutside of work, you will see me in the kitchen, my playground to curate recipes or someplace cozy doing meditation and yoga.\n\nMy ikigai [reason for being]: To do well by doing good.",
