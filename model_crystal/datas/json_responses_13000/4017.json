For Deltares, I enjoy setting up  and maintaining relations with Korean researchers and engineers. Key focus is to jointly address challenges in R&D and commercial projects and grow our knowledge levels. Relations have been established with key research institutes and universities as well as with large engineering companies and water companies. It is great to create knowledge networks between Deltares' experts and Korean counterparts and to get fruitful cooperation off the ground. Next to coordination, I help our specialists with doing business in East Asia and understanding (business) culture.",
