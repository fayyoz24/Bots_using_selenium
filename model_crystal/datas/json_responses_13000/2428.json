    "summary": "Recently, I completed my MSc Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory at Leiden University. During this time, I was also a student assistant at the Mathematical Institute of this University.\n\nIn 2019, I completed my bachelor\u2019s in industrial and Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology. As part of the bachelor\u2019s I completed a minor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha in Mathematics and Physics. Among others, I followed the course Modern Geometry, which discussed axiomatic Euclidean and elliptic geometry. This greatly increased my interest in the field of geometry. As such, I decided to do my bachelor thesis on axiomatic projective geometry.\n\nBecause of its expertise in geometry, I decided to pursue a master\u2019s degree at Leiden University, which is a two-year program. Since I had to catch up some of the necessary background knowledge, I spent extra time in catching up on subjects such as ring and field theory, which are part of the bachelor\u2019s program at Leiden University. At the moment, I\u2019m on track to complete my master's degree in the summer of 2021.\n\nOutside of academics, I am an avid writer for online communities. Of course, these communities are entirely international, so all articles I have written were in English, giving me an excellent grasp on the language. It also has given me experience working in global communities with all kinds of different people.\n\nI am an ambitious person and have always looked for extra challenges that align with my interests, from taking Cambridge Level English classes and following masterclasses at high school to finding a supervisor for my custom bachelor thesis and being a student assistant. As I am an independent person, I am very capable of working on my own, but I prefer working in (research) groups, as I believe discussion can greatly aid in creating ideas and solutions.",
