    "summary": "An advocate of change within business-as-usual systems to increase efficiency and achieve development targets that are sustainable. With an academic background in economics, environmental science, and sustainable development, I am interested in development that is nested in a trans-disciplinary framework of environmental, social and economic considerations. \n\nI work at SouthSouthNorth in the climate development space on the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme as a project manager. Simultaneously, I am completing my Masters in Energy and Development at the University of Cape Town specialising in climate-resilient energy infrastructure focusing on incorporating climate change considerations into the plan and design of hydropower infrastructure.
