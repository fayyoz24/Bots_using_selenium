As I direct the dialogue to stay on track and within the topic of discussion and ensure all voices are heard there may be issues of conflict that arise. It is within this role that I have increased my ability to resolve conflict and bridge differences in the process. \n\nIf you have read this far, and I know this is not very LinkedIny, I have stolen this next quote from another facilitator and I think it is always nice to repeat it, \"when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise,\" - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. With Soliya, I have truly found that all voices and stories are heard and it is truly beautiful to see in depth discussion of critical and conflictual issues being discussed respectfully, with open minds, hearts, personal stories and critical thinking.",
