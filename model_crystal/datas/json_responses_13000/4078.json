    "summary": "I am an open-mind individual who currently studying at the University of Leeds with MA Advertising & Marketing. Influenced by my parents who have been running their own business in China since 1998, I have a strong perception of external & internal business environment and marketing. That's the reason why I chose to further study in Leeds on Advertising & Marketing after two years work experience.\n\nAfter graduated from my university in China in 2013, I got my first job in Shanghai as a video planner in an advertising filmmaking agency. In that company, I created the big idea to help my clients to transfer their needs into marketing language, create video advertising through various platforms. I successfully managed all the projects and then quickly got my promotion as a senior planner within two months. \nIn 2014, I was employed by Genting Jeju Development Co Ltd which was a China and Singapore joint-venture and multi-cultural company in South Korea. As an executive admin secretary,  I helped admin VP to create weekly and monthly financial plan and operation plan. Also, I communicated with different countries' colleagues using Chinese, English and Korean.\n\nI'm interested in Advertising and Marketing communication. Thus, when I graduate from the University of Leeds, I would like to find relevant work opportunities as I have a strong educational background and rich work experience as well.",
