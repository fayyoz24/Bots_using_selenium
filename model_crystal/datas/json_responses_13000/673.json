I create space for everyone to be involved in shaping the future and to make a positive impact on their organization.\n\nI highly enjoy providing (Scrum) training and workshop facilitation. As a trainer & facilitator, I help teams and groups to do their best thinking and to find local solutions to persistent challenges. \n\nMy toolkit is packed with facilitation techniques, of which Liberating Structures are the most prominent. They make everyone feel heard, seen, and respected and help me get the most out of group interactions. \n\nI write blog posts, host meetups, and speak at conferences to share my lessons learned.",
