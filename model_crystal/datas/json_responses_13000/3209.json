Sure, I recommend you to read \u201cThe Importance Of Being Elsewhere\u201d by Philip Larkin (1922-1985).\n\nOver a period of ten years I worked in the USA (Gwen Frostic School of Art at Western Michigan University), in Denmark (Designskolen Kolding), in Great Britain (University of Derby) and in India (Unitedworld Institute of Design at Karnavati University).\n\nAmidst the first covid explosion in 2020 while leaving Mumbay to head for the North\u2014the contrast could not be bigger\u2014I decided to work on my own stuff solely. Meanwhile my autonomous portfolio including sequences of self organising drawings and dynamic repeat patterns is expanding and should be unlocked. Aside, I am preparing  a script about \"The Act of Preparing\" the important activity which is becoming rare (amongst designers).",

The proposal (one.zero) is a serious attempt to embed Computer Literacy, Creative Coding and Computational Thinking in an aligned, progressive and all-inclusive program of three years.\n\nMeanwhile, I decided to end my career as I started, that is by exploring Computing solely. I am programming in both Logo and Processing (Turtle Graphics). My Computer (pen up, pen down) Graphics are recursive, self-organizing systems and thus somehow related to the inspiring work of John Henry Holland (1929-2015) and others connected to the Santa Fe Institute in the early (19)80s. In the near future, I hope to explore, develop, and present some more--what I call--\"Dynamic Self Organising Repeat Patterns\".",

From 2011-2013\nI have been teaching four courses during fall and spring semesters at Gwen Frostic School of Art (Western Michigan University [> http://www.wmich.edu/art/home.php]) : Graphic Design for Non Majors (ART 2450), Color for Graphic Design (ART 2500), Typography 3 (ART 3510), and Visual Systems (ART 3600). On top of this load I have been advising and guiding twenty senior students who were working on their individual final Research Projects (ART 4610). \n\nAmerica has been very inspiring to me. Not only did I produce a number of colorful animations, I started to research \u2018The Goethe and Albers Triangles on the World Wide Web\u2019, and shared my interest with Brenda Danilowitz, the conservator of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation in Bethany (CT), who received my initiative with enthusiasm.",
