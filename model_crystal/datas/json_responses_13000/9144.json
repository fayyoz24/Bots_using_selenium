The prototype introduces new ways to look at risk, namely by allowing interactive drill down on EOD data from the top (i.e. Ressort) to bottom (i.e. Trade) and by introduction of new risk filters (e.g. Leverage and Concentration Risk). Datawatch is a complement to existing RiskSaver by increasing the capability to detect problematic portfolios at an early stage, ideally even before RiskSaver. \n\nThe TLS Prototype was successfully deployed after several months of collaboration with CRO Change, TLS IT and PTG.\n\nThe prototype was built using strategic components in the presentation layer (secure RDA, RDP), approved interim components for data (Filebroker) and an early model of a small business-aligned Scrum team to deliver it.\n\nDemos internal to the project team, user training and a quarter of testing would follow.\n\nI was responsible for the Deployment in UAT/Prod and for the Filebroker interfaces setup.",
