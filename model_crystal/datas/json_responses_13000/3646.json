    "summary": "\"A guerrilla\". I have not found a better word to describe my work and attitude as a Creative Director for both capitalist and worthy things over a period of more than a decade. I have relied on my ability to make use of whatever resources I have at hand and employ those in opposition to the ruling belief of how things ought to be done. With a solid strategy and open mind to people I have found inspiration in applying innovative means to challenge existing structures and conformity across a variety of categories including international companies on an Eastern European scale and have been blessed with assembling teams that follow me on this vision.",

Since then it has expanded not only the range of subjects it presents, but also the kind of people attending it. For this year's edition our task was to shift the perception of documentary films even further and provide them as a culturally relevant alternative to mainstream entertainment heavily consumed throughout Russia. It was decided to address this issue by using the festival's identity as key medium to promote the message in public.\n\nWe first chose to position the documentaries as real\u2013life alternatives to Holywood blockbusters. We explored the subjects addressed during the festival and sourced the films for keywords that are highly relevant for contemporary Russian society. Combining these words into lists we made them resemble specific movie genres and disrupted the common style of using imagery in poster designs by opting for bold type instead. This style became the foundation of the new visual identity and language of communication.\n\nBeat Film Festival was held in Moscow for the eight time this year and set a new record of participants. 20753 people attended screenings, discussions, Master Classes and after\u2013parties. 15% more than 2016. Our approach was extended to merchandise and has since become collector's item for fashion and interior design.\n\nCreative Director: Gatis M\u016brnieks\nArt Director: Ricardo d'Avila\nCopywriter: Fernando Brandt\nCopywriter: Alexandra Fedoseeva",
