    "summary": "I am a pedagogue and researcher specializing in oral and creative musical development, boasting over 15 years of experience. Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with diverse groups of children and adults, harnessing the power of their body and voice as the most natural and accessible instruments.\n\nFollowing my undergraduate studies in Iran and France, I embarked on pedagogy studies at The Royal Conservatorium of The Hague in September 2009. Since then, I have dedicated my time to exploring, studying, and implementing various renowned methods and philosophies of musical development, including Dalcroze, Kodaly, Suzuki, Orff, Gordon, and others. By integrating these different perspectives, I strive to create a pupil-oriented teaching approach that draws upon the strengths of each method.\n\nMoreover, one of my most rewarding and challenging endeavors has been leading and working with groups of children and adults, where I incorporate contemporary views and techniques. This allows me to cater to special communities or unique situations in a creative and inspiring manner, fostering teamwork and collaboration.\n\nCurrently, I am engaged in an exciting practice-based research project focused on developing a solfege system that combines the philosophies of Kodaly and the Iranian modal system. This exploration holds great promise for advancing musical education.\n\nOutside of my professional pursuits, I find joy in practicing various sports such as yoga, swimming, biking, mountaineering, and particularly winter sports like ice climbing and ski de randonn\u00e9e. During my leisure time, I indulge in listening to audiobooks and podcasts, expanding my knowledge and interests.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, I served as a guest coach in NAIP projects on behalf of The Royal Conservatoire of The Hague, splitting my time between Iran and the Netherlands. However, with the current circumstances, I have returned to the Netherlands after eight years of work, research, and teacher training in Iran. I am eager to continue my lifelong learning journey here and hope to foster new international collaborations in the future.",
