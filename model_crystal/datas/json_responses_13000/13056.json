    "summary": "I am a curious Solution Architect, not afraid of challenges or to learn something new. My natural motive is to deliver quality. That is why I like to be involved with the entire process from idea, technical workshop with the client, designing the architecture, leading the development and delivery of the end product.\nI have a practical \"let's do it\" attitude, think about what we want to do and then make it work. Years of experience as (SAFe) Product Owner with managing teams locally or abroad based on good design and correct planning with a focus on quality. If I have set my goals or made a promise, I will make it happen. I still like to do hands-on development and pick up a demo or Proof of concept.\n\nIOT - Development - Full Stack - SAFe - Front-end - Back-end   ",
