The aim of my work was phenotyping a mouse model for FXTAS, a dox-inducible transgenic mouse that expresses the transgene only in neurons, following Doxycycline administration. In order to phenotype this mouse model, I conducted several behavioral experiments, such as: open field, ladder rung, automated 3-chamber test for social behavior, elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. After the behavioral testing, material was collected for further histological and molecular investigations. The project comprised of two main groups: one cohort receiving dox for 8 weeks, and the second for 20 weeks. The project is ongoing, and we hope it will lead to a better understanding of the syndrome, and also to valuable scientific publications.  ",

Thus the individuals diagnosed with this syndrome suffer from intellectual disability, morphological features and autistic-like behavior. As human studies are more difficult to perform in depth, animal models offer a good alternative. The Fmr1 KO mouse also lacks the fragile X mental retardation protein (Fmrp), and reproduces some of the characteristics of FXS: macroorchidism, hyperactivity, cognitive impairments, epileptic seizures etc.\nMy research focused on the dendritic spine aspect in the hippocampus of these mice, as hippocampus plays a major role in memory and learning, aspects known to be impaired in FXS patients, and on social behavior of these mice. We found spine and behavioral alterations that we corrected by long-term administration of an mGluR5 antagonist, AFQ056/Mavoglurant.",

The aim of my work was phenotyping a mouse model for FXTAS, a dox-inducible transgenic mouse that expresses the transgene only in neurons, following Doxycycline administration. In order to phenotype this mouse model, I conducted several behavioral experiments, such as: open field, ladder rung, automated 3-chamber test for social behavior, elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. After the behavioral testing, material was collected for further histological and molecular investigations. The project comprised of two main groups: one cohort receiving dox for 8 weeks, and the second for 20 weeks. The project is ongoing, and we hope it will lead to a better understanding of the syndrome, and also to valuable scientific publications.",

By using the knockout mouse model for this disorder, I have investigated behavioral, histological and molecular phenotypes also present in patients diagnosed with FXS. The findings indicated deficits in sociability and dendritic spine morphology in these mice. Several pharmaceutical components were tested on these phenotypes as therapeutic intervention, of which AFQ/Mavoglurant proved to have a positive effect in correcting the observed deficits. These results were published in scientific articles, and in my PhD thesis, entitled: \"Fragile X Syndrome: Steps towards Therapy\".",

This gene is known to be involved in cancer, but also in ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders). In this study I used a mouse model deficient in this gene only in the cerebellum, and looked at several behavioral aspects like anxiety, aggression, learning and memory, locomotion. No significant deficit has been found, indicating that improper function of PTEN only in the cerebellum is not sufficient to cause a behavioral phenotype in the mouse model.",

During this time I taught and educated 2 generations of children: first one for 4 years, from their first year of primary school until they moved on to secondary school, and the second generation for about 2 years. This way I built a strong teaching experience, and improved my didactic skills in different domains, as I taught majority of the curricular subjects. I enjoyed very much working with children and teaching, as I consider it a very important aspect of our society, and I want to contribute to the development of better people for the future.",
