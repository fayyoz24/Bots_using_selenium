Thermal management is a key issue in designing and developing efficient LED-based luminaire products. DCTMs (Dynamic Compact Thermal Models) are required  for predicting the thermal behaviours of LED chips fast and accurately in system level simulations. Mathematical MOR (Model Order Reduction) methods can be used for extracting DCTMs. My primary role in this research project is to create a MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) DCTM, which is capable of handling multiple heat sources and multiple temperature monitoring points.",

These systems originate for instance from discretization of partial differential equations using mixed finite element methods, constrained optimization problems, generalized least squares problems, and network analysis in electronic circuits and water distribution.  A significant portion of the computational time in numerical simulations is spent in solving these large linear systems (order of millions).  Numerical linear algebra algorithms for solving these systems more efficiently in terms of robustness, memory requirements and computational complexity are in high demand for software development. Designing such algorithms is intimately connected with understanding and exploiting the structure of the resulting block matrix system. This thesis develops numerical solution techniques for saddle-point systems by exploiting the properties and structures of the associated block matrices.\n \nRESEARCH INTERESTS\n- Numerical Linear Algebra, Sparse matrix computations\n- Scientific Computing,  compact modelling and simulations \n- Algorithms and Software Development\n\nTEACHING - Numerical Mathematics, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Sets, Logic and Probability theory",
