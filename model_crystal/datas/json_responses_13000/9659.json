    "summary": "I am a graduate of the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information where I received a Master of Information with a concentration in Library Science. I worked until recently at a great public library in Hibbing, MN where I was the library's cataloger, created programming for patrons of all ages, and managed the adult and young adult collections. I left the position in August 2022 to pursue new challenges and adventures in my favorite place, the Netherlands. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Scandinavian Studies with a concentration in Swedish and a minor in Medieval Studies.  I have also spent many years traveling, studying, and working abroad in Sweden, Germany, Iceland, and the Netherlands.",
