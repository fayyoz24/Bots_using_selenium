    "summary": "Hi there,\nI am an enthusiastic and adaptable brand, creative and comms strategy consultant with international experience across a broad range of categories (luxury, lifestyle, entertainment, sportswear, fashion, beauty, food, automotive, environmental protection and tech). \n\nI help brands get recognised and relevant.\n\nI was born in France, spent a lot of my childhood in Mexico and have been lucky to work in Paris, London, Sydney and Amsterdam. I recently moved to Biarritz on the French Atlantic coast where I attempt to perfect my abysmal surfing skills. \nI work remotely and travel if necessary. \n\nI go to work in the morning to create work that works and that makes a positive cultural impact.\nI passionately believe in the importance of teamwork, frequent reality checks, a sense of humour and avoiding bullshit.\nAnd because I also passionately believe in listening more than I talk, I\u2019m going to stop there.\n\n--\n\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2c \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude13\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30",
