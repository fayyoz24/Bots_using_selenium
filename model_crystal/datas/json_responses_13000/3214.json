    "summary": "I am a global health professional with experience in and a passion for monitoring & evaluation and programme management; I am very much intrigued by international health matters and energised by working on locally owned and community-based interventions. Recently I gained valuable experience in M&E and management advocacy & lobby for SRHR and in tuberculosis. These, along with previous experiences, have strengthened my interest in and fascination for health promotion, civil society strengthening, (international) health policy and the relationship between chronic and infectious disease.\n\tI am curious and eager to learn, and I flourish in intercultural and interdisciplinary contexts in which I am exposed to \u2018the field\u2019. Working in teams in which diversity and interpersonal learning is the norm really makes me enthusiastic and optimistic. I have lived and worked in Kenya, Mongolia, Denmark, Poland, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Ukraine.",
