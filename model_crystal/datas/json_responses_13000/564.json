Not only will it become more difficult to provide access to water to all (and particularly to vulnerable groups), also the multiple layers of global, national and local actors from traditional and non-traditional sectors will increasingly influence decision-making on the distribution of fresh water. This will lead to more water-related conflicts, sometimes small and covert, sometimes open and violent, between individuals but also between nation states.  \nThe \u2018Water Diplomacy: Making Water Cooperation Work\u2019-project will analyze the key determinants that contribute to the transformation of water conflicts to cooperation over water. It does so by undertaking state-of-the-art research, actively facilitating stakeholder dialogues, and by training facilitators in a number of case studies (e.g. Jordan and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Megna Basin). We choose to actively engage with the stakeholders involved in the water conflicts as to assert mutual learning, create trust and a profound dialogue. \nNext, key institutions in the domain of water diplomacy are involved in this project: Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and the newly established UNESCO Cat. II Centre on Water Cooperation in Sweden, Uppsala University (Sweden), UNESCO-IHE (The Netherlands), UFZ Helmholz Centre (Germany), IUCN-Asia, EcoPeace Middle East, and the Water Diplomacy Program at Tufts University, MIT and Harvard Law School. \nBased on our research and the thorough testing in practice we will strengthen existing tools or develop new tools suited to the needs of those stakeholders who deal with water conflicts on a daily basis.",

The strategy development is done by a participative and adaptive planning process at different levels (i.e. provincial, district and local level), supported by advanced decision support techniques. By doing so the project demonstrates the added value of applying a participative planning process for the integration of different interests and spatial challenges into one single strategy.",
