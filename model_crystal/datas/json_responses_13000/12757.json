    "summary": "You don't establish and build 3 new ventures, which have developed into successful, sustainable businesses with over 200 FTE and multi-million USD annual turnover, without some blood, sweat and tears. \n\nMostly happy tears though I'm glad to say!\n\nMoving out to Trinidad, in the Caribbean, less than a year after completing my time as a Graduate Management Trainee with Peterson in The Netherlands was daunting, but as is my nature I grasped the opportunity and have continued to grow, personally, professionally and the business ever since. \n\nPeterson is a global operating service company supporting energy operators and TIER-1 contractors with turn-key logistics services, differentiating with a high focus on collaboration and technology. \n\nDeveloping the business and realizing the growth opportunities along with local talent potential has contributed to the establishment and development of the Peterson brand in the Caribbean, USA and Latin America regions.\n\nIn the last 8 years I've transformed new ventures and startups to well established companies through innovative strategies and partnerships.  In addition I've also lead the acquisition of a portfolio of integrated services contracts with a top range >60M USD.\n\nBroadening my network further I also provide strategic support to the international business community as president of European Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago (EUROCHAMTT) which is a member of the European Business Organization (EBO worldwide network). \n\nWant to talk Marine Logistics, Joint Ventures/Partnerships or anything else I can help with?
