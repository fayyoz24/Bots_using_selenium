    "summary": "I have spent the past 10 years working in various roles in the music and entertainment industry, including as a content creator, brand ambassador, and social media curator . My experience working with a variety of artists and brands, such as D.O. Gibson, Atwell Music, Hip Hop Saves Lives, Subliminal Worldwide, Stroopwafel, Mill Green, JJ From Yonkers, Gambit Gasolina, Loud Life, and more, has provided me with a deep understanding of what it takes to create and market of successful campaigns and brands from the start up. Notably, I had the opportunity to work with Hip Hop Saves Lives, a well-known nonprofit organization that teaches humanity through hip hop. During my time there, I worked on creating content, social media marketing, tour management, video editing, branding, graphic, and other marketing initiatives to spread the organization's message to a global audience.\n\nI have also been involved in the startup world, founding The Dutch New Yorker Barber Scholarship Program in Uganda Kampala and opening The Dutch New Yorker Barber Shop in Amsterdam. The success of both ventures has given me a wealth of knowledge in growth and marketing strategies for startups.\n\nIn my current role as a concept creator and content creator for Subliminal Worldwide, I have successfully launched the monthly Stroopwafel event which is a LGBTQ+ friendly, community driven, open minded event filled with different creatives doing live performances throughout the event and techno music in Amsterdam. The goal is to bring everyone from the community under one roof without judgment and without phones. Upon entry a sticker is placed on the consumers phone cameras to keep them present. So they can enjoy eye opening performances, visuals, and music. Subliminal Worldwide has become a staple in the local music scene. \nAdditionally, I have helped Subliminal build a strong brand identity and increase its reach through social media.\n\nMy experience in navigating multiple industries, combined with my passion for music, AI, and startups, makes me confident that I am the right person for this position. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the growth and success of your startup.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications with you.",
