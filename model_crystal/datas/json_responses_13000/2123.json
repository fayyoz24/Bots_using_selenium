At the very start of the PhD project the candidate also proposed the use of \"subspace-identification\" techniques for short-time prediction of (two-phase) hydrocarbon reservoirs. The PhD project was actually initially supposed to be a project on System Identification of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs using \"Predictive Error Methods\" (PEM) family (see the work of Lennart Ljung, for instance). To the candidate being an electrical engineer with a major in systems and control it was directly clear that such methods are (at that moment at least) most likely not the right way to go, so he proposed to change the focus, which fortunately was accepted.  \nP.S. Due to personal circumstances the PhD project was interrupted during 2006-2007, in which period the PhD candidate was employed by Schlumberger in Abingdon UK.",
