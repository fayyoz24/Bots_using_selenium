    "summary": "Both as Executive Secretary and consultant, I work on the development and implementation of multi-level governance and stakeholder platforms fostering international cooperation for marine protection and climate action. Additionally, I do project development, strategic lobbying, and moderation of high level events. Furthermore, developing environmental governance frameworks, environmental and nature management plans, associated action programmes and their monitoring schemes are important tasks regarding the contents side of my work. For which passively fished waste is of special importance.\n\nWhat drives me?\nI am convinced that effective protection and sustainable use of our planet and its natural resources, can be achieved only by means of an international, holistic and integrated approach that pays attention to Planet, People and Prosperity equally. All of these aspects, including participation of local communities, and cooperation with experts of a variety of fields, are of utmost importance to achieve that goal. \n\nGeographical Scope\nI participated in environmental coastal & marine projects & activities in 30+ countries, from a local to a continental scale in Europe; Asia, Kenya & Canada. I participated in activities organised by networks of countries as well, like European Union, ASEAN, OSPAR, Group of Seven (G7) & the United Nations.",
