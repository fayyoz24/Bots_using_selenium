    "summary": "Hello! I enjoy my work as a harpsichord repairer/technician. I do all sorts of repairs, maintenance, voicing work in Delrin or, preferably, in bird quill, restringing, regulation, do keyboard-workovers when they get noisy and have too much lateral play, and probably all else you could think of. I welcome on-site jobs abroad, too, in case there is no one aroud in your area. I have been trained by Joel Katzman and my own relentless curiousity, and the ongoing contacts with colleagues in the field. I might every now and then try to persuade someone to have real feathers installed, such as crow, seagull, or brown turkey. Or maybe the more historical slant-cut dampers instead of the rather modernist square flag dampers, and so allow the lush resonance of the sympathetic resonance of the undamped choir. A restringing, when it is due, might be contemplated with Nuremberg Iron, or p-wire. which has some outstanding qualities over previously available soft-iron wire. But every instrument will receive quality time and attention, and will be regulated to a crisp and precise toucher that will stimulate eloquent articulation and flowing ornaments. Apart from harpsichords, I have a lot of expertise in repairing and optimizing string instruments from India, I make sarangi bows and rehair them, and am an experienced jivari-maker for tanpuras.",

All artists would gladly let me take care of the tuning of the tanpuras. This may look simple to the uninitiated, but it is a most delicate business, as is the shaping and polishing of the convex bridge, that creates an effect in sound similar as to how a prisma works on light. I have toured with many great and inspiring artists. Nowadays my services seem less in demand as many musicians are content with using electronic tanpura boxes or smart-phones. In 2003 I wrote an extensive article on the defense of the real thing: a properly maintaind real tanpura, which will always out-perform anything artificial, if played and tuned right. In addition, I wrote the wikipedia articles (with input from others) on 'Tanpura' and 'jivari'. what a good tanpura sounds like:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk8FYkjIoIM&list=UUn92mhZxs5lknctZc-nzJeQ",
