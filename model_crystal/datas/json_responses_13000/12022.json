    "summary": "Since February 1 of 2019, I have been working as a software developer at the company 12Care, the creator of https://careweb.nl.\n\nIn 2015 I completed the bachelor's degree programme Mathematics at the Vrije\nUniversiteit Amsterdam. This study comprised of math topics like algebra,\nanalysis, probability theory, statistics and topology, and other useful skills\nlike computer programming (Java and C++), giving presentations and scientific\nwriting.\n\nAt the end of my bachelor's I learned how one can use Vim digraphs and the\nXeLaTeX package unicode-math to add math symbols to documents in a more\nconvenient way. For instance, to add the symbol \u03b2, one normally has to type\n\"\\beta\", but with this method one only has to enter \"b<backspace>*\" which\nresults in the typing of \u03b2 directly in the .tex document. Then, the package\nunicode-math makes sure this unicode character \u03b2 is handled correctly by\nXeLaTeX.  I think every mathematician should try this method.\n\nAfter my bachelor's, I started the master's Mathematics, also at the Vrije\nUniversiteit Amsterdam. I abandoned this study in May 2017 to look for a job\nas a computer programmer. \n\nA few interests of mine are single-board ARM computers and the Chinese language. My math is fine,\nI am good at listening and willing to learn.",
