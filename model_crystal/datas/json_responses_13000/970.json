    "summary": "When I was a child, I first came into contact with science through patient conferences, where I was inspired by the passionate researchers spending their time trying to understand a rare disease. I admired their dedication to improving the lives of even just a few people. Knowing how advancements in science had given me a chance to live a normal life, I decided that my goal is to do the same for other people.\n\nToday, I am training for a career in science and in my spare time I am a passionate advocate and volunteer for the cause of making medicines accessible and affordable for everyone around the world.\n\nIn 2021, I graduated cum laude and with Honours from an interdisciplinary Bachelor's programme combining biomedicine with public health and information.\n\nCurrently, I am in the second year of a Master's in \"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology\". I have recently completed an internship at the Hubrecht Institute in the group of Wouter de Laat. Through this internship, I explored my interest in epigenetics, and in particular the effects of alterations in the 3D genome structure in cancer. Currently, I am looking for a final six month internship. After I graduate, I hope to continue a career in cancer research, contributing towards a better understanding of the molecular and (epi)genetic underpinnings of cancer, and by extension targets for improved treatments.\n\nWhen I am not working or volunteering, I enjoy reading books, letting my creativity run free through writing short stories, as well as traveling and capturing memorable moments in photographs.",

Towards that goal, I managed petition efforts directed at the Amsterdam UMC in 2020. I co-coordinated the annual \"Access to Medicines\" week twice, including a photo campaign and article publication (2019) and creation of a social media campaign (2020). Lastly, I was heavily involved in the creation of the chapter's Instagram presence and researched, captioned and designed multiple awareness posts about various global health-related topics."

As an editor, I read student papers, promoted the journal, and mediated contact with authors and peer reviewers. When I advanced to senior editor, I oversaw the editorial process, coordinated promotion and outreach, and took minutes at board meetings. With the Editor-in-Chief, I assisted in recruitment, year planning, formatting the final issue, and managing a team of student editors from across the country."
