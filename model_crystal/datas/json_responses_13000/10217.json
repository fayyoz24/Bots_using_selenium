    "summary": "My name is Carlo Pareti and I was born in Grosseto, Italy. I moved in the Netherlands in 2017 and I am now a Social Innovation practitioner with an interest in system thinking, active citizenship, networking for impact and community development. \n\nI decided to study \u2018Social Innovation' since the more I questioned what drives me in life the more I found an answer in the connection with people, caring for myself and others and figuring out new ways of combining shared ambitions to have a positive impact on society.\n\nI believe that my main strengths are my mental flexibility, interpersonal capabilities, problem-solving and leadership skills. My main passions are music, languages and food - where sharing with others is what makes them so valuable. \n\nMy motto? learning never stops!",

Mobility is not only about traveling or studying abroad, but it actively involves students by promoting a cultural understanding and inspiring them to continue to leave a mark in society.\n\nThe project SE was born in 2008 in Poland and in a few years has expanded to many of the ESN sections around Europe. Our section of Breda is a recent section and for this reason it was not until this January that the SocialErasmus project started. At first we were only two to manage it but within a few weeks our committee widened to five members and the people who follow us are about a hundred at the current time. We are still in the process of finding the right activities to promote and expand our network, which requires patience but at the same time it is very satisfying. \n\n",
