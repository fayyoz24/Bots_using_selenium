    "summary": "From 2005 to 2013, I have provided my services in the field of teaching chemistry in the very competitive sector of the private education in Greece. I obtained deep knowledge and experience on how to prepare high school students for their admission to departments of Universities and how to provide them with the necessary skills for success in the Exams.\nAll this experience is very well supported by a rich educational background. I am a graduate of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens /Department of Chemistry (Bachelors Degree) and bearer of a MSc in Industrial Chemistry.\nAnother key and valuable factor is my ability to successfully work and teach vocational training students in private institutes.\nWith an insightful understanding of Chemistry, a tested constructive attitude towards pupils/students and colleagues and a hands-on expertise in teaching I feel I am in the position to offer developed skills, an interactive and positive personality and, above all, passion to any educational organization.",
