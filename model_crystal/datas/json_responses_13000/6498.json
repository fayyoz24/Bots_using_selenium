    "summary": "When I was a little boy, I grew up in foster care. This experience taught me to be independent and believe in what I do in life.\n\nMy first big opportunity was working for Starbucks where I learned that coffee is not just about making latte or cappuccino. It's also about knowledge of the whole coffee industry, agriculture, market, distribution, sustainability, and ethical practices.\n\nMy passion is not only for coffee but also for people. Here is a memorable story that I would like to share: once a customer ordered a cup of espresso but was unsatisfied with what I served her, claiming that she ordered a double espresso. She spilled the hot drink upon my hand. Despite the burning pain in my hand, I just asked what happened to her. It was then she started to cry and told me that she was experiencing a divorce. As a result, I listened to her story and made a new coffee for her. Customers could have bad days. Our job is not just to serve them better coffee but a better day.",
