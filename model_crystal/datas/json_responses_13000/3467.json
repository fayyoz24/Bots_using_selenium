    "summary": "Skills that I possess: strong planner, problem-solving, Team-worker, open communication, flexible, strong administration skills, friendly, managing people, implementing ideas, supervising.\n\nI am a driven and ambitious person. I am strong in entering into and maintaining contacts, I am strong in an operational role and like to help others to organize their work properly.

I am open to new developments, take a critical look at work processes and am always willing to improve things and to get the space to contribute ideas.\n \nMy name is Asiya, I have worked in different fields; from project management to teaching. I am originally from Afghanistan and have completed my first bachelor degree B.A Economics from Banaras Hindu University of India in 2011, after this I started working at a construction company as an assistant tot the  general manager. I also have experience as an administrative and documentation officer for a world bank funded project in Ministry of Communications and IT, in Kabul, Afghanistan where I have learned many things and improved my skills. I was involved in planning, reporting, organising and controlling the documents and i did practice a high level of responsibilities under my project managers guidance.\n\nIn  2013, and half of 2014, I did voluntary work with COA (an organisation responsible for the reception, supervision and departure of asylum seekers coming to the Netherlands). My tasks were translation and working with the children in a creative-room and day-care building. From September 2014 till 2016, I followed a Dutch language pre-university course in order to start International Business management studies next. In 2016 I started International Business and Management and got my degree in July 2022.",
