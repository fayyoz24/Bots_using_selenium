    "summary": "During more than 22 years of successful legal and spiritual practice, I mindfully addressed my clients (prisoners and others), as well as my own problems like panic, stress, despair, trauma, overeating and pain. These experiences taught me how to handle mind, emotions and body. With these skills realizing that I determine what is good and what is bad, I started teaching meditation, spirituality, yoga and philosophy parallel to being a lawyer for almost 8 years. After obtaining MEDITATION-YOGA teaching, Reiki ll certificate I dedicated myself to fully being meditation, yoga, and Life (wellness) coach. BECAUSE I FEEL NO DUALITY HERE. ONLY DEEP OF CONSCIOUSNESS. NO GOOD, NO BAD",
