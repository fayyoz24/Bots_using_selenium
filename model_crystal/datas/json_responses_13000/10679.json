My core responsibilies included handling urgent/sensitive escalations in 4 languages (Korean, English, Mandarin & Cantonese) and assisting the operations manager with adhoc tasks & projects.\n\nDuring my tenure, I supported my manager to do agent's quality management, tackled backlog volume issues, initiated process improvement, and generated business performance reports. Hence, I am experienced in SQL, Tableau, Lucidchart, and Lean Six Sigma methodology.\n\nOur role as a Trust & Safety team specialized in providing immediate response/assistance to Airbnb users \u2014 in the event of a safety and security situation (ie., property damage, illegal activities, malicious online payment activity, etc.).
