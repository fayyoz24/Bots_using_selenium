    "summary": "After finishing my master studies in Entrepreneurship and Tourism, I started to work in the local Booking.com office in Innsbruck. I enjoyed the direct contact to the partners and the results that were visible in our work with them. On a private level my interest in the background of how the company works on a technical level kept on growing and I started to get familiar with HTML and how websites are built. When the opportunity came up to move to Amsterdam for my new position I was very excited to combine my love for the operational work with partners and the technical side that I had just started to explore.\n\nI am proud that I managed to adapt to this new world and being able to have conversations with our developers on our new APIs now. Additionally to the technical learnings my role in the headquarter of Booking.com really boosted my networking skills and I got a lot of possibilities to grow my management skills with my team and the global support community.\n\nA harmonic work environment is for me the basis of enabling my team and me to be as productive as possible. In that sense going the extra mile for my stakeholders than also comes as a desire and the result of following the example of the people around me and leading by example myself. This is a key behavior for me in a service industry and support / operational role.\n\nFor the teams I am working with, leading and hiring I often come back to Steve Jobs' quote: \"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.\" I think listening to these smart people can really make a big change in a team and a company.",
