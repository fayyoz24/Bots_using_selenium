    "summary": "A former manager once gave me a notebook as a gift with an imprinted word \u2018curious\u2019. He said this notebook reminded him of my desire for knowledge and learning. Or maybe this was his way of giving me feedback that I ask too many questions. \n\nMy thirst for knowledge and learning came from a very young age and led me to develop a multi-cultural background, having lived and worked in Serbia, Egypt, Belgium and the Netherlands. In the past 8 years I\u2019ve worked across multiple industries (leadership development, information technology, pharmaceutical, finance) and held various roles within the spaces of sustainability and innovation. \nI\u2019ve implemented employee engagement programmes, developed and carried out global internal and external communication strategies (with an underlying goal of change management/culture change), led regional social impact (sustainability) programme and implemented OKR methodology and QBR process.\n\nIn addition to being curious; I am also persistent, I am driven by \u2018we can make it work, we\u2019ll find a way\u2019 attitude. I am a doer at heart always ready to get my hands dirty and I have a strong sense of responsibility and ownership. And I can bake some incredible brownies and cookies. \n \nI have spent the last several years utilising my love for presenting and engaging with audience(s) by producing and taking part in multiple video campaigns within ING, to learn even more about strategic visual communication and the power of words.\n\nSo, if you want to chat about communication, sustainability, running or baking, I would love to get in touch!",

Each year, it gathers more than 600 delegates, young leaders from across Serbia, with the aim to motivate them to become leaders of positive change in the society.\n\nI had the privilege to be the Lead Moderator of New Leaders Conference in November 2014. During the two day conference I had the chance to tackle the subjects of youth empowerment, youth activation for becoming agents of positive change in the society and youth un/employment with guest speakers. With the final aim being having motivated youth across Serbia taking on the challenge and bringing the impact.\n\nMore information about New Leaders Conference can be found on their Facebook Page (https://www.facebook.com/NewLeadersConference) and their Website (http://www.newleaders.org.rs)."
