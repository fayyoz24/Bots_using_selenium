    "summary": "I'm a passionate international development professional based in the Netherlands with 11 years of experience in sexual and reproductive health, gender and HIV/AIDS, in Eastern and Southern Africa and in South and South East Asia. \nMy work has involved working extensively with people who are incarcerated, migrants, sex workers and people who use drugs.\n\nOver the next 10 years I plan to build a solid network of female and LGBTQI+ professionals from the Global South working on sexual health, inclusion, safeguarding and GESI, to provide robust research on topics that affect our communities, with a more in-depth and intersectional perspective and insights that are unfortunately often lost when representation is lacking.",
