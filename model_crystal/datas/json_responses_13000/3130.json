    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic, battle-tested creative producer, production specialist, and travel junkie. Whether scheduling a shoot over a bowl of goat stew in Morocco or brainstorming content ideas while sitting in 32B (or Zoom...), I take pride in telling beautiful stories uniquely, ahead of time, engaging viewers, and keeping my team connected through the entire process.\n\nHaving worked in and traveled throughout 90+ countries around the world, I've come across a problem or two and enjoyed working to solve complex and unique practical and creative hurdles with vastly varied and internationally mixed teams for brands like Hertz, Eastpak and Trip Advisor as well as television productions for clients like National Geographic, Discovery Channel, BBC and CNBC - and managed to win some awards along the way.\n\nI grabbed the opportunity to move from Los Angeles to Thailand before being asked to join a team in Dubai, where I met my French wife with whom I traveled around the world to more than 40 countries with before we settled in Amsterdam. Along the way, we created a popular travel video channel with episodes filmed in places like Tajikistan, Sudan, Greenland, and Everest Base Camp in Nepal, which have been watched over 15 million times. \n\nSince graduating with a BA in Visual Journalism from the Brooks Institute in California in 2010, I have worked professionally as a production manager, creative producer, video editor, videographer and project manager while working with teams in the USA, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. (Ask me which was the hardest...)\n\nNow based in Amsterdam, I am currently working as a Creative Producer for Booking.com",

Final products included website, book, dvd, film, three gallery exhibits. I produced this year and a half project with the 20 exceptional students on the project, many faculty and staff advisers at Brooks Institute.  Cultural understanding and student leadership and creativity  were the main skills I pursued for my students.  Six months of pre-production training, two months in South India photographing and filming on the projects, 4 months post-production. I was the creative editor for all the products with my students. We fund raised $30,000 to fund the book publication of 1000 copies which all sold out.  ",
