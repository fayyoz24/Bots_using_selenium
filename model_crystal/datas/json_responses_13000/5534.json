All this was meant to prepare the QMS for the external\naudit \u2013 recertification process. For this, I came to learn about all the manufacturing process of the\ncar, from BIW, Paint and Montage. (FYI the models produced were van Sprinter and Buses chassis)\n3) Special projects: As per the headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany directed, implementation of new\nmethods, systems, control, etc. Also the NCV3 project (replacement of the Sprinter model) with all\nthe plant redesign, processes adequations and a lot of new work instructions.
