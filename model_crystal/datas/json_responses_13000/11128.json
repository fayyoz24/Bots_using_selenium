    "summary": "Experienced in research in academic and start-up environments. I am writing a PhD dissertation about platform labour and creator economy. In order to truly understand and appreciate what is happening in society, I am integrating big data with thick data using qualitative, ethnographic research methods that uncover people\u2019s emotions, stories and models of their world. \n\nComing from east of the west and west of the east, I thrive in international environments and gained experiences in Amsterdam, Ljubljana, Hamburg, Groningen, Brussels, and Amman. I believe that the future belongs to those who question which led me to establish Taking Up Space - Institute for Fair Shared Places where we do research and advocate for gender equality in analogue and digital spaces. \n\nSubscribe to my newsletter at tincalukan.substack.com",

As our communication systems change, the risks evolve alongside the benefits. We now see it daily: mis- and disinformation campaigns, polarization, surveillance, the undermining of social infrastructures. \n\nWe developed answers for the questions:\nHow do the design and incentives of social media companies influence individual choices and major social movements?\nWhere are we headed? \nWhat do we want to create\u2014and what do we want to leave behind? \nHow can we work toward building the forms of connection that we (or others) would like to see, while also mitigating the risks?",

But, while Silicon Valley startups may celebrate their ability to platform small-scale businesses, the turn to digital economies is a response to precarious employment. It is a hustle that shows how risk has devolved from states and employers to workers. Though hustling often refers to outside-work activities and informal economies, it has always been and continues to be a mainstay of producing economic security for households across the world. It is also recognized as a property of racial capitalism, as a cultural form that adheres to some bodies but not others, as the hustle is associated with Black women in the United States, for instance, and with similarly gendered, raced, classed and casted bodies throughout the world.",
