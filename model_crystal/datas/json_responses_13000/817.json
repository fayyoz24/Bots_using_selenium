To achieve this, \u201cEduCoach\u201d was selected by the European Commission as part of a highly competitive Erasmus Mundus Action 3 line of funding.\nEduCoach was designed to help millions of prospective students and PhD candidates who were considering study and research in Europe. Tools like live chat and webinars were implemented to improve the quality of their decision-making process on where and what to study, as well as to help institutions reach out to these students more effectively.
