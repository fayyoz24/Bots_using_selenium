    "summary": "I am an undergraduate student at the University of Amsterdam, studying Politics, Psychology, Law, and Economics. With this combination of subjects, I seek to gain an interdisciplinary approach to societal conflicts. Within the context of my extracurricular activities (Amnesty International Studentgroup, Junior Studies, German Junior Academy, Chatham House Summer School, Music Academy) and civic engagement (museum guide) I deepened my understanding of and passion for international politics as well as social justice and furthermore fostered my creative thinking, discipline, and team work skills. I see my personal purpose in adding a creative-empathetic and feminist approach to human rights issues within international politics.",
