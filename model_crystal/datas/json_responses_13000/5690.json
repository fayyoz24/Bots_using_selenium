The 1(\u2018primary\u2019) -2 (\u2018secondary\u2019) -3 (\u2018tertiary\u2019) seed multiplication systems practiced in Malawi fit well with the uni-modal rain distribution pattern and the sweetpotato growing calendar. Thus, we expect that farmers can grow sweetpotato in year around. The 1-2-3 seed systems were defined with implementing partners, where secondary and tertiary at the district level decentralized and managed by farmers under the supervision of the extension from the government and respected NGO. Meanwhile the primary multiplication is at the research station managed by researchers. The secondary and tertiary multiplication are distinctive by the different purpose and multiplication technique. The secondary multiplication mainly produces vines hence a rapid multiplication method is practiced. The tertiary multiplication is for vines and storage roots production with a slight modification from the conventional sweetpotato multiplication. This tertiary multiplication is fitting in the lean months in Malawi where food is scared.",

In Ghana, Burkina Faso and Nigeria (Sep 2014 - May 2017). Project: Jumpstarting orange-fleshed sweetpotato in West Africa through diversified markets. 117,000 HHS cultivated OFSP in the households (Ghana, Burkina Faso and Nigeria). Through Ghana Health Service program in 22 districts in northern Ghana, ~6,000 pregnant women and lactating mothers were trained on everything about OFSP, ~5,600 received vines and/or roots; from willingness to pay study, out of ~280 interviewed, 16% of women bought the vines or roots. In Burkina Faso, ~40% OFSP found in the 4 sweetpotato big markets in the West of Butkina Faso; before it was 0%. In Nigeria, Osun State, ~1400 schools had OFSP in their students\u2019 meals twice a week. Project was funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n3). Northern Malawi (Mzimba & Kasungu) and Northern Ghana (Bawku); period of Oct 2013-Apr 2015, project funded by USAID-OFDA. Results: Sweetpotato roots can be stored fresh in a large quantity in a sand storage: in Malawi, stepped pit is chosen by farmers, predominantly by women, for 7 months; in Ghana, sandbox is the best technology, for 2 months. If we do keep them in a room, the roots can be spoiled at 3 weeks.\n4). In Ghana and Burkina Faso (July 2017-Sep 2018). Project: Extending of the sweetpotato roots\u2019 life-span, results: (a) we keep roots in the stepped pit and sand box up to 4 months, using good agricultural practices and sand storage technology in drought-prone areas, funded by USAID-OFDA for scaling the sand storage technology. (b) farmers could manage 28% roots for sprouting as source of planting materials, only 21% were loss instead of 100% normally after 2-3 weeks of being stored in a room, and 51% fresh roots for food in the food stock. Out of 51% fresh roots, 59% roots were at premium quality.",
