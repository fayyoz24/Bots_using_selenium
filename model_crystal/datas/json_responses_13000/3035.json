I was responsible for team growth and modules synchronization between iOS and Android platforms.\nSome of the Core modules we packed as reusable libraries to share across other projects in the bank. We used Firebase for many features and I participated to configure and setting up many of the Firebase features such as Analytics, Performance, Crashlytics, and Remote Config. We also connected the App distribution feature in our CI/CD pipeline so our QA team can access each feature in each step. Also, we reused and extended the Design System from our parent bank that's why we increased the development speed. One of the last subprojects that I designed was WebApp integration via JS actions to improve delivery and content change speed.",

As a part of technological features, there were realized: multimodular development based on 3 types of layers: core, common, and feature with clean architecture on each layer; easy dependency injection with Koin. As a result, we had a successful release in March 2021.\nI'm responsible for Android team development as well.

But the start of the project was postponed to a later date, so I've participated in developing an application for Izi mobile operator for 2 months. During this time, there were several important features implemented, including a services Store in which users can buy and manage extra services. There was significant refactoring by separating clean architecture modules for this short period as well. As the project on which I was hired was postponed for indefinite period and I was invited to start new banking project from scratch I decided to change the project.",
