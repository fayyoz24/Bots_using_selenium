    "summary": "I am dedicated to developing new insights in the field of data and life sciences. With over 20 years of experience I have a broad background in working on demanding projects and training employees, where I always see a way to achieve goals. I lead a team of 5 people to develop cloud-based data science tools for non-clinical, pre-clinical, and clinical datasets. My expertise lies at the intersection of medical biology and data science. \n\nI am a lifelong learner and eager to explore new opportunities to further develop and make use of my competencies in an R&D environment. I am not only passionate about applying science, but also about communicating science. I have presented to high-school students during the yearly Brain Awareness Week, and spoke about my work at BNR Nieuwsradio (650.000 listeners) and Het Klokhuis (400.000 viewers). My work was featured in BBC Horizon, featuring Rory Bremner (2.5 to 3 million viewers).\n\nLet\u2019s connect!",
