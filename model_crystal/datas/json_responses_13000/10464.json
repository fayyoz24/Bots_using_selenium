The villas in Hua Hin Laguna are designed to meet European standards, as in high ceilings and double walls separating the lounge from the entrance hall to assure privacy. And also, unlike common Thai homes, the villas at Hua Hin Laguna offer big window walls to the terrace at the back of your house to step down to the garden next to the lagoon. It's there in your beautifully landscaped garden where you can relax and enjoy a magnificent sunset and mountain view. Your dreams will come true at Hua Hin Laguna.",

Situated in a quiet coastal area and is surrounded by expatriate community. It's a development of 2ndHomes in cooperation with Exposure Project Development, thus in Dutch hands. \r\nWe build 2 type of Balinese villas (total 24: 12 one storey and 12 two storey villas) with a big central 'open living', Infinity Pools and unobstructed Indian Ocean views to taste the unique Balinese way of life. Only 13km from the international airport and 1km from Dreamland beach & Golf. The closest beach (Greenball) is just a min. from the resort which is a true paradise to real Bali lovers. \r\nAlso close to the Jimbaran famous beach fish restaurants, Nusa Dua & Tanjung Benoa harbor.\r\nSituated in a area where tourism is hardly present yet to be able to enjoy the quietness of the beautiful surroundings. And yet close enough to reach all other facilities with a 15 min. drive, which is very convenient for rentals. The project will be delivered with Free-Hold title to secure your ownership rights. A true Balinese beauty in its kind...!\r\nMore info: http://www.2ndhomes.nl/details.aspx?id=1138&seq=AAST-0098-jhgG",

These projects share a couple of pre-defined characteristics in common:\n\uf06e\tLocations are in areas of outstanding natural beauty;\n\uf06e\tWe will only target countries that are being considered stable in terms of political climate and economic environment;\n\uf06e\tThe quality of the residential buildings meet without exception the demands of a very discerning clientele;\n\uf06e\tThe real estate developments have to create a warm atmosphere, making prospective buyers feel comfortable immediately;\n\uf06e\tMaking the transition for any client that wishes to relocate permanently an easy process;\n\uf06e\tFind areas to develop with interesting tax conditions and high capital appreciations;\n\nWith the recent changing of the global economies and longer life expectancies for many developed countries a growing number of people are considering a new era in some of the more beautiful parts of the world. It is mainly this group that we try to offer a solution. But we also have a growing list of prospective buyers that consider acquiring real estate for holiday use or as a financial investment.\nPart of our construction service is as well Flex-Building-Bali (Brazil + Thailand) for individual home construction with a variety of pre-designed models from us to chose from (so save architect costs) that we construct on chosen plots.:",
