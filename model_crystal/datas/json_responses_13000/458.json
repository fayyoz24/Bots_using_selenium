    "summary": "I\u2019m a freelancing data visualization designer and artist, working from a tiny town near Amsterdam, with a background in data science & a graduated Astronomer. \n\nI work to captivate and engage an audience with the insights that the data reveals. To convince them of the lessons hidden within the numbers. To take readers along on a journey told through the lens of data.\n\nIn 2016 I was chosen as Rising Star and in 2017 I became Best Individual in the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards. I\u2019ve worked with small start-ups, magazines like Scientific American, all the way to global multinationals such as Google to help them get the most out of their data. And this can be done through both static or interactive visualizations, for online or print. So long as there\u2019s data that has a story to reveal.\n\nFor each project I design my visualizations completely custom build. Starting from the actual data & goals, not the \u201cavailable charts\u201d. Resulting in engaging, beautiful and effective visualizations of your data. And taking the creativity one step further, I also love to turn numbers into data art or branding material, since your company\u2019s data is inherently unique. Something that entices the eye first and foremost while still hinting at patterns found in the data.\n\nI can take on the entire data visualization process. From data analysis, to design, to creating the final stand-alone piece. But I can also focus only on the design of the visualization an afterwards act as an advisor to your own front-end developers or analysts. Get in touch to discuss what works best for you! And please, if you'd like to get in touch, email me at info @ visualcinnamon.com, I often forget about LinkedIn.\n\n(PS I only accept people on LinkedIn that I know, if you want to stay up to date with my posts, follow me instead! :) )",
