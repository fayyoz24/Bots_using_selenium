Its goal is to move away from disaster relief and to focus on disaster prevention and mitigation. First, after completing research into the characteristics of vulnerabilities, capacities and hazards in communities. The goal was to find out what kind of DRR methods fitted our organization and -moreover- the needs and abilities of affected communities. This resulted in a program that connected with community development programs of the NGO I worked at.\n\nThe program consisted of training modules and the facilitation of disaster management tools. These tools were the establishment of a Community Disaster Management Committee (CDMC), a Community Cased Contingency Plan (CBCP) and a Community Based Disaster Savings Fund (CBDS). In some cases the trainings were combined with a small material component (e.g. distribution of socks or rubber boots).The program training materials were designed based on the research, interviews with affected people, exchange of ideas with partner NGO's and input from local facilitators.\n\nThe program was focused on extreme winter conditions and flooding during spring season.\nFurther plans included the development of an Advocacy Strategy, a Community Based Early Warning System and the exploration of Climate Change Adaptation measures.",
