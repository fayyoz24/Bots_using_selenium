We also participated in projects for Samsung, LG, Bradesco and Greenpeace.\n\nMain responsibilities of my role:\n* Meeting facilitation - Client x Team.\n* Collaborate with project idea and objectives.\n* Define scope, risks, issues, milestones, and deadlines.\n* Implement the Lean Start-up Approach and Agile Methodology.\n* Inform, involve, and inspire the team.\n* Planning, execution, and controlling of multiple projects.\n* Prioritize the backlog.\n* Full autonomy to make decisions.\n\nIn addition to these, I was also responsible for designing, developing, and implementing an internal tool for managing the client's expectations in regards to the projects. With this tool, the client could see the step of the process in which we were in, send messages about that particular part of the project and see snippets of the evolution. This had a large impact, measured by a 90% decrease in customer calls, emails and tickets. Because we were much more efficient with this new format, we were a lot less prone to errors and we had a history of all the actions taken in the tool. This way the clients were also much more assertive when approving or disapproving something about the project. The final impact on the business was the ability to take on 25% more projects without increasing costs.\n\nIn this role, I led teams of up to 36 people.",
