    "summary": "My study history is a bachelor in European Studies, a master in organizational sciences named Policy, Communication & Organization, the minor Development and Global Challenges and the minor Peace & Conflict studies. I have one and a half year of experience working for UNICEF, in three different teams that focus on fundraising. Before that I have done an internship in CRM & merchandising for a German furniture company. Apart from that, I have had several part-time jobs, such as Project Manager in Marketing & Sales, Administrative- & Sales Assistant, and tutoring in Spanish. I have lived in several countries: USA (middle school), Argentina (high school exchange program), Mexico (semester at university), Berlin (internship) and Paris (French courses & au pair). I am fluent in Dutch, English, Spanish, French and German, and beginner in Russian. Ambitious, communicative, enthusiastic, honest, motivated and responsible is how I would describe myself. I am internationally oriented and a very curious person who is eager to learn. My interests are animals, books, children, cooking, CSR, current affairs, painting, skiing and traveling. \n\nMy dream is to have a job of social importance, such as helping orphans and street dogs; championing women's and LGBTQ+ rights; and contribute to poverty reduction in less developed countries. I would like to work in a dynamic team from different backgrounds where ideas and suggestions are openly shared. I prefer to work for an organization that is internationally oriented and does not have revenue as its main goal.",

In order to study this urban space with an anthropological approach, we observed the shopping center and conducted 12 interviews with visitors and experts, linking this to several relevant urban theories.",
