    "summary": "I am a native-level English (South African) and Dutch (Netherlands citizen) speaking Language Teacher with four years of international experience, who emigrated to Portugal in 2018 where I taught both Business and General English plus Dutch at various language schools and in a private capacity. I had the pleasure of working closely with both individuals and groups ranging from beginners to advanced fluency.\n\nMy students came from diverse professional backgrounds, from small start-ups to global corporations. Prior to this, I taught General English and Dutch to adults, teens and young children which entailed the planning and delivery of high-quality teaching in physical and virtual contexts. \n\nI employ a range of traditional and progressive methodology, with emphasis on incorporating opportunities for experiential learning wherever possible. While I often use textbooks for beginners, I enjoy creating tailored material for all levels to address specific learning needs.\n\nIn addition to my professional experience as a senior journalist/sub-editor, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in English and Political Science and a Teaching of English as a Foreign Language Qualification in addition to the ESL/EFL Teaching Business English-Moodle diploma through TEFL.\n\n I subsequently also completed the International Berlitz Instructor's Training Course in The Hague/Amsterdam but returned to Portugal for personal reasons.",
