    "summary": "I am driven by curiosity above all else.  There is nothing like the rush of discovering all that you don\u2019t know when encountering a new field, or getting your hands on a new, unexplored data set. I thrive when there is something to find out, or figure out; the more complex, the better. Throw in a multidisciplinary angle, and I might forget to eat.\n\nProfessionally, other than my core specialties in mechanical engineering (automotive, maritime, internal combustion engines) I have dabbled quite deeply in  applied mathematics (probability and statistics, decision theory, expert judgement) , electrical engineering (power electronics) and programming (MATLAB, C++, relational databases/MySQL).  Personally, I enjoy exploring the fields of philosophy, psychology, economics, physics and history. \n\nI hope to significantly expand these lists in the future and find a good use for the knowledge and skills I\u2019ve gained so far. Moreover, I am well aware that not everything can be learned from a book and am eager for a new type of challenge.\n",
