    "summary": "Studying management for my bachelor's and being interested in the specific subject of human resources encouraged me to enhance my knowledge in a field that could deepen my understanding of the behavior of individuals in communities and groups. I gained this knowledge, doing my master's degree in social sciences research with a focus on sociology.  Between my Master's and the Ph.D. that I am doing currently, I associated and/or managed about 10 research projects in which I applied a combination of knowledge I have been equipped with during both my degrees. I have been always interested in applying sociological theories and research methodology in the subjects related to inequality and its consequences, particularly for individuals' mental well-being. Also, conducting some projects focused on groups who are disadvantaged and excluded/marginalized due to their different ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, etc., I became interested in the subject of social integrity. Currently, in my doctoral thesis, I am focusing on studying the interplay of subjective and objective inequality and mental well-being. \n\nFurthermore, doing my master's degree in Social Sciences Methodology, a part of my professional interests is learning and applying different methods in social inquiries. I do use some quantitative, and also mixed-methods to gain a comprehensive and deep understanding of the investigated phenomenon, from a dynamic perspective.",

One of the problems of this multiculturalism is the conflicts among neighbours specifically in marginalised parts of the city where are mostly occupied by new immigrants.

This fact has brought about a big amount of immigrants from different regions of the country with different cultures and ethnicities in Mashhad during the recent decades. Besides the advantages of this multiculturalism, this phenomenon has caused some problems in terms of social solidarity, social participation, and social integration. The aim of this research was to design some strategies to control these problems.",
