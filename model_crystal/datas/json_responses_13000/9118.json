There has always been a lot of fighting between people because of judgments and prejudices. The project wants to cross boundaries between young people who come from different Balkan countries. It wants to show that judgments should not be made until people get to know each other. It wants to make them aware that they are living all together in Europe and that there are only geographical boundaries not real ones in their lives. It aims to develop an environment full of understanding and wants to develop conscious that we have to look into the future, not into the past. It wants to engage the participants to gain an understanding of each others perspectives and history (from their point of view). Participants would learn about history, religion, traditions and customs of other countries. Training would include workshops about history, debates about controversial topics participants choose themselves, forum theatre with critical situations, treasure hunting in the venue, city challenge while spending a day in Gloucester. Activities will be based on critical thinking and analyzing and will try to make participants more aware of similarities they share between each other although they are from different countries. Also, project wants to make participants aware that differences are not something people should be ashamed of or something they should argue about. Differences should be respected and promoted as something positive. At the end of the training course participants should have a better understanding of each other and be able to build new relationships. Also they will be able to understand the differences and accept the different points of view. All together they will be able to build a little community that respects each other and closes some past doors and is opened for an excellent future cooperation.",
