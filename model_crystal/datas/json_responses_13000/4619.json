    "summary": "I am a Business Communication MSc Student at WU Vienna University of Economics and Business with a solid background in Marketing, Sales & Business Development. I pride myself on being a people person that has:\n\n-the imagination of a creative marketeer \ud83d\udcad\n-the voice of an experienced presenter\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\n-the mindset of a passionate entrepreneur\ud83d\udcc8\n\nAfter completing my Bachelor\u2019s Degree in International Business and Languages, I discovered that my passion for learning languages was not just a chore, but a hobby. I started learning Spanish due to my love for telenovelas and here is where it brought me 5 years later... \n\nThroughout my professional experience, I have lived and worked in four countries and I have proven to be effective and collaborative with solid intercultural proficiency. Furthermore, I have worked in highly volatile industries such as Transportation IT, Hospitality, and Entertainment. Hence, I can work confidently in a changing, fast-paced, and results-oriented environment where a high degree of flexibility is required. Also, I have gained vast experience in the B2B Sector and more specifically in Sales, Marketing, and Business Development. In turn, I have a strong skill set in communication, negotiation, problem-solving, project management and teamwork, and collaboration. \n\nToday I am looking to expand my knowledge and skills and make a valuable network in the international business setting.",
