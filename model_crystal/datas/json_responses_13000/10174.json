    "summary": "\"If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it. \nIf you don't ask, the answer is always no. \nIf you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.\nMagic exists.\" \n- By Nora Roberts\n\nA striking poster bearing her wisdom graces my wall, a constant reminder of my authenticity, courage, and self-belief.\n\nMy Journey...\nLeaving my home country with dreams of pursuing a Master's and a PhD, I faced countless obstacles and doubts that threatened my aspirations. The tension between fear and courage heightened. During those challenging moments, I discovered an unwavering inner strength and the power to rewrite my story. With each step forward, I unravelled the negative thoughts and self-doubts holding me back.\n\nToday, I proudly stand as:\n-\tA neuroscientist with top honours in PhD at a young age.\n-\tA breaker of stereotypes. \n-\tA courageous professional to leave a well-paid job and follow my heart.\n-\tA founder of 'Courage Quest,' my business venture.\n\nWho am I?\nI\u2019m a neuroscientist and an integrated mindset coach. I help people hack their thoughts and emotions so that they can lead their own lives with clarity and confidence.\n\nHow do I do it?\nMy clients are audacious dreamers with limitless potential, thinking BIG and envisioning a world beyond boundaries. But they often bury themselves in their conflicting thoughts and emotions, unaware that the world desperately needs their authentic brilliance.\n\nBy combining cognitive and behavioural neuroscience theories and transformative coaching principles, I help my clients unravel their narratives, weaving resilience and growth. \n\nWant to work with me?\nMy approach is raw, intense, and explicit. I use my neuroscientific knowledge to understand your subconscious thoughts and emotions carefully. My unique ability allows me to see what you might miss and confront what you tend to avoid. I empower you to break free from conformity, asking 'Why Not' instead of 'Why'. Together, we will dive deep into the depths of your brilliance masked by your fears, unlock your true potential and transform your life.\n\nSo, are you that visionary thinker, striving to chase your dreams and lead your life with clarity and confidence? \n\nI offer a free 60-minute happy-hour session where you have a chance to be the observer of your mind. You will experience my coaching and thereafter can decide whether to work together. \n\nTo book your call, follow this link: https://calendly.com/srinidhi-desikan/60-minute-happyhour-call\n\nConnect/Follow/Ring the bell icon to learn more about your brain and your mind.",

This tour was specifically structured to develop leadership skills. At such young age, I had to take up a leadership role to lead a team of 20 people to accomplish simple playful tasks such as hunting for treasure or blind walking, etc. These tasks inculcated the following qualities in me. People management, time management, to always look ahead with a positive attitude and to always strive to achieve better."
