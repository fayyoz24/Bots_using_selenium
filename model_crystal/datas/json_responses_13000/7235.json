    "summary": "Strong well operations skills.\nI have a proven track record working as a Senior Well Site leader (Senior Drilling Supervisor) both in Azerbaijan on the ACG platforms & Floater and in Algeria working on land rigs.\nMy current role as Onshore Senior Well Site Leader allows me to work on the ACG platforms to cover for Well Site Leaders when required. I\u2019m also an approved as Wells Superintendent for vacation relief and spend about 50% of my time working in this role. When I\u2019m not working in one of the previously mentioned roles, I\u2018ve been involved with investigations and the review of well operations procedures.\nIn my early career I\u2019ve worked as a drilling engineer and therefore have a good understanding of well planning.\nI\u2019ve been involved as an operations representative in the construction of East Azeri and West Chirag platforms, which gave me good insight into rig building.\n",
