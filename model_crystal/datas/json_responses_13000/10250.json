    "summary": "After graduating in business and economics I started my career in the financial and insurance world first as a private consultant and then as a sales manager for companies that distributed insurance and financial products through banks. I have had dealings with various banks, savings, popular and  cooperative credit banksI have managed all the phases of the distribution of products tailored according to the needs of the banks, phases ranging from training the salespeople to controlling the sales themselves. In my activity as sales manager I always focused on the client, reconciling the budget needs of the companies I represented with those of the final customer.\nAfter almost twenty years as a sales manager I followed my passion (volunteering) that I did in my free time and I moved to Auroville (India), a city devoted to volunteering. In Auroville I managed the purchases and internal organization of the cooperative created to distribute food and household products to the members. I co-managed an activity that sold ready-made Italian products (such as sauces and jams).\n\nIn 2018 I came back to Europe taking into account my experience in management and customer service.\n",
