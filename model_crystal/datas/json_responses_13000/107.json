    "summary": "I have taught many people with many different needs to learn English and Dutch. Some individuals had to pass exams or wanted to be admitted to universities abroad. Others needed to learn business English for work. One of the most illustrious students I had was the Ukrainian Minister of Defense. He was being offered a four week intensive English course by the Dutch Ministry of Defense as he was going to sit in on NATO meetings. He give me a riddle to solve. &quot;When the Ukraine became independent from Russia, how many soldiers were there?&quot; I said I didn't know. &quot;One...&quot; he answered for me. &quot;And that soldier was me!&quot;\nI aspire to have interesting and motivated students from all over the world and I hope to be working not only in the Netherlands in the future, but also abroad, be it in Europe or Asia or South America.\n\nSpecialties: My specialty is adapting my teaching to the needs of my students.",
