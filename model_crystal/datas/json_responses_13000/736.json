    "summary": "--> --> N.B. My PhD is almost finished. I will defend my PhD thesis on 23 September 2021. You can find more info here: https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/09/in-traffic-we-see-more-than-we-think\n\nAbout me: Enthusiastic traffic psychologist who bridges the gap between science and practice. I am particularly interested in human factors and vehicle automation, ranging from assisted driving (ADAS) to automated driving and autonomous driving. I work on topics such as human machine interaction (HMI) and vehicle driving skill. Since 2021 I have the pleasure to work at RDW, the Dutch Vehicle Authority, as the lead on human factors and vehicle automation and to work closely together with the experts of CBR.\nPreviously I combined my work at the Dutch government with PhD research in the field of traffic psychology. I combine knowledge with a broad (inter)national network of human factors and traffic experts to obtain results and push forwards the safe deployment of smart mobility.\n\nMy PhD research is about information along familiar routes: on what we perceive and how this affects human behaviour. I have a specific interest in the detection of driving-related information and changes in this information, specifically concerning traffic management. If you are interested in my PhD work, you can find more info here: https://twitter.com/ilseharms/status/1438861650795405314?s=20.\n\nAdditionally, I am\n- Alternate Director for the Netherlands at Euro NCAP\n- Chair of the board of De VerkeersGedragDag, the leading national conference for professionals within traffic psychology - from knowledge institutes, market parties and governments - where we yearly share the state of the art in our field of work (www.devgd.nl),  \n- peer reviewer for the scientific journal Transportation Research Part F, \n- a writer of scientific articles,\n- sharer of research results with the general public through the media, including the NOS news on TV, radio shows on e.g. Radio538 and BNR, and various newspapers,\n- and a lecturer on the full extent of traffic psychology through guest lectures and master classes for organisations and institutes such as DTV, PAO, NHL and HAN. \nThe most important thing of knowledge is that is shared and applied! \n\n#TrafficPsychology #HumanFactors #Behaviour #VehicleAutomation #RoadSafety #ITS #Consultancy #PhDlife",

Check below.\nInterested in my entire thesis? https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/information-along-familiar-routes-on-what-we-perceive-and-how-thi\n\nWould you notice if the speed limit on an electronic road sign changes? Are we aware of the route instructions that we follow? How is it possible that we avoid an obstacle without being aware of it? The aim of this PhD dissertation is to provide insight in the cognitive processes involved in visual information processing of familiar traffic environments. What is seen and what is not. For this study, various research techniques were used, such as a driving simulator and an observational study. Most remarkable conclusion: we don't always notice, but in traffic we see more than we think.\n\nDrivers as well as pedestrians typically reported an interest in other road users\u2019 behaviour. Reporting changes in objects on or alongside a familiar road or pavement proved difficult. However, participants\u2019 behavioural responses revealed they had perceived more information than they were aware of. They complied with a route diversion sign on a motorway or avoided a signboard on a pavement. Without having any recollection of this immediately afterwards.\n\nPeople get used to familiar traffic environments so much that they don\u2019t have to think about walking or driving with much conscious focus. They can act without thinking about it, so they don\u2019t always even remember what they\u2019ve done. Despite the apparent lack of full or even partial awareness, road information \u2013 including information that has changed in an otherwise familiar environment \u2013 may still guide behaviour. This outcome is also important for the way in which research on road users should be conducted.",
