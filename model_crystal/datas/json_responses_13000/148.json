I have excellent communication skills in Dutch, English and Spanish and in-depth knowledge of Latin American culture. I am a passionate, ambitious, motivated and flexible team-worker who loves to work in an international working environment where I can combine my passion for other cultures with my passion for travelling and 'making a difference'. The past few years my interest in the field of philanthropy has grown through work-experience related to fairtrade, women cooperatives, women empowerment and reproductive health campaigns. At the same time I also hope to continue my career in education and combine my teaching experience with new challenges.",

Because of my contacts in the tourleader industry I was able to receive many groups of tourists in the restaurant, giving them a full-night of entertainment with great food, music and salsa-dancing! Due to local ecological problems and the gobal crisis the restaurant went through a very rough year in 2010. Instead of closing down I was able to sell the the turn-key business in 2011. Besides the regular restaurant business I worked with female weavers from another village Santa Catarina Palopo. who sold their work in the  restaurant, stimulating fairtrade and women empowerment.",
