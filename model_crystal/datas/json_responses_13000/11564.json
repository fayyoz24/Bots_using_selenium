    "summary": "Dr. Carmen Anthonj is an Assistant Professor on GeoHealth at ITC. Her research focuses on water- and health-related infrastructure, knowledge and behaviour. She considers water and health challenges from a broader nexus perspective, including implications of inequality, extreme weather events, education, cultural context. She is interested in local knowledge, perspectives and perceptions of water- and health-related challenges and understanding how such local and contextualized knowledge can be used to inform public health planning and decision making. She conducts empirical mixed methods research from local to global level and with different stakeholders, and collaborates with international organizations, governments, local organizations and research institutes globally. Her regional focus is on Sub-Saharan Africa, South Pacific and Latin America.\n  \nCarmen Anthonj has a PhD in medical geography from the GeoHealth Centre at the Institute for Hygiene and Public Health ar the University Clinics of Bonn, Germany, and a Diplom in geography from the University of Bonn (focus on medical geography). She conducted postdoctoral studies at the Water Institute, Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, US before joining ITC in 2020.",

The aim of this Information System was to provide a Decision Support System to the local, regional and national decision makers. Themes of research included quantification of water (floods, availability of water, water use), quality of water, land use and its change (moving from agriculture to aquaculture due to policies), climate change and mitigation, socio-economic aspects (educational standards, knowledge management, institutional and legal mapping).",

The aim of the KIBEX project was to assess the vulnerability of the population and critical infrastructure (KRITIS) to extreme weather events (torrential rain, heat waves, drought) as a result of the climate change. In addition to developing criteria and methods for vulnerability assessment, an appraisal of the possible consequences of cause-and-effect chains and interdependencies was also be carried out, the results of which will serve, among other purposes, as a basis for the development of adaptation measures to vulnerable populations.",

One component aimed to strengthen capacities for disaster management boost capacity in flood disaster management, and ensured the improvement of existing emergency management systems in riparian countries to deal with the Mekong floods more effectively, through capacity building, knowledge sharing and public awareness campaigns at the provincial, district and community levels. Another component aimed to improve land management techniques through the use of flood probability maps and addressed the issues of flood probability assessment techniques, improved land use planning methods and damage-reducing land management policies in order to achieve sustainable natural resource management in the Basin.
