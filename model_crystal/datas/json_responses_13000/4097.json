    "summary": "My name is Kyungwon Kang and I was born in South Korea. I\u2019ve spent much of my life traveling throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. Other than the world of Arts, my passions include cooking, travelling and photography. \nAfter earning my degree in International Bachelor of Arts and Culture Studies from Erasmus University, Rotterdam, I felt motivated to innovate and influence the world of art dealings.\nMy extensive knowledge of the art world goes beyond my education.\nFor 6 years I was a tour guide of significant museums such as Louvre and The National Gallery, as well as historically notable locations like Mont Saint-Michel and Edinburgh. \nMy ambitions for the future entail having my own art dealership, and being an art gallerist and auctioneer.",
