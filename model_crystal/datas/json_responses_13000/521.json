    "summary": "Jeroen van Erp graduated from the Faculty of Industrial Design at Delft Technical University in 1988. After graduation he started as a freelance designer. In 1992, he was one of the founders of Fabrique in Delft, which positioned itself as a multidisciplinary design bureau. He established the interactive media department in 1994, focusing primarily on developing websites for the World Wide Web - brand new at that time. \nUnder Jeroen's joint leadership, Fabrique has grown through the years into a multifaceted design agency. It currently employs a staff of more than 100 artists, engineers and storytellers working for a wide range of customers: from supermarket chain Albert Heijn to the Rijksmuseum.\nFabrique develops visions, helps its clients think about strategies, branding and innovation and realises designs. Preferably cutting straight through the design disciplines, so that the traditional borders between graphic design, industrial design, spatial design and interactive media are sometimes barely recognisable. In Fabrique's vision, this will be the only way to create apparently simple solutions for complex and relevant issues in future. \nIn recent years, the agency has won more than 130 prizes and nominations in the Netherlands and abroad. Fabrique also opened offices in Amsterdam in February 2007 and in Rotterdam in 2012.\nJeroen is currently innovation strategist and founding partner. He is as a strategist and concept developer closely involved in various projects including ones for the Design Museum in London, Schiphol Airport, the City of Agra (India) and the Dutch Design Week. \nBetween 2015 and 2021 he was a full professor of concept design at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering / Delft University of Technology. He is a member of the supervisory board of What Design Can Do, the chair of the supervisory board of Eurosonic Noorderslag and member of the supervisory board of the renowned Arco furniture company.",

Industrial design agencies have developed from designing artifacts into designing value. They help their clients to stay relevant for their customers. Zeeno and VLA created a movie about why and how design agencies in the Netherlands do that, with the help of Van Berlo, npk, Fabrique, Indes, Van der Veer, Spark, Philips Design and Flex. Supported by a group of 43 Dutch industrial design agencies. The movie was made possible by the generous support of AgentschapNL IOP-IPCR and Design United.",

He established the interactive media department in 1994, focusing primarily on developing websites for the World Wide Web - brand new at that time. \nUnder Jeroen's joint leadership, Fabrique has grown through the years into a multifaceted design agency. It currently employs a staff of more than 100 artists, engineers and storytellers working for a wide range of customers: from supermarket chain Albert Heijn to the Rijksmuseum.\nFabrique develops visions, helps its clients think about strategies, branding and innovation and realises designs. Preferably cutting straight through the design disciplines, so that the traditional borders between graphic design, industrial design, spatial design and interactive media are sometimes barely recognisable. In Fabrique's vision, this will be the only way to create apparently simple solutions for complex and relevant issues in future. Jeroen was general manager of Fabrique [brands, design & interaction] until 2006.",

The Syndicate of Melodies was a management, a recording company and a publishing company for the music industry. We made 360\u00ba deals with bands, before this term was invented. The company was founded with money we got from MCA USA who signed the Thought. Second signing Fatal Flowers was highly successful. Third signing Blue Murder was the first band from the so called Amsterdam Guitar school that got a minor hit with Talk Talk Talk. The Fatal Flowers recorded 4 albums. The second one, Younger Days got a rave review from David Fricke in Rolling Stone. Furthermore we did projects with de Div (with Michel Schoots, later drummer with Urban Dance Squad) and Rainer Hensel (film composer).",
