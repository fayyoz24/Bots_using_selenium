Service design is a tool for designing a more sustainable society. Interaction design offers us insight into creating more user-oriented services. Design practitioners Fran Samalionis from IDEO, Arne van Oosterom from DesignThinkers and Paul Thurston from thinkpublic share their service design thinking and the benefits of the service design process for both companies and for the public sector. Various service design case studies from different business areas and different cultural contexts are presented and described in detail, and this book opens the discussion on designers\u2019 methods and approaches to developing services.",

Bourne was called in to develop a brand platform and a visual identity for the station that had very ambitious plans. The result is a big success: Bourne created a distinguishing design program, including a custom typeface in both English and Korean script, that defined JTBC as the new look of Korean television.\n",
