    "summary": "Hey, I'm a Senior Business/System Analyst with a deep background in system analysis as well as in business analysis.\n\nI have a strong experience in fintech and insurance domains, mentorship and I do enjoy my work and constantly try to self-develop :) I love to discover new domains, tasks and areas of knowledge and new responsibilities don't frighten me. \n\nI have a lovely husband and a cute doggy. I\u2019m into a healthy style and workouts, they help me to feel perfect. I\u2019m an adherent of selective waste collection and as I love pets, I try to do as much charity as I can through donations to pets\u2019 shelters. \nSometimes I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist but I\u2019m working on myself and doing my best not to be annoying in my perfectionism :D",
