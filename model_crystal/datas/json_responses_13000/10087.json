    "summary": "Hello! My name is Marieke.\n\nI worked 2 years as an International sales manager for an international company in the beauty industry. Previous to this job I worked as a manualist for a company in the healthcare sector and as a weekend employee in a nursing home. \n\nWith my love for the country Turkey, a study in tourism and an interest in the medical sector, I started my company Viva Versa in September 2019. A company in which you can have the pleasure of a holiday with friends/family or loved ones combined with a medical procedure. Viva Versa currently offers, hair transplantations, dental treatments and Gastric Bypass operations for people with Morbid Obesity or Diabetes type 2. \n\nAs a founder of Viva Versa, I want my guests to be in the center of attention. \nI love to go a step further than other travel agencies.  So that the step to a healthy future becomes a little bit easier. I only work with highly professional doctors and internationally certified hospitals and clinics.\n\nMore information about me or Viva Versa?\nGet in contact with me or take a look at the website www.vivaversa.com\n\nHopefully see you soon!\n\n\nmarieke_bouwmans@hotmail.com\ninfo@vivaversa.com\n+31 (0)6 22 11 18 09\n\n",
