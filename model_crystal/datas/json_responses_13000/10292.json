    "summary": "I am currently Head of Allegation Management,  Compliance Assurance and Monitor Liaison Office at Ericsson, where I manage the end-to-end allegation management process, including the allegation intake/assessment process and remediation once the investigation is complete. I am also responsible for overseeing risk assessments and monitoring & testing of our Compliance program.  Finally, I run the Monitor Liaison Office and am the primary point of contact for our independent compliance monitor.\n\nI was previously Ethics & Compliance Officer - Risk at VEON. Successfully completed VEON's three year compliance monitorship as Head of Monitor Liaison Office and the primary point of contact for our independent compliance monitor. I focused on evaluating and managing risk, including conducting risk assessments in VEON's 10 operating companies in Russia, Central Asia and emerging markets and developing VEON's monitoring and testing program to assess the effectiveness of the Ethics & Compliance program on an ongoing basis. I sat on VEON's Group Risk Ethics & Assurance Committee, with a mandate to foster the collaboration among risk assurance functions. I also advised on FCPA compliance and U.S./EU sanctions laws, as well as forensic and compliance investigations, and negotiated anti-bribery clauses.\n\nWhile in private practice, I practiced in three practice groups (Technology, Arbitration and Corporate) in three jurisdictions (Toronto, Ontario, London, England and Paris, France).\n\nI am also a passionate believer in pro bono and work regularly for U.S.-based NGO Lawyers Without Borders as a trainer for their wildlife trafficking training programs, which train judges, prosecutors and wildlife officers in Kenya and Tanzania.  Past pro bono clients have included an inmate on death row in Ohio, an NGO in Uganda that is seeking to protect the victims of the Lord's Resistance Army, the Center for Reproductive Rights that is seeking to document the availability of contraception in Africa and Lawyers Without Borders for a project on inheritance rights in Rwanda following the genocide. \n\nI am a native English speaker, fluent in French (spoken and written) and have a good knowledge of Italian (spoken).\n\nI am a member of the Paris, New York and Ontario bars.",
