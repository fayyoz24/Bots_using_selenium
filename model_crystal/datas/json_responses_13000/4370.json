Parallel to this project, I coordinated the exploration valuation of Clyde. Subsequently I coordinated the joint Shell/Exxon regional evaluation of the UK SNS area for the UK 21st Offshore Exploration Round.\r\nSubsequently, the NAM New Opportunities Team was transformed into the Shell Europe Exploration New Ventures Team, where I was the technical lead for the evaluation of the Ukraine Dniepr-Donets Basin. Since December 2003, we have been establishing relationships with the Ukrainian Oil&Gas Complex, in which I have played a key role. Due to vast differences in culture, this is a challenge in behavioral and interpersonal skills. Given the cirumstances, we have been very successful. This served as the foundation for Shell's current EP activities in Ukraine.",
