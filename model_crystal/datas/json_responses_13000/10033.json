    "summary": "Hi there! I'm Arda, here\u2019s a snapshot of how I keep busy these days:\n\nI manage PRV International, a textiles trading company that I founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Since 2018, I have been doing everything related to running a textiles trading company, from all the boring stuff like accounting and customs, to all the exciting stuff like business dealings and convincing people that the clothes I sell are cool and trendy.\n\nLately, I have a growing interest in Sustainable Fashion. I have started a Sustainable Textiles Sourcing Operation called PRV Sourcing, where I source sustainable clothes for European brands and companies. \n\nBefore this, I worked in a wide range of fields namely Business Planning, International Trade, Management Consulting, SME Financing and Sales Management, as well as in non-profit Youth Organisations like the European Youth Parliament (EYP) and Model United Nations (MUN). \n\nTo summarise, I specialise in International Business Development and International Trade, and more specifically in the trading of textiles goods between Turkey and the EU. \n\nI am fluent in English and Turkish, I am fluent enough to talk business in French, I can (barely) watch Narcos in Spanish and I can order a pasta in Italian.\n\nIf you made it this far, I guess what I do is interesting to you. Give me a call or send me an email to discuss how our interests can meet! \n\narda@toucheprive.com",
