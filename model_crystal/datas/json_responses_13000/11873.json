    "summary": "Oscar is one of the founders of Toky, a cloud-based call center that is making the world smaller with telecommunications. Serving more than thousands of customers around the globe, helping them to communicate with their customers as if they were talking to a friend.\n\nThe journey of founding a company and having clients around the world, gave him the experience to motivate and mentor other local entrepreneurs in LATAM and especially in Paraguay. Oscar collaborated in different workshops, as a counselor, and lately made book contributions on methods and practices for young entrepreneurs in the face of global challenges\n\nIn the past, Oscar volunteered at Techo, an NGO that empowers community leaders that have unequal access to opportunities and basic rights. He has been part of WEF\u2019s Global Shapers, and currently represents the tech and software industry with other local leaders in a civil society group called Paraguay Ahora, a platform which seeks to build the future of Paraguay through multisectoral lobby.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\" \u2014 Since the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey, I have always been fascinated with how meaningful and transcendent results are achieved when working in synergy as a team and as a community. I have learned to value co-creation and I have shaped my behavior to promote collaboration, empathy and the importance of sharing ideas. This facilitates new coincidences and solves issues from a solutions-oriented perspective, by integrating new ideas, minds, and people together.\n\nAs it happens in open source software, working ethically, transparently and openly with people, always brings a solution to complex challenges. A responsible leader promotes and embodies these concepts.\n\nI'm a strong believer that technology can make a positive influence on individuals, their environment, the ecosystem, and help us build a better future, where opportunities and access to information could be used for having a favorable impact on people's life.\"",

To overcome this perception, Viadedo targeted safety as the major priority in the project\u2019s development, allowing users to check drivers\u2019 credentials on Facebook. Car owners can alsopost a route that is only visible to their Facebook friends or friends of friends. In the context of South America, especially Paraguay, with poor public transportation systems, cities have neither planned for the skyrocketing number of cars, nor for any real control of growing CO\u00b2 emissions. With carpooling, Viadedo not only makes it easier for people to be a part of a viable solution, but also teaches them that taking care of the environment is a win/win situation for all.",
