    "summary": "I am an Aeronautical engineering student, completing her fourth year of study. My interests in aeronautical engineering are in the areas of structural development and analysis, software development and the impact of airflow on structures. My notable skills include technical design, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.\nOutside of class, I have also carried out some aviation- related work both theoretically and practically with respect to landing gear design, designing a control system and working on research projects. We have also worked in groups to create a fleet replacement plan for an aviation company and I have acquired first-hand experience on working in several project teams and being able to take charge of the project group. Currently, I am part of Team Apollo, where we build a car that participates in the annual Shell eco-marathon. I was appointed as the manager of the steering wheel where we designed the steering wheel and the layout of all the electrical connections with respect to the rest of the car.",
