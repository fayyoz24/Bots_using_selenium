    "summary": "I am a professor of Nutrition, Dietetics and Life style at the HAN University of Applied Sciences and a professor of Dietetics at Wageningen University & Research. My daily activities include (coordination of) nutrition research, with special focus on nutrition for older adults. Also, empowering dietitians and the dietetic profession to prove effectiveness of dietetic interventions in daily practice is a major research area. \n\nI am a member of the Dutch Dietetic Association, The Dutch Academy of Nutrition Scientists, and chair of the section adults of the Dutch Malnutrition Steering Group. I am on the supervisory board of the international initiative Nutrition Day. I am on the editorial board of the Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Voeding en Dietetiek. I have been on the  board of the Educational and Clinical Practice Committee within ESPEN and on the board of its Dutch daughter society NESPEN for many years. \nIn the past, I have participated in the Dutch Annual Measurement of Care Problems and in several committtees of the Health Council of the Netherlands. I am on the core group of the Global Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) to come to a worldwide set of diagnostic criteria for malnutrition. \n\nI started my career as a clinical dietitian at Antoni van Leeuwenhoekziekenhuis and OLVG. I moved to Amsterdam umc (location VUmc) and worked at VUmc for almost 30 years, as a clinical dietitian, as PhD candidate, as manager and as senior researcher. \nI did my PhD on 'Malnutrition in head and neck cancer patients' (2000). Then I became head of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics of the VUmc, supervising approximately 40 employees, including dietitians, nutrition support team nurses, researchers and secretaries. In 2009 I decided to focus on research only. During the past few years I have been supervising PhD students, teaching, and acquiring research grants.\n\nIn 2019 I was awarded the EFAD European Fellowship Award 2019: \".......for her continuous, outstanding and significant contribution to the advancement of dietetic practice, research and education at a national and international level. Over almost 30 years, Marian has built up a multifaceted and thorough expertise in dietetic patient care, research and education. Her research activities span most of the entire professional field. She maintains regional, national and international networks in healthcare, research and education. Her goal is to use her ability to inspire people to get along with both professional field and researchers to take dietetics to a higher level\".",

We focus on two major research lines: \n\nEffectiveness of dietetic interventions\nDietetics is a relatively new profession, and is currently facing the challenge of demonstrating its effectiveness. We seek to contribute by bringing structure to data collection in order to demonstrate the added value of nutritional support, for multiple clinical pictures. \n\nNutritional status of older adults\nThe second research area deals with the nutritional status of older people. The population is aging, which raises the following questions: How can people remain fit as long as possible? How can people recover as quickly and as effectively as possible? What role does nutrition play? And how can nutrition and exercise enhance each other?",
