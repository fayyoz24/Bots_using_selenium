    "summary": "I have been working in a secondary school for more than 25 years being a teacher of french. This has given me a lot of satisfaction, working with adolescents, trying to understand their preoccupations, but also loving teaching french litterature, organizing exchanging trips with pupils to Normandy (Rouen) and Paris and meeting former students in my travelbookshop in the centre of Amsterdam.\n\nAs I still like working with young people, I've got a job now at VU University Amsterdam (Integrative Neurophysiology). A small part of my work there is teaching these PhD's and Postdocs from all over the world the dutch language. I would like to expand this part, as teaching seems an occupation I love most.\nThis next to my job as a bookseller of travel litterature, which is a thrilling experience meeting every day people from everywhere who love reading.\n\nSpecialties: Expert in litterature from and about far away countries, in organising lectures with dutch travelwriters, in teaching high level French and Dutch.",
