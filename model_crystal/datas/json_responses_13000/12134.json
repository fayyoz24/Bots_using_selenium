Amongst other projects, I am currently involved in the NGF AiNed Fellowship Grants programme and the ENW Open Competition. Furthermore, I sit on the PWN Innovation committee as a representative of NWO. \n\nBefore starting at NWO, I obtained my PhD from the Wolfson Center for Mathematical Biology at the University of Oxford, where my research focused on mathematical modelling of autoimmune myocarditis and the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the development and progression of this disease.",
