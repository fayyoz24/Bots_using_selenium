    "summary": "After an initial position as acquisition geophysicist in the Middle East, I joined Shell International as a petroleum engineer. After a series of jobs as a petrophysicist in Oman, Holland and Brunei I moved into technical management with positions of development manager in Holland and then Brunei. I was then fortunate enough to become asset manager in Brunei for the Eastern offshore asset, a collection of 8 oil and gas fields,where I was responsible for subsurface development, engineering and operations. This was followed by the role of Technical Director until my retirement from Shell in 2005. Thereafter I did technical recruiting for experienced staff for Shell. Once the recruiting requirements diminished in 2008, I joined Logica as a business consultant at the interface between Shell business requirements and Logica's  IT solutions. After a second retirement, I was still eager to continue working and joined WTS recruiting in The Hague, where I hope to use my broad Oil and Gas exposure to ensure we generate the best possible candidates for our clients. After a very pleasant couple of years working from WTS Energy's Dubai office, it was time to come home and retire from WTS. However, I am still keen to keep busy with freelance/consulting activities in any of the areas that I still feel myself competent in",
