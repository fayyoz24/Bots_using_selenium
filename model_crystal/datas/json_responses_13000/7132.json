The purpose of the study was to investigate and understand the current situation with the fixed-route passenger bus system in Thua Thien Hue Province in\u00a0the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Therefore, the thesis writing process assumed staying abroad, so I spent 3-3.5 months in Vietnam as my field destination. The paper includes the criteria of and actual assessment of the bus network infrastructure quality and evaluates to what degree the available bus service meets the mobility needs of the local population. The paper (as the project name implies) also examines the sustainability of the bus service's development based on a specific set of criteria relevant to the context of the local lifestyle and environment and also taking into account the absence of universally accepted sustainable transport criteria. The results of the work were presented 3 times: initially, in front of the International Development and Economics Department's staff at Hue University College of Economics, later in front of the English-speaking audience consisting of local and international experts during the celebration of Vietnam's '50-year Economic Integration and Development' anniversary and finally, in front of the faculty members at Utrecht University. The completion of the project ensured me a successful graduation from Utrecht University and obtaining the Master's degree in the area of Sustainable Development.",

The paper attempts to analyze the impact, processes and prerequisites for 'land grabbing' (using the case study of the MaToPiBa region in Brazil) and tracks the impact and various forms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the field. The results shed light on the problem from two perspectives and motives: land grabbing, encouraged or carried out by the national governments, as well as by private investors. This is a desk study that uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to study the problem by reviewing the case of Brazil. The 2008 economic crisis affected most investor strategies for investment securities. The unreliability of securities changed the opinion of most investors and pushed them to the outflow of their investments from this source. Therefore, most of them started actively searching for more stable and promising alternatives. This alternative has been found in land investment. The capitalization of land has turned the value of land as a vital means of food production into a major source of profit, which threatened the lives and livelihoods of the local population. The global nature of this trend has made the issue of land grab a very relevant research topic and substantiated the topic choice as the most relevant for study. The completion of the project ensured me a successful graduation from Bilkent University and obtaining the Bachelor degree in the area of International Relations.",
