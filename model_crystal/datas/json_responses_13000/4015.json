Every year in February, incenses are lit to mourn the dead. The survivors still offer a \u2018Taihan (Korean military)\u2019 memorial ceremony on the day when all inhabitants of the village were murdered at an instance. In the 1960s, Korea participated in the Vietnam War as an ally of the United States, where they have massacred many civilians. Yet, Korea only remembers the war as a springboard for its following economic growth. Between Vietnam and Korea, between 1968 and 2016, and between the public memory and the private, there lies the memory of state violence. What cannot become \u2018history\u2019belongs to a \u2018woman\u2019, a \u2018blind\u2019, and a \u2018deaf\u2019. There they remain, kindling incense and offering a ritual for the victims. The first thing these \u2018survivors\u2019, \u2018second generation\u2019, and \u2018witnesses\u2019 did when they visited Korea was to embrace the Korean comfort women and to cry together with the bereaved families of the Sewol ferry disaster. The memories of those who have survived still hover around us, failing to become public memories. The memories of war become the war of memories.\n\n-FESTIVALS\uff5cAWARDS\n2018 The 23rd Busan International Film Festival \u2013 Special mention, BIFF Mecenat Award\n2019 Seoul Independent DOcumetary Festival\n2019 The 21st Seoul International Women's Film Festival \u2013 Korean Feature Competition Nominated",

The director rejected the educational system herself and deliberates on alternative education. She makes up a new vocabulary, \u2018Road-schooler\u2019, to represent the teenagers who deny the names such as home-schoolers or school-quitters and learn on the road about life itself. Program Note A documentary on teenagers who boldly challenge the educational system and contemporary times that promote so-called \u2018limitless competition\u2019 from elementary schools. The director rejected the educational system herself and reflects upon alternative education. She coins a new phrase, \u2018Road-schooler\u2019, that refers to teenagers who reject terms such as home-schoolers or schoolquitters and learn on the road about life itself. This is a breath of fresh air despite the very competitive Korean educational reality that meets these teenagers who choose their own education.
