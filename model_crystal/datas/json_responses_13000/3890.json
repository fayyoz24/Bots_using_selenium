    "summary": "I have 4 important facets that makes me the ideal business development  consultant for East meets West type of Enterprises and projects. Firstly I am a mini  serial entrepreneur having started more than 4 successful businesses   in China and in Europe during my professional career and therefore I understand taking risks with my own money as well as someone else's. Secondly  I have an MBA in international finance and have therefore added academic and theoretical knowledge to my own pragmatic experience. Thirdly I am an expert communicator  and mediator because I listen to people and use my broad knowledge to understand and advise;  because I am completely fluent in Chinese and English I can do this for both Chinese and European  business executives. Finally in my personal life I am a cross cultural person living my life in a mixture of Chinese and English and Dutch environments.\n \nI was born in Mianyang (the secret Science City) in Sichuan in China and I am passionate about this city and the role it has to play in building  the future Chinese economy and nation. Science, innovation, finance and business development are the key business topics that I find interesting and stimulating and very important for the future. They go hand in hand when  looking for new business opportunities and I hope to help as many companies as possible establish new enterprises in China and in Europe.\n",
