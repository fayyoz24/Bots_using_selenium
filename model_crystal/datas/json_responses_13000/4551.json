    "summary": "My passion is helping innovative organizations to reach their strategic goals by communicating in ways that engage and inspire.\n\nThe common thread in my diverse professional life is communication, which to me means connecting people. Over more than 25 years, I\u2019ve developed a finely tuned and flexible set of skills to help business leaders, researchers, policy makers and other innovators engage their stakeholders. I have a talent for finding the clear and simple message in complex information, and presenting it in the most compelling way to reach target audiences. Communicate with head and heart is my motto. \n\nI love working at the interface between science, business and the arts, and building bridges to connect these worlds. I have deep and broad communications experience in the areas of pharma/biotech and life sciences, clinical research, health and healthcare. I also have substantial experience in financial journalism, news translation, corporate social responsibility reporting, and communications focused on education, documentary film and literature. This diversity reflects my passion for diving into new worlds, where I ask the questions specialists usually don\u2019t think to ask. \n\nAs an all-round communications professional, I draw on expertise gained as a teacher, fiction writer, journalist, translator (Dutch to English), magazine editor-in-chief, publications launcher and manager, freelance writer and editor, corporate storyteller and strategic communications consultant. \n\nI\u2019m a native English speaker, fluent in Dutch, with good reading and comprehension skills in French. Raised in an Australian\u2013Dutch family in Australia and living in the Netherlands since 1989, I am bicultural and an expert in cross-cultural communication. \n\n",
