    "summary": "I am an assistant professor of persuasive communication at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research, University of Amsterdam and co-director of the Digital Communication Methods Lab. My research focuses on how insights gained from data can be used to adjust communication between organizations and consumers. I am also interested in how such data-driven communication impacts cognitions, attitudes, and behavior of consumers as well as what unintended effects such communication has on individuals and the society. In addition, I teach various Bachelor's and Master's level courses and am involved in the development of new courses at the department.",

Therefore, delivering the right content to the right person at the right moment with personalised marketing communication (PMC) tactics becomes increasingly valuable. Technology, big data, and social media deliver marketers insights into the personal interests of individuals. However, for consumers PMC tactics may make communication more relevant, but also more intrusive. This PhD project examines this tension by answering the questions what makes PMC tactics a persuasive strategy and under which circumstances they may have a boomerang effect on consumers.",
