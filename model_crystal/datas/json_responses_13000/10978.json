The event is aimed at marketing students of Dutch top universities in the final phase of their studies. Every year, about 300 students apply. The companies that participate in this event, eventually select 160 students. During a couple of inhouse days (prior to the battle) and during the event itself, complex marketing cases needed to be worked out and presented.\nFor the finale we had to solve a marketing case for DSM, which is a global science based company active in health nutrition and materials. We had to look into the application of beer enzyme products and the relationship with suppliers. We won because of our level of out-of-the- box AND practical thinking in solving the case.",

My task was also to collect examples of products that had already been made using the newly introduced guidelines, analyze them and give recommendations for better use of the branding guidelines. At the launch, all collegues at the different foreign offices were provided with a toolbox consisting of the new font, templates and visuals. My research showed that was a clear demand for enrichment of the toolbox with more ready-to-use visuals and more templates. The second part of my internship I spend on enriching the toolbox with various means and created a lot of new visuals and added new templates.",

This charity supports households who can no longer afford daily groceries. 13,000 families in the Netherlands, of which 900 to 1000 in Amsterdam, depend on food banks in the provision of their daily food. Because of the fact that this number was growing rapidly, the Food Bank could hardly cope with the demand. And the warehouse they were housed in, was soon to be closed. Time to help! We were divided in six teams to provide concrete solutions for the organisation, knowing: structural relationships (with food suppliers),  inventory system, communication strategy, new housing, HR policy and a plan for the future. My team took care of making a plan for the realisation of structural relationships with food suppliers (preferably fresh food). We provided a list of local suppliers and already contacted a few big companies. Someone arranged a call center to contact the other 600. We got a big Dutch department store make Christmas packages for kids. We offered help in creating a system for giant corporates to ask their employers to donate their Christmas package to the Food Bank instead of keeping it for themselves.\n"
