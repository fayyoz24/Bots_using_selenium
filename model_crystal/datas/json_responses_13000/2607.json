I helped \nincreasing the software quality and implemented features in \ndifferent areas like field service procedures, FDPA (scanning \ndiagnostic procedure), motor drive software and solved \nnumerous problem reports. I used IBM Rhapsody code generation \nfor implementing the features. \n\n(Software designer) When the study of the acquisition \narchitecture was completed, the architecture was to be \nproductized and I made an analysis of the control architecture \nusing different UML tools. The architecture was modeled and \nsimulated and after approval the architecture was deployed to \nreverse the event driven architecture into a control driven \narchitecture. Even today I am working on completing the \narchitecture/design, the size of the sub-system is ~4000Kloc \nC++/C# deployed in 29 Clear Case projects.\n\n(Software designer) I was assigned back to geometry to design \nand realize a prototype for an adapter that enabled interfacing \nwith third party surgery tables.

The \nrestriction interface controls 12 movements and 24 sensor \ninputs per movement to make sure the system can be moved \nsafely, in case of errors or collisions the interface enables the user \nto override specific errors in order to complete the procedure on \nthe patient safely in any circumstance. For this purpose I created \na Domain Specific Language (DSL) to describe complex state \nbehaviors. Because of the complexity of the software and the \nstate driven behaviors the design is simulated by a student using \nASD (Verum analytical software design).\n\n(Software designer) Designed and implemented the \nPatient&Beam which function is to control multiple movements \neither manually or automatically. This software unit is also \nresponsible for interactive error handling towards the end user. \nThe unit is ~300Kloc C++ supported by a unit test of ~200Kloc \nexecuting ~6000 automatic test-cases.
