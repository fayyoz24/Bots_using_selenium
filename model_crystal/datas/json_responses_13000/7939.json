The objective of the project is analyzing the current situation in Bulgaria and researching the experience of ten other European countries.

However, a lack of awareness means EU citizens do not fully exercise their right to vote in European and local elections and many are unaware of their right to consular protection from other Member States' embassies. \nThe report is based on input from citizens through surveys and a public consultation, and focuses on four areas: 1) promoting EU citizenship rights and EU common values; 2) increasing citizens' participation in the democratic life of the EU; 3) simplifying EU citizens' daily lives; 4) strengthening security and promoting equality.",
