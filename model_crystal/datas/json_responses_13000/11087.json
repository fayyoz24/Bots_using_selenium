I'm very passionate about leadership, teaching, public speaking and motivating people.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udddf\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddd8\n\nI have been studying software engineering and machine learning for the past few years and I have some experience in optimisation algorithms. I am also very excited about building robust micro-services using different tech stacks. I am currently working at Flexport and helping them build an internal near-real-time Accounting software for P&L visibility of freight shipments using Kotlin, Spring Boot and MongoDB.\n\nNot to forget, due to my passion for knowledge sharing and teaching, I also have 7 years of experience in mentoring FIRST Lego League teams and teaching children about algorithmic thinking using different tools such as EV3 Mindstorm and MIT App Inventor and Python.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde1\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde1 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7\n\nI absolutely believe in life-long learning. I am eager to learn as much as possible about leadership, entrepreneurship, software, machine learning and new ways of teaching. I truly believe we can make a better education system using these skills... \n\nI always like to push myself out of my comfort zone and above all, I value teamwork.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions regarding Software, Leadership or Education, don't hesitate to connect with me and message me! \n\nI can't wait to hear your ideas. \ud83d\ude01",

This year we decided to offer them something a little different and even more exciting as we are built a chain reaction experiment that took place through the whole school building.\n\nThe project was quite ambitious: a large group of students set up a chain experiment under the mentorship of professors and former students: a series of links that work on physical and chemical principles, with the previous link launching the next one in the chain. The chain experiment was conducted over all 4 floors and through several classrooms and other rooms of the school.\n\nWe firmly believe that through such work, we allow students to grow personally, to develop their self-initiative, and to have an excellent working environment in which they enhance creativity, teamwork, critical thinking and put their knowledge into practice.\n\n",
