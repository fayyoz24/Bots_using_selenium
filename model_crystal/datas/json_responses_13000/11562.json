    "summary": "Rob's background is rural infrastructure, water supply, irrigation and drainage; all in context of international development. He is specialised in Rural Road Infrastructure Development and maintenance, with over 25 years professional experience. He started his career in hydrology research, and switched to the private sector in 1990. Between 1992 and 1997 Rob worked for the ILO in rural access improvement and irrigation development projects \n\nSince 1997 Rob has been an independent consultant in rural roads and transport infrastructure development and access planning, with special focus on appropriate technology in design, implementation and maintenance of roads and other access provisions. He worked on assignments for international organisations, development banks, consulting firms and NGO\u2019s and in the private sector in over twenty countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. He has worked on short and medium term assignments on development of projects and programmes, aimed at the most effective use of (local) resources. \n\nIn 2007 Rob launched OCA (Orion Consulting Associates) and he is the Managing Director of the company. OCA provides consultancy services in the international market, focused on the rural  transport infrastructure sector. See OCA LinkedIn page (Orion Consulting Associates) under companies.\n\nIn 2020, Xanitation Solutions was born: a new initiative in WASH. After two years of development and testing by a Dutch group of design engineers we have developed XOPI, a soap dispenser, specially designed for schools and local health clinics. It is a rigid and strong device, works with the cheapest soap bars, secured within the device. The comparable benefit to liquid soaps is the low cost of refill, the availability of soap in the local market and the much lower carbon footprint and no plastic waist of refill bottles.",
