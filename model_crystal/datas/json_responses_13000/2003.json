    "summary": "Technical expert with 40 years experience in E&P.  Background in R&D followed by Technical Leadership and Technical Governance roles. Presently working for the Dutch E&P regulator. Previous job in Oman:  \u201cPDO Technical Advisor\u201d, responsible for Shell's technical governance of  \"Petroleum Development Oman\", a joint-venture of the Government of Oman, Shell, Total and Partex. \n\nAfter my physics study I joined Shell starting with geomechanical research on the differences between observed subsidence above producing oil and gas fields and predictions based on lab measurements and geomechanical modeling (e.g. in Groningen, Venezuela, Californi\u00eb). Based on this work  I obtained a PhD in Geomechanics from Delft University. I  studied and predicted \"pore-collapse\"  in carbonates prior to its observation in the field (e.g. in Ekofisk and in Sarawak). Later, I involved with inversion based derivation of in-situ compaction behaviour form surface observed deformations.  Research on the electrical, capillary and flow behaviour of reservoir rocks.  Published petrophysical and geomechanical research results. \n\nWorked for Shell in many places and countries.  Leadership roles, including \u201c Global Head of Petrophysics\u201d  with responsibility for some 400 Petrophysicist and Geomechanical experts around the world. Strongly interested in Technology Development and Technology Implementation, key business for successful E&P companies. I served on the SPWLA technical committee, as a technical editor for  SPE, on the board of the Dutch SPWLA chapter (Society of Profesional Well Log Analysts) (93 - 95) and on the SPWLA international board of directors (94/95).\n\nSpecialties: Technical Governance of Oil and Gas Companies\nR&D Benefit analysis\nR&D management\nInterface management, negotiating skills\nGeomechanics\nPetrophysics\nPetrophysical and Geomechanical rock properties\nSCAL",
