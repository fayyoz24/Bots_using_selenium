    "summary": "I am a certified teacher of French, German and English & I lived overseas for 2 years while attending the Universities of Strasbourg & Cologne. Thumbtack, who lists my services as a French / German tutor, has voted me #1 and \"Top Pro\" for several years. On this site thus far I have over 45 five-star reviews.\n\nSince relocating to Maastricht in 2015, on the borders to Belgium and Germany, I now have the opportunity to speak French and German DAILY. I have been teaching German A1/A2/B1 at Maastricht University. This is an additional asset I have been able to offer my private students.\n\nAlthough not a native speaker, it can be a definite asset for several reasons: 1) I am able to completely break down the grammar  so that any student can totally GET IT! and 2) Since I have worked so hard to not speak with an American accent, I am able to breakdown for my students how to phsically achieve the proper pronunciation of both languages.\n\nTeaching language has been a very rewarding profession. I love seeing how  my joy, enthusiasm and passion for German and French language, culture, food and architecture transmits to my students as I teach. I also love seeing my students' horizons broaden, excited about travel, and then seeing their lives literally transform in front of my eyes after experiencing language, culture and travel to a German- or French-speaking country.\n\nFundamentally, I feel any learning activity should be fun. That is why I focus on making the learning of German and French fun!",
