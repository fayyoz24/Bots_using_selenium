    "summary": "Currently I am working as a scientific officer to develop the use of eDNA analyses for the monitoring of invasive species. I am broadly interested in how genetic data can best be integrated to the management of our marine environment.\n\nI am a marine scientist and microbial ecologist and a background in environmental engineering.  I have a passion to understand how our activities are affecting us, and our environments. I have extensive experience in laboratory work as well as in data analysis and bioinformatics with R and Python. Through my work in research I have acquired an independence and an ability to learn on my own, as well as manage complex projects. I enjoy understanding large datasets and communicating findings through concise and engaging visualisations, specifically with the use of R. My experience living in several countries has taught me to be flexible and open-minded, and to communicate across cultural differences.",

I planned and set up new experimental methodologies as well as measurements and expertise from different fields of environmental science. I also analysed large datasets with python and R using multivariate statistics, and with concise and engaging visualisations.",
