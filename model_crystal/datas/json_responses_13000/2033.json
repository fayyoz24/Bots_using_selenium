Train all aspects of your golf game through different challenges: from long distance driving to short distance pitching and chipping, from bunker exits to putting. By registering every ball in an easy and intuitive way, you will get to know your own game better and improve faster. \nYour training results are used to simulate how you would perform on an actual course through a Virtual Handicap, which you can compare with your actual handicap. Also get a useful overview of your chances to shoot a birdy, par or a (double) bogey. Moreover, the app will calculate your probabilities for a mishit or an unsuccessful bunker exit. \nFinally, Master Golf will pinpoint the areas of the game you should practice to improve your score on a real course.",
