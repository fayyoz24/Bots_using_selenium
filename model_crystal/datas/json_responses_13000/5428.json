I dove headfirst into external stakeholder management helping Product Managers translate high level concepts into actionable items that could later be used in sprint planning. After approximately a month, I was given the lead of one of our product accounts and lead those external meetings. Additionally, I organised and built a vast majority of the Notion space for the product team, including spaces for external stakeholders to get updates on their product development, internal pages on the product team structure, SOPs, Processes, Tool Guides, and Master databases of communication channels and tasks that were later linked throughout the different pages. Furthermore, I collaborated in two extra grass root initiatives, the DEI employee circle and the Sustainability circle. In both of these I contributed to the research databases, and monthly deliberation and iteration meetings.",

This task required intensive independent research on government policy, EU heavy duty truck market, environmental laws, and reaching out to product developers of the top companies. \n\nSeveral calculation were included in this business case, such as total cost of ownership, potential CO2 reductions, and return on investment. Furthermore, a comparative study of CO2 reduction were made taking into account current use, depreciation of the assets, and the possibility of a CO2 tax. At the ending of my research, I was given the opportunity to inform logistic departments from across the globe about environmental policy development in the EU and what this meant for Barry Callebaut and other market leaders in the food industry. \n\nAnother secondary activity included support for KPI monitoring for the EMEA and EEMEA warehouse, which required knowledge in Microsoft Excel, intercultural communication skills, and a lot of professional email writing. \n\nUltimately, I learned to multitask, heighten  my attention to detail, and spearheading my own projects.",
