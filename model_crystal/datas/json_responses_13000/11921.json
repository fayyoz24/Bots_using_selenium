    "summary": "I am a goal-oriented and entrepreneurial-minded professional with a passion for innovation and a track record of success in providing evidence-based, data-driven strategic insights. My experience is in developing social-impact business models and tech-based solutions. I have honed my skills in strategic and analytical thinking, allowing me to identify opportunities for growth and lead effective implementation efforts.\n\nHaving grown up in Syria and experienced the first 12 years of war, I learned how to operate in challenging and rapidly changing environments. As the founder and CEO of ChangeMakers, I leveraged my entrepreneurial skills to create impactful programs focused on women's empowerment and community prosperity. This experience allowed me to develop a competitive and agile skillset, while also building my network with world shapers worldwide.\n\nI am particularly interested in pursuing a career trajectory in strategy and innovation, leveraging my experience and skills to drive meaningful change in the global industry. My ability to manage multiple stakeholders and complex projects, as well as my passion for innovation and technology, prepare me very well to drive growth and impact.\n\nMy achievements have been recognized by publications such as Forbes, Wamda, and the national website of the Government of The Netherlands. I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for using innovation and technology to create positive change.

Warsha's mission is to help organizations and global socially responsible corporations contribute to youth empowerment worldwide by enabling more education and employment opportunities. Its vision is to create a world with equal opportunities for all.\n\nWarsha aims to assist organizations and corporations in the West by providing them with research-based consultancy services to develop empowerment programs that are tailored for young people in the Middle East, with a special focus on cultural sensitivity and female participation.

In my capacity as their mentor, we worked together to address global issues and develop tech-based and innovative solutions.\n\nIn 2021:\n- Warsha signed an SBIR contract with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the education and employment needs of young people in Jordan. The 6-month research project included the development of a thorough project plan to tackle the education-to-market gap there via digital solutions. The final report reflected on opportunities and threats for the suggested solution, analysis of stakeholders, and development of business and revenue models. It has quickly acquired attention from global leading stakeholders, such as SPARK NGO, Google and the UN.",

Specific focus is given to entrepreneurs creating innovative and sustainable solutions to local challenges and contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nDuring my 6-month internship at Orange Corners, I conducted a research-based strategy aiming to improve their expansion of activities in the Middle East. In my research, I focused on analyzing challenges and barriers which young people in the Middle East face when they aspire to become entrepreneurs based on pre-existing literature and inspired by the group discussions I had with young entrepreneurs in the region. The resilience and determination which young people in conflict zones develop inspired me. My 5+ years of personal experience in entrepreneurship in Syria allowed me to reflect on the academic findings I was able to learn during my internship which strengthened my strategy recommendations and allowed me to thrive in strategizing and development.",

At LeafUp, we pay farmers a living wage to plant fruit and hardwood trees on coffee farms. \n\nIn the past several decades, millions of trees have been lost to make room for mono-culture coffee.  If this continues, the environment will suffer, more birds will lose their habitats and more chemical pesticides will be used which will have major impacts on everyone\u2019s lives, in addition to damaging the soil which will result in low quality coffee.\n\nLeafUp is turning things around by letting coffee drinkers pay for planting trees, save money in return through cool discounts, protect the environment, and empower the farmer.\n\n* Honored to had worked on this remotely with an amazing team from Morocco, The US, Algeria and Tanzania. LeafUp is founded in partnership with Yara International and as part of YSI Innovation Program, which brings together top young talent from across the globe.
