At the same time I started with supporting and advising several clients to improve their international profile and strengthen their business. \n\nIn the past 15 years I have expanded my international network. During my projects I visited various countries such as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Romania and South Korea. In addition I hosted over 50 international groups from all over the world. \nWhat do I like the most in my job? To learn from all the different cultures, to connect people and to develop successful projects.",
