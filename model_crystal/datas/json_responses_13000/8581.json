    "summary": "I am motivated by principled work that centers sustainability, equitable livability, and community well-being. In my early career, I advanced these values as a mobility planner in the US public sector, with emphases on bicycling and transit. Now residing in Europe, I am thrilled to be helping to foster climate neutral cities internationally.\n\nReducing auto-dependence is critical, and meaningful work can be done in many spheres to achieve this goal\u2014from design to data, policy to innovation. I am passionate about creating streets for people, scaling these into vibrant low-traffic neighborhoods that invite families to play and children to explore independently, and facilitating comfortable access to opportunity so residents of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds can lead fulfilling lives.\n\nI am eager to engage continuously with new challenges and potential solutions, collaborate with diverse peoples, learn from and elevate their stories, and support the evolution of places that inspire pride and joy among those who call it home\u2014honoring cultural heritage while embracing change to address the most pressing issues facing societies today.\n\nIf you are doing such work, I am keen to connect with you\u2014perhaps we may find opportunities to support one another's efforts.",

People For Bikes gave the demonstration project an honorable mention among \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best New Bikeways of 2018,\u201d and the city council made the project permanent the following year.\n\n\u2013 Facilitated public-private dialog to establish a framework for and launch the city\u2019s first bike share program. Oversaw installation of 50 painted parking areas and targeted deployment of 300 dockless e-bikes citywide, generating 20,000 trips within the first three months and providing a real-world feasibility study to inform future iterations.\n\n\u2013 Coordinated $4M+ of rapid-build bicycle network investments over the first four years of a 20-year program, delivering larger shares of separated facilities each year. Leveraged early successes and identified shortcomings to help secure $1.5M of additional funding over three years to enable more high-comfort improvements.\n\n\u2013 Contributed to various initiatives to improve department culture, including (i) promoting open and informed dialog about race and social justice issues and their intersection with transportation, (ii) building personal relationships and sharing subject-matter expertise across divisions, and (iii) surveying, examining, and challenging attitudes about traffic safety values and goals.\n\n\u2013 Served as the city\u2019s representative in various regional and professional forums, including invitations to speak on panels at state and national conferences.",
