    "summary": "\u201cOriginally from three continents, countries, and cultures, and having grown up in multicultural environments across the globe, my encounters abroad have taught me the importance of optimism, stepping out of my comfort zone and immersion; diversity and access to such a vibrant lifestyle have given many life experiences that I truly treasure, honing numerous transferable skills.\u201d\n\nIsabel Pieterson is a seventeen-year-old, detail-oriented, high school student who is currently undertaking the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program at United World College in Maastricht.\n\nIsabel is involved in both her school's community and the greater community: having worked with numerous non-profit organisations, like OnePwaa or HundrED, she is keen on advocating for lifelong learning. Furthermore, she is the Founder of 'collaborACE' - a website that offers both GCSE students and teachers the opportunity to freely view and use subject-specific notes, improving access to education amongst students; this platform has expanded internationally and, according to Google Analytics, has users from over 3 continents and 13 countries.\n\nIn 2022, Isabel authored a systematic literature review research paper, \"Evaluation of Helminthic Therapy as a Treatment for Autoimmune Diseases\"; which was peer-reviewed by a panel of professionals and published by 'The International Young Researchers' Conference.' (In partnership with the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons Global Health Organization)\n\nIn her free time, Isabel enjoys skiing, playing the piano and is captivated by storytelling. Having grown up in an international environment, she adores meeting new people, so feel free to connect with her and say \"hello!\" She'd love to learn more about you.",

The main aim of S.T.E.M UP Maastricht is to promote the popularisation of STEM due to the limited access to STEM education among primary students in the Netherlands, particularly focusing on the Maastricht local community. We invited local schools in Maastricht to collaborate with us on - hosting STEM workshops to engage children aged 10-12, teachers, and parents.\n\n\u2022 Hosted a day full of Biology, Chemistry, Maths, and Physics workshops, activities and experiments for children aged 10-12\n\u2022 Prepared, made and gave DIY STEM kits for refugee children in the Refugee (AZC) Centre Maastricht\n\u2022 Communicated with STEM-based organisations throughout the Netherlands to form collaborations (eg. GalactIQ Education, STEAM Limburg)\n\u2022 Communicated with 5+ local schools within Maastricht to invite them to participate\n\u2022 Focused on marketing strategies like advertising through newsletters (Weekend van de Wetenschap - 8000+ subscribers, GalactIQ - 5000+ subscribers) and Instagram",

According to Google Analytics, our users come from 3 continents and over 13 countries.\n\nAt collaborACE, we advocate for equity in education (SDG 4) and are dedicated to improving access to education amongst students, hence this platform was founded and formed in July 2022 by sixteen-year-old Isabel. \n\nCreating a platform like collaborACE has always been a pertinent idea in Isabel's mind. As a GCSE 2022 student herself, Isabel realised that there weren't many high-quality, concise, or 'easy to understand' notes available for students and teachers - in fact, many of the notes required payment for access. collaborACE initially started off as a small summer project, as a medium to 'recycle' GCSE notes, but has now expanded internationally.",
