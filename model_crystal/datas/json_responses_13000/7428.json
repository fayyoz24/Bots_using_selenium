    "summary": "I'm a professional with over six years of experience in sales and management based in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands. My current responsibilities at National Geographic Learning include managing National Geographic Learning's English Language Teaching (ELT) sales in the Benelux region. In this capacity, I collaborate with internal teams and distribution partners within the education sector to identify new sales opportunities and develop effective strategies. I am passionate about working hand-in-hand with our customers, Dutch schools and teachers, to help them identify the teaching materials that match their unique requirements.\n\nIn 2019, I received an award for excellence in customer service, following four years of consistent, positive feedback on the self-founded business I managed in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In addition to my work in sales and management, I have an academic background in healthcare research and teaching and I am a CELTA qualified English teacher with over two years of experience. \n\nIf you would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn Messages.",
