    "summary": "I am French and I studied in the United Kingdom and Canada for about 8 years. Now living in the Netherlands.\nI am also working on several projects of my own on the side. They are about different topics such as nuclear fusion, quantum gravity and dark matter. I have been thinking about ways to use less energy in our world with the same outcome. Some of the ideas I had years ago are just starting to be developed which is promising for the ones I still have in mind...\nI'm also very invested in thinking about how to optimize healthy living without affecting our environment much (high-tech and low-tech). I the last few years I have learnt many skills such as Indesign, Illustrator and other things such as search engine optimization and community management.\nLastly I started doing coding for myself in the form of apps that help me day to day for example finance management and optimization to waste as little of my money as possible. I also started working on a game idea that used my knowledge of physics and environmental interest together. It's still at the very beginning stage since I'm learning mostly from online videos and have plenty of things to handle already.",
