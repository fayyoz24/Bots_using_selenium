Throughout my study, I also gained experience working with multicultural teams and had a chance to study for a semester in South Korea and learn about a completely different culture and the way culture shapes business. I am always eager to learn new things and face new challenges. I look forward to opportunities to gain valuable experience for both personal and professional growth.  ",
