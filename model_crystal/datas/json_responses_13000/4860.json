However, the MDS-UPDRS scoring is not justifiable as it could vary depending on the personal analysis of each rater. Therefore, there is a need for a system to quantify reliably the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The aim of my study was to use the PowerGlove system (wearable hand sensor consiting of accelrometers and gyroscopes) to quantify the severity of bradykinesia and rigidity symptoms and identify the differences between off and on medication thereby resulting in a prospective system than can be used for screening patients in deep brain stimulation(DBS) and also be used as a potential feedback device for closed loop DBS. Whether to use a combination of parameters to identify before and after medication differences, was carried out in this study. The significant changes in the extracted features between the different MDS-UPDRS rating scores was to be studied. A predictive tool was also developed with classification algorithms using the extracted features to predict the rating scale scores of the three bradykinesia tasks - finger tapping, opening closing and pronation supination and two rigidity tasks - extension and flexion of the wrists with and without contralateral activation",

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a vital disease caused by the occlusion of coronary arteries. Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG) is a conventional method of treating this disease. However, doctors have still not identified a standardized procedure to grade the severity of stenosis or occlusion of the arteries. This has led to failure of the graft within one to five years after implantation. Therefore, there was a need for an alternative technique that can be used to help the doctors assess the type, severity and understand the flow distribution pattern in the stenosed regions. This forms the basis of the objective of the project work.\n\nAn attempt was made to simulate CABG using CFD. The model is designed using CATIA software and simulated using ANSYS CFX software to perform Computational Fluid Dynamic Analysis (CFD). Four different anastomotic angles (30\u00ba, 45\u00ba, 60\u00ba and 75\u00ba) were considered for both concentric and eccentric stenosed models. Further analysis has also been done by the same software to understand the transient flow in the coronary arteries. After CFD, 3-D printing of the model was performed to generate the vascular graft prototype.\n\nVarious contour plots of velocity, pressure and wall shear stress were plotted. After analysing the total wall shear stress, 30\u00b0 seemed to be most ideal anastomotic angle to be used for our graft design. ",
