    "summary": "I am passionate about genuine connections, fellow humans and constant new opportunities for learning and growth (on both a personal and professional level). Continually expanding my knowledge in the newest Localization and UX trends, keeping up to date through reading, exchange and active involvement in Localization events is part of my routine. \n\nI am multilingual (I speak German and French on a near-native level having pursued all my education in German teaching schools and having lived and studied in France for a few years), well-travelled and I get a lot of energy from people with diverse backgrounds and linguistic and cultural heritage.\n\n   \u2728\u2728\u2728 My vision is to shift the narrative from Localization to International UX by putting people's needs and cultural identity at the heart of every endeavour.\n\nBecoming a core member of Women in Localization has allowed me to get even closer to the Localization Community.\n\n    \u2728\u2728\u2728 I am a strong believer that great value comes from bringing people and ideas together. We are not meant to be solo travellers, we can achieve greatness only by joining forces.\n\nTravel is an amazing opportunity to experience new cultures and explore inspiring natural environments and I try to travel as much as possible to broaden my knowledge and horizons. I enjoy reading, listening to music, my daily yoga practice, my cats and all the beauty that surrounds us.",

This significantly strengthened and improved the collaboration between Product Management, Design and Localization.\n\n\u2022 Advocated for and ensured that Localization gets a seat at the Product Development table. This has significantly streamlined the localization processes, reduced time to market and established Localization as one of the main drivers of the company's success on the international landscape. \n\n\u2022 Proactively drove the creation of a UX Research initiative revolving around getting a better understanding of our international audience with the ultimate goal of ensuring a culturally appropriate and strong product-market fit.
