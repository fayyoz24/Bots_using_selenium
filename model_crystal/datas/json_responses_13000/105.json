    "summary": "As a passionate and enthusiastic English Language Teacher with more than ten years' experience in the field, I help my clients to communicate with confidence. \n\nAfter graduating from Utrecht University with an MA in English, I trained as a teacher of English as a Foreign Language and gained my CELTA qualification (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults) from the British Language Training Centre in Amsterdam. \n\nI have been teaching both Business and General English to students of all levels at various language schools since 2001. Mostly, my clients have been professional people who need English for their work and the courses were taught in-company, one-to-one or in small groups. My responsibilities include designing and teaching the English language courses as well as conducting the needs analysis, placement testing, assessing students' progress and evaluating courses.The courses I teach are tailor-made in terms of both content and teaching style to meet the individual needs and requirements of the student(s), but are often designed to be as practical and work-related as possible.\n\nAs both a Dutch national and a native English speaker who grew up in the United Kingdom, my bilingual background helps me to understand the typical difficulties experienced by learners of English.",
