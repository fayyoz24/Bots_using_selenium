This showed me the workings of the hospital even closer than my employment at the research institute, but it's also taught me what the necessities are in times of crisis and how to work under pressure. \nDuring the second half of this experience, the job requirements shifted, since the vaccination center was such a high-paced environment and had to shift according to current needs. Along with two other colleagues, we took over the main operative roles of the administrative department. This was a remarkable experience, not only because we were able to work alongside motivated doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, but also because I was able to experience firsthand what it is like to steer a department and what kind of planning and approach is required.",

It reminded me of the impact volunteering makes on animal lives, as well as their caregivers lives. The hard work payed off and we are still in touch with the centre, staying up to date on new developments of the rhinos through their monthly newsletter."

This experience strengthened relations in our group greatly, and after a hard week\u2019s work, to be able to see the children enjoying what we created for them was an incredibly fulfilling reward. It also made me realise that even me, a young student, can make a great impact on someone\u2019s life by helping them directly. This experience has left me with the decision that I want to be further involved in such voluntary actions."
