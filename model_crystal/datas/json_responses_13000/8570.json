Today\u2019s organizations have broadly adopted an Agile mindset and Agile methodologies enabling efficient delivery of software. However, delivering something of value to customers remains a major challenge for many organizations. Therefore, they need to reinvent themselves in such a way that the power trickles down to the product teams and people. These are the people who have the knowledge to make the best decisions, but this has exposed a new kind of problem. The need for product leadership.\n\nProduct Management is a complex, yet amazing profession. Product Managers require a broad range of capabilities, knowledge, skills and competences. How Product Management is defined and executed greatly depends on the organization, type of product, career pathways, the industry and many other factors. This however can change with the creation of the Professional Product ManagementTM Framework. Based on decades of Product Management experience in leading and transforming Product organizations, we have designed the Professional Product ManagementTM Framework, which covers all areas of Product Management.\n\nBeing the Head of Product - Professional Product Management Services, I am responsible for:\n- Product Management\n- Product Portfolio Management\n- Product Discovery & Innovation\n- Product Finances\n- Product Marketing\n- Maximising the Product's value (e.g. Revenues and Customer Satisfaction)",
