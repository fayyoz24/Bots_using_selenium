    "summary": "My main interest is theoretical computer science, in particular the fields Computational Geometry and Programming Language Theory, through anything algorithmic is interesting to me. I like to solve complex theoretical problems, as well as implementing solutions programmatically.\n\nStarting from September I will be a PhD candidate in the field of Computational Geometry, at Utrecht University and Eindhoven University of Technology. The research will look at different geometric and topological similarity measures for curves, and how to compute them.\n\nCurrently, I am working on making a paper out of my master's thesis, together with my thesis supervisors. For my thesis I have researched data structures for the chromatic k-Nearest Neighbors problem. This problem is closely related to the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier. My thesis contains the first results for this problem where the k nearest neighbors of a point are not computed explicitly.",

This problem is the geometric interpretation of the k-nearest neighbors classifier from machine learning. In the problem, we want to build a data structure on a set of colored points, such that given a query point q, the most frequently occurring color among the k-nearest neighbors of q can be found efficiently.\nThe thesis contains results for this problem under the L_1, L_2 and L_infty metrics, in one and two dimension(s), though the results can likely be generalized to other metrics and higher dimensions with already existing results.\nAside from data structures for the regular problem, the thesis contains semi-online data structures (dynamic data structures, in which we know the time at which a point is deleted), as well as approximation data structures, that report a color that occurs often enough.\nThe data structures have all been analyzed in terms of their asymptotic complexities (preprocessing time, space and query time). While the complexities of the standard data structures are on the high end, the approxiation data structures perform very well, achieving (near-)linear space, coupled with a query times that are almost O(sqrt(n)).",

It has a businessrule validator, to check if a state satisfies all constraints. Which constraints are used can be easily configured by the researchers. Also, the library lets the reasearchers create their own rules for maximum extensibility.\nThe other libraries are meant for seeing how robust a planning is, and for making the libraries available in other languages through gRPC.",

To make things easier for the marketing department to change the content of the websites, these new websites use Squidex, a headless CMS, to retrieve the data displayed on the site. Using Squidex, there is only a single backend for all websites. Depending on the site visited, the backend retrieves the right content from Squidex, while keeping the general layout the same.",

The NS wants to use machine learning for the online-planning of their shunting yards, to better handle disturbances as they happen.\nThe main library is meant to give the possible actions one can take, given the current situation. It has a businessrule validator, to check if a state satisfies all constraints. Which constraints are used can be easily configured by the researchers. Also, the library lets the reasearchers create their own rules for maximum extensibility.\nThe other libraries are meant for seeing how robust a planning is, and for making the libraries available in other languages through gRPC.",
