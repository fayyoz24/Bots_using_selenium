    "summary": "Niek Dousi holds an MSc degree in Petroleum Engineering from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands and joined SGS in 2005.\nHe is currently a Senior Petroleum Engineer and project manager working for Sproule and has over 17 years of relevant professional experience. His key competences are classical reservoir engineering, Reserves evaluations, dynamic modelling, addressing commercial aspects and project management. \nHe has taken part in numerous integrated field development studies, analysing oil and gas assets in the North Sea, Continental Europe, North & West Africa, Oman and Russia, among others. \nBetween 2008 and 2016 he has been part of asset valuation teams, evaluating various North Sea-, Continental European- and West African assets. Other activities involved participation in specialized subsurface studies, such as reserves certifications, using SEC&SPE-PRMS, UGS- and Geomechanics studies, both as a seasoned reservoir engineer and as project manager. Niek is also experienced in performing and supervising economic analyses. \nBetween 2016 and 2022 he has managed a large number of large reserves certification studies (some annually) on Dutch, Gabonese, East African- and Omani assets, among smaller reserves audits. \nRecently in 2019, Niek was part of a special team to support a large middle eastern NOC in building a detailed country portfolio model comprising of assets with many multi billion barrels of in place oil volume.",
