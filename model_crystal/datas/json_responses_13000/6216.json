    "summary": "I have been interested in computers all my life. This interest ranges from building equipment, to disassemble them, to learn how computers work and how is the wiring that makes it possible to have access to networks in our homes and offices, even in the street.\nLearning how to maintain computers and how they work has always captivated me, as well as keeping an open mind to learn about new technologies and how the old ones continue to work and endure over time.\n\nI am a cheerful person, who always motivate their environment to maintain a positive attitude about what is being done, I like that we are all on the same page, always sharing and discussing new ideas that help make our work more interesting and entertaining, because \"you will not have to work a single day of your life, if you do what you like\" and that's what I always want to instill in my teammates.\ni love to play videogames, TCG and board games, I believe that the best way to increase and sharpen your thinking is when your own life is at risk, figuratively speaking of course.\n\nI started working in 2013 in chile for Samsung Electronics, until 2015, starting in the technical support area, until I became supervisor of computer service centers.\n\nI studied systems analyst programmer before, but I could not finish the career due to economic problems, so I continued working in the area in personal projects and as a freelance in other companies.\n\nSpecializing with certifications and studies in the area of hardware and equipment configuration.\n\nBecause of this, I am always looking to grow in this field, learning what is necessary and always willing to work in a team, (because 2 heads always think better than one). Despite having made some progress in companies in my country, I feel it is time to start making my own career in the area, so I am looking to work in a company that has clear goals for the future and is also open to changes and new projects, all in favor of improving the service already delivered. I believe there is always work to be done and improvements to be made.",
