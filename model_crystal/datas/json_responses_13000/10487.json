    "summary": "I have gained a great amount of international experience and cultural richness in the United States, France, Italy, China, and The Netherlands through internships, volunteering, sports, and studies. I am very passionate about animals, and their health, which has been a point of interest for me, which led me to do pet-sitting in my neighbourhood and follow the animal health pathway in my future university. I have also played football at high levels around the world in many different playing and coaching styles. Which has taught me enough to be able to coach some of the younger teams and share them my knowledge and skills.",
