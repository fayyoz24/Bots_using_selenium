    "summary": "As a native speaker I specialise in training business English and hold the following two key qualifications:\nCambridge University \"Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults\"\nLondon Chamber of Commerce and Industry \"Further Certificate for Teachers of Business English\" (with distinction)\n\nIn addition I have extensive training experience, in a UK business environment, having held training positions at Mars Confectionery (UK) Ltd. and as a franchisee for Allied Dunbar Financial Services (subsequently a division of Zurich Assurance).\n\nSince 2005 I have used this experience to offer English language training to business professionals here in the Netherlands, both as one to one coaching and group courses. In both cases I believe it is vital to improve an individual's confidence by improving their knowledge of English in a business environment and then utilising this knowledge to enhance their performance when conducting business, in English, with both native and non-native speakers.\n\nDuring this time I have been able to help individuals in a wide range of different sectors including:\n\nBusiness Consultants & Advisers\nFinancial Services (Banking, Insurance, Investment & Accounting)\nFood processing\nGovernmental Departments & Institutions\nICT\nIndustrial Manufacturing\nLegal (General, Corporate & International)\nMedia & Communications\nReal Estate Management\nRetailing\nTelecommunications\nUniversities\n\nBeing based centrally in the Baarn area I am able to consider courses across the whole of the Netherlands.",
