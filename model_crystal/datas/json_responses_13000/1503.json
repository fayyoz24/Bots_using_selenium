Furthermore, in contrast to the current belief that \u2018calcium begets calcium\u2019 the progression of coronary calcification was independent of the baseline value.\nMoreover, in the third study, I reported the existence of modest association between the calcification in the cardiac valves and the calcification in the coronary arteries. The higher the extent of calcification in the valves the greater the calcium score in the coronary arteries. And in my last study for the purpose of this thesis, I found that there is no relationship between the prevalence of coronary calcification and the presence of family history of premature coronary artery disease.\n",
