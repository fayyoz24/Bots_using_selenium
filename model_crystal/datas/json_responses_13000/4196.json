I am an Assistant Professor of International Development (UD1) at the International Institute of Social Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam (2021-present). I was previously awarded two competitive research awards to explore ground-breaking ideas around state capacity, institution-building and poverty reduction in the Global South: the Alexander von Humbholdt Foundation Fellowship, based at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Award, based at the University of Tokyo.\n\nI have extensive policy engagement experience, having been given the opportunity to work closely with  the United Nations Research in Social Development (UNRISD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Brussels, and Publish What You Pay (PWYP) Coalition. My research has been supported by several grants, and field-based data collection were conducted in Brazil, Chile, the Philippines, Peru and Indonesia.",

Using the framework of critical international political economy (IPE), we challenge the long held views about the ways natural resources shape political and economic outcomes. The authors examine how the specific feature of the resource sector creates different dynamics of policy change, and therefore, the range of development options for the Global South move beyond adopting unregulated, open extractive markets. The collection offers a robust engagement with development theory and political economy literature by exploring the ideational construction, implementation, and subsequent recalibration of mining reforms in the last three decades across the Global South. In many ways, our contribution lies in our attempts at unpacking neoliberalism as a singular process of reforming minerals and oil sectors in different geographical contexts. By placing distinctive national experiences in multiple layers of authority at local, national and international levels, the collection likewise demonstrates how differing national governance styles are embedded in \u2013 and constrained by \u2013 the twin logics of global competitiveness and privatisation. Finally, our sustained emphasis on the role of states in governing resources make clear the authors\u2019 commitment to the challenges and limitations of constructing developmental states in the era of emerging markets. In so doing, the book principally explores the theory and praxis of neoliberalism in the Global South, as articulated in strategic extractive industries, by way of examining the tensions, contradictions, and attempts at reconstructing the coherence of (neoliberal) mining management.

While most studies in the field focus on the politics of mineral rents, the project explores the role of state-owned enterprises in facilitating growth strategies. It examines the central role of state-building in development and the ways natural resources were managed through different kinds of state-oriented policies. I look at the oil and mining reforms in the past three decades (1980s-2000s) and show how SOEs played a role in making these industries competitive. It concludes by looking at the challenge of how to effective govern the sector in the era of low commodity prices.",

In the context of an export bonanza, some resource-rich states have been shielded from the global crisism, and instead, are experiencing sustained growth. Crucially, this is linked to growth in the Chinese economy, in which its demands for metals, export agriculture, hydrocarbons, and other forms of energy are fuelling this rapid growth for nearly a decade now. In this context, the key question is the extent to which resources can deliver growth and inclusive development for developing countries as well as in minimising the impacts of the crisis to developed resource-rich states. I survey a broad range of case studies of countries with different natural resource endowments, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Botswana, Norway and Sweden.",
