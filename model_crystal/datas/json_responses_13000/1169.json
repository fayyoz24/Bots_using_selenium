    "summary": "I am a technician (BSc degree) with over 20 years of working experience in the field of pharmaceutics, medical research, molecular and cellular biology and biochemical and immunological assays.\n\nPrevious employers include Leiden University Medical Center and Utrecht University. For example, I was involved in research on breast cancer, assisted in investigating the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by focusing on ageing of endothelium cells and I contributed to the functional characterization of a transcription factor with respect to floral transition.\n\nUntil 2013, I had worked for about 15 years and was theoretically halfway through my working life. After having completed the work that related to my at that time contract, I decided to temporally break my professional occupation in order to realizing my indefinable desire for an in-depth discovery of Russia. I have taken sabbatical and lived for about two years (with some intermissions) in St. Petersburg and Russia\u2019s Far East.\n\nAfter this period, I have started working at the pharmaceutical company Janssen Biologics. I worked there for two years and unfortunately there were no possibilities to extend my employment. This entails that I am currently available to continue working in the life sciences.\n\nIt is not only because of my extensive expertise that it is worth to consider adding me to your organization, but also as a person I am in possession of appropriate competences to professionally fulfill an employment within your company. Some key words with regard to my personal qualities are precise, organized, involved and communicative. My supervisors and colleagues would recognize me in this description.\n\nI am looking for employment opportunities that will allow me to use my broad range of experience. Please let me know if someone in your network has a suitable vacancy. I can be reached either through this profile or by phone at +31639193428.\n",
