    "summary": "I help leaders navigate the complexities that come with transitions and changes in their careers, lives and whole companies, see the opportunities in obstacles they face and turn them into possibilities of making  a real difference. If you're a leader or HR professional going through or leading major change, I can help you find new balance and take your (self)leadership to the next level.  Some of the common situations I help leaders with are below: \n\n- they have been promoted or have a new project that feels over their head and they need to cut through the overwhelm and regain confidence\n- they feel stuck in their career or project, they need a fresh perspective and get clear on next steps\n- they're passionate about a company culture where everyone is welcome, feels safe to speak up, learn and contribute but it's not where they're at and  they need inspiration or guidance on how to move from talking about culture to creating such culture\n- they're wondering how to get through the resistance that comes with leading change because not everyone shares their view\n- they're someone who brings diversity to their team, they experience what it's like not to fit in or feel misunderstood and they need help to see their worth\n- they're looking for someone who is not just a coach standing on the sidelines but who has been in their shoes before and understands what it takes to play the game.\n\nDepending on your needs, I can support you through advisory, mentoring, and a variety of learning and coaching programs. \n\nI offer almost 20 years of experience leading HR & culture change across industries and countries, a big picture perspective, first hand experience of what it's like to be the diversity in the (board)room, multiple coaching and facilitation certifications as well as simply being what I stand for: human and caring.",
