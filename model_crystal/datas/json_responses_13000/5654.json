    "summary": ".14+ years working in advertising, content and marketing, where the first 4 were focused on social media and digital strategy, but for the past 10 years I\u2019ve been building integrated strategies for various global brands.\n\n.After switching careers, where my original degree was in psychology, my passion for advertising started when I landed my first job working with social media and content creation, and even though I then migrated to broader strategic roles, digital strategy and storytelling have always been at the centre of everything I do.\n\n.My fields of expertise are the financial, technology, spirit and Fashion industries, but I have also worked\nwith several other categories, from FMCG to Telecom. In my last agency role, before moving to the\nNetherlands, I helped to shape the communication of Latin America\u2019s largest bank, at DPZ&T - Publicis\nGroupe, where I also double hatted as the Head of Content, with the task to give a spin on the way we\ncreated stories, by going beyond social channels to give a more editorial point of view to the brands.\n\n.At Converse, after joining the company as the Brand Communications Director, I was appointed to lead the Integrated Digital Marketing function, a hyper-localised data driven initiative responsible to boost their digital business, putting their e-commerce at the centre of everything we did.\n\n.I also have a master degree in digital communication, was part of the staff at Miami Ad School, teaching\ndigital strategy, and I was rewarded with 5 EFFIE awards, 4 years in a row.",
