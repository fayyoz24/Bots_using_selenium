    "summary": "Having a background in economics and finance and being a chartered accountant (Dutch RA) I provide advisory and assurance services to privately owned and private equity backed businesses.\n\nWhilst my role has changed over the years from helping my clients with valuations, (vendor) due diligence and achieving financial reporting obligations, this role has evolved into being a trusted advisor and helping my clients with their growth journey - whether they are expanding, restructuring, acquiring or exiting their business.\n\nI find joy in, and my goal is to help private businesses with their most important transactions and work closely to grow business and solve important issues. \n\nWhat sets me apart is my broad-based local and international experience across multiple industries. I continue to leverage that experience for the benefit of my clients which historically have operated in multiple profit orientated industries like services, manufacturing, retail, tech, property and others.\n\nMy colleagues and clients tell me they like working with me as I am proactive, responsive, honest and adres issues early on. I always make a genuine effort to build strong relationships. I am very passionate about sports and foster a good and well balanced lifestyle - including a happy family (wife and son), traveling across the world and chasing my crazy sport-related goals (golf and Ironman). \n\nAs I value relationships, I am always open for new connections. Feel free to reach out to me.",
