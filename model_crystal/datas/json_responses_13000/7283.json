    "summary": "I have more than ten years of working experience in the field of education, data management and technology, and running my own business. I began my startup journey in November 2017, after undertaking a course in Fashion Design from Polimoda, Institute of Fashion Design and Marketing in Florence, Italy. It was my goal to add to Bangladesh\u2019s narrative as a fashion producer, by creating international awareness of an independent, emerging, sustainable clothing brand. I have worked with the garment industry in the past. My first experience was working as a volunteer during the Rana Plaza incident in 2013, during which more than 1000 workers died due to a factory building collapse. I had co-founded a social organisation that worked with charitable projects and non-governmental organisations to help fund and rehabilitate the victims of the tragedy. Many years later, I found myself working for a US tech startup as a Country Project Manager. One of my main responsibilities was to travel across Bangladesh to interact with garment workers and conduct workshops whereby they learn how to use a platform to provide data about their work environment. \n\nMy sustainable startup propelled me towards a career committed to climate action and sustainability. In 2020, I coordinated the project, Voices from the Frontline, learning, documenting and sharing stories of community resilience during COVID-19 while participating in research activities on climate change in Bangladesh.\n\nCurrently, I teach sustainable development at Maastricht Sustainability Institute at Maastricht University, in the Netherlands. In addition, I am an advisor for the project, \"Amplifying Voices for Just Climate Action\" at WWF-NL.",

Furthermore, I was in charge of ISD Scholarship which is provided to MYP and DP students. My role was expansive in nature as I looked after public relations both internally and externally.
