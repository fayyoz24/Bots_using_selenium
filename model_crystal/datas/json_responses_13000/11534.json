While I think products shouldn't be judged solely on their face value - a great user experience is one factor that compels users return to a product, and this is where my expertise lies.\n\nReact and React Native are my tools of choice when it comes to implementing Web and Mobile applications. And I'm well versed in NodeJS and .NET Core for server side implementations.",
