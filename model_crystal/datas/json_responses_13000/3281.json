The \u201cParis Agreement\u201d, signed in 2015, agreed on \u201ca long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d, and \u201cto aim to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C\u201d. In response to this development, the IPCC will publish a Special Report on global warming of 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and is gathering scientific content for this report. In response to this call, FutureWater leads a regional assessment quantifying the impacts of a 1.5 \u02daC versus a 2 \u02daC global warming for a major global climate change hotspot: the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins in South Asia.",

To improve the capacities of Colombia for adaptation of water management to climate change pilot projects were started in one small and one large pilot basin. The activities that were undertaken as part of this pilot project include analysis of historical climate from observations and future climate with downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs). Historical flood extents and land use were analyzed and a hydrological model was developed to assess climate impacts on water availability and flood frequency and extent. A water allocation model was developed to analyze how current and future water supply relate to sectorial water demands. Adaptation tipping points were determined and effects of different adaptation pathways were evaluated.",

Based on proven interpolation techniques it was possible to effectively combine different sets of reanalysis data, which resulted in a high spatial as well as high temporal resolution climate data set.

This is associated with an exponential increase in water and energy demands. Given the arid climate in the densely populated and heavily irrigated plains and the geopolitical tensions between the riparian states, the road towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water, energy and food is extremely challenging. In SustainIndus, we develop sustainable pathways that support decision makers and practitioners to develop science-based policy and climate\u2013smart solutions targeting SDG 2 (food), SDG 6 (water), and SDG 7 (energy).",
