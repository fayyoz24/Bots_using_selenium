This threatens farmer livelihood and peace in the region. Ideally, the cadmium remains in the soil, such that it is not taken up by plants. To do that, soil amendments can be added like compost and lime. However, to apply these amendments we need to understand the chemical and biological mechanisms in the soil-root interface that determine how much cadmium is taken up. This knowledge will be created, aiding the design of effective soil amendments.\n\nMy project will be carried out at Wageningen University & Research, at the Soil Chemistry and Soil Biology chair groups. Experiments and fieldwork will be carried out in Colombia, in collaboration with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). I am connecting my work to the EU-funded Clima-LoCa project (see link) for logistical and intellectual support, as well as to make my work meaningful for cacao farmers in Latin America and the Caribbean.",
