Most important findings showed that small business owners and creative entrepreneurs do not necessarily understand or have time to learn about the constantly changing world of social media. \n\nAs I have been a small business owner for a few years now and I also have years of experience in managing social media accounts in different companies and agencies around Europe I have decided to give something back to the community. Miska Sage is therefore a place where small business owners and creative entrepreneurs can come to learn about social media, graphic design and brand strategy. Miska Sage is also my own personal portfolio, where I am sharing my recent projects and hopefully attracting more clients with it.",
