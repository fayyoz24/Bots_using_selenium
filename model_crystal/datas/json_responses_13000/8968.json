    "summary": "I am an experienced engineer with an extensive background in modelling water systems and an expert in geographic information systems\u2014my expertise focuses on the modelling and design of urban drainage and sewerage networks, and water supply systems. \n\nIn addition, My PhD project and later in my role as Assistant professor gave me vast experience in flood modelling as well as socio-economic vulnerability, flood risk assessment, loss of life and damage computation under extreme events associated with climate change. \n\nWith my professional, academic and research background I can offer more than eight years of experience in consultancy projects and combined with research and innovation-oriented background. I am a professional with a strong desire for learning/teaching new things from/to others, able to work and adapt to changing and complex circumstances and with independence.\n\nI have more than 7 years of working experience in the water sector: Water utilities, sanitation and flood risk. I have a major in sanitary Engineer and postgraduate studies in Geographic Information Systems and an MSc on Hydroinformatics.",
