    "summary": "Hello! I am a circular economy & sustainability professional. I develop roadmaps to circular economy, zero-waste & sufficiency for cities, sustainability strategies for business, and am engaged in different formats of environmental education. I am happy to connect with colleagues and like-minded people all over the world. \n\nMy experience is quite versatile. I am an environmental scientist by training. I spent 35 days in the North Pacific Garbage Patch with plastic pollution research and a few months on Bering Island in the Pacific ocean designing a 'Sustainable Commander Islands' program and a local marine litter museum. I wrote a book on eco-friendly habits, made a board game to teach the same topic and co-developed a social simulation on deep-sea mining.  \n\nI believe in sufficiency, development over growth, zero waste and the power of awareness.",
