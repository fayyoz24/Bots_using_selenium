    "summary": "Ik ben Engels docent op zoek naar studenten, taalscholen om mee te werken, en ook correctie werk in het Engels. (B.v. scripties, proefschriften, presentaties, e-mails.)\n\nI'm a freelance English teacher and proofreader in Amsterdam. I am available for work with language schools, for private lessons and intensive courses, and proofreading. You can find out more on my website: http://helenlambert.wixsite.com/english \n\nI've been teaching English as a foreign language since 2010. Many of my students have been corporate clients; others studied English with me to improve their social lives or career prospects; or to pass an exam. \n\nKnowing my students' goals, needs, interests and difficulties is important; it allows me to create an effective and interesting course for them! I have the most experience with Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Ukrainian, Japanese and Turkish students.\n\nI teach Business English and General English, and I'm familiar with Medical English and Financial English. I have experience in teaching the BEC and IELTS exams. I am available for proofreading, and I have proofread theses, dissertations, and books, in a variety of fields.\n\nI am Cert. TESOL qualified, and have been trained in the Callan Method, which focuses on pronunciation and speaking instinctively. I have experience with blended learning and using online learning management systems. I am a native English speaker from the UK. I speak Dutch to an intermediate level (B2). I also speak French (B1) and a little German (A1). \n\nI'm interested in finding out more about learning styles, learning disorders, and other things that affect adults trying to learn a new language, and how to make an effective course that addresses these issues. E.g. dyslexia, ADHD, impaired vision. I always love to hear about more resources on these!\n\nSpecialities: Medical English, Business English, exam preparation, job interview coaching, building confidence in speaking, proofreading.",
