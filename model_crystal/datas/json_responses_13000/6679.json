ANND aims to empower CSOs and provide them with the necessary knowledge to influence policy-making. To this end, ANND established a monitoring function in 2011 to enhance the role of civil society in observing and holding accountable social and economic policies based on their impact on human rights. The main outcome of this function is the Arab Watch Report on Economic and Social Rights, which is a biennial report issued by the network that examines the national, regional, and international policies and factors that lead to the violation of the rights under scrutiny. The previous reports covered the following topics: \u2022 The right to education and the right to work (2012) \u2022 The right to social protection (2014) \u2022 Informal labour (2016) \u2022 The right to food (2019) \u2022 The accountability of the private sector (2021) The network plans to publish the sixth report of the Arab Watch Report on Economic and Social Rights in 2023, with a particular focus on the right to health.",
