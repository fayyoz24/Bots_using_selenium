In collaboration with the Shell Health Rijswijk and Shell Health Promotion Center staff and working together with 2 other salsa instructors at P&T Rijswijk we promoted and executed the lessons by creating a fun and vibrant atmosphere, enthusiastically recruited participants and kept the interest growing by systematically increasing the difficulty level of the dance routine. Each lesson block  was broken up into beginner and intermediate part which focused on specific dance moves, tailored to the level and needs of the group and individuals. \nMy responsibilities were to organise  group dinners and events to ensure team building, a pleasant environment and reinforce network among all participants. Additionally I supported the participants by reassuring them and helping them to develop their dance technique and musicality. As the leader of the lesson, my key role was to maintain discipline and keeping the audience's attention whilst teaching different levels and variation of dance moves at a comfortable pace for the group. I created my own way to break down the lesson content in a step-by-step sequence in simple and fun terms for ease of understanding and tailored and adapted according to participant's level and progress."
