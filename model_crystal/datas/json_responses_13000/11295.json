Gabriele Bubola was not involved in this process.\n\nI haven\u2019t changed anything to the rules, however, I have reworked the storyline to fit the game better in the 999 Games catalog, and to match the target audience. I did rewrite the rules and included examples.\n\nOriginal concept: Barbanera. Barbanera is a mighty and evil pirate. You have to split the loot, but he wants the largest part of each of the types within the loot. He will put you in jail if you fail that request. The only players running for victory will be the players that are not in jail. \n\nFinal product:  You and your gang have robbed the bank. The leader Blasting Billy is remorseless and wants the biggest part of each type of stolen goods. Be sure to take as much as you can, but never have more than Billy. Otherwise he will shoot you down. Or you can blast a part of the loot with dynamite. The winner will be the one that is not shot down and has the second biggest loot, after Blasting Billy.\n\nThe main work was the storyline, including the art direction. Dutch illustrator Thijs Rozema helped to get the right feeling of an evil Wild West Cowboy, yet don\u2019t scare away the younger children or the parents. Being both scary and attractive for a broad audience.",

In this project I have worked closely together with the designer to develop this idea into a published game for 999 Games. I\u2019ve redone the balancing of the victory points and reduced the game time. Finding the right style of artwork to fit the family audience proved a real challenge. Together with Dutch illustrator Marlies Barends I have managed to find the right approach.\n\nOriginal Concept: Based on a true story. A hundred years ago they introduced the highly poisonous toad, now known as the cane toad to destroy a type of insect on sugar cane farms. Instead of doing their intended job they moved away and ate everything else. The toads have become a pest to date.\n\nIn the game your Australian farm is run over by the toads. While you try to expand your terrain you have to catch them alive to score victory points and at the same time keep your farm up and running. At the end of the game you score for having specific items on your farm that weren\u2019t destroyed by the toads.",

They basically combined Yahtzee and BINGO. While this seems very simple to do, they have managed to make this into something new, that has not been seen a lot. They have added just the right touch, and have published the game in private print as \u2018Dobbeltime\u2019 in the Netherlands in low numbers.\n\nFor 999 Games I have developed this game into something for a bigger and international audience to sell big numbers. To achieve this, I had to overcome some challenges, mainly mathematically.\n\nOriginal concept Dobbeltime: Each player has a scoring sheet, containing a grid of 5x5 numbers between 1 and 12. But there are 4 different sheets. One player rolls the dice, 1 white and 5 different colored dice. As soon as a player sees a combination of the white die and a colored die, he may cross that exact number from his sheet. The active play may ignore the white die. But as soon as a player makes a mistake he has to mark that. Three faults means you\u2019ve lost the game. A blue pawn can be used to keep players from winning.\nFive in a row wins you the game.\n\nIn this project I have worked closely together with the designers of this game, Dennis Harmsen & Esm\u00e9e Spaargaren to develop this idea into a published game. The main challenge was to create 4 equally balanced sheets that both contain all possible numbers and an evenly division of easier and harder numbers in the right colors. Evenly divided in horizontal, vertical, diagonal and compared to other sheets.\n\nThe second thing I\u2019ve worked on is the name: ZINGA! A combination of the sound of the bell, the excitement of YAHTZEE! and the feeling of BINGO!. A very powerful artwork, developed in-house at 999 Games completes the story.\n\nResume Made by Flo: development, creation of testable prototype, testing, writing the rulebook, editing the rulebook, theme development, art direction, production briefing.",

I\u2019ve rewritten the rules and added components to make the actions more streamlined, easier to understand, and along the way decreased the game length to ensure the target audience will rather play several games in a row.\n\nThe storyline was almost perfectly described by Marcelo, and all I had to find was the right illustrator. Gael Lannurien (Ginkgopolis) proved to be the right option, using bright and colorful images that attract the family audience.\n\nOriginal Concept: Don Juan. You are madly in love with Don Juan and are eagerly waiting for his love letters, but he sends those letters to many girls, not only to you. Sick of jealousy, you and your competitors alternate in helping the postman out. You all rearrange and hide each other's letters. Find the letters of your own and prevent others from receiving theirs. And then there\u2019s special letters. Trade in three of your own letters into a heart token. Three hearts in the color of your opponents will break their hearts. Three hearts wins you the game.

            "description": "The game concept called \u2018Sneaky Snacks\u2019 was offered to 999 Games by author Robert Brouwer, and proved a very nice and original mechanic. But, the target audience (students) and the suggested theme would not match. Therefore I tried and tested various themes and eventually developed the current theme. The game mechanics didn\u2019t change but adding the right artwork proved the gimmick here. Each card has a little joke in it. People love the funny images of each single card, greatly drawn by illustrator Yonatan Mantzur. Perfectly fitting the student audience. \n\nOriginal concept: Sneaky Snacks. Players try to catch monsters by luring them with hamburgers. Monsters eat hamburgers and\u2026 monsters. You can lure them with smaller monsters. A \u2018sneaky\u2019 card will steal the lure from other players. The winner of the game is the player with the most monsters. Hamburgers don\u2019t grant points.\n\nFinal product: Sneaky Bastard. The storyline is about the housing shortage in the Netherlands in the late 2010s. Since placing bids on houses and overbidding when buying was a very common procedure, this is exactly what you must do in the game. Estate agents and lenders are represented by \u2018Sneaky bastards\u2019, cunning businessmen and women. They will take your money if you push your luck too far. And you\u2026 You end up with houses either too good to be true, or castles in the air.",

The game needed localization, since the theme of the concept (Roman Catholic Church) is merely an Italian culture, whereas in the Netherlands 999 Games requested a theme and storyline more fitting to their own catalog and public. I have created a nice storyline perfectly fitting mechanics. The game is now about exploring sailors finding a haunted treasure on the island Kadora. In addition I have added 2-player rules. With Dutch illustrator Rogier van de Beek we could create a wonderful looking card game.\n\nThe Austrian licensee Piatnik has developed the theme for their audience into Kleine Kl\u00e4ffer.\n\nOriginal concept Conclave: You have to take the most cards of at least a single family (color) but get rid of all the other cards that you don\u2019t have the most of. playing is done by placing in and taking from a grid of cards. \n\nFinal Product De Schat van Kadora: You have to get the most diamonds of at least one color out of six colors of diamonds to release the curse of a haunted pirate treasure. To achieve this you must make many trades on the table. The player with the most points wins the game.\n\nI have done the development, balancing, testing, rulebook and art direction. I have also developed and tested alternative rules for 2 players.",

I have suggested and tested rule changes, added cards, done the development, and did balancing, testing, rulebook writing and art direction. I have created the best storyline for this game that started as a very abstract mechanic. Eventually after optimizing the story into the mechanics, I\u2019ve found the right illustrator in Andrew Bosley (Everdell - Tapestry)  and this transformed the game from an abstract concept to a nice and attractive family card game. The funny characters of the masks that were developed in cooperation with Andrew contribute greatly to the experience of the game.\n\nOriginal concept: Neon Party. Each player has one (out of five) secret identifier card and plays rounds where they place value cards at either of those. You must find the one identifier belonging to each of the other players and at the same time place as many value cards at your own to score points. At the end of the game you score additional points for each well guessed identifier card. But as soon as all other players guess your identifier right, you score no points at all.\n\nFinal product: SAMOA. It\u2019s the Great Mask Festival on Samoa. Each mask belongs secretly to a player. You must decorate your own mask with coloured feathers that you find on the beach. If everyone knows which mask is yours, you're out. If not, you score points for the number of feathers and for guessing each other player's masks. Now you know each other's strategy, play another 2 rounds (instead of 1) and see if you can read minds.",
