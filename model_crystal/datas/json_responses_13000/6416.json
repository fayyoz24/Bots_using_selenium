    "summary": "Promoting and selling golf holidays in Kenya was the start of my Africa experience. \nMy company in Rwanda, the country that appealed to me from day one, brought me into contact with many local tour organizations from all over Africa. \nWe met each other on a regular base in Utrecht, at the \"Vakantie Beurs\", in London, during \"WTM\" and in Berlin during the \"ITB\" days.\nI partnered up with some of them. Together with these partners we can offer you tailor made safaris in, what I consider, some of the most beautiful environments of Africa!\nAfter my time with my wildlife safari company in Rwanda: 'Access Rwanda Safaris\", I started 'Mountain Gorilla Safaris\" in Rwanda, Uganda and DR Congo.\nBut, I also decided that it was time for a new challenge, not replacing or changing the old company, but adding a new feature: \"Golf Safaris in Africa\". \nTherefore I started with a new website: 'WildlifeGolf', for people who love to play golf on beautiful and challenging and/or extraordinary golf courses. Not only in well known golf countries, but also in countries that are less known to have golf courses.\nHowever, we always try to combine these golf safaris with wildlife and/or cultural safaris, because we think that although playing golf can be very relaxing (or stressful), it would be a waste of time and money, not to enjoy the other features your golf destination has to offer.  \nAnd we can imagine that not everybody in your company likes to play the game of golf, so we also offer HYBRID golf safaris, some play golf, others enjoy their days in a different way, meeting each other again during lunch or dinner.\n\nThe WildlifeGolf website is always under construction, that is why I am still looking for reliable, experienced, local, new partners, for some of the countries and services we are offering to our clients like for the safaris down here:\n- Tailor made\n- Golf\n- Wildlife\n- Primate\n- Mountain Gorillas\n- Birding\n- Beach\n- home stay tours \n- cultural \n- Visits to the life volcanoes.",
