Over the last few years my wife Susan & I have chaperoned events for groups from China and Spain and have hosted children and supervisors from China and Spain.  \nIt has become apparent that the US needs to understand the events that are unfolding around us and the people that are effected.\nThey only way to effectively understand each others cultures is by allowing each other into our private lives.",
