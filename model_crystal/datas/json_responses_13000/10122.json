This thesis focuses on transformational and charismatic leadership and takes stock of the similarities and differences of both styles. It argues that in order to facilitate the use of the theories it is essential to analyse if the models are applicable to every possible case. In this analysis a case study design is applied and special attention is given to the trait perspective.  The analysis revealed that the overlap of both styles with respect to traits differs significantly. When considering managers\u2019 perceptions of both models, managers with low organizational capacities at their disposal see a comparably high overlap. The higher the organizational capacities of a manager, the stronger the need for more distinction between both, as the overlap is reduced. Therefore, the implications can be seen as a road sign for practitioners and future research, as on one hand practitioners can improve self-assessment mechanisms and on the other hand scholars can conceptualize a more thorough analysis.\n\n",
