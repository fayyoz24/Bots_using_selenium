A large portion of its clientele are people with disabilities. Abeona Mobility provides in custom moderated bikes and trikes. \nAs co-owner I was responsible for the Corporate identity, communication, team meetings, collaboration activities, marketing, social media, recruitment, managing the manager and client interviews. My specialism is Web-development, Graphic Design and Photography. I also acted as a skilled team leader in multi-collaborative meetings and projects. With my background in social work and my experience in working with people with disabilities, I particularly enjoyed working with those who found us while exploring their options to cycle again. I always emphasized on abilities and possibilities, instead of disabilities. As an empathic person, I added value for our clients with my interest in their story and the impact of their illness or disability for themselves or their  family that support them.",
