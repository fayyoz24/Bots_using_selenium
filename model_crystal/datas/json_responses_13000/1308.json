Over time these local ordinances transformed into a provincial and later national legislation on mark protection, based on the pipe makers marks. During the research the inventory of pipe makers, their trademarks and period of activity within the guild was finalized, using all sorts of archival sources since the guild records are incomplete. From the museum collectionsover 7,000 specimen of marked pipes were studied, which were connected with the historical data. Part of the publication is an art-historical chapter on the printed wrappers for the wholesale of pipes. The research resulted in a manual that is an important resource for archaeologists and historians, worldwide considered as the standard work. Hours: 6,000.",
