My primary role was focused on the Reverse Shell Method, an innovative approach that involved establishing a connection from the target machine (running QuickSTEP) to an attacker's machine. This attack vector provided remote access to the PowerShell instance on the target machine, allowing the execution of PowerShell commands without QuickSTEP's knowledge. I was instrumental in setting up this connection, providing critical insights into the potential exploitation of this vulnerability, and documenting the process.\n\nAdditionally, I had a secondary role in bypassing the virtual machine (VM) detector to enable SEB to run within a VM environment. This involved altering VM configuration and modifying certain SEB DLLs. Although the task was less complex compared to the Reverse Shell Method, it required an understanding of the interplay between VMs and the detection algorithms employed by SEB. My team and I successfully achieved this objective, thus demonstrating the potential for students to cheat during exams.",

The app serves as a platform for environmentally conscious individuals to easily discover, join, and organize clean-up events, making the clean-up process enjoyable and socially engaging.\n\nUsing Java and Android Studio, we designed this app specifically for Android 11.0 and later, ensuring compatibility with different screen sizes including Google Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. The database was managed using Firebase.\n\nI had a crucial role in project management, code development, and documentation. My key responsibilities included writing a majority of the code, establishing the app's flow, organizing logistics, and documenting requirements.\n\nAs the SCRUM Master, I facilitated communication and progress within our team, ensuring that every task and goal was achieved effectively. With our dedicated team efforts, we managed to fulfill all the mandatory requirements, delivering a quality app that simplifies participation in environmental clean-up activities and promotes social interaction.\n\nOur accomplishment demonstrates our technical skills, teamwork, and commitment to creating an app that encourages a positive environmental impact. The experience was incredibly rewarding, offering us the opportunity to use our skills for a significant cause.\n\nTidyTeams is a testament to our ability to develop an effective solution to a real-world problem. It represents our understanding of the users' needs and our capability to create an enjoyable user experience that serves a greater purpose.",
