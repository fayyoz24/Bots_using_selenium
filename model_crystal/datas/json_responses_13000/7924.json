As a Credit Controller, I was responsible for monitoring the creditworthiness of customers, analyzing their financial statements and payment history, and ensuring timely collection of outstanding debts. I was able to apply my knowledge of accounting principles and financial analysis techniques to identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.\n\nThroughout my internship, I was able to work collaboratively with other departments to resolve issues and ensure customer satisfaction. I was also able to gain valuable experience in using financial software tools and systems, such as SAP, to manage accounts and generate reports. Additionally, I coordinated the preparation of proposals for new/update/revision of customer credit and submitted them to management for approval. I also communicated directly with account contacts to resolve disputes, reviewed and released sales orders placed on hold for credit limits or collection risk, and ran credit agency reports to evaluate potential new customers. Furthermore, I prepared estimates for the annual bad debt provision for review by the CFO.\n\nFinally, my internship at EKO Bulgaria as a Credit Controller has enabled me to develop my analytical and communication skills, and has provided me with a solid foundation in financial management. I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained to future roles in the finance industry.",
