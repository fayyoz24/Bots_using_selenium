            "description": "The much debated term fundamentalism has become a prominent focus of the imagery through which Islam is presented. Therefore many scholars denounce the term, preferring other terms like Islamic resurgence, revivalism, activism or even extremism and militantism.For anthropologists local terms seem the best solution as they mostly work in specific cultural settings(Van Santen and Willemse 1999 4-13).Islamism(Islamists: Individuals or groups with access to sources of power: economic, political, moral or military)often refers to movements  \u201caiming at an Islamic state(forms of political Islam)that would enforce at least some Islamic laws and customs\u201d(Keddie 1998  16).Islamism is to be distinguished from processes of Islamisation:processes of conversion to Islam in general,whether by force or by consent,whether today or in the past.In my work I often use Islamic reform movements when it concerns reformulation/redefinition of Islamic practices in reference to specific contexts. In the NWO research programme(Willemse, Gueye, Jeppy, Van Santen, Islam in Africa)we suggested that a concept like fundamentalism offers possibilities for analysis of similar global processes:\u201chow can we compare supposedly fundamentalist movements in various regions?\u201dIn the plural it suggests the pluriform nature of the phenomenon.\nIn my work on conversion to Islam Islamisation indicates the transition from one religion(the so-called traditional religion)to the world religion Islam,which had the character of a process. The verb Islamise is,moreover,a direct translation of the Fulfulde word silmugo.\nIn Cameroon the global Islamic reform movements are much related to their influence on youths,who have access to new media.I discovered that Muslim communities place value on the establishment of Muslim institutions built with NGO money from the Islamic core areas.This locates the issue in the wider context of a struggle for international influence and sovereignty.",

                    "description": "During my fellowship I worked on a monograph concerning Islamic Fundamentalism, Youth, Gender Identities and Islamic Secular Schooling in Cameroon, country where I have carried out research annually since 1986. In Cameroon as elsewhere the global resurgence of Islam is much related to its influence on youths, who have access to new media. Studying the opportunities and constraints of processes of globalisation, I discovered that Muslim communities place value on the establishment of Muslim institutions built with NGO money from the Islamic core areas. This locates the issue in the wider context of a struggle for international influence and sovereignty. The excellent circumstances NIAS provides and which I thoroughly enjoyed have enabled me to go through much of the gathered material and to relate it to the literature concerning the topic, so the monograph is progressing. A considerable number of articles and seminar papers, most of them related to the mentioned topic have been finished and/or written. Several of them came out or are now in press, others are under revision. During the period I also updated my 1993 book on conversion to Islam that is being translated for publication into French.",
