    "summary": "I lead teams to develop new insights and scale their impact. My sharp eye for the abstract and the practical, helps me transform complex challenges into new solutions. With my enthusiasm and curiosity I get others on board and continue learning. \n\nAfter a career in academia, setting up innovative collaborations bridging research and practice, I fell in love with the dynamism and potential of the wider startup ecosystem. I fully enjoy helping the next generation of start-ups and scale-ups achieve their wildest dreams of making a positive societal impact with their venture.\n\nHowever, to truly reach the scale of the transformation needed to address our most pressing societal challenges, we need more than impact scale-ups alone. We need governments, industry incumbents, knowledge institutes AND the next generation of startups to collaborate on developing and scaling new ways of working. \n\n\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f As senior program manager at TKI Bouw en Techniek I orchestrate collaboration between this full spectrum of partners in order to learn and innovate our way towards a CO2 free and future proof built environment. \n\n\ud83c\udf31On the side, as an independent consultant, facilitator and speaker at Havermans Consultancy and Scaling with Impact I enable collaborative learning about organizing and support impact scale-ups. \n\nMy areas of expertise are leadership, analysis, collaborative change, learning into the unknown, scaling, and (positive societal) impact.",

            "description": "Driven to understand and support the development of project managers we explored why and how people become project managers, what and how project managers learn from experiences, and what is perceived as supporting this learning. We used a multi-method approach, consisting of in-depth interviews and a short follow-up survey among project managers and line managers of project managers. Results show that project managers tend to 'roll into' their profession drawn by their enterprising interests, most learning experiences occur more or less accidentally on the job and support for learning from these experiences is limited. This suggests potential to improve the quality and pace of the development paths of project managers. \n\nWe were awarded with a research grant by Project Management Institute in 2013 to support this study. We have presented the results of our study at the PMI the Netherlands Summit 2014, in a webinar hosted by Project Management Institute with over 5000 registered participants, and at the HRM Network Conference 2015. In order to stimulate further discussion about the development of project managers we have organized a symposium on Career Paths with Beverley Lloyd-Walker, Lynn Crawford, Ed Hoffman & Martina Huemann at the Global PMI research congress in Portland Oregon July 2014. This research project has led to four publications: a book published by PMI (2014), academic papers in International Journal of Project Management (2016) and Project Management Journal (forthcoming), and a practitioner publication in Projectie (2015).
