    "summary": "As a graduate from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a BSc in Economics and Business Economics, I bring a wealth of experience in financial roles from diverse organizations. My academic journey helped me build a strong foundation in finance, where I focused my thesis on the intriguing factors influencing cryptocurrency use in the US.\n\nIn my roles at ABN AMRO Clearing Bank, Theodore Capital, and Ernst & Young, I honed my skills in data analysis, transaction settlements, and accounts management, while also identifying and implementing efficiency improvements in accounting systems.\n\nLeadership is a quality I value and constantly strive to enhance. Founding an event organizing group was a significant milestone in my journey, providing me the opportunity to manage, plan, and lead a team, while honing my negotiation skills.\n\nOutside of my professional life, I'm a fitness enthusiast with a particular passion for kickboxing and tennis. I believe in maintaining a balance between professional and personal interests, and my love for sports certainly plays a pivotal role in that.\n\nI'm multilingual, proficient in Azerbaijani, Russian, English, and Turkish. This linguistic versatility, coupled with my broad software knowledge, allows me to comfortably navigate the global financial industry.",
