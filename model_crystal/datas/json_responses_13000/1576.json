All chapters of the thesis were also published as articles in high-rank peer-reviewed journals, such as Circulation. Obtained extensive experience in histological techniques, microscopy, and 3D reconstruction of the serial images, as well as presenting the findings in a didactic way. Authored the overview chapters on the development of the heart and its conduction system for the 8th and 9th editions of the renowned textbook Heart Disease in Infants, Children, and Adolescents.",
