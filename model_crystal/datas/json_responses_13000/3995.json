In 2014, my team and I were awarded the Cathay Pacific award for Best Dutch Entrepreneurs in China. \n\nI\u2019ve also been co-founder and investor in a multitude of global business ventures and I\u2019m highly passionate about mentoring other entrepreneurs.  I am an active member of the global Entrepreneurs Organization network. I have managed both their Shanghai Mentorship and Accelerator program and am currently volunteering to establish the Shanghai chapter\u2019s Social Impact Program. \n\nI reside with my family in Shanghai, but one of our favorite places is Kenya, where the abundance of nature and wildlife makes us feel incredibly enriched. \n\nIn October 2018, I completed my first full IRONMAN in Louisville, Kentucky.",
