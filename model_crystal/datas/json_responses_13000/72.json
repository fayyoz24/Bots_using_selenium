    "summary": "What kind of person Am I?\nwell, During last 8 years in Amsterdam a lot of things have changed. I became more independent and confident woman. I learnt how to work with international team, I got more patient organized and communicative. Definitely I improved my English, and learnt some dutch. \nAny place I went to work at, I became a team leader, helping the supervisors or managers with their duties.\nI am a responsible and easy going person. And maybe that is why they trust me and give me more duties. I also am able to catch a nice contact with guests, thank to that, they always come back. I am also a good team player and thanks to that we create always a great team!\nI learn fast and I am a hard worker. I know I can do things I never did before and be successful!\nI am good at organizing things and managing or planning my time. \nWell, i would lie if I say that is all, but for the rest people need to meet each other, learn from each other and teach each other. I know people can learn a lot from me, and I can not wait to learn from them!\nRecently I got back to Poland. Working as an English teacher.\n\nMore personal?\nMy latest passion is Squash! Love this sport, is so dynamic and great! \nAnd my idol- Gordon Ramsay:) yes, i love cooking!\nI enjoy sewing and handmade things. It makes me so peaceful and patient:)\nMaybe these three are not a perfect combination, but it is working so far!",
