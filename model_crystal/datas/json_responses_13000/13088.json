    "summary": "Civil Engineer with a master's degree in Structural Engineering and focus on:\n\n- Structural Engineering;\n- Static and dynamic numerical analysis (in particular the Finite Element Method);\n- Structural design;\n- Structural optimization;\n- CAD drawing.\n\nI finished my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering with a thesis named Perdas de Protens\u00e3o em Lajes Lisas com Cordoalhas N\u00e3o Aderentes (Loss of Prestress in Slabs with Unbounded Cables), in which the evaluation of the tension's losses was exploited, especially the computations of such losses, helping in design of post-tensioning structures.\n\nDuring my master's degree in Structural Engineering, I did research in the field of computational mechanics applied to Fracture Mechanics at LMCV (Laboratory of Computational Mechanics and Visualization - http://www.lmcv.ufc.br/). My master's thesis dealt with the analysis of cracking in quasi-brittle materials using using the Finite Element Method. In order to solve the resulting non-linear material damage evolution problem, interface elements featuring different types of cohesive-zone models were used.\n\nCurrently, I am trying to broaden my experiences by pursuing a job as an engineer. I have particular interest in structural engineering with focus on numerical modeling and design. However, I am also willing to explore other civil and mechanical engineering fields. As I have just arrived in the Netherlands, I am still not able to communicate in Dutch, but am more than willing to learn it.",
