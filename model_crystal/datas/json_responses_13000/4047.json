    "summary": "I am qualified and possess the charisma to offer business environments a pragmatic approach to solving both current and future challenges. Additionally, I am very enthusiastic to learn everyday and resolve obstacles at hand. Since my undergraduate degree is almost embarking upon completion, I seek a more stable work environment which can assist me to improve my practical application to circumstances and develop my professional attributes and skill. If I select a best word, it is \u2018passion\u2019. I always pursue my passion that I want to be. Shortly, what I want is what I have to. Finally, my father always emphasized faithfulness for me. It makes me do my best and be honest. \n\nI am interested in team-sports and making music (not professional absolutely). That is why I enjoy often playing soccer twice a week and I had a hiphop-crew makes music or dance for performance.  I had some performances on the street or for talent donation.\n\nFinally, as a leardership, When sometimes not doing any works that a group want, I promote what the group intend to promote.\n\n- Language skills\nEnglish - fluent\nKorean - native\nSpanish - beginner",
