    "summary": "I'm passionate about knowing as much as possible about the world. I love working in international recruitment, due to it I've got a chance to know 16 cultures from 4 regions! Thank to my emotional intelligence, analytical and communication skills I can find an approach to any candidate from those countries.\n\nAlong with that I found the way to close the vacancies after the 3d and even the 1st interview. I've been working with different vacancies and departments. From associate level to manager or team lead one.\nSo far since 2021 I closed more than 150 vacancies in 15 countries. Sometimes I'm too careful about the candidate we're about to hire, but it helps me to keep high retention and growth rate among them. \n\nApart from my professional side, I love reading about spiritual stuff, personal growth or just novels and practice vipassana. I like trying extreme sport like surfing, even though the next day I'll smash my face in the sand... In general, I'm very easy going, open, energetic / calm (50/50) and intelligent person.",
