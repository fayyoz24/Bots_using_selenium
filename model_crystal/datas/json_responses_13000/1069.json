We designed and built a floating vegetable garden using aquaponics, to combat malnutrition and provide a source of income. (How does aquaponics work? We had tanks on the side of the garden with fish; the fish would poo in the water and a pump transported the water to the top of the garden to flow through and fertilise the plants.) We presented our work to judges and gave public demonstrations, being awarded 'Best Technical Solution'.",
