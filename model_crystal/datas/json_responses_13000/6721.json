    "summary": "I reimagine what it takes to have healthy individuals and populations in the Digital Era. \n\nI belive we invent technology and it invent us back. I want to explore both ways! \n\n#Digital transformation \n#System thinkers \n#Digtal Health strategy\n#unleash value-based care \n#shift to integrated care\n#Digital inclusion\n#Patient/citizen-centred innovation\n#Staycurious about people\n#relationship builder\n#Transformational leadership\n#Intellectual humility # self-care. #Compassion. \n\n\nI am an interdisciplinary public health researcher with a strategist acumen. I work at the intersection between Digital Innovation, Global health, and ICT towards effective digital transformation.  I enjoy combining my contextual understanding of Europe and LMICs to address challenges in health care.  I am a technology enthusiast who also talks the language of business\n\nI have an international working experience in the USA, UK, and Europe in different areas such as Regulatory Affairs, Pharmaceutical policies, Medical Device, Digital Health ecosystems, and management consulting. \n\nTrust, integrity, curiosity, audacity, genuine relationships, and value-driven contribution are my core life and work values, I strive to live by every day. I enjoy using cross-cutting expertise such as policy analysis, Public health advocacy, strategic thinking, health communication, project management, Qualitative research ( oh, I like humans and what make them strive in life ), global health diplomacy, and leadership skills to advocate for people-centred ethically grounded, and inclusive solutions to advance their health and well being and decrease inequalities. I also enjoy using my curiosity to work irretrievably on sophisticated projects and strategic partnerships. I enjoy solving complex business challenges by leveraging innovative ideas, people, processes, and technology.\n\nWhile I am at ease to work on both strategic and operational sides, strategy, knowledge brokering between politics and Health policy worlds is what I do best. \n\nMy life journey, places I lived in, people whom I met, strangers' stories about their health and life quality, and my personal experience as a patient have shaped my passion for public health. Health is personal for me and advocating for UHC is my moral obligation to honour and help people I care for. What is your story? Let's talk!",
