    "summary": "I am an aerospace engineer and a historian of science, specializing in the history of medieval Arabic science & technology.  My engineering background has enabled me to engage with the history of science & technology in a much more profound way (numerical and hands-on) and at the same time has allowed me to build bridges between the education of history of science on one hand and education of science on the other. My motto is \"Pride in the Past, Ownership of the Future\"\n\nI am particularly interested in combining history of science with STEM/STEAM education. I am also interested in introducing and engaging students with technologies of the future such as 3d printing via history of science, for example by developing working replica's of ancient inventions by 3d printing. \n\nI have a great passion for science and history of science communication and popularization. I have considerable experience in \"hands-on\" teaching of history of science by means of \"hands-on\" workshops. I have given workshops on Arabic science such as astrolabe workshop or workshop on geometric patterns in Islamic art in many countries.\n\n\nI have also considerable experience with curatorial work. \n\nAs one of my latest projects, for the Turkish Presidential Nation's Library, i have developed a exhibition with the title \"History of Islamic Science in 100 objects\" . The exhibition, which  consists of 100 objects of which are 87 replicas and 13 authentic medieval scientific manuscripts. The exhibition which opened it doors in April, 2021 has since been travelling. \n\nAs the curator of the exhibition, I also wrote a 220+ page exhibition catalog for the exhibition, which is available both in Turkish and English. \n\nI also do consultancy work for auction houses where I am regularly asked to analyze, describe and evaluate medieval Arabic/Islamic scientific instruments & manuscripts.",
