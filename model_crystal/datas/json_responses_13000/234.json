I am able to help Ukrainian refugee students express themselves through helping them improve their English skills. In the classroom, I differentiate and scaffold my students\u2019 materials to have appropriate levels for each individual student. I teach in manners that allow students to develop their English in each communication modality. My position as a TESOL teacher at OSA is more than teaching English, however. It is also about making sure my students feel safe, comfortable, and as happy as possible. I ensure that I look after the social-emotional components of my students in and outside of each lesson. Further, the students at OSA have taught me so much about personal strength, growth, and the power of community. I continue to learn from my students each day, and look forward to continuing my work at OSA!",
