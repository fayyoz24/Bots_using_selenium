    "summary": "Actively pursuing new challenges \n\nHaving made a transition from Albania/Kosovo to the EU Netherlands now, I am actively engaged in pursuing my next career move.  My extensive background in working for state and local governmental entities, as well as NGOs, gives me a solid basis and skillset that can be applied in a variety of roles.    \n\nThe Western Balkans, synonymous with turmoil, is where I have built a career spanning over two decades.  My primary roles have involved fostering governance and democratization within this highly volatile region. It goes without saying, that success within the Balkans requires a broad skillset to work in difficult, stressful and tense situations.  Over the years, I have honed my skills, which directly contributed to the success of my endeavors and earned the respect among professionals peers and not only.\n\nMy unique professional experience and background gives me a worldly perspective that I look forward to sharing in my next role.  By nature, I am motivated, enthusiastic, proactive, communicative, and more importantly, ethical.  I love to learn and do not shy away from any challenge.  I pursue all that I do with passion, dedication and commitment to the ultimate end goal.  \n\nI am currently looking for a position that enables me to relay the professional experience but certainly enabling me to learn from the work I will be doing as I truly believe that every job is a stepping stone to career learning and further professional development. \n \nI look forward to speaking further and can be contacted at:\n\nCell:  +31 65 13 00 841\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/isakbilalli/ \nisak.bilalli@hotmail.com \nisaactiral@gmail.com \n\nSincerely,\n\nIsak N.
