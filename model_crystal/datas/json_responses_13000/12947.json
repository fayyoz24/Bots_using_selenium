    "summary": "My name is Eva de Vries (1984), and since November 1st 2021 I am working as foreign news editor (Radio, TV & Online) at Dutch public broadcaster NOS.\n\nFrom February 2016 until September 2020 I worked as freelance multimedia journalist in East Africa, first based in Nairobi, Kenya and from 2018 onwards based in Kigali, Rwanda. I worked for Dutch as well as for English language media. Besides my journalism work, I did quite some communication & storytelling assignments for ngo\u2019s as well (text, photography, video and audio production). To see my work please visit www.storiesbyeva.com.\n\nPrior to my move to Africa, I worked as a project coordinator for Movies that Matter (initiated by Amnesty International) (2014 \u2013 2016) and as an editor, producer and program coordinator for media organisation Lokaalmondiaal (2009 \u2013 2014). Leading the \u2018International Journalism\u2019 department, I developed and coordinated projects related to media, journalism, foreign correspondents and press freedom.\n\nEducation wise, from 2003 until 2009, I studied Journalism, International Relations and Political History (BA) and Conflict Studies and Human Rights (MA). During my Bachelor degree, I studied African History at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town, South Africa. My research for my Master thesis took place in the border region of South Sudan, Northern Kenya and Northern Uganda. The years after, I travelled to Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Tanzania, Togo, Ghana, Egypt, Morocco, Zimbabwe Ethiopia and Rwanda.\n\nContact me at eva.de.vries@nos.nl",

Lokaalmondiaal has implemented this program since 2006 but in 2013 and 2014 we expanded the program to five other EU countries.\n\nDuring this two-year program, a total amount of approximately 10,000 students from 6 EU countries enrolled (partly or fully) in the training program about global reporting which was offered by universities and media schools in their own countries. A total amount of 440 students from the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Germany, Portugal and Bulgaria went on overseas placements to developing countries in order to make a total amount of 1760 journalism productions (film, radio, photography, written, multimedia). \n\nTaking into account the interconnectedness among countries worldwide, we highly value the role of international journalism. Therefore, the overall objective of the program is to inspire and enable the next generation of EU journalists and media professionals to inform the European audience about development issues and other foreign topics, thereby generating greater critical understanding among EU (and global) citizens.",
