Our clients are based in Europe (the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, Sweden) and in America. I have extensive experience in drafting and prosecuting complex patent applications (including at the interface between Artificial Intelligence and Biotech). I frequently advise biotech startups on their IP strategies (landscaping study is a middle to help formulating an IP strategy). I am frequently involved in European Opposition Proceedings. I also have experience in supporting complex license negotiations in which IP is pivotal and in advising clients before and during IPO processes (Initial Public Offer).
