It is a professional spin off of the annual ANVR Congress in November for the Dutch travel industry.\nThis students' congress offers 44 excellent students of 5 different high schools and universities, a unique change to get in touch with their future colleagues and possible employers. During 4 intense days they work in a team and have to complete tough assignments, preparing them for a professional carreer in tourism. \n\nI was delighted to be asked to join the crew and coach one of the eight student teams. With my work experience and knowledge of online travel website development, I tried to advise my team at times they needed me, and was also there to help other teams in their assignments. Our team ended up on the 4th place, of which I'm very proud! However, their final business case and presentation was judged as the best of all teams! \n\nIt was a pleasure to join this special trip and meet so many new travel experts. Hope to see you all soon!",
