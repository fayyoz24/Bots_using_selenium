We now have over 250,000 users in schools, colleges and universities.\nIn 2023 Revisely also launched a platform to allow teachers to outsource grading tasks to external professionals: TheyCorrect.com\nAt Revisely we believe happy teachers make happier students. Many teachers are not so happy due to the workload around marking and giving feedback on students\u2019 work, so we came up with some solutions.\nRevisely offers a productivity tool that teachers use to correct students\u2019 work, saving teachers time with standardised feedback and optimised workflows. It also gives more actionable feedback to students so they can improve learning outcomes. The unique extendible sets of comments integrated in Revisely\u2019s web application include tips on how to improve writing skills but can also include teachers\u2019 feedback, increasing students\u2019 engagement and learning effects. In addition, Revisely offers various other features such as plagiarism checking to promote original writing, Team Hand-ins to stimulate collaborating in groups and Peer Grading & Feedback to help students learn from each other. \nRevisely\u2019s tool can be integrated through LTI 1.1 and 1.3 as well as through its own API, so we welcome partnerships with publishers and LMS providers!",

An experienced management team is in place to handle the ins and outs of North-South nearshoring. \nInterested?
