    "summary": "Experienced archaeologist with a demonstrated history of working in Cultural Heritage Management. Skilled in Historical Research, Report Writing, Excavation, Heritage Survey, Artefact Catalogues, Functional Analysis, Digital Recording and Photography. \n\nI am passionate about all things heritage and most importantly the people at its core. I enjoy working with Traditional Owners and members of the public and I am a strong believer in listening and learning from others first.\n\nMy Honours project focused on a Fremantle Convict-Colonial mental Asylum (1864-1909), and investigated the potential for former patients to enact agency within a total institution that retrogressed it\u2019s operations from modern therapeutic approach, to punitive holding ground.  \n\nI achieved this by synchronising extensive historical research with archaeological fieldwork at the former Asylum, spatially and functionally analysing material evidence and graffiti left behind in the former isolation area. \n\nTwo seperate excavations, in the former yard and underfloor in one remaining cell revealed an array of evidence manifesting as subversive behaviours and coping mechanisms among others, consistent with punitive penal institutions such as prisons, rather than a mental health facility designed to rehabilitate. \n\nAlthough I have a particular interest in historical archaeology, I am also passionate about Australian Indigenous heritage, Traditional Owner knowledge and their ancestral right to have a leading voice in its preservation. \n",
