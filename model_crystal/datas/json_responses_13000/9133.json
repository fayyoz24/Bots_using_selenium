    "summary": "I am a 2017 International Business graduate with a minor in management. I have over 3 years of working experience ranging from Technical Support to E-sports, and I have spent the last two years as an Expat Rental Coordinator for a start-up in Amsterdam. During these years of experience with startups, I've learned the importance of quick thinking, flexibility, and the need for adaption. \n\nOutside of work, I enjoy many different hobbies. Some of those include music production, gaming/esports, and staying active with bike rides, basketball, and hikes.",
