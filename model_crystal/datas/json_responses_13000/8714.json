    "summary": "As freelance Engineer, I am interested in technical and/or product-innovation challenges. Every innovation needs an open mind to manage the process, independent of the innovation itself!\nWhen I believe in a project, I won't give up easy, all problems can be solved! \nIf not, it's not a problem but a fact!\nOne of my strengths is motivating people and make them believe in a common goal. It is always \"what is in it for US?\". \n\nI cherish my experiences in Public Administration, it gave me the opportunities to achieve goals in\nthe collaboration between different Authorities. And with succes....cost reductions up to 50% can be reached!\n\nMy comprehensive experiences and achievements in international networking are major:\nI had the honour of giving presentations at several international seminars and expositions. Like \n2014 in Belgrad on wastewater-topics, 2015 Apa Expo in Bucharest at the WAREG on water-Governance and in 2014 i was nominated by the Topsector Water to represent the Netherlands on the  Water Exposition in Zhanjian (China).\n\nDuring last 7 Years I formed a close network at Romanian Governments and Authorities, such as A.N.A.R. (Apele Romane), A.R.A. (Romanian Water Association).\nAlso I discuss (waste)waster policy with the Secretary of State of A.N.R.S.C. (National Regulatory Authority for Municipal Services) on regular basis.\n\nInitiating, developing and implementing innovations triggers me.\nIn private projects, or as company consultant. \nHydrogen Automotive, Sugar Beets Processing, Wastewater Treatment, Governance Structures, New Applications for existing Materials, creatieve structural designing, it does not matter, it is the \"Way of Thinking\" that counts.\n\nCont(r)act me and find out....I am interested in a challenging career shift\n\n+31 654223534",
