    "summary": "I have a background in education, customer service and recruitment, which has enhanced my social and people skills. My last job experience as a recruiter/trainer at Picnic also helped me grow as a team leader. I was in charge of hiring new employees, as well as training them to reach the targets within the company.\n\nI loved my job! It gave me the opportunity to interact with a lot of people from different backgrounds and nationalities. It also helped me to discover I want to develop further as an recruiter.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me. I'm looking forward for a new experience.\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Email: paochavesca@gmail.com\n\ud83d\udcf2 Whatsapp: +31 (0)6 36280351",
