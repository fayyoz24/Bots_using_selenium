The objective is to make the I-bin a multi-functional and unconventional bin with added values to the users that will encourage people to use the trash bin, like emergency Phone charging outlet, solar energy to power the light and phone charging. The trash bin bucket was designed for easy use for both the users and maintenance workers. It also has ash tray for smokers. Additionally, the I-Bin has advertising platform that will generate revenue for the owners-municipality.. We've made various tests of the concept, which included user trailing and we created a fully functional model of a trash bin. All the information related to this project can be found in my online portfolio (under Sustainable Solution)",
