Our objective has been to break the stigma associated with infertility across the continent. The struggles of women with fertility issues inspired the formation of the DO ; however, the constitution of Destiny Organisation would later on be amended to include men because infertility does not discriminate. I am a proud volunteer of my time and skill set to an issue that is particularly close to my heart."
