Secondly, I co-created a new policy on debt relief.\nFor both these projects I had to work closely with many colleagues, management, and interest groups on the intersection of the municipal organization and politics.\n\nIn the second year I was involved in the co\u00f6rdination of regional collaboration in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area.
