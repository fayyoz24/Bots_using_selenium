Later, this architecture could be extended to support more complex games, such as Mancala, checkers, chess, etc",

It is apparently the first tool of this type that natively runs on Android mobile devices. JMorpher compiles a lexical transducer definition in the AT&T raw text format, of the type generated by Foma and other open source finite-state packages, into an internal Java representation which is drawn upon to parse input strings. Besides the API, JMorpher comprises of a simple graphical interface that allows the user to load a transducer file, type in some text and parse it. Results of an evaluation based on large Portuguese lexical transducers of different complexity degrees are provided. The implementation was shown to be very efficient on a desktop PC. Although, on an Android smartphone, JMorpher\u2019s performance is much lower, it is still suited to the needs of NLP tasks in this environment.",
