    "summary": "Dr. Logan Stuck is an epidemiologist, statistician, and data scientist with over seven years of experience using these skills for innovation in the research, control, and prevention of infectious diseases and other causes of morbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. He has conducted field work in Ethiopia, mainland Tanzania, Zanzibar, Zambia, and Zimbabwe and supported research remotely for many other countries. These projects included intervention program evaluation projects, cost evaluations, as well as leading workshops to build quantitative research capacity.\n\nFollowing his bachelor\u2019s degree at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, USA, Logan worked as a grant writer at Monument Health in Rapid City, South Dakota, USA, then pursued a master\u2019s degree in biostatistics at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. After receiving his MS in Biostatistics, Logan worked as a statistician for the Health Partners Institute in Minnesota until enrolling as a doctoral student at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, where his dissertation research focused on the evaluation of systems effectiveness and cost of reactive case detection for malaria in Zanzibar. After receiving his PhD, he acquired a position as an epidemiologist and postdoctoral fellow at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development in Amsterdam, Netherlands where he currently works today.",

Results will guide PMI/Zimbabwe and the USAID mission to make decisions on appropriate strategies to strengthen NMCP capacity and to choose interventions best suited for PMI support as the country moves toward malaria elimination.\"",

More specifically it aimed, first, to evaluate the most basic assumption that the prevalence of malaria is higher within the index household and possibly amongst neighbors of the index household than the background prevalence in Zanzibar. Secondly, it aimed to evaluate RCD as a tool to target and treat these infections, should they exist. Finally, it aimed to assess the effectiveness and economic cost of RCD and whether a number of alternative strategies might be more effective at a similar or lower cost.\n\nThis project provided the data for my doctoral dissertation.
