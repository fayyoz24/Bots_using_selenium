I can help you develop your business English communication skills for any business situation. Using Neurolanguage Coaching\u00ae, learning becomes time and cost efficient as well as effective due to personal goal setting.\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Are you interested in knowing more? DM me to book a free initial session!\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nBy understanding how the brain learns best (neuroscience), as Neurolanguage Coach\u00ae, I can make sure that:\n\u2666 You are in the optimal mind state to facilitate learning. This means that you feel comfortable when using English. \n\u2666 Within no time, you feel confident and are ready to tackle your work in English. \n\nWhat does a neurolanguage coach\u00ae do?\n\nAs a neurolanguage coach\u00ae, I know that: \n\u2666 each brain is unique.\n\u2666 we all learn differently\n\u2666 we all need to feel comfortable to learn. \nSo, I create a calm, welcoming and professional atmosphere that allows optional learning. This atmosphere releases the right chemicals into your brain to help this. I also use knowledge of learning preferences to improve your learning. If you have always thought \u201cI can\u2019t learn anymore\u201d or have a bad learning experience, I can help you work through this. Most importantly, I know that your brain is capable of amazing things \u2013 you can always learn because of your brain\u2019s plasticity. I work with business professionals in the Netherlands (offline) and online with the world community to help them achieve their language learning goals.\n\nHow does this process work?\n\n\u2666 Using an initial free meeting, we set out your personalised learning road map with realistic goals. \n\u2666 You set the goals, the time-line and the tempo; we work together towards efficient and effective achievement of your goals. \n\u2666 We can check and ensure your progress by setting realistic goals at the beginning, performing a goal review mid-programme and at the end.\n\nWho am I?\n\nHi, my name is Tara and I am an experienced business English trainer and a Professional Neurolanguage Coach\u00ae certified and accredited by the International Coaching Federation. \nI have been running my language business for more than 10 years and have been teaching business English for more than 20 years in South Korea, Hong Kong, France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. \n\nTo sum up, Making English YourEnglish - Neurolanguage Coaching\u00ae is brain-friendly language learning that combines the strengths of teaching and coaching to empower language learners to achieve their Business English goals efficiently and effectively.",
