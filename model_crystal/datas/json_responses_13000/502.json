The world is one family and we seek to create partnerships, both large and small in order to work together towards a peaceful coexistence and initiate the change that is so greatly needed in the world. By working together, we can more easily multiply our efforts to scale up projects and create the momentum to take them global. \n\nThe foundation operates as a social innovation incubator, facilitating projects in growing to scale both at the national level and globally. Currently we have four projects, One Shared School. Embrace Europe, TorontoLine and Catalyst 2030, but are open to calls from organisations and individuals to assist in the incubation of their projects.\n\nWe create change through\u200b incubating projects and scaling up\n\nThe foundation operates as a social innovation incubator. Imagining change is the seed of making change happen. Our incubation projects are the ideas of shared change we facilitate to fruition. Once up and running, the project will either become an independent organisation or be handed over to one of our partners to take forward.\n\nWe have the expertise and a proven track record in taking projects and organizations to scale and are currently working with a number of established organizations to help grow their role in bringing the change to the world that is so greatly needed.",
