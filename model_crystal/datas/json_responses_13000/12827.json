She then took a career break to raise a family.  She completed her higher education in Britain (2006-2009), qualifying in software engineering and engineering management (University of Greenwich).  In 2009 she researched humanitarian supply chains in central Sierra Leone, for an MSc dissertation.  Since 2009 she has worked as a researcher in Liberia and Sierra Leone, supervising several large-scale socio-economic data gathering exercises for Wageningen, Cambridge, Chicago and Njala Universities, including rural socio-economic baseline studies of communities around the Gola forest (Sierra Leone and Liberia). This work involved managing field teams of up to 30-40 enumerators working in remote rural conditions, and supervision of computerised data entry. She has also managed several socio-economic field survey exercises for Njala University commissioned and funded by FAO.  In addition to her current work on the Njala-Wageningen research cooperation scheme she is also writing a PhD in social sciences at Njala with supervision from Professor Erwin Bulte (Development Economics, Wageningen) to be based on publications (e.g. Mokuwa et al. 2011).  Her thematic focus is on cultural variables (kinship, marriage exchanges, gift giving and sacrifice) to see how these affect economic development and market integration in rural Sierra Leone.",
