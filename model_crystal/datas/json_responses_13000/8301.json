After I noticed that the internal and external stakeholder engagement needed a boost, I took the initiative to roll out new hiring processes for each role uniquely, as well as employer branding practises. I involved the hiring managers in this process and as a result their interest for interviewing and candidate engagement sparked. When I joined Fashiola no data was gathered for measuring the performance of recruitment efforts, so I implemented an ATS that provided better visibility to the hiring managers.",
