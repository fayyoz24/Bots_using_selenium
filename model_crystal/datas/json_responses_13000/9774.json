    "summary": "I'm an enthusiastic professional who enjoys finding solutions for every set of circumstances. For all customer requirements, I am driven to find the most efficient solution: a solution that fits both the business process and the concepts behind the software. I enjoy connecting colleagues from different teams and departments, as well as bridging the gap between customers and our engineers.\n\nOutside working hours the same happens: I will minimise the number of traffic lights on my way from work to home, to make the cycling trip quicker and more enjoyable, and when working on a DIY project I try to get the most out of my piece of fabric or felt by cutting it in a smart way.",
