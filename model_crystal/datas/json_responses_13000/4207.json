    "summary": "I have professional experience with client facing roles in the last five years ranging from digital advertising, tourism in Iceland and logistics. Helped facilitate the interaction with clients globally and provide solutions for different market needs.\n\nI studied International Business of Tourism in Vilnius University and got a Bachelor's degree. As I wanted to explore challenge myself and get some international experience, I attended Chung-Ang University (South Korea) as an exchange student for one semester and I did my internship in Madrid Sensations (Spain) for 3 months. As I wanted to improve my language and communication skills, I became a member of an organization called ESN Lithuania which helped me to expand my knowledge about other cultures and improve intercultural communication. I became better at time management, organizational skills, I also improved my English and Spanish languages. \n\nAfter my studies I started working as a logistics coordinator in an international company Transcom where I get to communicate with customers every day in English and Spanish languages. This job helped me to improve my customer service skills and to gain knowledge about logistics. When I decided that it is time to face new challenges and opportunities, I started working in Adform where I got to know more about digital advertising and IT support. I also spent a year working in Arctic Adventures as customer care specialist where I learnt more about Iceland and tourism. \n\nMy goal is personal development, therefore, I aim to try different fields, continue working with international people and never stop learning.",
