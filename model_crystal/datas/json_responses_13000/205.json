    "summary": "I am a graduate of Weequahic High School (Newark, New Jersey, USA, 1961), Bard College (BA  Eng. Lit. 1965), the Johns Hopkins University (MA  Eng. lit. 1966) and the University of Connecticut (Ph.d  Eng. lit.1979).\n\nDuring my 45 year long teaching career I have covered the gamut of English literature from Chaucer to the present day. My Ph.d research field was Alexander Pope and the whole period of English satire from 1688 to 1745. I also developed and taught  advanced undergraduate courses at the University of Amsterdam on \"Continuity and Innovation in American Poetry\" and \"Jewish-American Literature in the Post-War Period.\" \n\nSince my early retirement in 2005 I have been concentrating on teaching two different courses which reflect my current interest in the Torah (Old Testament) to Senior Citizens at two of Holland's universities, namely the Free University (Amsterdam) and the University of Groningen. The first of these courses is called \"The Jacob Principle: Symbol, Ritual and Theme in the Jewish Bible\" and the second is called \"From Gift to Command: How Monotheism, Idolatry, the Family Metaphor and the Contract Metaphor Together Shaped the Jewish Bible.\"\n\nI hope some day to turn \"The Jacob Principle\" into a book.\n\nSpecialties: American literature: Bernard Malamud\nEnglish literature: Alexander Pope\nOther: Bible Study and Theology",
