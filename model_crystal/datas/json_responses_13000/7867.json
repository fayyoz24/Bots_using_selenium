    "summary": "I am passionate about design, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and connecting the dots between these three.\n\nI am pursuing my formal education in graphic design at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam while I am educating myself informally in entrepreneurship and business through various programs, events, LinkedIn, reading articles, connecting to people, and working on self-initiated projects.\n\nWorking and volunteering in the non-profit sector has demonstrated to me the value of working together with people who are driven by a mission, and a common goal, and who want to have an impact on people and society through their work. It has been incredibly rewarding to work in a team with people who are dedicated to their work because of its meaning and significance beyond their own interests.\n\nWorking for an e-commerce startup and for a company consulting start-ups has provided me with insights into team dynamics in smaller teams, into the importance of attention to detail and customer service. From my working positions so far I have learned the importance of design to communicate accurately what the company wants to send out as a message to its target audience and the broader public.\n\nMy skills can be separated into two groups:\n\n1) Design-related skills\n- Adobe Creative Suite /Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign/\n- Brand concept development \n- Creating concepts for visuals for social media\n- Product photography and photo editing\n- Illustration \n- Storytelling through art /graphics, film, illustration/\n- Collaborative design\n- Interactive design\n\n2) Entrepreneurial skills\n- Self-initiative and proactiveness\n- Public speaking\n- Project Management\n- Interpersonal communications\n- Self-awareness\n- Connecting with people and building relationships\n- Pitching\n- Business modeling\n- Communications and marketing \n- Negotiations",
