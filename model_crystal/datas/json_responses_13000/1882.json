The languages found in Eloquence are alive and used by NPCs, so the best way to discover what words or phrases mean, is by testing them on NPCs to find out how they respond.\n\nEloquence is a highly innovative game that revolves about communication. It aims to show the strength of language, and focuses on the similarities between language use in different cultures.\n\nEloquence is my original concept, and I've gathered a small team to help me build this project.\n\nIt's innovative character has been recognised by others, as is demonstrated by Eloquence's selection for GDC 2019's Experimental Gameplay Workshop, the inclusion in the DGA's Holland Pavilion at 2019's Gamescom, and the selection for the Leftfield Collection at EGX 2019.\n\nEloquence has received a government subsidy to stimulate the development of the project, which is now used to create a vertical slice of the game. The team is currently seeking additional development fund.",

Using my background as a historical linguist - with deep knowledge of the medieval language of Middle-Dutch - I was able to add accents of authenticity to the game world, which revolves about an ancient (Dutch) kingdom being frozen in time.\n\nMy responsibilities included:\n- create various iterations of the plot;\n- write dialogue lines for the characters;\n- guarantee that each line of dialogue remains sufficiently informative or instructive, to ensure the players maintain focus on their tasks ahead;\n- create characters and add to the characterisation of the existing cast;\n- write direction lines for the voice actors;\n- incorporate the game's lore into my writing;\n- check all other writing for consistency;\n- help design in-game world items, such as tarot cards;\n- insert snippets of Middle-Dutch, to add authenticity;\n- think along with the game designers about the puzzles and their place in the game world;\n- write rhymes and lyrics for the ominous Jester character.\n\nThe challenges I faced were:\n- marry the story of the old instalments with the new setting and mechanics of 'We Were Here Together';\n- insert as much background story and world building details into the dialogue as the team allowed;\n- keep up with the game design's pace of rapid prototyping, meaning that puzzles and sequences I finished writing for might be scrapped from the final game - and filling up the plot issues following said omissions;\n- experiment with different rhyme schemes for the Jester's songs;\n- hide secret messages in the Jester rhymes.\n\nWe Were Here Together is available on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/865360/We_Were_Here_Together/",

            "description": "Together with Studio Bleep and Sfinx Games, I am developing a childrens' picture book using Augmented Reality (AR) technology, for the target audience of children aged 3 to 6 years. AR is cleverly combined with beautiful and colourful hand-drawn pictures.\n\nAR enables the reader to make the images jump off the book's pages by using a smartphone or tablet. In fact, it allows for interaction with the illustrations. This way, the book's story can be somewhat influenced, which results in a richer and more interactive reading experience, connecting the best of two types of media. The app will be made freely available in the App Store and Play Store, while the book can be utilised without the app as well.\n\nMy task was firstly to compose lines of poetry that emphasise the connection between the pictures in the book and the fantasy world in the app. The story tells of a girl called Rosie, whose stuffed animal Swinger won't go to sleep. Therefore, they explore all the rooms in Rosie's house, each of which turn into adventurous and exciting environments in the fantastic mind of Rosie. The book's illustration portray the house's rooms, while the objects in the rooms transform into interactive play opportunities in the app. The text and tone of the poems need to relate to both the 'realistic' rooms and the imagined objects for this reason. \n\nSecondly, my task was to link the inherently static nature of a book to the interactivity of the app. The book will always show the same text and images, whereas the app enables readers to create a unique experience out of every reading session. This interconnection caused issues in areas such as interaction, continuity, replay-ability, and branching play experiences. By designing the architecture of the story, texts, and images in a specific manner, I managed to balance all of these factors to achieve an innovative, interactive play and reading experience.\n\nThere is a demo available for the picture book as well as the app.",

The UI will be minimal. Nonetheless, the game wil tell rich narratives. How this works, I cannot disclose at this time. I can only give away for now that I am designing innovative and experimental systems to achieve this. \n\nMore news on this project soon.",

Some parts of the story may be skipped, or a choice will be available between several optional plot paths, according to the player's preferences.This story is complemented with other narrative clues, that may be collected and will, when correctly sorted, provide additional information on the game's world and characters.\n\nThe game is set in a fictive United States city, and contains a cast comprised of culturally diverse characters.

The player will find himself in a world based on The Shire (from 'The Lord of the Rings'), and will be able to read many books that will illustrate the history, culture and ideologies of The Shire. \n\nHowever, I was soon given the task of designing the mod's Main Quest line, which resulted in a creative approach to the source material in terms of world and lore, in which the player is supposed to be sufficiently empowered to make a difference through his actions. \n\nThis led to a branching story structure, with thresholds for varying side quests (also designed by myself) and at least two distinct climaxes to the story. \n\nTogether with the project manager, I designed story characters and written a character sheet for each of them. I additionally designed the quests and assigned stages to each quest, while also writing the full dialogue for the Main Quest, including all branching dialogue options and selection conditions.\n\nFinally, I acted as editor of dialogue written by others and check these on spelling, tone, and validity within the confines of Middle-Earth's fantasy world.",

I live and breathe all things story and narrative. Fortunately, game developers of today look beyond the stereotypical game experiences and seek opportunities to instil their products with inspiring, horrifying or dramatic appeal. \n\nI'm available as freelancer and prefer to work closely with the developer, to ensure that gameplay and story are intertwined and connected. I am always seeking new opportunities in which to express my creative energy, so you are most welcome to send me a message.\n\nMy professional strengths lie in the areas of:\n- emergent narratives (my article on emergent narratives has been the top result for Google and other widely-used search engines for years: https://multiverse-narratives.com/2015/05/07/emergent-narratives-in-games/)\n- world building (ask me about my method using network theory and sociology to create dynamic worlds full of conflict)\n- thrilling dialogue (I make sure players know what characters expects from them, while maintaining a naturally sounding tone of voice)\n\nI am particularly interested in projects that include the following themes:\n- mythology and folklore\n- cultures and languages\n- duality and symmetry\n- tension between different levels of knowledge; objective truth versus represented truth\n- playing with the player's expectations",
