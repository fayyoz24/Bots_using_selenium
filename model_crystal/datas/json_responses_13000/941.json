    "summary": "The Lowlands Institute for Bioelectric Medicine was founded by cardiologist-electrophysiologist prof. Dr. Natasja MS de Groot and Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Yannick J.H.J Taverne. The institute is a fusion of their research groups, which are respectively translational electrophysiology (department of Cardiology) and translational Cardiothoracic Surgery (department of Cardiothoracic Surgery). Within this institute  an network of medical doctors, engineers, biologist, patients and companies collaborate to implement innovation in biology, technology in daily clinical practice to diagnose and treat diseases caused by bio-electrical dysfunction with emphasis on the heart.\nBioelectronic medicine encompasses innovative approaches to detect and treat diseases by utilizing bioelectricity. Bioelectricity refers to generation of electrical currents by conversion of chemical energy produced by living organisms. Bioelectrical signals are at the heart of cell-cell communication and therefore essential for organization, morphogenesis, and regeneration of cells. Bioelectrical dysfunction causes dysfunctional organs and hence a variety of challenging diseases e.g. cardiovascular, neuromuscular-, skin- neurological-, auto-immune-, psychiatric-, metabolic- diseases and cancer. Deciphering bioelectricity and subsequently modulating it, revolutionizes prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Recent molecular studies have highlighted the importance of bioelectrical signaling; the electrochemical nature of cells and their micro-environments encompasses a tight coupling between cellular physiology and bioelectricity. Combined with the realization that externally applied electrical fields can modulate multicellular processes, interest in bio-electricity of biological systems has been revived. The bioelectrical system is the quintessential link between form (morphology) and function (physiology) and is the gamechanger in translational research.",
