    "summary": "Passionate about holistic, student-centered, social justice-oriented education that embodies creativity, lifelong learning, and fostering a growth mindset. \n\nAt University of the Fraser Valley, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with further concentrated study in Visual Arts and a certificate in Communications. From there I pursued a Bachelor of Education with a focus on teaching secondary Humanities and Arts (UFV). In February 2019, I obtained a Snowboard Instructor Certification from the Canadian Association of Snowboard Instructors. In September 2021 to April of 2022, I completed a Masters of Education with a focus in Curriculum and Instruction from University of New Brunswick, graduating with a GPA of 4.2. \n\nI taught Art and Art Activism at Abbotsford Senior Secondary School from 2018 - 2023. In the past I have taught English (various ages), Communications, Psychology, Social Studies, and International Baccalaureate Art. I am intentional about incorporating cross-curricular content, technology, social justice, and mental health and wellness into each course I teach, which lead me to be the Social Emotional Learning department head, also. \n\nThe Art Activism course that I designed entails students delving into social justice topics, breaking down their bias, and creating large-scale artworks that are then publicly shown at a local art gallery. University of British Columbia's Art Justice class reached out to partner with me in bringing awareness to the overincarceration of Indigenous peoples in Canada. We work alongside Corrections Canada to facilitate learning and public artworks on this topic. Gallery showings have been featured in Abby News and online. In 2022, I was nominated for UFV's Young Distinguished Alumni Award for this work. \n\nI currently teach International Baccalaureate Visual Arts at Amsterdam International Community School.\n\nIn addition to teaching, I am an active part of art and writing communities. I am a published book reviewer for the Canadian Review of Materials, and I have had articles published in art and education publications such as Louden Singletree and TEACH Magazine. Along with these other creative endeavours, I illustrated the children's book \"Mama's Carnitas\" (2021), with all proceeds going to supporting entrepreneurial single mothers in Mexico. Currently my goal is to hone my paleoart skills and contribute to the paleoart community with a female presence. Some art can be seen on my instagram, @paleonikita. ",
