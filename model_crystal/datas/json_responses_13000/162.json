    "summary": "I have been an ESL professional since 1983, and have worked in the People's Republic of China, Nepal, as well as the Netherlands. My work in Holland began with 10 years as instructor and trainer in Business English at a wide variety of businesses throughout the country. In 2000 I began working at the Kennemer College, and acted as Department Head for 7 years. In August 2014 I joined the English department at De Breul. In addition, I have worked with the Anglia Europe network as both Head Teacher and Group Teacher. In 2016 I received my Master's Degree in English Education at the University of Applied Sciences  Amsterdam.\n\nAs well as being an English teacher, I also have a private practice for consultations, workshops and presentations in spiritual astrology, systemic work and energetic healing.
