The objective is to accompany communities and councils in the promotion of transparency, the management of Forest Royalties in order to create positive development impact at local level. Located in the Manyu Division, Tinto council area has 59 villages with a population of 55,000, 95% them depending solely on forest. The council reported to have disbursed 10% of the Royalties to the beneficiaries. But this money has not been used properly due to many reasons: poor circulation of information on the issue of Royalties in most villages, poor record keeping and choice of costing of projects. This has led to many uncompleted projects. Not withstanding, the council has executed projects like construction of markets, schools\u2026As for Eyumojock it is located 63km West of Mamf\u00e9 with 66 villages and 80,000 inhabitants.58 villages out of 66 benefit from Timber Royalties. There is an improved understanding of the concept of Royalties, but confusions remain on applying texts. Most traditional councils managed the funds to their benefit. But some projects like the construction markets, roads, water supply were carried out. The result is that there are villages with vast forests which are underdeveloped and underscholarized. Hence, councils should both be assisted by experts from the government and NGOs. Local communities should also be set up to monitor the use of Timber Royalties.",
