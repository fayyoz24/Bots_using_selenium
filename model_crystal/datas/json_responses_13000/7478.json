    "summary": "Why do you love where you work? Because of the people I work with and for would be my answer. I have discovered that I could work in any organisation and be happy and professionally challenged if I work with and for people that challenge, move and inspire me. I am curious about what they want for themselves and what brings them to and keeps them with the organisation they work in and how they want to contribute to making that organisation and its clients better. \nHow I work is by giving and gaining trust to the internal and external clients, being the hospitable & caring, taking ownership of my projects and tasks at hand and being the strong communicator that I have become over the years. And always remaining enthusiastic, positive, working hard and with an eye for possibilities.\nWhat I aim to achieve with my passion for people and the organisations I work with/in is to connect the organisation as a whole and excel in the product or service we deliver to our clients.",

Together we worked our way through a relocation to and complete renovation of the new office, a merger with Hale and Dorr LLP,  a new book keeping system and several challenges on the level of staff and lawyer recruitment, insurances, billing to clients, salary administration and arrival & departure of the multi-national team of lawyers and stagiaires (interns). The office language was English, but because of its location (Brussels) we spoke Dutch and French on a daily basis.",
