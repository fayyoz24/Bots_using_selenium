    "summary": "I am Iv\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, an Argentinian System Administrator professional located in the Netherlands. I am a technology enthusiast who loves reading and learning about infrastructure and emerging technologies. I am very interested in being part of projects that employ agile and DevOps methodologies and work with cloud-native techs.\n\nI used to work as a Cloud Engineer at Edrans, the first company to be an AWS (Amazon Web Services) Premier Partner in Argentina. In this role, I help our clients design and deploy AWS solutions following cloud best practices. Besides that, working with our clients' developer teams is also part of my position, improving and troubleshooting their development and production environments.\n\nBefore Edrans, I worked as Operation Analyst at Wavy, a Movile company. There I learned a lot about telecommunication and mobile networking. My main tasks were monitoring our carriers' SMPP links and administration of our Southcone servers and services. \n\nBefore Wavy, I worked at Grupo Most as System Administrator. It was my first job in IT, where I had my first interaction with Linux (I fell in love with it) and server administration in general. There I managed the services and infrastructure of Grupo Most and its clients.",

It offers three services to its 6M+ users: sending money, requesting money, and paying with a QR code.\n\nThere comes a time in every start-up company when it is necessary to have a team with a narrower and more specific scope of responsibilities to achieve great results. That is where the role of DevSecOps is born in MODO. After almost a year of working as a DevOps Engineer, I took on the responsibility of building the foundations of this new team, being its first member.\n\nHaving the advantage of knowing the points of improvement in the security of MODO's infrastructure in AWS, we managed to define a roadmap where we prioritized our weaknesses, documented our security stack and processes, and automated the deployment of our solutions using mainly Terragrunt as an infrastructure-as-code tool.",

Then comes the time of day when developers require the smoothest possible experience when deploying their applications to our Kubernetes clusters, and that's where the DevOps engineer hat comes in, which tries to improve deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions as a build and deployment tool.
