    "summary": "peptide/protein discovery and development scientist. \n\nI\u2019m research scientist working to develop technologies that benefit human health. My main area of interest is discovery and development of pharmaceutical drug entities. I have more than 6 years of post-Ph.D. experience in peptide therapeutics, medicinal chemistry and protein/antibody. My key strength is phage display screening, lead generation and optimization, project management and have experience working with modalities like small molecule, peptide, macrocycle, protein and antibody. I have very good knowledge and skills in peptide chemistry, medicinal chemistry, peptide and antibody phage display, high-throughput screening, pharmacokinetics, molecular biology, biological assays, bioanalytical and biophysical tools.\n\nA little about me\u2026\n\nOriginally from India, now reside in Amsterdam area and continue to serve global clients for peptide/protein/antibody discovery and development project. One of main role is to expand exiting peptide-phage discovery technology and managing internal and external projects. I am very much looking forward to working on challenging projects.\n\nPrior to that as a scientific staff, I have contributed in establishing protein-peptide phage display technology on safe drugs for pain and inflammation using phage display at Max Planck Institute for Medical Research. \n\nDuring my postdoctoral tenure at EPFL, I have managed various projects and developed two-platform technology for early drug discovery based on double bridge peptide-phage display and traceless high-throughput screening of macrocycles. I have also performed antibody phage display against Tacrolimus to develop point-of-care diagnostic applications and selective bioconjugation of antibody.\n\nI am a chemist by training, did my Ph.D. in chemistry. I have contributed in the field of on peptide, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. I have designed, synthesized and studied novel peptide foldamers and performed multistep organic synthesis of peptidomimetics and natural products.\n",
