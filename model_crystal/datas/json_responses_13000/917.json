    "summary": "I am a theoretical biologist with a wide interest in ecology and evolution. In my work I aim to understand how population structure changes due to environmental influences and how population structure drives the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities. Herein I am especially interested in the feedback mechanisms that link individual energetics, life history characteristics and population dynamics. Although my scientific work is aimed to broaden the theoretical understanding of ecological systems, I am also interested in applying these theoretical insights to specific systems in the context of management questions. \n\nI currently use matrix models to explore how interactions within a family network affect the dynamics of a family of social individuals and how this affects the dynamics of populations of endangered animal species. \n\nDuring my PhD I explored how plasticity in individual growth curves affect the dynamics of structured populations. To do so, I connected dynamic energy budget models to size structured population models. I used this framework to study the effect density dependent growth in harvested North Sea fish stocks. \n\nIn addition, I have a broad background in teaching biology, ecology and evolution at various levels, which I consider an important aspect of a scientific career.",

This year the Theoretical Ecology Section devoted the award to novel and unconventional ways of theoretical thinking\u2014what we called break-the-mold papers. Departing from mainstream research, break-the-mold papers have the potential to be paradigm shifts in the near future, opening new avenues of work and understanding in theoretical ecology and beyond. Thus, a link between the Section and Santa Fe Institute Press was a no-brainer.\n\nThe 2023 ESA Outstanding paper in theoretical ecology goes to Jasper C. Croll and collaborator Andr\u00e9 M. de Roos for their paper \u201cThe regulating effect of growth plasticity on the dynamics of structured populations\u201d published in Theoretical Ecology. In this paper, the authors shed new light on how the interplay between the environment and individual traits, such as growth and reproduction, can impact the persistence of consumer populations. Specifically, this paper reminds us about the role of differences in plasticity (the difference in individual phenotypes due to the influence of the environment) in shaping age-structured and size-structure driven dynamics. This paper provides an elegant theoretical perspective to integrate life-history traits, energy budgets, population dynamics, and feasibility analysis.",

A basic form of plasticity in individual growth occurs if the growth rate depends on the food availability. On the population level this can give rise to indirect density dependent growth, because the density of a population affects the density of their food source. I am interested in the types of dynamics and population structure that can occur at different levels of plasticity in individual growth. In addition I study how populations with different levels of growth plasticity respond to harvesting in the context of sustainable fisheries. I tackle these questions by developing size structured population models based on dynamic energy budget models. In this way I can study the effects of growth plasticity from individual energy allocation up to population and community consequences. ",

These non-territorial individuals evoke pressure on the territorial individuals in the form of resource loss or defence costs. In this research, we explore the effect of non-territorial individuals on the size, shape and stability of territories. To do so, we propose a new territorial model based on the cellular Potts models. In this framework, we combine optimization, interactions between individuals and individual decisions, which are the most important aspects of the currently used territory models. As a result, this model is able to produce territories with characteristics found in a range of models and field studies. Territories are found to be stable if territorial individuals are very eager to expand their territory or when the costs of boundaries with neighbours are higher than the costs of boundaries with empty patches. In this model, the non-territorial individuals are incorporated in two distinct ways: explicitly as moving individuals using resources and implicitly as defence costs scaling with the area of the territory. The non-territorial individuals only have an effect on the size and shape of the territories if boundary zones of empty patches occur between the territories. The territories increase in size to compensate for resource loss, while they decrease in size if the costs for defending a territory increase. In addition, fluctuating pressure due to non-territorial individuals can result in a rounder shape of the territories. This model shows non-territorial individuals can have strong effects on the dynamics of territories depending on the conditions under which the territories are formed. Therefore, it is important to consider the presence of non-territorial individuals when studying the dynamics and evolution of territories.",

            "description": "Quantitative analyses struggle to determine all processes that are important for postcopulatory sexual selection. The shape of the relationship between mating success and reproductive success in males, the Bateman curve, can solve this issue. In contrast to the Bateman gradient, which is the linear regression between mating success and reproductive success, the Bateman curve can have different distinct shapes. The Bateman curve contains valuable information about the processes causing postcopulatory sexual selection and can have four distinct forms caused by different processes acting after copulation. The linear shape results from sperm competition following fair or unfair raffle dynamics. The saturation shape results from resources limiting sperm production, but can also result from mating order when all males start mating at the same moment. The intermediate optimum curve indicates several selective processes working in opposite direction and often contains additional precopulatory processes. To determine the best shape for the data, it is important to pay attention to characteristic features of the different curves. In contrast, for differentiating between the various processes resulting in the same shape of the male Bateman curve, it is important to look at the variances in the data and the female Bateman curve. In this way, hypotheses about processes causing postcopulatory sexual selection can be formed more easily even without measuring these processes in the first place, leading to more detailed follow up research. In conclusion, the Bateman curve is a simple tool for estimating processes important in postcopulatory sexual selection. ",

            "description": "Alternative Reproductive Phenotypes (ARPs) are an extreme form of intraspecific variation. The Environmental Threshold model gives a genetic basis for conditional ARPs and enables us to predict and model the evolution of ARPs. Theory furthermore shows that differences in life history between ARPs can enlarge the range of situations in which coexistence of ARPs persists. This suggests that other ecological processes that influence an organism\u2019s life history, such as cannibalism, can influence the persistence of ARPs as well. In this research, I study the effect of cannibalism by fighter males on the existence of ARPs using the male dimorphic bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini as a study species. First, I showed in an experiment that R. robini males cannibalize on the final instar stage and juveniles exposed to cannibalism mature proportionally more into scrambler males. It was reasoned cannibalism and ARP ratio were linked by size, because both are size dependant. Second, I explored the effect of cannibalism by fighter males by extending a two-sex, two-ARP population projection model. This revealed that cannibalism can extend the range of life history parameter values in which ARPs can exist by decreasing the fitness of cannibalizing fighter males. I propose an eco-evolutionary feedback loop, explaining in which way cannibalism and evolution of ARPs interact. In conclusion, this work highlights the importance not only to look at life history, but also at ecological factors when aiming to explain the coexistence of ARPs.",

Genetic drift, inbreeding and isolation are three major genetic factors contributing to small population size due to the negative effect of habitat fragmentation. In this study I focused on the fragmentation of fluviatile woodland habitat by examining nine populations of the climber Silene baccifera in the Dutch Rhine delta. I analyzed six microsatellite loci, examined population structure, and estimated the genetic status of S. baccifera in terms of population structure, inbreeding, gene diversity and allelic richness. The results suggest historical dispersal of S. baccifera historically dispersed along the river system.  However, current populations are currently significantly isolated by reduced gene flow. However, no direct effects of small population size indications were observed, such as inbreeding or drift. Silene  baccifera may be a good indicator species of  the effects of improved habitat connectivity in the Rhine delta through development (\u2018rewilding\u2019) projects. This study showed the effect of fragmentation of the river area on S. Baccifera and it is important investigate the effect on other species in order to make reconnecting the fragmented areas succeed.
