    "summary": "I am a multilingual (native French) person with many years of experience in Communication, Media Relations, Events, Brand Content and Promotions campaigns (online & offline). In my job as Export Consultant for Beverages at Business France, I assist French companies with their export activities on the Dutch market. Until recently, I worked for Sopexa, a Marketing & Communication agency focused on food, wine and lifestyle. In this role I was focused on B2B and B2C communication for international clients on the Dutch market. I am truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other professionals. While I enjoy most aspects of my job I think my favorite stage of a project is working with my clients to understand their business and their audience in order to realize their objectives. Colleagues know me as an enthusiastic connection cultivator who can build good relationships with the media and other stake holders.  \nPrevious experience was as a PR Manager with the luxury Renaissance Hotel in Amsterdam, part of Marriott Hotels & Resorts.\nI am detail oriented/accurate and always try to think out the box. I  can be trusted to come up with new ideas/approach. I can (and mostly did) work well alone and I love  to  work together with others. My successes included the organization of many (food & wine) events and  press trips that received good media coverage and a positive image for the clients I represented. \nFinally I am always willing to learn and looking towards the horizon to see the newest ways of reaching the audiences. \nI can be reached either through this profile or by phone at +31-6- 515 04 884.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
