    "summary": "I have completed my bachelor\u2019s studies in Environmental Engineering in Albania. After successfully graduating bachelor level, I pursued a professional Internship in the Department of Environmental Development Policies and Strategies at the Ministry of Tourism and Environment. Later on,I joined Eco-Studio-Project company as an intern in the department of environmental monitoring . \n\nIn 2019 I started my MSc degree with a major in Water Resource Engineering and Management (WAREM) at the University of Stuttgart in Germany where mostly I focused on sanitary engineering, the design of wastewater treatment plants, water quality, and treatment.During all my studies I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of technology and engineering both theoretically and practically. \n\nAlong with being a full-time student, I have also worked as a student assistant HiWi nearby Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems.  Furthermore, during my studies, I took on the role of the Public Relations Officer at the committee of IAHR-Young Professional in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. This role allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills, time management, teamwork, and public speaking.\n\nIn February 2021 I joined Centre Expertise Water Technology (CEW) in the Netherlands, nearby R&D team, for one year as an intern student and I got involved in several applied projects. During the whole year, I gained a lot of experience in conducting a literature review, planning, and executing practical research, critical evaluation of the results, and writing scientific reports. \n\nMy MSc.Thesis was  in collaboration with CEW and Hydraloop. The goal of the thesis was to evaluate microbial activity and inside the Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor and the efficiency of the greywater treatment in the decentralized water treatment system.\n\nCurrently, I am working as a Junior Technology Consultant at Isle Utilities based in the Netherlands. \n\nI am an optimistic, enthusiastic, curious, social, flexible, and self-determined person. \n",
