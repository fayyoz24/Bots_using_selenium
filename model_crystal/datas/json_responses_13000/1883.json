Spaces \u2018between\u2019, items in \u2018waiting\u2019 are depicted without revealing full scenes or information, they instead leave an essence of something, or an emptiness waiting to be filled or activated.

            "description": "\u2018Reports from the Year of the Monkey\u2019 is a playful and reflective presentation, bringing together works created in other times and places. Positioned together, within an unsettled era of transition and restricted mobility, whether individual or global, they resonate new association and possibility. Borders are transcended, portals opened to other dimensions and realities: Imaginary or temporal spaces with their own breath, rhythm and time. \n\n\u2018Grid\u2019, a performance/ video installation by Madelon Hooykaas combines projected video, performance, and a drawing. Structure and separation congregate abstractly as we are confronted by the projected image of a hostile iron grid used to create a house, (a home), and the physical presence and breath of the human. As the performer attempts to recapture the interplay of lines from the video, a drawing is created. She is both chasing the moving image, and chased by the image, as a new temporary dimension envelops her. \n\u2018Cat Ladders (Konstanz, Jena, Gubb\u00e4ngen, Bj\u00f6rkas, Salt Lake City)\u2019 installation by Saskia Janssen consists of five wooden replica cat ladders, paying tribute to \u2018putting oneself in the position of the other\u2019, even when the other is an animal. Whilst pet owners make cat ladders to allow their cats freedom, they risk them not returning. The ladders are playful symbols of compassion, or altruism, and symbolic stairs to freedom. \n\u2018Seismic Dreamers\u2019 is a photographic portrait series by Emily Bates, of teenagers in streets and courtyards in Naples, Italy. By entering into a brief moment of trust and openness with the artist, an intimate and vulnerable transformation and silence pauses the relentless chaotic magma of the city. ",

            "description": "Combining photography, video and audio elements, the installations of British artist Emily Bates are the fruit of long-term research in specific geographical contexts, often marked by the transition from traditional cultures to modernity.\n\nHer new project The sky is glowing with the setting sun has evolved from several visits to the Japanese island of Amami Oshima, located in the East China Sea, the subtropical landscapes of which are intimately linked to the rich mythology and belief system of the inhabitants. The work is centred on a photographic series combining views of the virgin forest, which contain numerous sacred trees, with portraits of two women who are guardians of the island\u2019s traditions and views of their living space.\nThe combination of these elements underlines both the fragility and the richness of the relationships that link the inhabitants of the island to its landscape.\n\nThe video installation Rhythm in 2 (... As long as our village shall last) comprises video recordings made over 2 years, of a song from a unique island ritual, the Hirase Mankai. The ritual is practised once a year at a specific site on the island shore. Originally, one part of the call and response song would be sung by Noro Shaman, and the other by several villagers, in respect to the rice gods, and to celebrate the harvest. Here the shifting time and demise of the island traditions sing out, echoing the song line, As long as our village shall last.\n\n\u201cAs long as our village shall last,\nLet us honour and celebrate her,\nLet us honour and celebrate, as long as our shima shall last!\u201d\n\n",

EMILY BATES, MADELON HOOYKAAS AND SASKIA JANSSEN.\n\n\u2018Reports from the Year of the Monkey\u2019 is a playful and reflective presentation, bringing together works created in other times and places. Positioned together, within an unsettled era of transition and restricted mobility, whether individual or global, they resonate new association and possibility. Borders are transcended, portals opened to other dimensions and realities: Imaginary or temporal spaces with their own breath, rhythm and time. \n\n\u2018Grid\u2019, a performance/ video installation by Madelon Hooykaas combines projected video, performance, and a drawing. Structure and separation congregate abstractly as we are confronted by the projected image of a hostile iron grid used to create a house, (a home), and the physical presence and breath of the human. As the performer attempts to recapture the interplay of lines from the video, a drawing is created. She is both chasing the moving image, and chased by the image, as a new temporary dimension envelops her. \n\u2018Cat Ladders (Konstanz, Jena, Gubb\u00e4ngen, Bj\u00f6rkas, Salt Lake City)\u2019 installation by Saskia Janssen consists of five wooden replica cat ladders, paying tribute to \u2018putting oneself in the position of the other\u2019, even when the other is an animal. Whilst pet owners make cat ladders to allow their cats freedom, they risk them not returning. The ladders are playful symbols of compassion, or altruism, and symbolic stairs to freedom. \n\u2018Seismic Dreamers\u2019 is a photographic portrait series by Emily Bates, of teenagers in streets and courtyards in Naples, Italy. By entering into a brief moment of trust and openness with the artist, an intimate and vulnerable transformation and silence pauses the relentless chaotic magma of the city.",
