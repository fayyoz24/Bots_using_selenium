    "summary": "From 1975 till 1982 I lived with my family in Cameroon and from 1982 up to now, the Lord Jesus allows me to make periodic visits to Cameroon and other African countries. In the course of many years, many people turned to God from idols and gather now to the Name of the Lord Jesus. Assemblies were established and groups of believers came into being both in remote villages and in towns. The purpose of these periodic visits is to preach the gospel and to instruct, confirm and encourage the existing testimonies and groups and to be a help for local brothers who serve the Lord in their country.
