Therefore, this project and being framed in the field of metalworking, studied a automated device that could replace a traditional manufacturing stage as the grinding of welds, taking as an example aluminum frame suitable for mounting on wood systems windows in wood-aluminum, which after passing through the phase welding need pass by grinding, this is a lengthy process and expensive failures. With this equipment we can thus obtain products with higher quality and lower lead times.",
