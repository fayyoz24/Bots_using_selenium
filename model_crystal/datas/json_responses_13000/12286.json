    "summary": "I am an Integrated MSc Chemistry postgraduate from India and am currently settled in the Netherlands. Previously I was employed in Piramal Pharma Limited / Hyderabad, India as a QC chemist under GMP regulations. I also pursue research experience in three different premier research labs in India. My master's thesis was rooted in the synthesis, characterization, and applications of N-heterocyclic carbenes and complexes. We are in the process of communicating the work to a specialized journal for publication. During the research, period got the chance to get hands-on experience in FT-IR, UV-Vis, Fluorescence Spectrometer, and Product analysis by different spectral techniques such as FTIR, NMR, Mass spectroscopy, etc. helped me to design experiments and perform the analysis in a much better fashion. As an integrated masters student, I dealt with theoretical and practical courses in physics, mathematics, and biology so I was able to explore various subfields of science.",
