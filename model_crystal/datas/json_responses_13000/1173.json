    "summary": "Job Experience (Summary):\t\t\n\nExperienced production and exploration geologist / seismic interpreter with 38 years experience. \n23 years experience in seismic studies as part of field development studies, appraisal and development well proposals, reserves reporting and equity redeterminations. \nIn earlier part of career had 15 years job exposure with Exploration geology and interpretation, both with prospect identification and mapping, as well as with regional seismic and geological studies. Worked in offshore delta and continental margin settings, oa the Lower Congo (Angola), Nile (Egypt), Niger (Nigeria) and Baram deltas (Borneo). Onshore studies in NE Syria (Deir ez Zor, Ash Sham), Irak (Majnoon and Kirkuk fields), Egypt (Western Desert), and Oman.  \n\nDiscipline lead for Seismic Interpretation and geo-modelling in Shell since 1999. Was regularly involved with technical peer assists and integrated milestone reviews during field development studies.  Was \u2018New Technology\u2019 focal point, as well as processing and QI focal point. Have experience with skill pool activities.\n\nMy platform of productivity is the Petrel seismic and geo-modeling toolkit, which I have used for the last 23 years. Earlier worked with Openworks / Seisworks and the Geoframe / Charisma platforms, as well as Shell\u2019s 123Di workstations. I am experienced with 2D and 3D seismic interpretation techniques, volume interpretation, fault and structural interpretation, attribute extractions and mapping, surface gridding techniques, geo-statistics, velocity modeling and depth conversion and uncertainty analysis.\nAdept at structural framework modeling, specifically of complex settings, built large and complex structural models for ao. the H-Node project, Nigeria offshore, Troll and Ormen Lange fields in Norway offshore, the  Val D'Agri field in Southern Italy and the large Lekhwair cluster in Oman. \nRecently worked as Lead Geoscientist and Project Lead in integrated field studies, as part of the Interpretation and Evaluation group in Weatherford, based in The Netherlands and Romania. Currently on contract as senior Geoscience consultant and project lead to the Weatherford Pakistan interpretation and Evaluation Group ( IES: covering all Middle East integrated studies) as well as the Romania IES group, covering European projects.",
