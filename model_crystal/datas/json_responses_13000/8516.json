    "summary": "I am Italian and German and have lived in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Florence, Maastricht, Barcelona and am currently working in Milan, Italy. \n\nI graduated with Cum Laude distinctions from an International Business bachelor's degree with a  marketing specialization. I conducted my thesis on a small scale empirical research, diving into the effect of personalization in advertisements for Gen Z customer\u2019s buying intention across different product categories. The research yielded conclusions with significant results.\n\nLooking ahead, I aim to expand my knowledge in management consulting, business development and data analytics. \n\nI am a pro-active team member who loves to take up a challenge, through analytical thinking, creativity, taking responsibility and continuously learning. \n\nI enjoy meeting new people, living new experiences, learning by doing, travelling and engaging in a range of sports from skiing to ball games to skating.\n\nSpeaking English and Italian fluently, having an advanced level of Spanish and intermediate proficiency of German and growing up in a dynamic environment, has taught me to appreciate international communities and experiences.\n\nIf I had to describe myself with one word it would be Energetic.\n\nMy favourite quote is from Napoleon Hill: \"You are the Master of Your Own Destiny.\"",

I found it to be a great motivator :)"
