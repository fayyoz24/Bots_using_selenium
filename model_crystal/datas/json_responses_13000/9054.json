    "summary": "As a little girl, I was fascinated by the fact that I spoke two languages, Croatian and Dutch. I saw it as a blessing; for each thing, every action and every feeling I had two words in my vocabulary. I knew then that I wanted to do something with language and communication. The decision to study at the Vertaalacademie in Maastricht came quickly. Translating is a wonderful field, but I was actually more interested in how my lecturers were teaching us. And 3 years after I graduated, I worked for 6 months as a lecturer of Translation at Zuyd University. Currently I'm partially working as a teacher for Dutch as a second language and text editor. I help my students with improving their Dutch and expanding their knowledge of the Dutch culture and society. There's nothing more beautiful than seeing people grow and develop their talents. Knowing that I contributed to that, is very valuable to me.\n\nI'm also a singer songwriter under the artist name Mala, which is at the same time my pet name in Croatian. Writing and sharing music means healing and connecting for me. There is nothing more beautiful than performing live and feeling the connection with the audience. During my show I also invite to share, that's very special. I combine my music skills with teaching Dutch, like giving workshops to non-native speakers in combination with music. In this way, they learn the language in a different way than they're used to. This combination was made for me. Furthermore, I share stories of other refugees in my music, to give them a voice too. I released my latest album The Untold Stories together with a book that contains these stories.\n\nIn work, as well as in daily life, I try to showcase my patient, calm and goal-oriented attitude, but also my passion, enthusiasm and creativity in all that I do. I let go of what's normal, and dedicate myself to change and discoveries.",
