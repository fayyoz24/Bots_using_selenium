    "summary": "I'm a scientist & engineer with a PhD in machine learning (ML) and a passion for (combinatorial) optimization.\n\nDuring my PhD at Max Welling's group, I have published and been an (outstanding) reviewer at top ML conferences, on the topic of machine learning for combinatorial optimization / vehicle routing. I received a best paper honorable mention at ICML 2019 for my work on stochastic beam search and I have been a Research Scientist Intern at Google DeepMind. See https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=DLCKZqUAAAAJ&hl for my papers (1000+ citations), and my github.com/wouterkool for my code (900+ stars).\n\nAt ORTEC, I worked on various ML & optimization projects such as warehousing, load optimization and vehicle routing. I initiated and led the team that won the 2021 DIMACS VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) challenge and I initiated and organized the EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition with over 150 participants and 50 final submissions.\n\nI have participated in many (ACM-ICPC style) programming and math competitions. While Python is my major tool, I have worked with many languages and I am a quick learner so I can code my way around. I like engineering, to build stuff and I will typically find a way to make things work, aiming for optimal results. \n\nFinally, I'm an enthusiastic presenter: my aim is to make my audience learn and laugh.",
