    "summary": "Hi there! I'm Niels, a passionate and driven 22-year-old student at the Tue, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering. With a keen interest in process engineering, I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the industry's advancements.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in chemical engineering principles, including process design, optimization, and analysis. I have actively engaged in challenging coursework, allowing me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and honed my attention to detail.\n\nOutside of my study I love to work as a bartender and waiter, where I resolve the people's need of a cool refreshment, here problem solving and working under stress is one of the key elements I have to deal with on a daily basis.\n\nAs I approach the completion of my bachelor's degree in late 2023, I am eagerly preparing to embark on the next phase of my professional journey. I am particularly drawn to industries that prioritize sustainability and efficiency, as I believe in the transformative power of engineering to create a better and more sustainable future.",
