    "summary": "As a (policy) researcher I specialized in both qualitative and quantitative research methods, ranging from deskresearch, interview, observation, and interaction techniques (group decision, Delphi techniques) to a broad range of methods for statistical analysis. In my opinion for research to be truly valuable, both qualitative and quantitative approaches are indispensible. To make founded assumptions, \u2018hard\u2019 quantitative data are important. However, being able to give a reliable interpretation of these quantitative data requires a good understanding of the context. For me, linking these two approaches within a study is the biggest challenge as this link is necessary for translating research findings into practical, usable recommendations for policymakers. \n\nKeywords: monitoring and evaluation, policy research, impact studies, policy consultancy.",
