We took around 800 images daily near the building amounting to 5032 images in total which were later reduced to 2011 images after the removal of redundant data. Concepts of Edge Matching, Histogram Equalization, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm and other image processing techniques were then used on the image data. The final result was presented in the form of one stitched image of the building. This concept can be used for intuitive interaction with large image datasets and will be very useful for interactive games, movies etc. ",

PP contribution to EOWS (End of Well Summaries) reports.\n\n\u2022 Long term Closed-in wells review, Yibal asset \u2013North Oman : As part of integrated team, reviewed long term closed-in wells of Yibal asset and allotted them for abandonment, restoration/ repair or other alternatives. The other deliverables include FUP (Further Use Proposal) for every reviewed well, Opportunity inventory of potential gains, Potential to deliver gains using low cost intervention methods & appropriate technology, Feedback on available data quality & gaps.",

Below are some of the key projects:\n\nSDB, Shell Deepwater Borneo exploration project: Formation evaluation for multiple wells for exploration well targets in the A, CA1 and CA2 blocks, offshore Borneo.\n\nAbadi project: Abadi field is a large offshore gas condensate green field in Indonesia. Below are some of the key contributions during the Abadi field development:\n\u2022\tSaturation Height function (SHF) modelling: Modelled the SHF for Abadi field using the SCAL data of all wells which was used in static and dynamic models after upscaling. Collaborated with the CCOE team to predict the correct value for Interfacial tension as a SHF input using molecular simulations. \n\u2022\tQuanti elan modelling: Completed the quanti elan modelling for the Abadi field and validated the operator\u2019s porosity model. The work helped to understand the volumetrics difference between Shell and operator.\n\u2022\tUncertainty analysis: Completed the uncertainty analysis on petrophysical parameters which was an input for the static modelling and different subsurface realizations.\n\u2022\tProperties upscaling: Upscaled the porosity, permeability, SHF in order to use them further for static modeling.\n\u2022\tPetrophysical properties cutoffs: Refined the PP properties cutoffs for defining net sand which resulted in two subsurface models (GIIP model & Flow model) thus leading to better quantification of in-place & UR volumes.\n\u2022\tFacies modelling: Created electrofacies for facies modelling of Abadi field to capture the reservoir heterogeneity and its impact on production profile.",
