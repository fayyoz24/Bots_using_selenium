    "summary": "Accomplished Electrical Engineer with an MSc degree in Renewable Energies. I believe in the transformative power of sustainable human development: vital to face the daunting challenges of the 21st century and ensure future human life on our planet. \n\nstarted my career in 2006 as a communication engineer, working in mobile communication projects , I have proven myself as a fast learner which allowed to grow gradually in my career, from a field engineer to project manager. I oversaw projects in telecom and solar energy domain resulted in delivering a high quality work, respecting client deadlines, during my work in Watansrerve in the fiber optics I successfully raised the work volume by 25%, thus achieving a remarkable higher profit reaching 1.5 M$ in 2015.\n\nDriven with passion toward environment and green energy, I decided to shift my career into renewable energy sector, I had the chance to supervise and manage the installation of 4 solar power stations in Algeria with a total capacity of 80MW , during these projects I managed 10 installation teams of a total of 60 technicians, and several subcontractors.\n\nAt the moment I am designing solar PV power stations, with capacitiea ranging from 3MW to 9MW. as lead design engineering i have completed the design of 5  projects with a total capacity of 30 MW,. covering not only solar design, but also Data and auxiliary systems such as CCTV and SCADA, in addition to civil, and different calculations  ( earthing , Amapacity , voltage drop, losses , FO Attenuation, shading, string calculation, ...... etc.) and simulations using PVSyst , SolarGIS, JVSG, Cisco Packet tracer, all simulations and calculations are in line with IEC, IEEE , NEC and EN standards.\n\nfields of experience:\n\n-Renewable Energies - Photovoltaics - solar design - solar energy \n-mobile communication m 2G/3G/4G \n-Microwave Equipment : PDH/ SDH , Analoge transmission.\n-Fiber optic transmission networks : Construction management , network design, right of way, civil works , cable posing and blowing ,  EPC.\n-CCTV :  Installation test and commissioning .\n-Railway Signaling equipment Installation test and commissioning : Bombardier transportation ( EBILock Interlocking , Wheel detector , ERTMS level 1)",
