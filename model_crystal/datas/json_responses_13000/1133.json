    "summary": "Currently employed with Trollope Mining services as a Jnr. Site Manager, previously employed as a underground geologist at Northam Platinum at their Zonderiende mine. Looking to gain more experience in the mining industry, to expand my scope and understanding of the industry\n\nI have a Bsc (hons) in Geology from NWU and conducted my honours on the alteration minerals of the Merensky reef and their relationship with the recovery of PGE's near the Pilanesberg Alkaline Complex. This study also presented me with the opportunity to speak at the 35th International Geological Congress held in Cape Town in 2015\n\nI spent 3 years honing my skills and expanding my empierce as an underground geologist at Northam Platinum mine. It was a  great transition period that matured me as a young adult and I gained more experience in the understanding of the different pothole facies of the Merensky and UG2 reefs. furthermore I was exposed to life as a underground mining employee in a mine that uses conventional mining methods.\n\nAt the moment in broadening my understanding in the opencast coal mining industry as Jnr. Site Manager. I'm currently learning all the ins and outs of running the production of a opencast mine and honing my skills as a manager. ",
