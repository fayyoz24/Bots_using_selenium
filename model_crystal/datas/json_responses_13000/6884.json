    "summary": "The first newscast I followed was about the historic meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader Gorbachev held in 1989 on the island of Malta. I was 11 years old. A couple of months later the Gulf War broke out and I started to collect all the articles from the Hungarian dailies about the operation and did so throughout the war. When I finished,  I even held a presentation to my class in primary school. My very first international affairs project. Since then, history and contemporary politics keep captivating my imagination, so joining the Foreign Service after graduation seemed to me a natural, or even inevitable step.\n\nInteract. Inform. Influence.\n\nI believe these are the three main cornerstones of my profession. However, whether implementing a development project in an African orphanage, preparing for and participating in international conferences or drafting bilateral policy documents, the basic tools remain the same. Research. Strategy. Execution.\n\nEXECUTIVE PROFILE. I am \u25aa an experienced international affairs professional regularly performing in multicultural environments with expansive expertise in governmental decision-making, strategy and policy planning, project and programme management as well as international organizations \u25aa adept at strategic analysis and leadership of teams to deliver outcomes geared to priorities \u25aa able to communicate difficult messages with confidence and credibility to the most senior internal leaders and external stakeholders \u25aa capable of prioritizing competing demands and managing complexity",
