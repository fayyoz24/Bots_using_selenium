It seems I was one of them during the first MDF course I attended.\n\nWorking for 15 years in a variety of development projects - often focusing on vocational training and business development - as advisor, manager and portfolio manager, made me to advocate that cultural peculiarities had to be taken profoundly into account into any development intervention. MDF appreciates authenticity and inquiring minds and invited me to work for them.\n\nI developed a professional understanding of cross-cultural issues, and the value and limits of a wide variety of tools and approaches towards the development of management of development organizations. \n\nIn 1977 I finished my studies in electronics, and after a brief period as a researcher with Philips I became manager of a village polytechnic in the slums of Nairobi, the beginning of a long career in development work. In 1993 I started a mango-farm in Sri Lanka, and in 2002 received a PhD after writing a thesis about the history of local public administration in the South of Holland since the Middle Ages till modern times.\n\nFor MDF I gave all main courses, specializing in Institutional development and Organizational Strengthening. Since September 2001 I worked for long periods as a capacity builder and country representative in post-conflict nations (Afghanistan and Sudan), thriving in this brave new world in which quality, speed and quick understanding of complex situations count.",
