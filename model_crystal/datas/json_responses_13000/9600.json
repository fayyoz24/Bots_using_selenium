    "summary": "Experienced Environmental and Social Officer with a demonstrated history of working in the banking industry.  Strong operations professional skilled in Sustainable Development, E&S and Human Rights Risk identification and management, operationalizing IFC Performance Standards. As part of my banking experience, I have worked in a wide range of sectors from infrastructure clients such as mines and ports to financial institutions, factories, agriculture plantations, and renewable and non-renewable projects thus dealing with various E&S challenges that arise from different sectors. I have also been in the forefront of many banking corporate initiatives and policies that have shaped the Dutch Development Bank\u2019s investment strategy. These initiative range from the development of the inclusive pillar foundations that currently guide FMO\u2019s inclusive business (including the assessment criteria and the business case for inclusive business); as well as more recently the development of Human Right\u2019s risk integration into FMOs investment process and thinking.
