    "summary": "An enthusiastic and highly motivated Organismal Biology graduate from Scripps College pursuing a Master's degree in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience, with specialisation in Drug Development and Neurohealth. Has obtained relevant research competencies in molecular biology and analytical chemistry laboratory techniques from both my academic and professional experiences. Additionally, I have a proven ability to problem solve, communicate effectively and produce high-quality work \u2013 particularly indicated by my work at Steep Hill Labs. I am seeking to both solidify my current research skills and expand them to eventually use the knowledge to assist in building the pharmaceutical industry in my country of Botswana. Research interests include developing neurotropic drugs using plants utilised in traditional medicine of Southern Africa and the use of psychedelics to treat psychiatric disorders.",
