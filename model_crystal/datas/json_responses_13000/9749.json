    "summary": "Opinion on me from one of my Former Manager: \n\n\"Sudipta used to be part of my team. As his direct manager I recommend him because of his skills and attitude: always aiming to exceed his goals.\nAt Alfa Laval I experienced Sudipta as a pro-active project manager. Full of energy and aiming for the best for all stakeholders. Full focus on project milestones, quality and budget.\nSudipta will add value in an international environment within larger, complex organizations. He has clear and professional communication skills.\nBeside the professional attitude Sudipta is a good team player too and above all he is a nice colleague.\u201d\n\nWho I am: \n\nA highly motivated and committed Industrial Engineer with a proven ability to effectively evaluate, organize and prioritize work within an overall project schedule.\n\nI polished my Master's degree in Quality and Operations Management program at the Chalmers University of Technology. After pursuing my Master's degree, I started working at Alfa Laval, Nijmegen, and later at Foot Locker EMEA as a Senior Coordinator. Currently, I am working as an EMDC Manufacturing Coordinator at Glory.  \n\nMy Master thesis was done at \"SKF Group\" on the topic titled \"Supply Chain Transparency for SKF Group Purchasing\" where I believe I showed my potential based on my theoretical knowledge, training and previous experience.\n\nOne of the things that I enjoy most about engineering is the ever-evolving role of a problem solver. I am all about making the \u201cwhat if's\u201d become the \u201cwhy not's\u201d. For enriching my professional development, I have accomplished & added in my bucket list \"SIX SIGMA Black Belt PROJECT\" which was done in ESSITY (former SCA). Besides, I was awarded Google Developers Challenge Scholarship opportunity for the Front-End Web Developer track. Additionally, I have gathered experience of working with the Low/No code platform and the application used is Betty Blocks. \n\nAs a part of the extra-curriculum activity, I was engaged as a project member of \"Diversity in European Volunteering\" project which was hosted by \"Young European Federalists\".\n\nPlease feel free to contact me on +31 618 8452 37 or email me at diptosaha4@gmail.com, for any kind of queries. \n\nThank you so much for your valuable time!",
