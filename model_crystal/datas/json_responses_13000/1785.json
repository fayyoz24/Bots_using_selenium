I'm also responsible for the development and execution of marketing campaigns.\n \nCoaching student teams through their entrepreneurial adventures at Socionext was a very inspirational experience. The goal of the Socionext teams is to raise money for talented students in South Africa. In this challenge the teams learn about entrepreneurship, business theories, creative thinking and networking. My part in helping them as a coach was to help teams achieve their goals by sharing my experiences as an entrepreneur.",
