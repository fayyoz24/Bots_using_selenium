    "summary": "Currently working as Country Director and shareholder, running the pancake and pastry dough business in the United Kingdom with my team for Cerelia, the leading European manufacturer in this area. In the UK we operate as BakeAway, serving most UK retailers with chilled pastry dough and/or chilled and ambient ready made pancakes. Following massive growth we have built a new state of the art manufacturing base in the UK for pastry dough products. We source our pancakes from our bakeries in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the UK we predominantly partner up with our customers for strong own label propositions driving category growth, but also run a branded pancake operation (www.abra-ca-debora.co.uk). \n\nBesides this I have acted over the last couple of years as an entrepreneur, successfully supporting businesses in different industries to achieve new business growth and in the meantime founded a new company, Boers&Boers with my brother (www.boersenboers.nl), a very successful initiative with a website and store, helping our customers to create a unique Christmas dinner experience at home. \n\nSince recently I'm also involved in a venture for premium quality (organic) sour dough bread for instore bakery and also a part-baked consumer proposition. We have now successfully fast tracked and entered the UK market (in Tesco!), on behalf of the NL based company Pandriks with the brand SlooOW: www.slooow.co.uk\n\nKey words describing my professional journey as a business leader are innovative, creative and entrepreneurial, with a strong grasp of business fundamentals and how to build relevant sales networks. Built an international track record in fast moving consumer goods and medical devices as business executive in blue chip and entrepreneurial companies. Developed and implemented growth strategies that delivered short term results and created longer term company value. \n\nAlong the same lines I\u2019m always interested in new business opportunities and growth initiatives. In this context I mostly partner and work with private or private equity funded companies and ventures, finding new avenues for growth and adding company value.",

Top quality and animal welfare are at the core of what they and we do, as recognised by Wakker Dier, an animal rights organisation in the Netherlands. \n\nSince then we have expanded our range to cater for different alternatives to the courses of a perfect dinner, ranging from beautiful hams, to dessert cheeses, Scottish salmon and even an original Christmas pudding, all from our other supplier Dukeshill, also purveyor to her Majesty the Queen! In 2019 we have added a venison option, wild, from Scotland and supplied to us by the expert, Nigel Sampson (Holme Farmed Venison). \n\nWe are an online business with home deliveries through a personalised dedicated service, although it's possible to pick up your order at a central point in the Netherlands as well. Boers&Boers is now an established, successful business, but most of all very rewarding, because there is nothing like reading the warm and enthusiastic reviews and emails of customers thanking us for taking away the stress of preparing the perfect dinner and make it an unforgettable delicious and lovely experience.",
