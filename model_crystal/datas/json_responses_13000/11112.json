In a time of television user packages, it brings obsolete antennas back to life. The radio frequency is still out there, and sometimes the orchestra gets lucky and catches a glimpse of its scratchy hum. TO are absolutely fascinated by the development of the newest gadgets, not for their intended purpose, but to explore their potential to produce the humming, glissandos and squeaks of the theremin and electromagnetic pulses. DIY theremins are unpredictable and basic. Nevertheless, they offer a multitude of sounds if they are connected to the most unexpected antennas, from conductive ink to umbrellas, wire ducklings, air tubes, flowers, and scrap metal. TO is combined by participants of TEREMINI in TEREMIDI physical interface workshop, which took place on Ljudmila in May 2011, under the mentorship of Borut Savski, who after a while also joined the Orchestra.\n\n",

The tracks' slowly fluctuating dynamics aims to create an open sound space, underpinned by a foundation that unites topical themes with a clear methodology. The album is based on selected premises of the string theory and the complexity of quantum dynamics, while introducing also certain other levels of music composition alongside this scientific layer: the mechanics of DIY electronics, telling stories of a grim vision of the exploitative Anthropocene, of the apocalypse and how to confront it, and the meaning of magic rituals. With her noise for strings, beepblip taps into the political dimension of sound, daring to ask not only who is listening but also what is it that we do not listen to. Her compositions walk the thin line between cultural appropriation and an emotional response to segregation and colonial tendencies around the world, which are as present today as they were a hundred years ago.",
