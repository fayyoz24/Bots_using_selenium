    "summary": "- I create narratives based on the people data I collect and analyse. With the power of story, I help decisions get more buy-in and a sense of shared goals.\n- I believe in process. I build effective processes that make us reach our aims smoothly and prioritise more impactful things. \n- I am a problem solver by nature; I am a \u2018go-to\u2019 person to deliver the outcomes and respond to multiple stakeholders' necessities immediately.\n- I have grown up as a professional in diverse, international, and dynamic environments, at both governmental and non-governmental organizations, in both academia and corporate sectors. And of course, I'm still growing day by day.\n\nAt the workplace, I feel energised and rewarded when: \n1) exploring multiple perspectives and achieving mutually agreeable solutions; \n2) contributing to people's learning journeys, and; \n3) making people feel included, welcome, and respected. \n\nLast but not least, I am an avid home cook who genuinely appreciates the time and effort spent in cooking and loves the heartwarming experience of sharing.
