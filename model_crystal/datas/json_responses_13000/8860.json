    "summary": "I am currently travelling around Europe until the end of August, after which I will be settling in Amsterdam, and seeking a Project Management role within the engineering and infrastructure industry. \n\nBefore travel, I was previously an Assistant Project Manager at Beca, in Wellington, New Zealand. I have experience in managing commercial construction and infrastructure projects in fast moving and technical environments. I am skilled in Microsoft Office, Communication, Construction, Management, and Leadership.\n\nI graduated from Victoria University of Wellington in 2019, with a Bachelor of Building Science degree, with a major in Project Management and Sustainable Engineering Systems. I am an avid traveller, and have a love for learning, both of which combined well during my study abroad year at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. \n\nThroughout my degree and my previous experience, I have gained a passion for sustainability in the industry and how the face of this is changing to address our current issues. I am passionate about the way in which organisations have the potential to positively impact society, and I'm not afraid to test out new ideas and solutions. I hope that in my future role I can bring innovative ideas forward to create change.",
