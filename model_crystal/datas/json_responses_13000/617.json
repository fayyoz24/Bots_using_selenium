    "summary": "Psychologist with 15+ years of experience in the (deep)tech and startup/scale-up scene in the Netherlands and the United States. In 2023, I want to become the best presenter I can be, as well as build my mediation practice. \n\nPlease feel absolutely welcome to reach out to me if you need a host for your event, or would like help resolving a conflict.\n\nLonger summary:\nAfter graduating at the end of 2011, I lived in the US for 3 years and led the expansion of Dutch company Dopper from San Francisco. When returning to the Netherlands at the end of 2015,  I worked in and around the Dutch startup scene in all kinds of capacities as an entrepreneurial project leader, founder or managing director. \n\nI led many projects from A to Z, organised small intimate gathering as well as large international events with hundreds of people. Initiated campaigns and initiatives to motivate groups of people to change their behaviors, like the Buy Nothing New-Month and 'Tevredenlander'. I would say I'm entrepreneurial in the sense that I think like an entrepreneur, am used to going the extra mile, and then some, and know I have the end-responsibility for results. This makes others able to relax:)\n\nRight now, my focus lies on 3 things:\n\u2192 Moderating and hosting events\n\u2192 Mediation\n\u2192 Organizational- and family constellations.\n\nSo excited about hosting and moderating events on all kinds of topics, but often related to tech, deeptech, startups, investing, international relations, geopolitics. Graduated as a psychologist and a certified mediator, where I help client resolve conflicts. Every two months, I organize an afternoon of constellations in Amsterdam.\n\nIf you'd like to reach me, you can do so via \ud83d\udce7 irenerompa@gmail.com or \n\ud83d\udcde +316 28 25 28 79.

If these 25 neighbours form a co-op and own 5 cars together, they each pay a lot less money but have access to newer vehicles and, if they choose to, a variety of vehicles. The unused 20 cars would leave their street instantly. Using a commercial carsharing service for commuting to work is unaffordable at this point; commuting to work when you're part of a co-op costs much less than owning your own car.\n\nA cooperative, a 'co-op, is a legal entity that is owned and operated by and for the benefit of its members. The local co-op can buy or lease its own vehicles, based on the wishes and usage of its members. Members decide themselves how many and what type of vehicles to buy or lease. DEEL does not own any vehicles and in no way makes money by the usage of local co-op members, we merely facilitate them in their process. \n\nAmong other things, our work consists of\n\u25b9 helping residents decipher & facilitate the process of creating a local coop\n\u25b9 offering all necessary documentation needed to start\n\u25b9 analysing their current behaviour which helps them choose their number and type of vehicles\n\u25b9 offering a cost-calculation model with which to share costs between members \n\u25b9 negotiating on their behalf with municipalities and arrange for fixed parking spots, charging stations \u00e1nd the opportunity to transform their street or neighbourhood if the coop shows they need less parking spots (which is almost always the case)\n\nResidents in The Hague that choose to form a local co-op are guaranteed of fixed parking spots for their vehicles as well as the opportunity to transform their street.\n\nPlease see our website for more information and contact me directly via irene@wijzijndeel.nl",

The \"Buy Nothing New Maand\" is one month in which people pledge to discover what they already have & what the fun alternatives to buying new things are. \n\nSwop, give-away, re-use, repair, rent, create & buy second hand. Why? Because it is fun, makes you more creative, because it'll save you money (that you can then spend on a fun experience), because we keep using up finite resources to make new things even though there are already so many great things out there, and because buying a lot of new things automatically creates unnecessary waste. \nBut even more so, because we seem to have lost a sense of the real value in our \"stuff\"- in other words, tend to keep buying 'things we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't like'.\n\nWe would love for this month to stimulate the creation of a more circular economy and make us re-assess the value of things so that we buy stuff that actually makes us very happy :) \nWe organize the Buy Nothing New Challenge in October of each year, during which thousands of people participate. The month has received great media attention online, in local and national newspapers, on television and radio - see www.buynothingnew.nl (we're currently relaunching the website for 2021)",

Our goal is for The Netherlands to be th\u00e9 startup hub in Europe.\n\nActivities range from \n* organizing the \"Silicon Valley Fundamentals\" - my latest bog on our 1st event: http://dutchbasecamp.org/blog-get-ready/\n* organizing \"startup bootcamps\" for Dutch startups to Silicon Valley/New York and Boston, to strengthen and inspire them, validate their business model and test whether an international expansion is for them; \n* organizing \"Executive bootcamps\" for Dutch corporates to Silicon Valley to introduce them to the latest innovations by US startups that'll bring them a competitive advantage; \n* creating 'lead partners' for foreign startups that want to locate their operations in The Netherlands, providing them with a pool of corporates that'll act as more than just their launching customers but really become their p\u00e1rtner, in order to help them enter the Dutch market successfully; \n* coordinating a Partners in International Business (PIB) application for Dutch accelerators and incubators to give them a better, solid access into Silicon Valley which will benefit both their portfolio startups as well as their own organization (because of their improved appeal to foreign startups that seek to enter the US market via The Netherlands); \n* organizing intensive \"explore camps\" for Dutch startups that decide to expand the The Unites States and provide them with a soft landing during the first three months through connections & introductions to mentors and a range of qualified partners.\n\nIn summary, we focus on the following 3 things:\n- Provide a soft-landing for Dutch start-ups that expand to the United States\n- Help fast-growing US companies choose The Netherlands as their hub for expansion into Europe\n- Bring the \"Silicon Valley mindset\" of serial entrepreneurship to the Dutch start-up ecosystem",
