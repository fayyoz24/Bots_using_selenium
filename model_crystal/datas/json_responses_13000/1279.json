Interpretation of offshore 3-dimensional seismic dataset over an existing and a potential gas field which is a vital part of an integrated study for the Shell operating unit in Sarawak, designed to result in a development plan for the potential field.\nObjective: To better understand the causes of the poor-quality seismic data over the potential gas fields\n\u2022  Horizon picking and mapping using Seisworks\n\u2022  Generate synthetic seismic traces\n\nReservoir Geology team:\nForward seismic modeling using outcrop analogues to evaluate the level of reservoir architecture that can be extracted from seismic datasets that are regularly used to constrain 3-dimensional reservoir models.\nObjective: Investigated at which seismic frequencies various scales of stratal geometries, facies variability and rock properties (water-filled or gas-filled) can be imaged.\n\u2022  Created synthetic seismic models of a mixed aeolian, sabkha to playa lake succession as might be found in the Rotliegend reservoir of the Southern North Sea using an analogous outcrop from Schnebly Hill Formation, Arizona, USA. Results are reported via internal web-based knowledge management systems to optimize access throughout the Shell Group.\n\u2022  Generated synthetic seismic models of a deltaic to shallow marine succession from the Book Cliffs Formation, Utah, USA. This setting is an excellent analogue for the Jurassic Brent Group of the North Sea and the Nigerian delta.",
