    "summary": "My name is Carla Meijsen and I love to knit. Since I learned to knit when I was seven years old, the technique of knitting intrigued and inspired me. What began as a mere hobby, soon became hobby and work. Since then it has only gotten better and more interesting and fulfilling. Knitting plays an increasing central role in my life. Not a day without knitting...\n\nI'm the owner of the company The Dutch Knitters that has been founded in January 2009. In the capacity of The Dutch Knitters I give classes in The Netherlands and abroad. The course Advanced Knitting (Het Betere Breiwerk), a serious 8-lesson course for advanced knitters is given at least twice a year in Amsterdam and/or Utrecht or otherwise organized at home and abroad (Belgium). In 2017 the follow-up course Het Hogere Breiwerk will start.\n\nOn Thursday I work at the best yarn shop in the Netherlands de Afstap in Amsterdam.\n\nI'm trained as Textile Arts teacher. I successfully completed Level I (2008) and Level II (2011) and I'm working on final Level III of The Knitting Guild of America\u2019s Master Knitting Program to become Master Knitter.\n\nFrom 2010 I made I make study trips with my knitting friends to including Estonia, Sweden, Latvia, Norway and England (Shetland) to participate in knitting courses and to study the local knitting culture.\n\nOn 24 October 2014 I published Lekker Warm! Twijnend Breien / So Warm! \u2013 Twined Knitting, the first bilingual book (English and Dutch) on twined knitting.\n\nIn October 2011 The Dutch Knitters published their first book Warm Hands \u2013 Estonian Mittens and Wrist Warmers. The book contains designs for eleven mittens and two wrist warmers.\n\nIn 2006 en 2007 The Dutch Knitters organised The Dutch Stitch 'n Bitch-Dag in the Van Nelle Fabriek in Rotterdam in cooperation with Second Events.\n\nYou can find me on Ravelry as CarlaM and Thedutchknitters and on Facebook as Carla and Thedutchknitters.",
