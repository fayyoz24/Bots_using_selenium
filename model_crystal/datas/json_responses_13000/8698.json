Several thousand students from over 130 countries simulated for four days the work of the United Nations. Thanks to the own initiative of my fellow colleagues and me, the University of Twente sent us as their first delegation, representing the delegation of Laos. Before the actual start of the conference we had the pleasure to meet with the ambassador of Laos in New York, to ask questions on Laos\u2019 position regarding the conference topics. Together with a fellow colleague I joined the General Assembly Committee 3, which discussed how to Improve the Coordination in Humanitarian Response to Natural Disasters and Other Emergencies. In the end of the conference a great coalition of many delegations, including me and my delegation proposed the resolution GA3/1/7, whhich was adopted with 107 votes in favour, 9 votes against and 27 abstaintions. The whole resolution can be found here: https://www.nmun.org/assets/documents/conference-archives/new-york/2017/GA3_NMUNNY2017A.pdf",

Around 200 students simulated the legislative process of the European Union, by performing roles of parliamentarians and delegates of the EU member states. 2016 the topic of discussion was migration and the students debated the topic according to the interests of their allocated role. EuroSim is a great opportunity to experience the legislative process of the European Union live and learn to solve diplomatic challenges.",
