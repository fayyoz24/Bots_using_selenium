    "summary": "Goal-oriented, systematic, reliable & determined to achieve inspiration, with a passion for sport & society! \ud83c\udf1f \n\nBut how did this passion for sport and society start?\n\n\ud83e\udd38\ud83c\udffc Elite gymnastics was the starting point. I had a topsport-talent status during my high school career because I combined elite gymnastics with pre-university education (course profiles: Nature & Health / Nature & Technology, with English and German).\n\n\u26bd\ufe0f After receiving my pre-university education diploma, I enrolled in the bachelor Physical Education at Fontys School of Sport Studies. As part of this bachelor\u2019s degree, I did a minor in Culture & Global Leadership at Myongji University in Seoul, South Korea. For my thesis at Fontys School of Sport Studies, I developed a portfolio for high school student-athletes to teach them about important skills (such as self-regulation), that are required in a dual career of sport and study.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Currently I\u2019m studying an international Master of Arts in \u2018Olympic Studies\u2019 at German Sport University Cologne. The Olympic world is linked to the academic world in the master\u2019s programme, with seminars in sport history, ethics, sport governance, international relations, sport pedagogy, media/commercialization and research methodologies. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially supports the M.A. Olympic Studies programme. \n\n\u26a1\ufe0f I work on projects in a goal-oriented and systematic manner. At TeamNL centrum Zuid, I use my organisational skills by working in a systematic manner and by setting goals, as well as being reliable in carrying out my duties and responsibilities. In collaboration with partners, I organised a Topsport Conference, a conference on assisting athletes in selecting a study and education institution that is compatible with a sports career, and Talent Skills meetings. Talent Skills is an online education programme for student-athletes that I help to develop.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Other (inter)national projects I've worked on include organising a fundraiser for sport shoes for the organisation LifeZone Cape Town, organising an after-school sports project at an elementary school in collaboration with the organisation 'Nuth beweegt Nuth,' and assisting in the World Rafting Federation's Peace & Sport White Card Campaign. \n\n\u267e\ufe0f My elite sports career, educational career, and project management skills all contributed to who I am today: goal-oriented, systematic, reliable and determined. I will continue to work with enthusiasm and passion in the world of sport and society!",
