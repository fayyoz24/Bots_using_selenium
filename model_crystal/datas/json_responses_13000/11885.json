    "summary": "I was born into a theater family and have been working in the entertainment industry since I was old enough to hold a hammer. My specialty is in finding exciting ways to use technology to support the final product. My background in theatrical performances helps me turn a boring corporate event into a real show. My creative experience helps me make videos and presentations that deliver their message in a clear and fun way. And my technical knowledge and managerial skills help me spot potential problems and solve them before they can disrupt anything.\n\nMy video portfolio can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.strikingly.com/wshaneoman",
