    "summary": "A driven individual who is thirsty for knowledge and believes that learning has no limits. For that reason I did two emphasis in business and continued my graduate degree. I was able to do so with two full scholarships ( MEPI Tomorrow\u2019s leaders scholarship for my Bachelors and the Swedish Institute for future Leaders\u2019 scholarship for my Masters). It did not stop there of course, I continued my learning by attending courses and conferences.\n\nI consider myself to be very dynamic and adaptive to the environment I am in. As you can see I am a Jordanian citizen who lived in Lebanon for four years, 3 months in the United States, a year in Sweden and now I live in Luxembourg. I have been able to adapt to such different cultures and enrich my life journey with memorable and life changing experiences.\n\nWhen it comes to my professional life and career I was admitted to join one of the most prestigious graduate programs in Jordan with Arab Bank PLC in 2015. I have been able to prove myself with my hard work thus I was given the chance to improve processes, handling individual and group projects, conducting meetings and providing out of the box solutions.\nIn 2018, I had the privilege to join the number one banking software provider in the world, Temenos, for the Sales Academy program in Luxembourg. Then went back to Dubai to support the MEA region as an inside sales executive. After that I had the privilege to change my career path into a pre sales consultant to gain more functional knowledge.\nIn 2020, I joined Mambu in Amsterdam, netherlands as a pre sales consultant/solution engineer! \n\nInterested in:#Financial Services FS, banking sector, Consumer Analysis and market research, data analysis, consulting, entrepreneurship, startups, digital banking, global companies, big data, analytics, banking software\n\nFluent in English and Arabic",
