    "summary": "I grew up in Downey, California. After graduating from Downey High School, I attended the California State University of Long Beach (CSULB) where I was a Presidential Scholar. While at CSULB, I majored in chemistry and minored in mathematics. I performed research in organic chemistry with Dr. Kensaku Nakayama and in physical chemistry with Dr. Brian McClain. After graduating from CSULB (summa cum laude) in 2007 I attended graduate school at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\nAt UCLA, I joined the group of Dr. Benjamin Schwartz where I investigated the structural properties of the hydrated electron using mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulations. While at UCLA I also acted as a teaching assistant for many quarters, eventually earning the Hanson-Dow Excellence in Teaching Award in 2009. I participated in the NSF GK-12 program where I acted as a resident scientist for local high schools from 2010-2011. I completed my dissertation in 2014.\n\nAfter obtaining my Ph.D., I was hired as a visiting-assistant professor at Sonoma State University from 2014-2015. There I worked on developing a Foundational Level General Science Waiver. In 2015 I lectured at Loyola Marymount University and participated in the Center for Teaching Excellence Credential Program.\n\nI am an Associate Adjunct Professor at UCLA, where I teach general and organic chemistry. My work at UCLA also includes chemical education research conducted under the advisement of Dr. Arlene Russell. One of the major projects is focused on the development and implementation of general chemistry courses designed to increase retention amongst students at risk of leaving the STEM field. Another project includes investigating specific interventions in the laboratory in order to increase student accuracy and precision with glassware.\n\nMy husband was offered work in the Netherlands, so I am currently on leave from UCLA. My hope is that I can use the next few years to further develop my skills as an educator and researcher.",
