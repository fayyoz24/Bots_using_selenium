    "summary": "I study and teach water allocation policies and practices, focusing on questions of equity and justice. I am interested in different institutional and technical modalities for allocating water and regulating water flows, and the different ways to understand or legitimize these. I favour an interdisciplinary approach, seeing water allocation as the outcome of interactions between nature, technologies and society. The relation between power and water is central in my work, with explicit attention to gender. My current research looks at re-allocations of water from agriculture and rural areas to cities and industries: how do these re-allocations happen, with what effects, and how are they legitimized in policies and knowledge? I for instance studied how the introduction of supposedly water efficient technologies (drip irrigation) goes accompanied with, and causes, changes in water tenure relations that favour some people more than others.
