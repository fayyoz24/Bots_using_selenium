We provided a complete overview of conferences organised by topic and location. Conference organisers could upload their events free of charge and delegates were able to book online or make a bid for a seat at a conference and name the price they were willing to pay for a seat. This was a unique new business concept in the conference industry at the time.\n\nThe second phase of development started in 2009 after a second round of investment, when we started providing white label booking & bidding functionality to large companies and corporate travel companies. This provided these companies with a convenient and secure booking system for their staff and Conference Bay with additional volume and therefore even better discounts for our customers.\n\nConference Bay was ultimately financially not successful enough to continue and we decided to pay our investors (including the Singapore Government) the remaining funds back and focus our efforts completely on AccelerAsia.",
