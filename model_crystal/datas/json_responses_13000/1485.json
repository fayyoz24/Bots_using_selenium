    "summary": "Originally I am from the \u2018States, specifically from Michigan, but I came to Amsterdam as a student in the \u201870s and never seriously considered moving back for good. I met my husband at the introductory lecture of our professor.  In Amsterdam I studied South and Southeast Asian history and archeology focusing on the Khmer Empire. The study I completed was in both Ancient and modern history of SEAsia from the University of Leiden.\nThere was no work in the \u201880s for an inexperienced archeologist, so I decided to train as an EFL teacher of adults, getting an RSA- TEFL diploma in 1985.  Through the eighties and nineties we travelled and worked in various countries including a stint in the PRC (just after Tianamien) teaching future teachers of English at a \u2018third rate\u2019 teachers\u2019 college in Xian. Also I worked at the language centre of a university in Hong Kong and as lecturer of academic writing in a small university in the north of Lebanon.\nTeaching adults of all professions from Cape Verdean sailors in Rotterdam to Deutsche Bank staff in Dusseldorf ensured that I was flexible both in teaching an in design of learning trajectories in non-academic settings. Somewhere in all this time, I started doing a Masters in Adult Education from the OUUK while working full time. This was triggered by a growing fascination with the various ways that people learn.\nMore and more I wanted to understand how to design and deliver learning opportunities for adults. This was the core aim of research carried out in the later years of my working life.\nSince retiring as a teacher/lecturer of mostly academic English at polytechs in the North of the Netherlands my husband, Lucas, and I have settled in a quite village in the extreme southeast of the country in Limburg.",
