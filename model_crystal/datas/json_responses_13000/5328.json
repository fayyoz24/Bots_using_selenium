    "summary": "After graduating as a physician in 1985 at the Erasmus University Rotterdam I worked from 1986-1990 with Doctors without Borders (MSF) in Peru, Belize and Rumania. After a Public Health degree in 1991 I worked as a health advisor with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) from 1992-1995 in Nicaragua and from 1995-1998 in Colombia.  \nFrom 1998-2010 I worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the department for International Development Cooperation (DGIS) where I was responsible for international policy development on prevention and control of malaria and tuberculosis as well as for biomedical research on tropical diseases, access to drugs, and the development of new drugs, diagnostics and vaccines for Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria through public-private partnerships. \nFrom 2003-2005 I studied Business Administration at the Erasmus University Rotterdam receiving a master degree with a thesis on dynamics of public-private partnerships. \nIn 2008 I founded Euvadis work as an independent consultant providing institutional support to public-private partnerships for the development of health technologies against neglected diseases. \nSpecialties: PHC, Malaria and TB control, international policy development for public health and R&D, (inter)governmental collaboration and interaction with donors, development of public-private partnerships, brokering between representatives and organization from public and private sectors, strategy and communication development.\nIn  order to keep my registration as a medical doctor I am currently working 3 days per week as a physician in ambulatory care for Drug Dependance at Brijder in Leiden.",
