    "summary": "Last spring, I graduated with my bachelors in mechanical engineering and I am now seeking a job that allows me to use the technical skills cultivated in my degree as well as the creative side of me that is not as strongly used in traditional engineering positions. \n\nI have always enjoyed physics and problem solving, but I also love getting my hands on things and tinkering. I was an avid metal worker in high school, a 3D printing enthusiast in university, and have currently been bit by the sewing bug. I find creating something from nothing and testing new design ideas fulfilling and exciting.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out where these sides of artsy and engineering could merge until I interned at a small aerospace engineering firm where the lead engineer gave me the opportunity to work on the design of a new helicopter piece from start to finish. I modelled it in Solidworks, creating sleek curves and pleasing design features. Then I used my knowledge of deformable solids to calculate and determine what material would meet the job specifications. During the whole process, I iterated on the design based off communications with manufacturers and the client to make sure everyone was pleased and the cost was reduced without compromising quality. Not only did I learn so much about the design process through this experience, but I realized design is what I like to do and where I really excel.  \n\nI currently live in Vancouver, Canada, but am aiming to relocate as needed to work among industry-leading companies, engineers, and designers.",
