    "summary": "I am a native English speaker (British), translator (Dutch to English) and English language coach. With a business background in England and the Netherlands, and with a passion for language, my translations are creative, professional, accurate and reliable. I also edit or correct English text written by non-native speakers. \n \nClients include: commercial, financial, marketing and media companies; universities, hospitals and church organizations; project developers, academics and private individuals.\n\nProjects have been various, including: translating/editing financial, environmental, philosophical, educational, religious and medical books, articles and manuals; theses; websites and commercial documentation.  \n\nThe language training I give is one-on-one (also In-house) and focuses on the client\u2019s specific needs, such as: Increasing Vocabulary; Improving Grammar; Perfecting Pronunciation; Building Confidence; Presentation Coaching.\n\nBecause I value personal contact with my clients, and because I believe client-translator collaboration is not only desirable but essential to the success of the end product, I work independently, not through translation agencies.\n\nSpecialties: My speciality is the correct and natural use of the English language.",
