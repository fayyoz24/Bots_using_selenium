    "summary": "Nico Bruining, PhD, FESC, began his career in 1985 at the Thoraxcenter (Department of Cardiology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), working in the cathlab with pioneers in interventional cardiology, including Prof. P.W. Serruys and Prof. P.J. de Feyter. In 1993, he joined the Department of Experimental and Clinical Information Processing (KEI) at the Thoraxcenter, where he currently serves as the head of the department. Since mid-2020, he has also been the inaugural Editor-In-Chief (EiC) of the European Heart Journal \u2013 Digital Health (EHJ DH).\n\nWith a degree in Technical Computer Sciences, Nico had a pioneering role in the development of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, which culminated in his 1998 PhD thesis, \"Quantitative 3D Echocardiography of the Heart and the Coronary Vessels,\" under the supervision of Prof. J.R.T.C Roelandt. Since then, he has been evaluating new therapies within interventional cardiology using novel technologies, such as the first-in-man studies on drug-eluting stents and bioresorbable scaffolds using advanced coronary artery imaging with intracoronary imaging methods and computed tomography, by novel analysis methods with advanced computational methods. His current focus is on the broad field of Digital Health, which brings together clinical and technical innovations improving cardiovascular care developed in-house or in collaboration with industry. Some of his ongoing projects include general data registration, patient monitoring in-hospital and remotely, cardiovascular imaging, artificial intelligence, and seamless integration of computer-assisted analysis methods.\n\nNico is actively involved in international activities, in addition to serving as the EiC of the EHJ DH. He is the vice-chair of the ESC\u2019s Digital Health Committee, the topic coordinator Digital Health for the congress program committee, and nucleus member of the CardioVascular Round Table. He previously chaired the ESC working group of Computers in Cardiology, and he also serves as the eCardiology editor of EuroIntervention and is the Specialty editor Digital Health for the European Heart Journal. Nico is a Fellow of the ESC and a member of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI).",
