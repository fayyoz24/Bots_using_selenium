It is a sustainable, affordable and above all trendy alternative to the car and public transport. Experiments in new cycling facilities are underway everywhere. Cycle Infrastructure includes international examples, interviews with the makers of prominent cycling routes and a glimpse at future innovations.\nThe possibilities that cycling offers for the spatial quality and the liveability of cities are enormous, but have not been fully exploited. Cycle Infrastructure is an inspiring handbook for anyone interested in the development, design and promotion of high-quality cycling routes. The goal is to activate the full potential of cycling for the (urban) landscape and to consider cycling infrastructure as an integral design challenge instead of purely an issue of traffic engineering. Stefan Bendiks and Agla\u00e9e Degros are the founders of Artgineering, a practice for research and design on the boundary between urban planning and infrastructure.",

With 2,000 hectares of new land to be reclaimed from the sea, the construction of Maasvlakte 2 is one of the largest infrastructure projects in recent years. Through Jongerius\u2019s eyes, however, it is above all an alien landscape and a world of amazement and expectation.\nMarie-Jos\u00e9 Jongerius (b. 1970, De Bilt) studied photography at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague and with Rineke Dijkstra. She worked with Dana Lixenberg and has exhibited work at the Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam, the ADC Gallery in New York and the Riverside Art Museum in Los Angeles. In addition to autonomous work Jongerius has worked for The New York Times Magazine, ELLE and Vogue.",

He proved himself to be a critical member of the international avant-garde, with his architectural designs and theoretical writings. As an architect, his aim was to play an influential role in the realization of a new society with greater social equality and less private property. He designed several residential communes and he wrote fiery manifestos to achieve his aims.\n\nIn this first monograph about Robert van \u2019t Hoff, all his projects are described and richly illustrated; furthermore, Van \u2019t Hoff\u2019s most important writings have been included. Three authors analyse the development in his fascinating body of work, the underlying philosophy and the significance of this radical architect for whom art and revolution were so closely linked.",
