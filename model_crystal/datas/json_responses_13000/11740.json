I'm the bridge between consumers and products, it's me. \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nHello everyone, I'm Ana, a master's student diving into Economic & Consumer Psychology at Leiden University. Here's a little sneak peek into my journey so far:\n\n\ud83c\udf31 After graduating in Business Psychology, I delved into some fascinating subjects \u2014 like the links between our decision-making tendencies and our overall happiness. It amazes me what our minds can reveal!\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Jump to the present: Here I am in the lovely Netherlands, excited to embark on my MSc journey. And why consumer psychology? To put it simply, I'm drawn to understanding the daily choices we all make and the motivations behind them.\n\n\ud83c\udf31 My latest aspiration? Merging my understanding of CX with product management. With so much to learn, I can't wait to connect dots, innovate, and shape products that truly resonate with people.\n\nLet's connect!",
