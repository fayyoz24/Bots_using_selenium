    "summary": "I want to continuously learn and apply my knowledge and experience both in my job and in my life.\nI completely dedicate myself to the goals I want to pursue.\nEither attending theoretical courses, learning directly on the field or sharing experience with colleagues and people I get in touch with, I like widening my background, focusing on my skills and learning completely new and different topics in a proactive way. I strongly believe in continuous improvement, personal and professional, through experience sharing and communication with other people, being them involved or not in my daily life.\nI've got lots of interests in addition to professional ones, such as sport (in many ways), technology and reading: all of them contribute to the person I am, shaping character, ideas and body.",

My assignment consisted in providing support during the first phase of the project, through the preparation of method statements and a first draft of the environmental monitoring plan. My participation resulted from my involvement in tender phase, and the short duration from my other duties for different tenders.",

These are part of the development of the two offshore windfarms (OWF).\nMy role has been to manage the tender by leading the tender team, supporting and directing it through the various phases, to ensure that the BAFO (Best And Final Offer) was compliant and satisfactory.\nAfter successful shortlisting at BAFO, I have been involved in the full negotiations of the contract, taking place in the first half of 2020. This resulted in the award of the two contracts for Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B.\nMy involvement has continued with the handover to the Project Manager of all the relevant knowledge from the tender phase and can be considered completed with the transfer of responsibility from the Tender Team to the Project Team.",

Some of the main challenges of these projects include the landfall at Wijk Aan Zee, the deep burial in the nearshore section and the overall scheduling of the works.",
