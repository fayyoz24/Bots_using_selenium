    "summary": "Rasmus holds an MSc. in Chemistry as well as a BSc. in molecular biology; from Gothenburg University. He spent the last semester of the Master\u2019s degree program on an Erasmus exchange program to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in \u00c5s, Norway.\n\nRasmus is currently located in Amsterdam working at the Vrije Universitet with protein expression, and purification. \n\nDuring the master\u2019s degree project Rasmus crystalized purified membrane protein and tested the protein crystals at the Max IV beamline in Lund, Sweden. This project was presented at the 2019 SWEPROT/SBNet conference in T\u00e4llberg, Sweden. \n\nRasmus developed, throughout the Bachelor\u2019s- and Master\u2019s degree projects a holistic experience in the laboratory environment. He is proficient with multiple molecular biology and biochemistry techniques and methods. \n\nDuring the pandemic, Rasmus completed his master\u2019s degree and lead a group of three with the distribution of PPE and SARS-COV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests, to the municipals of southern Norway. Furthermore, Rasmus works part-time as an ice hockey official, currently working the highest league in the netherlands.  \n\nRasmus is a team player, and he enjoys challenges, efficiency and prospers in a fast-paced work environment. He\u2019s agreeable and dedicated to his work. He works well under pressure and remains optimistic about solving the problem at hand.",

Utilizing heterologous expression in E. coli, I successfully produced the proteins, which were then purified using the \u00c4KTA FPLC system. In order to enhance efficiency and achieve greater yields and purity while minimizing manual labor, I implemented improvements to the protein purification methodology.\n\nKey accomplishments include:\n\n- Employing the \u00c4KTA FPLC, I streamlined the purification process, employing three or more steps to obtain highly purified recombinant proteins.\n\n- To ensure the quality and integrity of the proteins, I conducted thorough verification of protein purity using LCMS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry).\n\n- Furthermore, I engaged in co-crystallization experiments by combining the protein of interest with cyclic and bicyclic peptides, leading to valuable insights and discoveries.\n\n- Demonstrating my problem-solving abilities, I successfully solved numerous crystal structures, contributing to a deeper understanding of the target proteins.",

In this study, the three-dimensional structure of the short isoform of aquaporin-1\n(AQP1_v1) from the bay barnacle B. improvisus was investigated through hanging drop\nvapour diffusion and X-ray crystallography. The B. improvisus aquaporin-1 was heterolo-\ngously produced in Pichia pastoris and isolated in a two-step purification, through anion-\nexchange- and size-exclusion chromatography. The crystalized purified membrane protein and tested the protein crystals at the Max IV beamline in Lund, Sweden. \n\nThis project was presented at the 2019 SWEPROT/SBNet in T\u00e4llberg, Sweden.\n\nFeel free to download the thesis and enjoy it a cold autumn evening with a warm cup of tea by the fire.",
