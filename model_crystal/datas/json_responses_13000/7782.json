    "summary": "Besides being an entrepreneur, I\u2019m an writer who lived, worked and travelled in Southern Africa for a long time. During my time in Africa, I\u2019ve lost my heart to the culture, the wilderness and wildlife, especially to the painted wolves. I write experience blogs for a renowned Dutch travel organisation, which offers luxury tailor-made trips to Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nThe African wild dog has a prominent role in my exciting debut novel \"Witkind\" (English title: Mlungu).\nI've been writing the story of Witkind since 2017, and in 2019 I asked a well-known Dutch publisher to give me his feedback regarding the story. \n\nThe feedback I received was: \n\n\u201c This story has potential.\nThe setting is good (the African bush). A strong woman who wants to get away with her family for a sabbatical to get rid of the hectic and stressful life in the Netherlands is recognizable.\nThe disappearance of their young daughter is the greatest nightmare that can befall a parent. The theme around the pack of painted wolves and the traditional African healers adds excitement and makes the story cultural and even more engaging. \"\n\nWell, the diamond is cut and ready to be presented to (international) publishers, organizations, and filmmakers.",
