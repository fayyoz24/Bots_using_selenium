    "summary": "Hey there, I'm Youssef.\n\nBorn and raised in Morocco, I was lucky enough to travel the world as a young child and spend many of my holidays in breathtaking countries and beautiful hotels. Feeling this strong connection to the hospitality industry, I moved to the amazing city of Amsterdam at the age of 18 to pursue a business degree in hospitality management at Hotelschool The Hague. During those 4 formative years, I learnt so much about that world, but more so about myself, what it meant to be an adult, found new passions and rekindled old ones. \n\nToday, as a 23-year-old who's extremely excited about the future, I've decided to immerse myself completely in the world of technology by diving deep into the world of programming & cryptocurrencies. Being entrepreneurially minded, my goal is to leverage my business and hospitality background with the necessary technical skills to launch something that has the potential to revolutionise the world. Yes, I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but I genuinely believe that we are all capable of great things. Truth is, not everyone is willing to put themselves out there, take risks, and sacrifice short-term gratification for long-term goals. That won't be me.\n\nKeep an eye out, I might just surprise you \ud83d\ude09",
