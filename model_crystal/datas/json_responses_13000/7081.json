    "summary": "As a business communication professional with over five years of experience in corporate communication and digital marketing, I specialise in helping organizations connect with their audiences in genuine and engaging ways. Whether it's crafting compelling content, managing social media campaigns, or developing integrated communication strategies, I thrive on delivering measurable results that drive business success.\n\nBut my interests don't stop at work! In my free time, you can find me on a football pitch or tennis court or curled up watching (usually bad) horror movies. And whenever there's live rock or blues music playing (Led Zeppelin rocks \ud83e\udd18), I'll be in the front row, cheering along. \n\nI'm always up for new challenges and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally, so feel free to reach out and connect!",
