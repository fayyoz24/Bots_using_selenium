                    "description": "Prof Guus A.M.S. van Dongen finished his undergraduate in biology/chemistry (biochemistry, cum laude) and PhD study in molecular cell biology at the University of Utrecht. In 1989 he received a staff position at the Dept of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery VUmc at the laboratory for tumor biology. A main and consistent research line is on the development and use of targeted drugs like monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for disease detection and therapy. In this field, \u201cimmuno-PET\u201d and \u201cTKI-PET\u201d, the PET imaging of radiolabeled mAbs and TKIs, respectively, as well as photoimmunodetection, were introduced. These techniques are nowadays worldwide applied in drug development by pharma companies as well as academic centers. In 2002 he became full professor in head and neck oncology. In 2006 he also became head radiochemistry at the Dept of Nuclear Medicine and PET research (nowadays designated TracerCenterAmsterdam). In 2012 a switch was made to full professor at the department of Radiologie & Nuclear Medicine, and in 2016 also to vice-chair of this department. He has several national and international positions in science and technology management. He has been project leader for the construction of the 80 M\u20ac Amsterdam UMC Imaging Center, and became managing director after the opening of the center in 2019.  Besides projects supported by cancer and technology foundations and EU, many collaborations exist with biotech, pharma and imaging companies all over the world. More than 40 antibody conjugates, prepared in own licensed GMP facilities, were brought in first-in-man studies. He supervised nearly 20 PhD projects, is author and co-author of 220 papers in peer-reviewed journals, is inventor at several patents, and has involvement in the farma companies Cyclotron BV (radiopharmaceuticals) and LinXis (antibody drug conjugates) .",
