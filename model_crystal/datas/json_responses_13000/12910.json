In cooperation with the government of Guinea and the different INGO\u2019s, we set up a plan connecting the different programs of the organizations. This enabled the refugees with psychosocial difficulties who were receiving counseling to help with their trauma and life skills training to prepare for a return to life outside of the refugee camps, to move on to programs by other INGO\u2019s to learn a craft and start a small business. This way we were able to help a group of severely traumatized people regain their resilience to such an extent that they wanted to return permanently to the place where they were traumatized years before.",
