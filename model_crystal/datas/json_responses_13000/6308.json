Keep strong in mind that history is different than has been told with created and planned events involving many unnecessary deaths of humanity and especially children. Famous persons and companies in the world sold their soul to the devil to able to urn fame and money from all professional levels. All evidence, state secrets and coverups will be made public. As much as the eye can comprehend and endure through all the terrible events that have been created, cgi images or manipulated. It won't be easy fighting the deep state of the devil (abuse of power, money, control over all citizens, the top objects selling on number 2 is fear and number 1 is children trafficking), it may take a while with multiple world events before things finally get better. Hold on. Share your positive feelings, light and love. Together we are stronger with and without faith. The patriots are fighting war worldwide for your freedom. Don't ever give up on hope, a new world (better) is born and is coming. A military tribunal for all world leaders and others arrests. Are you awake and do you really know what is happening right now near you or in the world. God wins.
