The aim of the event was to design, present and manufacture an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) that can survive a rocky terrain for 3 hours of endurance run, after qualifying through Brake, Acceleration, Steering, and Oil Spill Tests. In the preliminary rounds, around 200 teams participated, of which around 80 were allowed to go forward and fabricate the vehicle. Our vehicle finished overall 19th nationally in its maiden attempt. In the subsequent years of participation, after the strong foundation laid in the first year, the team had one many awards such as Best Innovation, Go-Green and Highest Acceleration awards. ",
