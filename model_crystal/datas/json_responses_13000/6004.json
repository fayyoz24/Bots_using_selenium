This section of the government focuses on monitoring legislation and regulations in diplomatic and consular matters, examining accreditation procedures for Ambassadors and appointing of foreign Consuls in the Principality of Monaco and relations with them. As an intern, I was able to examine some files concerning Ambassadors and Consuls of the Principality abroad and relations with them, as well as some agreements of International Organizations and Monaco. After being thoroughly instructed, I was tasked with preparing some country profiles in order to brief other diplomats on certain countries. As a student this helped me apply theory to real-life cases: it is important to study the history and culture of a country as preparation before meeting officials to understand the motivations, priorities and goals of the nation in front of us.",
