    "summary": "Graduated Research Master in Religious Studies with excellent study results, now working as a PhD candidate studying the ritualization of megalithic structures (hunebedden) in the Netherlands. During my MA, I specialized in the collective remembrance of conflicts, resulting in my Thesis on the collective memories on different aspects of the Dutch colonial period, as well as the fall of Srebrenica, and how these memories are created and shaped by the wording and images used in history textbooks. \n\nMy education has given me the opportunity to conduct research on a broad range of topics, from archival research on collectors of non-Western art in the 1970's to the use of precolonial heritage in peace museums in Kenya, and from tiled walls in Catholic churches to the roles played by Mennonites in WWII. The one thing in common: all of these subjects deal with how history is 'created' in one way or another. Often the stories and created histories are at least as important as what actually happened in history, at least when looking at society. \n\nApart from my research qualifications, I also have experience in organizing events, coordinating small teams of volunteers, and presenting for/entertaining children and young adults.",
