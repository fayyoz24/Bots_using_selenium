    "summary": "My personal mission is to make research happen. As owner of DrEAMS Funding Consultancy (www.dreamsfundingconsultancy.eu), I offer research strategy advice, grant writing and funding support to scientists from the Life Sciences & Health and other sectors.\n\nI have been active in the LSH domain since 1994. After obtaining my PhD degree, I worked as a managing biochemist at a biotechnology company till 2002. I then moved to various decentralised and central strategic positions at the largest university medical center in The Netherlands to write competitive grant proposals, set up and coordinate large national and international research consortia, scout and advise on national and international funding opportunities, and promote the (inter)national positioning of the institution and its scientists. In May 2020, I joined HollandPTC as Director Research & Education. I supervised the R&D department including the R&D facilities, and was responsible for the implementation of the HollandPTC research programme on proton therapy. As member of the Management Team, I took part in setting the strategy and running the operations of the organisation. In April 2022, I started DrEAMS Funding Consultancy as part-time freelancer. Since mid November 2022, I am a full-time freelancer.\n\nI have a broad national and European network of research managers and administrators. I am mentor and trainer for the European Association of Research Managers and Administrators (EARMA), co-founder and former vice-chair of the Association for Research Managers and Administrators - The Netherlands (ARMA-NL), and have been a core group member and working group leader of the COST Targeted Network BESTPRAC.",
