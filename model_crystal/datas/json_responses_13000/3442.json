    "summary": "I have more than seven years of work experience with national and international nonprofit organizations to support women's empowerment and civic education initiatives in Afghanistan. \nI have graduated from the law and political science faculty at Kabul University. I was a competitor and finalist of the Kabul University team in the Afghanistan National Rounds Price Media Law Moot Court Competition funded by USAID. I volunteered to support the media law moot courts as a judge in 2016 and 2017. \nI was selected from amongst 200 candidates and offered an internship at the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs, women's protection centers, in December 2014. \nI worked as an assistant for the Women and Youth Empowerment Program supported by CPI and funded by USAID in 2015. \nI led a three-year project on strengthening the linkage between formal and informal justice providers and advocacy for peace in Afghanistan (funded by the Asia Foundation). Afterward, I joined the Checchi Consulting Company as a CSO capacity building specialist. I worked on the most significant rule of law project called \"ADALAT\" in Afghanistan.\nI started working with Cordaid in 2019. I worked with Provincial Women's Network in 20 provinces of Afghanistan to empower grassroots women to undertake evidence-based lobbying & advocacy to generate positive societal changes. By doing this, I have assisted vulnerable women at the grassroots level and in (remote) communities in accessing justice through formal and informal justice systems. \nI obtained PMP certification at the end of 2020. I started my master's in gender and women's studies in early 2021. Then, I was assigned as gender focal point for the Cordaid Just Future project as part of many programs funded by the Dutch.",
