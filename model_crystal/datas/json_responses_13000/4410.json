    "summary": "I am currently studying at the Australian Catholic University completing a double degree in Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Global Studies. I am a passionate student and who is interested in politics and working with young people. For my future career I aspire to be involved in making positive social change. Working through Covid-19 lockdowns in the Retail Sector and Salvation Army Caf\u00e9, I have learned many skills including patience, tolerance, how to remain calm under pressure, confidence and effective communication as customers and clients became more agitated and aggressive. In 2022 I also took part in an exchange program and studied abroad in the Netherlands at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Moving abroad and studying in a different country has only furthered skills such as problem-solving abilities, networking, resilience and confidence.",
