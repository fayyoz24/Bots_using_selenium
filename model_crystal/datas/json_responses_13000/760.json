    "summary": "Mission statement:\n\n\"Provide tailored mass spectrometry imaging solutions for product development purposes, in order to better understand product function and highlight important pathways of action.\"\n\nI established my start-up company, AKIN solutions, in order to pursue this goal.\n\nExperience:\n\nI successfully graduated my multidisciplinary PhD in 2018 which was focused on mass spectrometry imaging method development for analysis of advanced 3D cell culture models. Then I moved on to a role at the Leiden University Medical Center to establish tailored 3D cell culture and analytical protocols in order to address informational gaps in sarcoma research. This involved generation of patient-derived sarcoma models, the creation of suitable 3D cell culture methods within the group, and the adaptation of appropriate mass spectrometry imaging protocols for the analysis of these models. \n\nFunded by an EMBO fellowship I worked at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS) in Mannheim for four months (Jan-Apr 2022), in collaboration with the LUMC. Here, I developed chiral MSI protocols for oncometabolite imaging in rare cancer types. During the fellowship, I also consulted on relevant industrial and academic projects within the institute which is when I started a private consultancy for MSI and 3D cell culture applications.\n\nCurrently, I am also working as a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics on the development of advanced MALDI-based analytical protocols of biological isolates for industry partners.",
