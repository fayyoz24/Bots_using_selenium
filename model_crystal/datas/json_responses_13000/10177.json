    "summary": "Since I keep receiving job offers that are very much appreciated, however require fluency in Dutch: although I do live in the Netherlands, my knowledge of Dutch is so basic that I can't have a fully correct conversation yet, let alone translate anything in Dutch for your company. Of course, if you are in dire need of someone who could tell you that leven in een zolderkamer is niet heel leuk or het spijt me, maar mijn Nederlands is erg basic, then I'm the right person. I'm diligently training to get better at it though.\n\nAnd now, to the topic.\n\nI've been working for Albion Localisations for more than four years, translating dialogues, marketing pieces and other kinds of texts from video games, from English to Polish.\n\nMy biggest success so far is an innovative translation of Bugsnax\u2014a charming independent title by Young Horses\u2014where I utilized a complex system of dukaisms (pl. 'dukaizmy')(Polish non-binary pronouns created by a writer Jacek Dukaj) and dukatives (pl. 'dukatywy')(corresponding nouns) to avoid ciswashing the non-binary character that has been done many times before.\n\nA nice side effect of this task was a lengthy interview on the page \"6 kolor\u00f3w gier wideo\" (\"6 Colors of Video Games\"). The owner and author of the page was nice enough to mention me and my translation in her own interview for \"ASZdziennik\" (a satirical Polish portal comparable with The Onion, although focusing on more serious topics as well).\n\nThat's it when it comes to my main area of expertise. Now, to the side gig.\n\nTwelve years have passed since I've started making mixed media jewelry, trying to create my own brand, loobeensky, from the scratch. Effectively that means designing, working with plywood, felt, linoleum, polymer clay, silver, copper, beads, wires, leather and whatnot, taking pictures, postprocessing, writing descriptions, coming up with (more or less) catchy titles, taking care of multiple shops, contacting clients, selling and managing many channels in social media. Yes, yes. My pieces saw more of the world than their maker as I used to have clients in Canada, Sweden, Germany, USA, Netherlands, Israel, Norway and Spain (this list is not complete).\n\nFor two years I've been writing reviews for the biggest polish portal for bookworms \u2014 Lubimy Czytac, a bit like Goodreads.\n\nI've spent one of my years as a social media & communications humanoid and translator in a Spanish multinational, Tiendeo.",
