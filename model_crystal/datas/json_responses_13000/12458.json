    "summary": "I am a political science graduate with aspirations of working in public administration, international organizations, or research/academia. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nI studied International Economic Relations in Prague, Czech Republic. During my bachelor studies, I spent an Erasmus exchange semester in Istanbul, Turkey, which offered me great opportunities to learn about different cultures and improve my communication skills in English.\n\nI spent the last three years in the Netherlands and graduated with a master's degree in Political Science. I learned how to do world-standard research in social sciences and was briefly able to assist one of my professors in her research project. My greatest achievement was graduating cum laude (with honors) and finishing my master's thesis in which I connected people's factual knowledge about abortion and their opinion on its legality. During my stay in Amsterdam, I worked at Booking.com in a B2B position which allowed me to further improve my communication skills with clients and stakeholders.",
