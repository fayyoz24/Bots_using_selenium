    "summary": "After graduating as a BSc in Environmental Engineering in 1992, I worked in the field of Contaminated Land Management in projects in the Netherlands for various clients, especially in the oil and gas sector. \n\nFrom 2001 onwards, I focussed on International projects in the field of environment. Throughout the years I have worked on a large variety of small and large (budget) projects for international clients in many countries and collaborated with clients and experts from a large variety of cultures.  \n\nThe diversity of projects that I was involved in, either in project teams or on my own, excites me. I love navigating between projects in Contaminated Land Management or Soil Policy Development, managing EHS Management systems (compliance) audits and EHS Due Diligence assessments, QHSE  management for both internal and external clients, Coal Mining and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.\n\nI personally worked as a project manager or specialist in projects in Azerbaijan, Albania, Bangladesh, Belize, Bonaire, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Lesotho, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, The Philippines, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Additionally, I managed multiple projects in other countries from my home base in The Netherlands and therefore have extensive experience in working with international clients and contractors.\n\nI understand the client\u2019s requirements, as well as the local working conditions and restrictions applicable to such projects, which are highly beneficial for smooth execution of the projects.\n\nSpecialties: \n\u2022\tProject Management\n\u2022\tContaminated Land Management (soil and groundwater)\n\u2022\tSoil Policy development\n\u2022\tContaminated Sediments and dredging\n\u2022\tEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment\n\u2022\tDue Diligence auditing for mergers and acquisitions\n\u2022\tQHSE management\n\u2022\tQuality auditing in the Nuclear Industry\n\u2022\tCoal Mining\n",
