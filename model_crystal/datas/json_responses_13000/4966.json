We create minimalistic yet distinct products, led by the esthetics of shapes, materials and colours. We work in an associative manner. With a fascination for form following function and use, Visser & Meijwaard looks for new ways to apply the unintended esthetics of everyday products.   \n\nThe studio\u2019s work ranges from interior to conceptual design, and from presentation to set design. Visser & Meijwaard has worked for, amongst others, Herm\u00e8s Paris, Linteloo and Pulpo Products.",

Together we create a new image out of wonderful color, material and object combinations that change the atmosphere and meaning of our individual work. We not only share a space, we create a new world.\n\nAs a collective, we seek the boundaries of disciplines, even exceed them, by creating a complete new image. At the same time our work can still be separated again: we make objects that can also stand alone, each with its own concept and its own ingenious design.\n\nIn our work we are all looking for boundaries: between product and autonomous object, between pleasant and alienating, between historical reference and innovation, between natural and artificial, between design and concept. This is the field in which we find each other and strengthen each other. We create our own world out of elements that congregate in a presentation, which takes the audience out of it\u2019s fast pace and judgement.

With Kiss my Name they present a colorful setting that challenges the audience to not only see the products, but also experience them. (The exhibition was on display from 12 till 17 April 2016 during the Salone del Mobile at Via Massimiano 23 Lambrate, Milan)\n\nProduct designers Visser & Meijwaard, Studio KnockOut and artists Linda Nieuwstad and Jan van der Ploeg unite their work together in a conceptual presentation, combining giant flowers, coffins made of PVC cloth, large murals and dazzling ceramic chandeliers. Kiss my Name is a singular world of elements that find each other in an exhibition where the audience doesn\u2019t just look at products, but walks into an experience.\n\n\u201cThe work we make is extravagant. We deal with the big gestures, rituals and themes. From an aesthetic world of material, color and shape we make objects full of expression that are sometimes real products, sometimes more art and sometimes more decor and space.\nThe central pieces of our exhibition are coffins which are suitable for reuse. This is a product that is far removed from a glossy lifestyle, and is often found in serene, tranquil surroundings. We focused on how we could design a new world of pomp and rituals around the theme of grief in a distinctive new design language.\n\nAs a design collective we are looking for a new interpretation of space and perception. \u201d\nKiss my Name was on display in Milan with support of the Dutch Creative Industries Fund.",

These properties are found in the design of industrial plastic crates and were the starting point in our design of the cupboard. Inspired by the technical aesthetic of these crates, our Grey on Gray design features an exoskeleton that has been used to fulfil both technical and decorative functions\u2019.",
