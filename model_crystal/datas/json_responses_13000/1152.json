Extensive use was made of OpenWorks, Petrel and ArcGIS to create and analyse a regional database of rock properties derived from core and log analysis, other well data, and information obtained from scientific publications.\n",

This implies that classic sequence stratigraphic models underestimate the potential impact of sediment flux and do not capture the full range of potential architectures of fluvial/deltaic deposits. \n\nResults were reported informally to Norsk Hydro.",
