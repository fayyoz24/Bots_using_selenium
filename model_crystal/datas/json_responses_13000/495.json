    "summary": "As Findest\u2019s CEO, I focus on improving the companies\u2019 processes, growing our team, and acquiring more users for IGOR^AI. \n\nQuestions that drive me:\n- How many technologies already exist but are not found by the right people? \n- What software do R&D-professionals need to find all technologies quickly? \n- How to get IGOR^AI known by people who need him?\n\nMy journey of making an impact using technologies started with commercializing a Metal-Organic Framework in the Oil & Gas industry. The massive gap between nanoscience & big-business inspired me to start a nanotechnology scouting company with Roel Boekel in 2014. We worked on a dozen innovative nanotechnology projects and primarily searched for technologies in the old school way. We were googling, searching patent databases, calling suppliers, etc. \n\nIn 2017, we became passionate about developing the best method for finding technologies using artificial intelligence. Maybe we could combine the best of human- and artificial intelligence to further improve the technology scouting process? This combination resulted in Findest, a technology scouting company that built IGOR^AI to help R&D teams find and manage technologies.",

In the long term, society should benefit from an optimized cost-benefit relation between the default risk and the price of insurance products.",
