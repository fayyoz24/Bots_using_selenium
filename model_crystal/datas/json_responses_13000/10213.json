This proactive contact serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims to enhance the overall service experience for the customer by actively engaging with them. Secondly, it enables me to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and challenges faced by our customers.\n\nDuring these interactions, I gather valuable insights that help identify additional opportunities, challenges, or commercial needs within the customer's account. This information allows me to take the necessary actions to ensure that the customer derives maximum value from their subscription.\n\nBy actively listening to the customer's feedback, concerns, and goals, I can identify areas where Elsevier products can further support their objectives. This may involve suggesting additional product features, offering training resources, or connecting them with relevant resources and support teams within Elsevier.",
