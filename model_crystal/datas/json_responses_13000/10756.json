    "summary": "Experienced educator, learning designer and (process) facilitator for both face-to-face and virtual interventions. I have worked across Asia and Europe for the past 20+ years with leaders on developing their confidence and competence in driving change and navigating complexity. I'm always curious about what human(e) leadership entails in this digital age.\n\nSpent 13 years abroad (Hong Kong 2009-2012, Singapore 2012-2018, Stockholm 2018-2021), and now residing in The Netherlands, working with our European team of learning designers and educators, and in parallel, since 2021, focusing on building out our Dutch presence and impact in the leadership development space.\n\nI have had the privilege of developing leaders at Google, BNP Paribas, Accenture, Visa, Lufthansa Group, Volvo Group, Bain & Company, Etihad Airways, Essity, McDonalds, TUI Airline, Pernod Ricard, Accenture, Publicis Groupe, UBS, and many many other amazing organisations. \n\nMarried and 2 beautiful kids. Biggest passion (besides learning and leadership development of course): equestrianism!\n\nDutch citizen, Swedish Residence Permit Holder and Singapore Permanent Resident.",
