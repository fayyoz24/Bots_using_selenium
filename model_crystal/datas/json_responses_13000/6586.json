These projects are part of bigger programs, therefore proper alignment to other projects is necessary. \n\nI managed project to improve design of thermostatic expansion valve from the early beginning till the successful finish. Most critical for the success of this project was clear identification of the scope in the beginning of the project. This 6-phase new product introduction (NPI) project was finished on time and within budget.\nI also temporarily managed the Solar Water Heater projects, where I was previously acting as mechanical designer. It was nice experience to see the same project from different perspective. I successfully finalized this project.\n\nI am now managing large development projects of components into domestic heating gas appliances. \n\nMy main responsibilities as project manager are:\n\u2022\tIntegration of all functions \n\u2022\tScope definition, ensure proper change management and avoid scope creep\n\u2022\tDevelop and control budget and schedule\n\u2022\tEstimation and management of capital expenses (CAPEX)\n\u2022\tConnecting all stakeholders, escalations\n\u2022\tProject execution\n\u2022\tRisk Management\n\u2022\tResource Management, negotiation with resource managers\n\u2022\tDealing with Customers and Suppliers\n\u2022\tFollowing rules and processed established by Project Management Office (PMO) organization\n\u2022\tUsing project management tools like MS Project or Jira",

This department was part of Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) and later Environmental & Energy Solutions (E&ES).\n\nIn this department, we were developing building controls \u2013 especially valves and actuators for heating & cooling systems. I was working mainly on New Product Introduction (NPI) projects with the objective to develop new rotary and linear valves and later cooling controls.\n\nI was design leader of a new rotary valve for accurate mixing control of supply water temperature in heating and air conditioning. I used Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to eliminate trial and error approach. Later, I was involved in the design of the linear 2- and 3-way mixing valves with the focus on quality, cost and time to market. \n\nThen I moved to cooling business, where I was working on the design of the new electronic expansion valves used in air-conditioning and refrigeration applications. I increased my knowledge of refrigeration systems in the theoretical and practical way. \n\nOther main activities in this role:\n\u2022\tDesigning of mechanical parts - casting, forging, machining, plastic parts, sheetmetal\n\u2022\tFEA - finite method analysis used for verification of the design\n\u2022\tVarious mechanical calculations\n\u2022\tPreparation of technical specifications\n\u2022\tSolving of technical issues\n\u2022\tDesign reviews\n\nAll projects were managed in the multinational team, split into more locations. I learned how to communicate and collaborate over distance \u2013 in English or German language. \n\nI also supported buy to sell projects, especially for Solar Water Heaters projects where the focus was on clear specification, risk identification and daily communication with suppliers. These global projects required daily communication with other team members and partners in Africa or Asia-Pacific and Europe.",
