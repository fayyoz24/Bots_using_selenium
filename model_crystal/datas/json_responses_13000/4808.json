    "summary": "One of my most important attributes is my determination.  If I put my mind to something and tell myself that it is possible, I don\u2019t rest until I\u2019ve accomplished it.  Time and time again I prove to myself that if I put 110% of myself into doing something nothing can stop me.  Success is my goal and I will not settle for anything less.\n\nChallenge is my motivational force in life.  When faced with a challenge I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, instead I see it as an opportunity to learn something new and prove to myself that I am capable of conquering any goal.  \n\nI believe that I have been successful as a student, family member, employee and member of the community because I participate with commitment, and always try to contribute in all situations and areas.\n\nI am an adaptable person that works well with people and can turn ideas into actions.  I am good at understanding an idea and finding a way to bring it to life.  I am a solution orientated person and a firm believer being proactive and not reactive.  \n\nTechnology is the future and it is time for us to embrace it and make sure it works for us.  I believe in working hard but even more in working smart.\n\nI believe I have grown well throughout my career and I have been groomed in a great way with many different corporate characteristics.  I look forward to continuing this growth trend with strong companies and being part of a team who takes a business to the next level.\n\nGallup Strengths: Achiever, Strategic, Activator, Maximizer, Futuristic",
