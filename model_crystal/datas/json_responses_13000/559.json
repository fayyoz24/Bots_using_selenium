    "summary": "I am active as a consultant, project and process manager and (risk-taking) business developer. I do so with a strong focus on the water sector. From Sanitation to Water Supply, from Integrated Water Resources Management to Irrigation. My educational background is generic, which allows me to interact with a broad range of professionals. From engineers to policy makers. From NGO\u2019s to entrepreneurs. Having worked in the water sector since 2007, I have developed a broad understanding of the worlds\u2019 water challenges, as well as a vision on how to cope with these. I have developed specific knowledge and expertise on water supply and sanitation in developing countries, through my work for the Netherlands Water Partnership and WASTE, both in the Netherlands as well as in Mozambique. Next to my work as an independent consultant, I am a partner of EWB, a Dutch start-up in climate adaptation, specifically in storm water management and treatment.",

With our patented Urban Rain Shell-system we store and purify rainwater with natural, circular and renewable materials. We buffer storm water in underground beds of 'AA Ecoshell Mix' and at the same time purify the runoff water of heavy metals, mineral oils and PAH\u2019s with the innovative mineral mix 'AA Minerals'. As a result, we are able to infiltrate the water in groundwater protection areas and water catchment areas to prevent drought and salinization. Or we can store it in aquifers, where we create a fresh water bubble. With the URS we make rainwater available again for use in all sorts of applications for which currently drinking water is used. For example, sprinkler water for sports fields or greeneries, firefighting water, process water or as play water on squares in residential areas. This way, we save drinking water and make rainwater a source again instead of a sore.",

Two billion people in the world survive on 2 Dollars per day or less, the so-called Base of the Pyramid, and we have noticed an increasing number of young people that are appalled by this situation. People that are determined to contribute to the eradication of poverty and the improvement of livelihoods at the Base of the Pyramid. \n\nWe believe that structural improvement can be established by focusing on entrepreneurial development. By viewing people in Southern countries not as victims, but as value-conscious consumers. Consumers that have their own demands for high-quality products and services. This creates a market that challenges entrepreneurs and companies to be creative and innovative. To come up with products and services that fit local conditions and that are still affordable for local consumers.\n\nThe Borrel of the Pyramid focuses on bringing together the unbound potentiality of young professionals from different sectors and countries, and challenges them to contribute to improve the situation at the Base of the Pyramid. Hereby our focus is not only on the people that are active within the development sector, but especially on so-called unusual suspects from the private sector. We do this by offering a platform on which young professionals, with a heart for entrepreneurial development, can connect with each other and meet likeminded spirits. We also inspire them by introducing real-life cases in which they are challenged to find a creative and innovative solution to an existing problem.",
