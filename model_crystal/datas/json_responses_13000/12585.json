    "summary": "My love for an active lifestyle is mostly expressed by swimming, running, and cycling outdoors as much as possible. Next to a healthy addiction to strong coffee I enjoy travelling and learning about other cultures and countries. \n\nI get energized from creating digital products with talented people and love creating new business models with technology at the core. I believe my work matters as companies that want to continue thriving in the digital age need digital natives to help them create value for their customers. \n\nThe products that I create range from web-based E-Commerce solutions to digital experiences on mobile devices. After having launched more than 25 digital initiatives in the past 5 years all over the world I consider myself an experienced digital product creator.",
