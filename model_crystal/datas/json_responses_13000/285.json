    "summary": "I am a French man in my early thirties with a third level degree in History.\u00a0 Since my graduation, I have mostly lived abroad. I have resided in Ireland and the Netherlands and I am currently undertaking a working holiday in New Zealand.\u00a0\n\n\nDuring my time in Dublin and Amsterdam, I have made my trade in the B2C working environment by working at at Smartbox in Dublin and at Hellofresh in Amsterdam. I am coming back in Europe in July 2020 and look forward to further my career in this area.\n\n\nIn my previous employment, I have proved my abilities to give the best outcome to the customer and to handle difficult cases in a busy environment. My employers have always commented positively my hard working mind set, my team working abilities and my interpersonal skills. This is evident in the new tasks and responsibilities I was given after time in both roles.\n\n\nBy the end of my contract at HelloFresh, I was promoted to a senior staff role and held responsibility for customer complaints for  French and English speaking market in Belgium and France. My tasks including taking over difficult cases regarding customer issues and devising solutions which were acceptable to both the customer and the company. I also was involved in the training of new and current colleagues to in sure the best possible customer service experience for our clients. I was also tasked with the quality control of our English and French websites to in sure all information was up to date and that no bugs were present. These new tasks helped me enhance various skills such as communication, conflict resolution and attention to detail. I would like to further develop these skills in my next career step.\u00a0\n\n\n",
