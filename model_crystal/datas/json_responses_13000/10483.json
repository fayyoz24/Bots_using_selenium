This was accomplished by using Cyclomedia's state of the art, proprietary imaging equipment to capture the entirety of New York City then extracting data from the imagery using powerful software also developed by Cyclomedia. This project was truly an international and collaborative feat as was had GIS experts, programmers, stakeholders, production, and QA/QC teams working together in 3 countries over 2 continents. The overall outcome of this project resulted in data that NYC can use to make public areas safer for pedestrians and more accessible to people with disabilities. \n\nI led a team of 15 in-house QC operators in which I had active roles in hiring, training, and working with daily. I was also responsible for daily communications and continual training with a 3rd party partner which extracted the data with a scalable team of up to 80 operators. Since the majority of work was performed in The Netherlands, my expertise of the American infrastructure was invaluable to the success of this project. ",
