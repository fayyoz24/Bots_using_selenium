    "summary": "I have been fascinated by branding and marketing sector for as long as I can remember. It has always intrigued me how simple words or visuals have the power to communicate a message that will resonate in the society. How the contemporary media helps to reinforce or challenge the very structures of society that we live in. That is the reason why I study Communication and Media.\n\nMore recently, I have been interested in the ways that companies build narratives around their brand to sell their products to customers. More importantly, I find it incredible how a certain brand image literally hooks customers to the point that they believe that it is impossible to live without this particular product. \n\nAfter my internship at Wunderman Thompson, I have realized that companies work relentlessly to construct a smooth customer experience on all touchpoints, whether it is online or offline servicescape. I have also noticed how seemingly minor inconsistencies can jeopordize the success of this goal.\n\nI want to be a part of this. I want to be the person that builds meaningful connections between brands and customers. I want to be the person that helps companies strive in the increasingly competitive business setting.",
