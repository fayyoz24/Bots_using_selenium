    "summary": "I was born and raised in Afghanistan until 2015 when circumstances forced me to escape my own homeland and resettle in the Netherlands. The whole journey has been a great deal of experiences and hardships which I have gone through but I am happy and proud where I am today. \n\nCurrently I am doing my last year of my Associated Degree in International Business Management at Hogeschool Tio, I did my first internship in 2021 at Chemelco International B.V which subsequently I was hired as part time employee in logistics. It was in 2010 when I started my first job in Afghanistan and I was 20 years old thus I have a very diverse range of 13 years of experience in Business Management.\n\nMy work experiences in Afghanistan and the Netherlands in different departments enables me to be flexible and work efficiently. I am organized, accurate, patient and able to deliver consistently high results in a challenging and pressurised work environment. I am a fast learner and because of my open-mindedness I am able to work exceptionally well with other people. Seeking a challenging job in the field of my study in a highly comparative environment at a position of responsibilities to utilize my skills.",
