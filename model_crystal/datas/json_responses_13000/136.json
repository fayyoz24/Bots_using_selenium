    "summary": "In my working career travelling and event organising have always been a passion; a red ribbon that keeps coming back. Although trained as a teacher I enjoy working on projects and cultural -, business- and groupbuilding events. \n\nIn these areas my previous work experience  and personal interests come together beautifully. I like to challenge myself and that is one reason why I have been succesful in my projects.\nI am ready for a new challenge in Europe in a international company where my multilingual communication and organisational skills can be used to succesfully organise events or projects.\n\nFeel free to contact me! I am looking forward to hear from you.",
