I help them find inner motivation, trust, hope, inspiration, strength, and zeal, and work with them to foster spiritual growth, reflection, and well-being.\n\nMy approach involves two main processes to help patients affirm their identity and worldview. The first is personalizing their worldview by helping them make it their own and integrating new perspectives into their thinking. The second is developing a worldview that helps them engage with life, clarify their values, and move forward with purpose.\n\nI am currently raising funds for the San Francisco Night Ministry, a multi-faith organization that provides spiritual care and community support on the streets, on the phone, and at night. Their mission is to offer care to everyone, regardless of faith or no faith, without judgment, conversion, or agendas. The ministry offers community chaplaincy services and crisis intervention, serving the human and spiritual needs of people in San Francisco during the darkest hours.\n\nPlease consider donating to this registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization to help make a difference and support those in need. Thank you for your contribution.\n\nLearn more about the San Francisco Night Ministry by navigating here: https://sfnightministry.org/programs/",
