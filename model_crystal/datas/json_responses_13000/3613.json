    "summary": "An experienced peace and development specialist and conflict sensitivity expert with a track record in conflict-sensitive programming, political analysis, policy advice in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. As Policy Lead for Conflict Transformation at Oxfam Novib I have worked on conflict-sensitive policy and programming with teams in Burundi, Nigeria, South Sudan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Yemen and Myanmar (amongst others). I also lead the training agenda and thematic support on conflict sensitivity mainstreaming in Oxfam's work. I have worked for EU and UN institutions as well as INGOs in Eurasia, MENA and Africa on programmes to support people affected by conflict, helped building bridges between divided communities and participated in peace negations. \nMost of my long-term experience has been in the South Caucasus, Afghanistan and Iran, but also includes MENA and Africa, which has given me sound knowledge of specific country and regional contexts that comes from living and working in the field. \nI am a fluent English and Russian speaker with intermediary French, Farsi and German, and some Georgian and Arabic; a strategic thinker and pragmatic problem solver with excellent management, communication and interpersonal skills, who is creative, flexible, pro-active and stress resistant. I consider myself a realistic optimist who believes that change can be achieved, even if it seems unlikely. \nMy areas of focus cover: conflict sensitivity, conflict analysis, humanitarian-development-peacebuilding Triple Nexus, conflict and climate change, political analysis and policy advice on conflict issues, training and facilitation, creative visual presentation and (peace) negotiation and mediation, with wide experience in EU and UN policy and programmes.",
