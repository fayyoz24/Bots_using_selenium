With the help of watershed, estimation and management of water resources at country level is an internationally adopted technique. Furthermore classification of watershed from continental to regional and local level provided ease in management of hydrological resources. In the hour of need, like flood and drought conditions, water management can be provided to very basic level. We recommend above delineated classification to be done from country to provincial and localized levels to help maintain our precious water resources for natural hazard management to irrigation maintenance. Soan is the 2nd level watershed after the Indus basin which is considered as the 1st level watershed in Pakistan. The coding for the first level is (Regional level) 00 and for the second level is (Sub Regional) 0000 and for the third level 000000 as per USGS standard hydrologic unit coding (HUC) system.

LST uncertainties involved in the retrieval of radiance which is less than (1-2K) than those of microwave. Due to this fact there are minor range of change of surface radiance in the TIR realm. It is also dependant on the temperature. The  angle of surface ejection in the microwave is much larger and relies on the temperature which ultimately results in LST uncertainties. Calculations in infrared spectrum are susceptible to cloud contamination than that of microwaves. The finding of Strict cloud detection can reduce the uncertainty to 2-3K, also the lasting cloud belongings to the microwave determinations are similar. The Infrared properties gets limited due to the presence of heavy presence. The \u201csunny day\u201d partiality of IR results is noteworthy and differ temporally and spatially during the season. The relation of temperature variations and cloudiness in weather events give the overall variations. Calculation of microwave is limited in scope and less reliable due to large changes in emissivity of surface materials \nIt is well know phenomena in RS that the land surface temperatures are very much related to the land and atmosphere  connection and energy flux. upward radiation flux causes surface energy balance and, latent and sensible heat loss fluxes. LST is dependent on the revisit which is influenced by sensor uniqueness, atmospheric situation, spectral emissivity, surface type variation, content in soil moisture, visual geometry. The average LST variation shows that as we move away from the coastal area temperature start rising\n",

Its uses range from household to industries spanning every sector of economy and has become a resource with strategic importance. Level of groundwater is dependent among various factors such as topography, aquifer type, climate etc. Over extraction of groundwater can lead to its depletion and result in problems like structural damage, salt water intrusion. Hence groundwater monitoring is important for groundwater management. In this respect, GIS has emerged as a very helpful toolin this regard as a tool for spatial analysis and mapping. In this study, spatio-temporal analysis of water table of Rawalpindi municipal jurisdiction has been done. The surfaces for surface elevation and water table of 1998, 2003 and 2007 were generated by IDW interpolation technique. Then vertical profiling was done and 9 cross sections were identified based on which spatial and temporal trends were identified. In addition, stratigraphy was also analysed by data of well logs. The main results of study showed that eastern side of Murree road has  enerally good situation of water levels but have faster depletion rates. The water table elevations are also decreasing gradually with increase in concentration of wells and discharge rates.",
