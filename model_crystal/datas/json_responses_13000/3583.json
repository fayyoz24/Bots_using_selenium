    "summary": "Paddy Moran, 31, is a Seattle-raised presenter, artist and professional currently living in Groningen, Netherlands. Growing up with a love for music and stage performing, Paddy immersed himself in the concert and touring world starting at just 13 years old. \n\nYears later, Paddy's most prominent musical endeavor - Seattle's only post-horncore band, Actionesse - brought him in front of thousands on festival stages, in classic venues, on tour across the Western US, broadcast on television and in print as a performer on one of The Seattle Times' Best Seattle Albums of 2019 (Actionesse, 'The Deep, Bright Below').\n\nIn 2022, having discovered a knack for creating warm, engaging and welcoming spaces for interaction, Paddy began working as a freelance presenter and host for Visit.Org, a SaaS startup and industry leader in building meaningful corporate social responsibility and employee engagement programs through impactful virtual, hybrid and in-person experiences. As a Virtual Event Host, Paddy warmed up and entertained virtual and live crowds using his bubbly personality and bright, optimistic energy.\n\nOver years of vastly different work experiences, Paddy's history traces the common thread of \"people\", his biggest passion. Now working on the new Enterprise Customer Advocate team at Atlassian, he aims to bring top-tier customer service to Atlassian's Enterprise Sales organization through empathy, active listening, and precise attention to detail.",
