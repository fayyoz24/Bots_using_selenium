    "summary": "I\u2019m a native German communications specialist with over 12 years\u2019 experience in the creative industry. I have organized events and collaborated with interesting, talented, creative people from all over the globe.\n\nWorking at TIO university of applied science I am teaching German and CCD to the next generation in business and tourism. \n\nAs an independent, I specialize in English and German copywriting, storytelling, translation to German, creative writing, external (international) communications, event organization, design organization, project management in design. Enhancing networks, connecting people to help business and communications between people and cultures.\n\nAt heart I\u2019m a creative writer and a passionate story teller. Stories connect people, help people remember and understand. Stories work for brands, companies, and people. And so do I. Once upon a time I turned even a simple sentence into a story \u2013 and it\u2019s still what I do best!\n\nFor six years I was the lead project manager for the world\u2019s biggest international young designers competition: the iF concept design award at iF International Forum Design in Hannover, Germany. This has allowed me to apply my experience in communication and organisation to design-related fields. \n\nI am a storyteller. I can assist with finding and coaching on stories - corporate, personal or product stories - and making the connection to the German market.",
