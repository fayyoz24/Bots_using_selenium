    "summary": "I am an experienced Musician / Music educator / Facilitator / Trainer / Online Education and Learning Consultant. I do my best at addressing some of the world's challenges through music performing, education and advisory for entrepreneurs and organizations in the fields of the arts, education, culture and social impact when it comes to project conception and development. \n\nI focus on and support social strengthening of at-risk communities and children with refugee status. The experience I gained from working, studying and researching in Colombia, Norway, Germany, and now The Netherlands, have made me focus on creating a positive impact on people's life's through the communication and team dynamics found in music.\n\nWith trainings for music educators and music workshops for young people but also adults and professional teams, I explore concepts like intercultural and cross-cultural communication, diversity, inclusion, peace and solidarity, belonging, resilience, democracy and community building.\n\nIt's always hard to explain with words what I do, so just look at the videos down here \ud83d\udc47\n\nCheck out my website\nwww.juandavidgarzon.com",

There we worked with inclusion and integration into their new environment through music projects that puts them together with children raised in Germany. Through songs, both from the German Pop repertoire and self composed, the children got a new approach towards this new language. Having to communicate with each other to solve different musical situations like when they are learning their instrument parts in smaller groups, have proved to give these students a set of skills that they would not achieve so fast by other means. From projects like the Lebensk\u00fcnstler, a couple of students have discovered their passion for music and have decided to seek a semi-professional career.\n\nI provided training in music pedagogics and counselling for the teachers of the different projects and established communication paths between students-teachers-schools-parents and cooperation partners. \n\nI conducted, directed and wrote for The Children District Orchestra Eichholz in L\u00fcbeck which is an integration project with the goal to provide a space where kids can interact in a productive way, towards a common objective, despite their differences in social, cultural and language background. \n\nThere, I also did the event management for Tontalente.
