I love creating innovative strategies for almost anything, obsessed with bringing real value to customers, and a champion of using the accurate data points and visuals to tell a well-constructed story. \n\nAs a design leader, I inspire my teams to think differently and challenge the status quo. I believe that individual growth is key for team success, and therefore I focus on finding opportunities, removing blockers, coaching and mentoring team members. \n\nI bring with me strong leadership, communication, and facilitation skills together with vast experience in building, optimizing, and marketing products.",
