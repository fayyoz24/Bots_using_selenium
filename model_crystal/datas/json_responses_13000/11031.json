It\u2019s Barcode bar and What\u2019s On is here to check out if this is a code worth scanning.\nFrom the first step in you understand Barcode is about drinking \u2013 a spacious bar welcomes every visitor, while the ceiling lights are decorated with glasses and bottles set into the wall elude to the theme. The menu proves this to be true also \u2013 the array of cocktails is impressive and split into \u201ccodes\u201d \u2013 like \u201cold fashioned\u201d, \u201csour\u201d, \u201cManhattan\u201d, and in-house Barcode specials; each style is visually explained as to its taste and strength. I notice Barcode\u2019s own cocktail recipes seem inspired and order a Jungle Beauty right away. It comes with a large block of ice and a slice of strawberry, and I enjoy the strength of the horilka it contains, along with sour notes of lemon and delicate basil.\nThe food list is not extensive, but makes sure you won\u2019t go hungry no matter how many cocktails you might have. With burgers, smorrebrods, hummus, and steaks it looks eclectic at first glance. \u201cThe food menu offers different taste experiences, something people in Kyiv are looking for,\u201d \u2013 says Hussam, the owner of the place. He originally comes from Syria, which is why the menu has some of the best-known Arab dishes like falafel , mutabel (eggplant salad), labneh (cream-cheese balls in oil and spices), and so on. Following his advice, we are ready for a gastronomic journey.",
