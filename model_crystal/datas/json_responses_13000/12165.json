    "summary": "I have completed an IChemE accredited Bachelor's degree in Chemical engineering and Chemistry at Eindhoven University of Technology with Honors in Energy Transition. So far in my degree, I had several laboratory experiences in particular in organic synthesis, nanotechnology, materials characterisation and polymer curing. My BSc thesis was focused on wide-band gap perovskite single junction solar cell optimization, with the aim to contribute to experimental advancement of high efficiency all-inorganic perovskite n-i-p triple junction solar cells. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Molecular Systems and Material Chemistry, with certification in Technology for Sustainable Development and specialization in polymer systems (coatings, colloidal systems and their characterization). My ambition is to contribute to smart, sustainable technology innovation and its safe implementation in society.  I have an international background, originally from Italy, lots of experience with multidisciplinary and multicultural team work.",
