    "summary": "After graduating for Technical Business Engineer (BEeng) I started as work preparator for Bronswerk Heat Transfer B.V. learning all about the manufacturing of Heat Exchangers and Air Cooled Coolers. Welding, materials, machining, logistics and purchase summarizes the knowlegde and responsibilities well.  \n\nBecause of growth and the economic situation in the Netherlands, I started outsourcing parts of the HE's and not much later complete HE's and ACC. Searching for good reliable suppliers, auditing, expediting, supplying technical advise and commercial negotiation became my core tasks. \n\nWe raised the department Production Operations and as a manager I became responsible for the complete outsourcing of the production and all of its subjects. \nCountries as Romania, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, India, Oman and Kazakhstan are known to me.   \n\nMy department grew rapidly and with six colleagues we were responsible for guiding over \u20ac 4 million  purchase spend with a net profit of 12%. My job was to facilitate the department by providing tools and knowledge where needed. \n\nAs a spider in the web, I was always looking company wide for improvements all the time, change processes, make departments cooperate and make the production Lean whenever needed.\n\nAfter twelve years, I left the company and started my own company, Global Forging Supply B.V. My goal is to supply high quality materials for the oil- and gas industry. Machined tube sheets, flanges, girth flanges and drilled headers are the main products but welded parts or stud bolts can be supplied just as easily. \n\nSpecialties: Management, production techniques, outsourcing, international business, materials.",
