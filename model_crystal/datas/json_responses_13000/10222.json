    "summary": "I\u2019ve always believed in learning and resilience.\n\nI grew up in a standard low-middle-class family. We had to tighten our belts for all the small things. But not for books. My parents were factory workers and believed in education. I don\u2019t remember any lavish holidays, but I can still recall the smell of an old encyclopedia my mother had bought in installments.\n\nLearning changed my life for the better. My hometown was a boring place in the middle of nowhere, tarnished by several economic crises. People had dull jobs, not particularly skilled, for all their life. I strived for more. This attitude helped me to achieve my educational goals and shape my current job.\n\nResilience is something different. It is a process of trial and error: you get it through life experiences. In 2008, the global financial crisis propelled budget cuts at my university and I had to change my educational path. I had enrolled to become an IT expert and educator in Digital Forensics and the cuts transformed it in a standard Law course with glimpses of general programming.\n\nAfter having earned my Bachelor's in Legal informatics, it was time to change everything: I started to travel more, learned new languages; moved to another city, and started a new Bachelor\u2019s in Foreign Languages. I wanted to be a Linguist and a Language Teacher. And I did it. \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\n\nBut, as I stressed before, resilience is a tangible skill. You learn it on the field. My latest field was the pandemic in March 2020. I was a University Lecturer in Russia when everything was shut down, including my job. I had to rearrange it, if I wanted to keep my career. I learned to communicate online, and more about sales and marketing to become a full-time online language tutor, creating my own business.\n\nI survived thanks to my resilience, but my drive to learn new things led me to another career: Data Analyst \ud83d\udcc8. Why?  Because I\u2019ve always loved data analysis: from my first BA in IT and Law to my internship as an accountant, to my research in Applied Linguistics. Understanding data is another way to educate myself and spread knowledge, as I\u2019ve always done.\n\nOver the past 6 months, I got more and more expert in Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I earned many certificates, including Start2Impact University\u2019s Master's. In other words, I got hooked.\n\nIf I\u2019m not working or studying, you\u2019ll find me: \n-\t\ud83d\udd6e Reading (fiction, non-fiction, self-development)\n-\t\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Podcasting at my project \u201cItalian stories with Davide\u201d\n-\t\ud83c\udf5d Cooking (OFC I\u2019m Italian)\n-\t\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0fWorking out\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fFeel free to send me a message here or at emanuelli.d@gmail.com",
