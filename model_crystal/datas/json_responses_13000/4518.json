    "summary": "I am an experienced DJ (Shady Lady) and Dance Instructor with a demonstrated history of working in the music, arts and media industry. Having completed my Bachelor degree in Performance and Film Studies from the University of New South Wales my interests lay in theatre, music, film and social media. In regards to my professional background I have worked as an Administrative, Production and Agent's Assistant in Australia, so I'm no amateur when it comes to playing the assistant role and being an organisational octopus. I am fluent in creating schedules, time management, social media scheduling (Hootsuite) and working my tentacle magic with a bit of Canva, Prequel and Photoshop. As an Agent's Assistant at Cameron's Talent Management I was responsible for website maintenance, organisation and consistent updates of 30 client profiles (film editors, writers, cinematographers, directors), handling their year-round schedules and reading scripts.\n\nSince moving to Amsterdam I have been working as a professional DJ and Aerobic Dance Instructor and have built up my own following (@shadylady_bec). I create fresh, funny and engaging copy and posts on average 3 days a week, I upload livestream and pre-recorded sets on Youtube, Twitch, Facebook and Soundcloud and I also run my own Patreon Page for the dedicated supporters out there. I essentially live and breathe social media marketing. Working alongside events and promoters I also co-ran social media campaigns through Instagram and Facebook ads for companies like Peak Mystique, ADE, Volkshotel & Oosterbar. There I was able to get experience in adopting different copy tones to suit brand expectations. \nMy goal is to continue to work in the creative industries such as music, fashion, film and arts.",

She then began to circulate the small yet solid Sydney disco and art scene, playing for collectives and events such as Backyart, Electric Boogie and Heaps Gay. As a side passion she also volunteered as a host for FBi Radio - an alternative music station with a heavy focus on local talent.\n \nShady Lady has now slotted herself into the grooves of the Amsterdam dance music scene. Having moved from Australia to Amsterdam only 2 years ago she has now co-founded 2 different parties in Amsterdam\u2019s east side (Hang Together & Dice Nights), has her own weekly livestream show (The Shady Lady Show) and has played for clubs across the city. Shady Lady\u2019s highlight performances include the Feminist Pisswife parties, Red Light Radio, Lovelee Opening Weekend and warming up for her favourite DJ and producer Folamour at Claire ADE 2019.\n \nWith a background in dance and theatre performance her DJ sets aren\u2019t ordinary. She is driven to make the dancefloor move as much as she does with a push for palpable and joyous tracks. Shady Lady\u2019s usual set is teaming with emotion, colour, a sense of kitsch aesthetic but with an eclectic knowledge of disco and house music.",
