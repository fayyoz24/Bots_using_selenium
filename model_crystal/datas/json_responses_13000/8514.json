    "summary": "I am passionate about finding new solutions to existing problems. Our current challenges require a rethink of the way we do business, so that it can better serve our world community. Thinking business and society together, and accounting for the political, environmental and social impacts of corporate governance, is how we bring about meaningful change. I have a strong personal interest in international social responsibility and accountability, as well as in sustainable and inclusive development that benefits the people and the planet. I want to help organisations make the right decisions and equip them with the tools, skills and insights they need to make that change happen and engage more mindfully with their environment.",
