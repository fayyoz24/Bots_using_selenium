    "summary": "I have been been exposed to all aspects of Petrophysics during my 40 years with Shell. I have worked in two separate assignments on the deployment and development of Petrophysical applications. I have worked in the United Kingdom and Oman, in which I gained skills in all aspects of well logging operations. During the last twenty years I provided support as a principal petrophysicist in the various integrated field studies, reserve estimations and data rooms. During these studies I developed strong skills in the following areas: integrating core, mud & log data, multi-mineral and fluid analysis, saturation height modeling, upscaling petrophysical properties, pressure and fluid analysis, pseudo synthetics, thin bed analysis and uncertainties. Furthermore I have worked on sandstone and carbonate reservoirs and developed skills in applying different shaly sand models and applying different workflows for difficult carbonate reservoirs (e.g. tight, fractured, argillaceous limestone, multi-pore type and chalk reservoirs).\nI concluded my career with Shell as Learning Advisor Petrophysics. I was responsible for the basic and advanced development programs of young staff and I was the course director of the basic and advanced Petrophysics global courses.",
