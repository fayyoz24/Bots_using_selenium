    "summary": "\ud83d\udccd Born and raised in one of the most beautiful capital cities in Europe: Budapest. I am a native Hungarian, fluent in English, German and at a beginner level of the French language.\n\nColleagues describe me as a warm hearted, intelligent, very calm and patient person who challenges the \"status quo\u201d while always ready to be at service for others.\n\nSince the age of  16, my kind  and outgoing personality has  made me perfectly suited  for jobs working with people. I was lucky enough to get the chance to work at the International Airport of Hungary, Budapest for more than  5 years. I was  struck by the atmosphere and the cultural diversity I found there. I spent my freetime working various part time jobs in there.  Following my studies, it  became clear  to me that I wanted to  travel and work abroad.  \n\n\ud83d\udcad ''Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls. '' \n\nMy favourite quote from Joseph Campbell that well summarizes my life in the past 10 years. \nMy bliss: a career that opened the whole world to me. \n\n\ud83d\udeeb My journey began in Cyprus with a summer job during 2015. My life since then has been transformed; I became a professional entertainer at a 5 star beach resort. Working as a kids club representative allowed me to develop my creative mindset in the workplace and my problem solving abilities. This summer proved to me that I am meant to work with people in a fun and ever changing environment. \nI also began scuba diving during this time and instantly fell in love with it. Despite my demanding schedule, I took any opportunity to dive. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize I wanted to combine my career with my passion. The decision to do so has been, by far, the best and most rewarding aspect of my life.\n\n\ud83c\udf0e It took me to places that I could only dream of: from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, with the highlight of my journey: 4 years in the Maldives. I have matured, built my resilience & independence. Only if I could prescribe traveling and working abroad to all! Such a transformative experience helped me become the best version of myself in all areas of my life.\n\n\ud83c\udf08 I have a wide range of interest from human connections, psychology, compassion based interventions, behaviour & performace improvements, food & nutrition as well as creative work such as face & body painting.",
