    "summary": "I'm specialized in Healthy Plant-Based Cooking, Food Nutrition and Recipes Development. \nI have studied Western Nutrition, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Macrobiotics. \nI have a dynamic and flexible personality - i learn fast and know very well (spoken & written) English, Dutch and Polish - my mother language. \nI like to work in a organized manner with respect to everyone in the business, as well as the clients.\nI have over 10 years of diverse cooking experience in Poland, the Netherlands and other countries in Europe.\nI have started my career as a Chef in 2009 in a small vegetarian cafe in Poland.\nIn 2011 i've moved to Amsterdam, opened my company and started to work Free-Lance in diverse positions for various Health Oriented Companies:\n-  Restaurant & Salad/Juice Bar Chef\n- Catering \n- Organizing Healthy Cooking Workshops and Presentations\n- Chef: production of Healthy Snacks for the Largest Organic Supermarket in the Netherlands - Ekoplaza \n- Co-organizing Food & Art events and Health Oriented Retreats (Food & Movement as topic) in France and in the Netherlands\n- Retreat/Festival Chef, a.o. for one of the Biggest Yoga Festivals in the Netherlands - Yoga Festival Terschelling  \n- Chef during International Macrobiotic Conferences\n- I've also worked as a Personal Chef for private customers in Amsterdam\n\nMy job at almost every restaurant was to:\n- Create a healthy dish or a new menu or to\n- Transform an existing dish/menu into a more healthy version\n\nI have experience with minimalizing the production costs and making the whole production line more efficient, simple, operating smoothly and economically sound, while still trying to make the most healthy/sustainable/environment friendly business choices by the means of: \n- Cutting down the cooking time in various ways\n- Implying different cooking techniques/tools\n- Simplifying the inventory management/minimalizing the number of suppliers whenever possible\n- Simplifying the menu: creating multi-functional half-products from which you can cook as many dishes as possible instead of that you make many preparation work for only one dish \n- Finding a smooth balance between the quality and price of inventory items: organic/non organic or industrially processed vs traditionally processed etc.\n\nThanks to my diverse Restaurant/Event/Food Production experience and Nutrition/Chinese Medicine/Macrobiotic knowledge i can help any business that wants to create a Healthy menu, a Vegan Restaurant Start-up or Wellness Center, because since 2019 i'm a internationally certified Iokai Shiatsu Therapist, besides a Vegan Chef.
