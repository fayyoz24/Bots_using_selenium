    "summary": "Kim Peters is a Eindhoven-born and based graphic designer and artist.\nHe attended TeHaTex and Academie Beeldende Vorming Tilburg before taking on his first job at Exit Magazine (early 90's) where he learned the ropes of graphic design and desktop publishing.\nKim's creative style is influenced by many things: street art, collage-stuff, typographics and old school graphic designers such as Neville Brody and Swifty, who's work was often music/subculture-related. \n\nAfter leading his own little graphic design company called Caneel, he moved to The Hague where he took on a job as art director for Zeal, a marketing company for retail businesses. It was here that he learned the values of production know-how, professional presentation, client interfacing and strategic thinking and budget management.\n\nAfter 5 years he started missing getting his own hands dirty (and also missing Brabant a bit), therefor starting Funkfabriek, a one-man visual arts studio. \nIt strives to create the most insightful, well crafted, impact full and uncompromising work possible. So no matter if you are a band trying to put out your first record or you run the largest internet browser in the world, be sure that I will treat your project with the utmost importance.",
