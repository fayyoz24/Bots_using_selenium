    "summary": "Senior Business Leader with 20 years of experience across Joint Ventures & Upstream in technical, commercial, asset development, risk, assurance and governance.  Managed up to 10 direct reports with a community of up to 200 FTEs. Highly acknowledged stakeholder management skills and delivered key improvements for decision-making in a dual-operated venture with three non-operating partners (4000 employees; total production of 240 kbbl/d) and a very complex governance structure.\n\nDelivered key changes and unpopular projects, having improved its decision-making process, de-risked business operations, scaled value assurance, transformed authorities and ways-of-working for the organization and leadership team. Further, added value with key portfolio analysis and audit insights while mitigating risks and achieving a step change in transparency and efficiency, besides of standing the ground towards partners and authority on significant HC reserves reduction and providing quality inputs and support in form of studies, analytics, field/well development, and real-time well drilling, testing and coring operations. \n\nMy stakeholder management and profound technical subsurface skills are recognized internally and externally. I pursue business objectives with integrity and no bias and consider the impact of actions and decision on safety and ethical integrity. I thrive in complex stakeholder environments and negotiate alignments to deliver value and mitigate risks.  \n\nMy approach is delivery and people focused: translating strategy into actionable steps, listening to and empowering people to deliver, and stepping-in if required. My genuine care for people and their development is reflected in my work as a coach / mentor to 50+ people over my entire career.",
