    "summary": "Currently, I am researching and analyzing for my senior thesis report on social sustainability practices associated with heritage equine tourism of a UNESCO recognized heritage site of Lipica Stud Farm, Lipica, Slovenia. \n\nI have four years of experience in business research, analysis, and writing with stakeholders passionate about sustainability practices for business development projects to advance their regional circular economy in partnership with nonprofits, customers, business partners, and government. \n\nThe Karst region of Slovenia is internationally known for sustainable tourism and nature protection practices. Providing unique opportunities for agri-tourism and heritage farm practices; critical tourism components for Slovenia. This project's focus illustrates a tourism business located in a rural environment with an equine heritage culture of more than 400 years. Understanding social sustainability needs and expectations of Lipica stakeholders can contribute to circumventing adverse impacts. How does social sustainability practices that involve equine heritage tourism take place? Is there more that Lipicia can do as they highlight their practices to meet national conservation goals?\n\nDuring my six-month internship with Dutch Cycling Embassy in Utrecht, the Netherlands, I communicated with people from all over the world who are inspired by Dutch cycling culture and are seeking more sustainable transportation and inclusive cycling for their own communities. I learned best practices for working with business partners and hosting delegations for infrastructure tours. I furthered my communication skills by planning events with my team members and the onsite hosting of clients. Technically, I advanced my WordPress, Adobe, and presentation software skills. This internship provided me with tremendous insight into the inner workings of powerful Private-Public Partnerships (PPP) in advancing sustainability goals.      \n\nIn 2022, I conducted several sustainability projects with Hogeschool Utrecht's Co-Design with Fundamentals, a dynamic international community of design professionals. Co-Design Academy students work with clients to apply the probing skills needed to understand complex societal issues to create prototypes to address potential solutions.\n\nMy first internship was in eco-agra tourism. I supported daily equine operations and the international marketing projects of riding the Frisian horse on the Island of Terschelling for a family-owned business with access rights to a national conservation area of the Wadden Islands, a UNESCO heritage site.",
