The line of this research revolves around bounded initiatives of groups who aim for the transformation of socio-technological systems, which means that consumption and production practices, social relations, norms, values, regulation and policy change together with a change of technological artefacts and physical infrastructures that have emerged with earlier unsustainable practices. An example would be a change from the current Dutch energy sector to a sustainable one in which renewable energy is produced by households, local citizen groups and local governments. I regard system innovation as the outcome of the interactions between the concrete actions of and micro-level dynamics around such initiatives, socio-technological systems resisting change and other developments like crises, normative contestation etc. While acknowledging the limited contribution of single initiatives, the aim of my work is to study as well as enhance their significance and role in transformative change towards sustainability.\nSpecific topics are: what learning processes are relevant for system innovation; the role of communication in such learning, and the ability of bounded initiatives to contribute transformative change and their interaction with the existing systems.\nNew insights on the topics above feed into the further development of the methodology of Reflexive Monitoring in Action (RMA), which aims to contribute to the emergence of new social practices and rules, by stimulating reflection and learning. RMA has a wide international uptake in among others agriculture, natural resource management and health.",
