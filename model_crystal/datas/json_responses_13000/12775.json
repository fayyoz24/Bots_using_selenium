    "summary": "I am an experienced professional ready to help you develop your (internal and external) communications strategy and craft your messages. I've had many seats at the table - representing the agency, civil society and commercial brands in consumer goods, technology and healthcare. My work has a broad reach, with extensive experience in strategies and projects that energise and motivate stakeholders to deliver in line with business priorities. Message me if you're looking to deepen your engagement and make an impact.\n\nI am a strategic thinker with a hands-on, practical approach. \n\nMy \"big picture\" thinking helps to break down complex themes into targeted approaches and clear messages.\n\nMy starting point is finding 'common ground' to motivate people towards a shared goal and exceed expectations. \n\nI believe in empowerment, integrity and collaboration. Knowledge is power and real impact only comes if we share our knowledge.",
