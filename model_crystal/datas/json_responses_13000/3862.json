    "summary": "Experienced manager with a proven track record in vendor finance and the execution of international assignments and management of teams. Implementing global sales, operations and risk strategies and leading these successfully at global and local level in a disciplined manner. I am passionate for developing people and creating professional teams that outperform objectives and deliver sustainable results. \n\nAll senior management positions involved important turn-around scenarios that required significant change management skills. Setting high quality expectations for myself and others, strong analytical skills and embracing professional challenges in an international setting have been a key success factor throughout my career.\n\nOver the last 20+ years, I have progressed my career successfully for a fast growing global financial services organization. I have worked in different Senior Management roles in 8 countries (for 12 years), among others in China, Italy and Scandinavia. As Global CRO for Siemens Financial Services COF, I will be working out of Munich Germany and be a member of the Management Board for SFS Commercial Finance and a member of the Global SFS Leadership Team. \n \nFrom a regulatory perspective, I was Statutory Director for our Italian and China (bank) legal entities and part of the Board of Directors in the USA for the joint-venture between DLL and a Dutch Global Healthcare Manufacturer. \n\nMy all-round career is furthermore enhanced by a post-academic degree in Finance and Control and Executive Education at the Wharton School of Business.\n\nPrior to working for Siemens and DLL, I was a teacher at the Finance Faculty of the University of Maastricht, in the Netherlands.\n",
