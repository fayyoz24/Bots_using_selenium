Katia and Jerson lost their house in 2012 because the river water raised to record levels. Three years later, in 2015, they struggled to grow crops and to fish due to a severe drought.\n\nThe advent of electricity in 2010 brought air conditioning changing the vernacular architecture and moving away from local knowledge and technologies. New materials that are not fit for purpose, such as aluminium roofs and PVC ceilings are also being introduced, creating hotter and more uncomfortable homes.\n\nNadir, Jerson\u2019s sister, and her family suffered dengue because of water polluted with organic matter. Due to the lack of a sewage system, families have been polluting the lake for decades increasing the chances to get water-borne diseases such as dengue.\n\nThe project aims to design and build a floating Climate Change Learning Centre as an example for best practice in construction to educate Mamori Lake people and serve as an scalable global case study. The project will be developed and constructed with local people, materials and technology while demonstrating a more resilient and comfortable dwelling type. Inspired by nature and using biomimicry, the building floats to adapt to tidal variations, is synergetic to resist strong storms, is based on passive cooling and closed loop nutrient systems, is affordable and easy to build. The centre will be sustained by a yearly program with visiting students and learning activities for the local schools and communities.\n\n\nTEAM\nAlessandra Ara\u00fajo, Andr\u00e9 Almeida, Beatriz Villar, Breno S\u00e1 Leit\u00e3o, Carolina Bins Ely, Gabriela Wiss, James Barcelona, Laura Cardone, Marko Brajovic, Mia T.

In order to illuminate these future sustainable scenarios, this Forum RXN \u201cHeritage and water \u2013 visions and strategies\u201d looks forward to contributing to another scope of benefits for innovative public politics practices.

The adopted methodology mixes own procedures of approaches to Integrated Urban Conservation, Sustainable Urban Development, Social Habitat Production and Water-Sensitive Urbanism. The participation of stakeholders linked to the territory is defined as an assumption of action, making everyone co-responsible for decisions and their application.\n\nThe RXH 2019 postulates that the realization of a Future Vision for the Sustainable Development of the Island of Ant\u00f4nio Vaz, with the Integrated Conservation of its Cultural Heritage, must be achieved through transformations in two scales: in an endogenous level to the island, in the scale of integration of the various sectors that compose it and the dynamism and complementarity between its specific dynamics; at an exogenous level, in its physical and functional articulation with the city as a whole, in the midst of the projected macro-territorial changes and the impacts exerted by them, from outside to inside the island and vice versa.",

It gave the opportunity to open discussions on important urban challenges and questions, such as how to plan and manage cities, towns and villages for sustainable development. The discussion of these questions shapes the implementation of new global development and climate change goals. In particular, the conference elaborates on Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals: \"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.\"\n\nHabitat III invited all Member States and relevant stakeholders, including parliamentarians, civil society organizations, regional and local government and municipality representatives, professionals and researchers, academia, foundations, women and youth groups, trade unions, and the private sector, as well as organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental organizations.\n\nAbout 30,000 people in total attended the conference, which was based at the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana in Quito 2016.",
