    "summary": "My name is Giacomo Zagami an I\u2019m Italian. I was born in Ivrea on the 22th of October in 1989. Ivrea is a small town in Piemonte (Italy).  In 2001 I moved to Veneto with my brother and parents. For financial reasons I was unable to finish school completely, and started working full time at a age of 16 at the construction industrie. At the age of 18 I started working in the catering industry in Italy. During my work in Italy I met a Dutch girl called Anne-Sophie toghether we worked the last three years in Ibiza (Spain). There I was learning the Spanish language and improving my horeca skills. After the summer season I decided to move to The Netherlands with my girlfriend. She already found a job and now it\u2019s my turn to find job. I\u2019m looking forward to this new experience and learning more about the Dutch culture and its traditions. I will also will do my best to be able to speak the Dutch language in a short term. I like to run or go tot the gym to stay fit. Cooking is one of my passion and I like to spend time with my friends and family. \n\nI'm seeking for a job!  \n",
