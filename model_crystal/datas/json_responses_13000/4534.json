    "summary": "I\u2019m a passionate business leader with a reputation for sales performance, innovative thinking, strong commercial acumen and a loyal network of customers, suppliers and peers. My leadership style is that of a light touch for high outcomes, honed through many years of delivering through 3rd party intermediaries.\nMy business skills were forged in an international bank, working with terminal or near-terminal businesses to shut down or manage them back to profitability.\nI\u2019ve been involved in the Australian arms of two \u2018start-ups\u201d and for four and a half years I ran my own fleet consultancy business. I also incubated seven start-up franchisees in a finance based start-up franchisor.\nIn 2015 I conceptualised OviDrive. Artificial Intelligence had become mainstream, OBD technologies became cheaper and dependable, and software-as-a-service substantially dropped the cost to maintain an ERP system. This confluence sparked OviDrive, the only platform in the world that uses real-time data, machine learning and AI to automate vehicle and fleet management. \nRecognising early that Sustainability and Mobility- As-a-Service would change the fleet landscape we pre-positioned as a supply-side enabler. I\u2019m now taking a more vocal role in the future of business mobility. I am a firm believer that congestion and pollution can be curtailed through advanced logistics and utilisation management. Having worked in small businesses through to large corporates, I have a deep understanding of the time constraints we all have, and token gestures are simply no longer enough -systems need to act on our behalf! I\u2019m proud to have been instrumental in the delivery of a system that will remove unnecessary vehicles from the roads, have a positive environmental impact and actively influence businesses toward efficient mobility practices.",
