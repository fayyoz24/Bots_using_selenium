This means registering, modeling in Cyclone, LMR or PDMS and texturing in 3D Max, as well as helping my colleges to laser scan sites. I know how to use the Z+F Imager 5006h and the Leica HDS3000. I used constantly Photoshop, Autocad and 3D Studio Max to improve projects' presentations. During my last year I was also in charge of the LFM-AVEVA software sales and support.\n\nAs project leader of the petrochem department I was responsible for the planning, development and delivery of projects.\n\nDelftForensics is a part of DelftTech that has its own Forensic related software (3D Blood Pattern Analysis, 3D Suspect Measurement and Point Force) for which I worked as the tech support helpdesk.  \n\nI was the interns' tutor too. \n\nBesides all this, I was also in charge of the marketing and sales department, specialized (of course) in the Spanish market. I contacted customers, designed flyers, wrote a quarterly newsletter, designed business cards and took care of the stand of the company in all gathering events.",
