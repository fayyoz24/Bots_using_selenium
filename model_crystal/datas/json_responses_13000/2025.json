It evolved in the inititation, co-ordination and execution of a Datamanagement improvement plan. Furthermore acting as the IT focal point for both teams with the emphasis on monitoring the implementation and testing of the IT infrastructure. For the Pearl project the seismic re-processing has been managed. For the same Pearl project responsible for the acquisition and processing of the Zero-offset VSP's. Theme Lead for seismically constrained reservoir modeling (XStream), thereby responsible for technical context definition and execution. The Middle East focal point for XStream developments and deployment. A research proposal has been written for the application of novel multiple elimination techniques and tests using synthetic seismic data. This research would enable further QI studies for the Pearl project. Detailed seismic to well tie studies has been done for the Qatar Shell projects, Pearl and QatarGas 34 (QG34) which has resulted in recognised improvements in the interpretation. An image enhancement project with Shell's SIPMAP seismic processing has been done for QG34 which has resulted in improved seismic data quality and enabled refined interpretation.",

The Quantitative Interpretation (QI) and seismic inversion application to the large-scale Lunskoye IRM project. The aim of this project is to assist in getting better value from the Lunskoye oil and gas development by delivering Integrated Reservoir Model(s). The secondary objective is to demonstrate the value-proposition of XStream.I have been a member of the virtual deployment team for XStream whereby I represented the Lunskoye IRM team and in this role have extensive engagement with the EP R&D teams. I presented a paper on XStream under the title, Challenges for reservoir modeling. How to optimally use seismic in the modeling workflow at the 2004 ISC. The Integrated Subsurface Conference chairpersons recognized this paper as an excellent presentation and as such it is published as an article in the special EP-Journal of Technology in Shell. As a member of Shell\u2019s Jason steering group I act as the global inversion services representative. In this role, I liaise on behalf of the global user community with both Shell subsurface software portfolio management and Fugro-Jason for improvements in the Jason workbench. At regular occasions acting as mentor or coach for inexperienced staff in Integrated QI studies.",
