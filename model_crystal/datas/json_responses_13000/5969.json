    "summary": "I am a creative and goal-oriented team player who tenaciously pursues organizational objectives. I specialize in connecting people, organizations, and ideas to create synergies and in combining creative problem-solving with focused planning and execution. I encourage others to challenge the status quo and become active participants in creating simple and sustainable solutions.  I have over 25 years of experience cutting across both public and private sectors.  I led multi-disciplinary teams within Canada\u2019s Special Operations Forces, spear-headed Canadian Armed Forces cyber operations training and education programs, and facilitated flagship interoperability initiatives at NATO Headquarters.  During the last 10 years, I've supported the successful growth of three separate defence and security companies during their start-up phase.  I am very proud to be part of a tremendous team at Reticle that is helping to solve wicked problems across many sectors by leveraging the power of teams.",
