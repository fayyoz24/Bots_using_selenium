    "summary": "For the past 20 years I have navigated all the spheres of communications-related occupations in the media, education, fashion, art and cultural sectors. \n\nI hold an MA in Critical Fashion Practices, a BA in Multimedia and a Postgrad Diploma in Marketing Management. Even though these fields seem unrelated, they all focus on how people communicate and interact, what their values are and how they show affiliation. Regardless of the industry, as long as my work is people-focused, I thrive. \n\nI have worked in South Africa, Botswana, China, Japan and the Netherlands. After 2 decades I have built up a myriad of skills, starting with content creation then moving to optimisation and dissemination of content. I later started managing large projects as well as training and coaching children and adults in the classroom and online. This broad exposure has enabled me to acquire a wide range of practical, teaching, intercultural and decision-making skills that serves the role of Facilitator and Project Manager well. The following outlines the main principles that guide my coaching and management styles.\n\nHave a system: Whether drafting strategic and project plans with various stakeholders or developing a curriculum is important to be detailed, concise and relay conceptual theory in easy-to-digest chunks.\n\nCommunicate:  It\u2019s good to have frequent and open communication on what goals need to be accomplished and what milestones to reach to accomplish these goals. Coworkers and learners need to feel safe, confident and supported to achieve success.\n\nBe responsive: The zeitgeist is forever changing. Whether it is transferring skills for a 360 turnkey project or transferring skills to leaners I encourage myself and others to not get stuck on legacy issues or be averse to learning new concepts and behaviours. \n\nInvite co-creation: Collect all the voices and elicit user participation in everything from institutional plans to brand identity. Centre the content strategies around the people that are using the content.\n\nEmpower them: People from diverse backgrounds are participating in the globalized world. My philosophy is to imbue everyone with agency and respect by investing in succession planning and making sure that responsibility is distributed.\n\nFocus on the future: I help people cultivate a deeper understanding of the inter-and intra-connectedness between the self, other people, nature, things, space, and time. This style of exploration will hopefully motivate and inspire humanity to play an active role in tackling societal issues.",
