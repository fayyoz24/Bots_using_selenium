    "summary": "VERA DANILOVA\nwas born in the Republic of Macedonia.\nAfter completing her studies in singing and piano in Skopje, she was accepted at the Accademia d\u2019arte lirica e corale di Osimo (Italy), mentored by the music impresario Sergio Segalini and Raina Kabaivanska.\nShe continued her education at the Music Academy in Ljubljana, Slovenia where she graduated in singing with honours. During her studies there, Vera won several competitions and sang in many concerts. It was while she was a student that she made her Opera debut singing Adina in L\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore. She was awarded the student\u2019s Preseren prize (Pre\u0161ernova nagrada), the highest award for an artist in Slovenia for extraordinary achievements in music.\nWhile still a student at the Academy, she became a member of the Opera studio at the Slovenian National opera in Ljubljana and at the age of 25 she became a soloist. She sang leading opera roles from belcanto to modern composers: Norina (Don Pasqale), Berenice (L\u2019occasione fa il ladro), Die Prinzessin (Die Prinzessin auf der Erbse), Bubikopf (Der Kaiser von Atlantis), Adele (Die Fledermaus), Rosaura (Le Donne Curiose), Sophie Uhlich or Madame Herz in the original version (Der Schauspieldirektor) and others. She has worked with conductors such as Dieter Rossberg, Uro\u0161 Lajovic, Milivoj \u0160urbek, Borut Smrekar, Toshio Janagisava etc. and with the stage directors Gregor Horres, Manfred Schweigkofler, Diego de Brea, Vinko M\u00f6derndorfer, Henrik Neubauer etc. \nShe performs as a concert singer and has a wide repertoire, from opera arias to chamber music. She has recorded for the Slovenian National Radio and featured in several theater productions.\nHer cooperation with the Slovenian pianist Erik \u0160uler resulted in many highly successful projects and recitals throughout the country. Starting with Rachmaninoff\u2019s romances, later their repertory was expanded and they added other Russian, German and Italian chamber music.\nSince 2015 Vera Danilova lives in Maastricht, The Netherlands.",
