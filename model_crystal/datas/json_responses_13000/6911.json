I believe that digitalization and technology can move the world forward, and I would like to be a part of it.\n\nEverything you do right now ripples outward and affects everyone. Your posture can shine your heart or transmit anxiety. Your breath can radiate love or muddy the room in depression. Your glance can awaken joy. Your words can inspire freedom. Your every act can open hearts and minds.\n- David Deida",
