    "summary": "English LanguageTeacher and ESOL Tutor 1980-2012\n\nI started out as a primary teacher but fairly soon I moved on to teaching at secondary and tertiory level where I specialised in teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and providing Learning Support to individual learners or small groups of students. In the last 8 years I have worked in adult education as a Teacher Trainer to improve Student Literacy Learning at secondary school and  recently I have returned to teaching ESOL as an EnglishTrainer in the business sector. \n\nHaving specialised in Learning Support and ESOL for so many years, I have become very skilled at adapting to and providing for the specific needs and objectives of the students and clients I work with. First and foremost this requires involving the student and their particular interests. Student motivation, enjoyment and working on their own specific learning objectives are key.",
