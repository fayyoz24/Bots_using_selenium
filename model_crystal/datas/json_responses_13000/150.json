    "summary": "I'm an experienced CELTA certified Native English Teacher having taught for 13 years with 5000 hours + EFL teaching experience, which includes 4 years at Universities. I help students improve their English language skills. Since November 2011, I've owned my own company: D.I. Linguistic Solutions. Born in London, I'm a native speaker.  Nowadays, I live and work in the Netherlands. I've taught international students from 4-92 years old, ranging from A1-C2. Also, I've been offering correction work services since 2011.\n\nI have given teacher training workshops for teachers on presentation skills, creativity and teacher talking time. I have also taught two teacher training courses (ROC Mondriaan, Hotelschool). In February 2018 I passed DELTA module 1, which focuses on understanding language, methodology and resources for teaching.\n\nI wrote, edited & independently published The EFL Teacher's Handbook in 2017 ( http://a.co/0UHVMnv), and, a year later, The EFL Teacher's Companion (http://a.co/eZN2ped) and EFL Resources: 20 Writing Assignments (http://a.co/d/dpkLSqJ). The latest teaching-related enterprise is EFL Blogs (2019). I'm also a blogger for iamexpat.nl and contributor for EFL Magazine.\n\nFollowing on from my film background, I wrote and self-published: Top 100 Films: Film Criticism, Trivia and Lists (2020). In addition - as a homage to Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), one of my favourite writers, and in keeping with one of my great passions, which is travelling, I have also written and self-published World Traveller (2020) and film-related: Catharsis (2021), Homage (2022) and Do I Amuse You? (2023)\n\nTeaching: I give Business English lessons: online, in-house/ in-company, and Cambridge examining is on the side.  \n\nI have also facilitated Effective Business Communication at Erasmus University, taught Academic English (EAP), English for Biomedical Sciences, Academic English for the Sciences (AES) and the Social Sciences, Writing for Publication for highly motivated BA / MA students at the University of Utrecht, and EAP & General English at University of Leiden in Den Haag and Leiden.\n\nAdditionally, I've helped students privately with exam preparation (B2 First and C1 Advanced), taught General English at various centres, at SWOP, I taught senior citizens integrated skills for over 5 years, private lessons for 6, and, lastly, I taught teenagers exam preparation classes at Winford college.\n\nSpecialities: \n\n* Personal approach\n* Great communication skills\n* Humour\n* Creativity \n* Enthusiasm\n* Creating courses\n* Designing material",
