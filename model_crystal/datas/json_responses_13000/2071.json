    "summary": "I have multidisciplinary background from Industrial Engineering,Children Education, and Oil and Gas Industry. \nBefore continuing my master, i got 6.5 years experiences working in Oil and gas industry, specialize in Stimulation and Production Enhancement, with two different major Oil Service Company. During my career, i had different role  from preparing the logistics and executing the job, until dealing with the technical issue, designing a fracturing/ stimulation job, and presenting the design and results (DEE) to other parties. I benefited by the chance to work in five different locations around the world with people from various nationalities with their respective roles.\n\nRight now I'm doing my master thesis with focusing in geomechanic and network fracture analysis in various oil and gas reservoir rocks, such as shale, limestone, and sandstone, with one of the case studies is in Posidonia Shale Formation. This requires the understanding of petrophysics, geomechanics, and network characterization.\n\nI am interested in Reservoir and Production Engineering role.\n\nSkills and Specialities: Production Optimization, Fracturing, Acidizing, Sand Control, Nodal Analysis, Familiar with FDP, Petrel, Economic Analysis.",
