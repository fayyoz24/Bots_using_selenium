Since April of this year I am a permanent member of the team, and I enjoy handling all kinds of questions and requests concerning online bookings and reservations, hereby getting acquainted with the different kinds of programs we offer and what types of issues occur. In my double role for the Rijksmuseum I can manage issues and questions twice as efficient, and I serve as a link between the two teams, sharing important information and coordinating certain shared processes, suggesting improvements in the processes, and executing these. In the end both teams share the main goal of providing the best possible service for our visitors, and I feel I can really contribute in realizing this goal.",
