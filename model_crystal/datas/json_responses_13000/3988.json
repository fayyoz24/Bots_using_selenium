I also gained experience in the finance (Deloitte), advertising (Publicis\u00a0Media), FMCG and chemical (Henkel) industries. At Ingka (IKEA Retail), my mandate is to support the company's digital transformation by driving the adoption of data in decision making. \n\nI have worked on projects delivering solutions for media planning and buying, CRM, loyalty programs, marketing efficiency, consumer insights, product development, operations optimisation, business modelling, etc. My consulting experience ranges from automotive, cosmetics, FMCG, and luxury, through retail and e-commerce to hospitality and telecommunications.\n\nI have a great passion for sports analytics and Chinese proverbs.",
