    "summary": "Expert in Pharmacovigilance with more than 20 years of experiance, medical doctor by training and specialist in clinical pharmacology. Started to work in the Univeristy hospital in the Unit of Clinical pharmacology joining the National ADR monitoring centre in 1991.  In 2005 joined the Croatian medicines agency (HALMED) with the task to develop the Pharmacovigilance department joining the EU regulatory network. After that I was four years in the role of the Director of HALMED in the time when Croatia joined the EU.  After two years in  World Health Organization (WHO) in HQ in Geneva I am starting again in the European Medicines Agency now in Amsterdam. I enjoy the work in the European and international environment and hope to contribute in providing better health and access to safe medicines to people in Europe and worldwide.",

This aims to support further development of Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP) and other guidance in this area.\n\nEMA will ensure compatibility of WEB-RADR deliverables with EU law, EU systems and GVP modules. This will also ensure consistency with ongoing work in other European forums and facilitate consultation with EMA\u2019s Health Care Professionals Working Party (HCPWP), the Patients and Consumer Working Party (PCWP) and the EudraVigilance Expert Working Group (EV-EWG). Further, technical expertise will ensure compatibility of Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) reporting standards, and associated product dictionaries.\n\n\nThe WEB-RADR project is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) under grant agreement n\u00b0 115632, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies\u2019 in kind contribution.",
