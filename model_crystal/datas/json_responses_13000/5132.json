    "summary": "Often we give up too quickly to find a solution because the problems seem to be too complicated. I believe that it needs interdisciplinary approaches to face wicked problems. This is why I am passionate about studying the BSc Global Studies in Maastricht, a truly interdisciplinary program that gives me insights into different disciplines such as law, economics, psychology and data science.\n\nToo often academic disciplines compete with each other instead of cooperating to implicate their findings into efficient policies. But why is interdisciplinarity so important? Because no discipline has all answers and is only a part by definition. Bringing disciplines together allows us to access a wider variety of ways to consider solutions for ongoing challenges.\n\nMy time as a professional athlete taught me how important it is to work together in a team to be successful. I am enjoying working together with people who share the same interests and visions as I do. I am eager to learn as well as to bring in already gained experience into all different kinds of projects.",
