I feel that these shape the foundation that allow development and sophistication to flourish. The last couple of years, I have focused much on the energy industry across the width of the whole power space. Having worked in the Oil & Gas sector and later on moving on to cleantech, I understand the potential of a diversified energy mix. After this, I also took on a role of diplomat for the Govt of India, that allowed me to understand the profound connection between government and corporate and by extension entrepreneurs to sustain society\u2019s welfare. Currently, I work at an investment fund that focuses on the sustainable energy transition \u2013 which allows me to work with entrepreneurs who share this passion. \nI always look to deliver optimal results with a slight obsession for efficiency. My broad, international orientation allows me to understand the bigger scheme of things \u2013 which strengthens my entrepreneurial nature. My tools are listening, sympathizing, networking, speaking and resilience. I am a natural communicator that brings practical solutions by learning and adapting fast. \n",

Oemrawsingh and supported by Rotary Club The Hague Metropolitan. \n\nThe Rotary year 2023-2024 will be focused on raising awareness and funds surrounding this program and subject. \n\nThe Generation HealthWise project is a preventive healthcare program about the importance of healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle, focused to raise awareness among children at risk of health disadvantages. The program aims to educate children, parents and communities in an accessible and interactive way to empower them to make healthy choices and improve their quality of life. Through educational materials, workshops and community engagement, we aim to help these children take preventive measures against diseases related to poor diet and lifestyle. Further, Generation Healthwise aims to bridge the health gap and empower children with health disadvantages to embrace a healthy future. By equipping children, parents, and communities with knowledge and practical tools, we strive to create lasting change at both the individual and community level.\n\nMore info on the project is at www.generationhealthwise.com.

Abu, India,  offers healthcare free of charge to the extended local community. Outreach programmes that visit 52+ rural villages, daily lunch programs at 46+ schools are not uncommon to this charitable hospital. \n\nHowever, the hospital faces high overhead costs which are challenging to cover since most donations are earmarked for healthcare. Thus, the hospital came up with an innovative plan to engineer a solar energy plant on the rooftop of the hospital to the scale of 82kW. This supplies the hospital with 50% of its power need by means of own generation. During this operation, I fulfill the project manager role, together with a team of engineers and benefactors we worked to realize this aim. \n\nDuring the fund raising stage, I gave talks on the hospital\u2019s work and this project \u2013 which resulted in the Rotary International adopting the project. This adoption ultimately led to raising sufficient funds. Currently, the solar system is operational and achieving the aforementioned targets. The new project is focused on a full-fledged sustainability program to make Global Hospital & Research Center the most energy-efficient hospital \u2013 ultimately contributing to curing both man and nature. \n"
