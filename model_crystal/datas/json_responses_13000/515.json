    "summary": "I work as an independent Business Community Builder and have spent over '10.000 hours' in \"organizing value\" by connecting people, ideas and organizations in Business Communities since 1988. I seek to \u201corganize serendipity\u201d i.e. my experience is that unexpected great value is often to be found by bringing different communities in contact with each other. This has resulted in numerous Program Management and consultancy positions focussed on bringing together Information Technology, Innovation and Impact.\n\nOne of my key communities is the 'Institute for Accountability in the Digital Age' (I4ADA) which I chair. The institute was set up in 2017 at the instigation of UNESCO to seek 21st-century solutions on how to manage accountability in the Digital Age. To help find these solutions I4ADA is connecting a global multi stakeholder community consisting of national and local governments, international policy makers and institutes, NGOs, civil society, the ICT industry and platforms, as well as other relevant organizations.\n\nI have been invited to speak at or moderate numerous events around the world. I have presented in Africa, Australia, China, Europe, India, New Zealand, South-Korea, Sri Lanka, the United States. I advise and coach organizations and other communities on community building, collaboration and strategy - the shift from \u201cCommand-and-Control\u201d to \"Connect-and-Collaborate\" thinking. Examples include IT-Circle Netherlands, IPBPM - Portugal, General Council - Netherlands, Dutch Government Innovation Community - Netherlands, Innovation Network Flemish Government. I work on a couple of pro-bono projects including the ITU AI for Good Global Summit, YPO's Impact Summit and Digital Africa. I have written various articles for BPtrends, Executive People and BPMagazine.\n\nI have developed my expertise through various senior commercial positions with a number of organizations including Logica, Cambridge Technology Partners and Staffware/Tibco. Since 2009 I am self-employed\u200b.",

And, most people don't see it.\n\nKorstmos is my metaphor for 'Connect-and-Collaborate\": it requires a particular mind-set, each stake holder has to benefit, collaboration can be found anywhere, it takes time to build up trust, good collaboration is often transparent.",
