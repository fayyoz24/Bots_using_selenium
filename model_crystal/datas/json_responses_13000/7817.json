    "summary": "I am a driven and disciplined graduate with 2 masters degrees in Literary Studies (research) and Old Testament. I taught both disciplines at college and university level. I speak 4 languages fluently and  I am good at 2 classical languages. My knack for languages makes me a good translator. \nI love reading hence my 2nd masters in Literary studies and I also love politics. I did a Dutch Christian Union Party masters class called \u201cMasterclass Veelkleurig Talent van de ChristenUnie\u201d; an introductory course to the  non-Dutch on the Dutch political system and the objectives and the ideology of the Christian Union Party. I am therefore a good debater and presenter and I want to be part of the policy making process or at least influence the process of policy making be it directly or indirectly.\nI am also a researcher but I am also passionate about my current job as a teacher of English language. Some of the qualities one needs to have as a teacher and which I possess are: the ability to listen, empathy, patience, a good communicator, a policy maker, being a mother (in my case because I am a woman), being computer savvy (IT and Microsoft), problem solver, a good presenter, translator (particularly if you teach English as a second or third language). The list is endless. \n\nMy hobbies are reading and running.",
