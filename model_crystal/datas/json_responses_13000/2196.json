You do the math. \n\nWithin 3 days, over 3 million square meters were surveyed \u00e1nd processed into highly detailed charts and graphs, revealing some extraordinary claims, which can\u2019t be denied.. A professional documentary team joined the project and filmed the adventures of this ones-in-a-lifetime expedition. \nMore details and documentary will be disposable upon request.\n",
