In a strictly Islamic country such as Pakistan and in a very conservative area such as the SWAT region projects encounter problems in reaching their (female) target group, whereas alienation with the male population is to be prevented.\nMy role included both the organizing and documenting of these workshops, in close collaboration with the chair preparation of both agenda and invitations to meetings, contacting guest speakers and maintaining contact between the donor-financed projects within the region.",
