                    "description": "A R&D MSc. thesis project on the applicability and development of improvements in de-noising algorithms to the music recording industry. The main themes of this work were signal processing, statistics, and noise removal. My work culminated in an algorithm capable of removing random (white/coloured) noise from audio recordings, while leaving the musical signal largely intact.\nSupervised from ETH Z\u00fcrich.",
