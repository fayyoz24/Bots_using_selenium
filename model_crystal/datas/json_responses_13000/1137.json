    "summary": "I am a versatile and curious geoscientist specialising in remote sensing with experience in geology and geophysics. I have an avid interest in natural sciences, energy, environment and sustainability sectors which is why I chose to specialize in Remote Sensing for Earth Sciences at ITC.\nMy work involves processing and interpretation of remotely acquired data, ranging from satellite to airborne and spectro-radiometric sensors. I have also been extensively involved in a range of projects in crop monitoring, mineral exploration, mining and environmental sustainability with demonstrated technical, analytical and project development skills. \nResults of my work are applicable for digital data extraction, geo-informationrelevant to geological applications, environmental and natural resources monitoring. \nMy personal interests include the use of data/digital products in geological remote sensing, Geo-information management,communication hyperspectral imaging (spectroscopy), and development of image processing strategies. \nI am self-motivated, driven, focused and I have the ability to challenge myself and others to add value and team advancement. I find it necessary to be diligent and thorough, whilst simultaneously giving room to innovation and creativity. \nI seek opportunities where I can learn and grow with industry experts and one day  to be an all-round remote sensing specialist.",
