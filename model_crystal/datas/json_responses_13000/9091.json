Ongoing professional and personal development help me brush my legal and creative skills, alongside coaching mindset while maintaining high level of performance, work ethics and good sense of humor as integrated part of my daily work flow. \n\nBEING LEGAL & BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL IS NOT ALL I DO \nAs a long time meditator, yoga practitioner, & organisational coach (ICF - ACC), I am enthusiastic about human well-being.
