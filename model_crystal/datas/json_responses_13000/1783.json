    "summary": "Teaching English is my main expertise, with 8 years happily spent in classrooms. I have a love for vocabulary and finding the exact words for a translation, not only literally but also in the sense of the message/sentiment that is being conveyed. \nBecause of this I devour books. For fun and educational purposes, from philosophy and classics to sci-fi and mythology. \nTeaching is undeniably connected to learning thus as a teacher you must continue to learn and develop yourself, it's not just up to your students to progress. As a fast and fervent learner I strive to expand my skills and knowledge.\n\nBesides teaching I have a fair share of experience in the hospitality branch. This means that I have a strong focus on the client at all times. Adapting to the individual and being creative are valuable qualities which I definitely possess.\nI have also learnt to be clear, a fast thinker, concise when it comes to communication, organised and meticulously clean. This, naturally comes with a loving weakness for food and drink related subjects.\n\nIn the future I'm hoping to find a pleasant work place where I can continue to grow as a professional as well as a person.",

This whilst making sure to not disturb guests in any way. Besides cleaning rooms and common areas, organising and restocking storage was also part of the daily tasks.\n\nAs far as my internship is concerned I very much love food and especially adapting dishes to specific diets/wishes. However what I ended up really missing was the connection with whom you are doing the work for, your diners. My responsibilities were mainly related to preparing cooks stations and produce as far as possible before service, receiving and putting away ordered produce, independently managing breakfast service, managing a share of the lunch service, assisting other cooks where needed and cleaning/storing according to health and safety regulations.",
