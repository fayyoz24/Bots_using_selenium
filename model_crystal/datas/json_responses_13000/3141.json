    "summary": "I am a banking and investment professional with over 10 years\u2019 experience in international consulting and 20 years\u2019 experience in development/sustainable finance. Having worked in different roles, organizations and countries, I am able to take a holistic perspective on dilemma's. I gained diverse knowledge and experiences in various areas including risk management, project/change management, impact investing, CDD/KYC, business development, retail & SME banking, microfinance.\n\nAs a great connecter I like to match solutions to problems and overcome challenges. I can easily learn a new subject, initiate and take charge of a new project or an initiative. I am good at cross-functional collaboration and project work. My enthusiasm, down-to-earth mentality and perseverance enable me to get things done.\n\nNowadays companies in all industries are facing digital transformation, increasing competition and tougher regulation. They must adopt quickly to stay relevant and ahead of competition in a rapidly evolving environment. Over the past decade, I have been focusing on risk management and earned a couple of risk management certifications. Among my projects, I conducted a number of risk management assessments of financial institutions as a PRMIA\u2019s certified independent institutional assessor in risk management by summarizing how they scored on strategic, governance, credit, financial and operational risks and consequently, guided them to improve their risk management system. In the period of 2018 \u2013 2019, I served as a Deputy Chairperson of the PRMIA\u2019s member-led working group that was formed to discuss and work on operational risk in Microfinance. \n\nSo I can help companies to implement a systematic risk management approach to cope with challenges of transformation, growth and regulation complexity. I believe that my wealth of knowledge and experience would make me a valuable asset to many businesses seeking an expert in risk management. \n\nI am currently working as a consultant at PROX6 \u2013 a Dutch consulting company. Feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin to discuss how I can add value to your business. \n\nHighest degree: MSc degree in International Management from Radboud University (2009).\n\nCertificates: PRINCE2 Foundation (2023), Professional Scrum Product Owner I (2023), Professional Scrum Master I (2023), CDD (2023), IBM Professional Data Science Certificate (2022), PRMIA\u2019s Certified Independent Institutional Assessor in Risk Management (2017), a Certified Expert in Risk Management (2013). \n\nLanguages: English, Dutch, Russian and Ukrainian.\n\nNationality: Dutch.",
