    "summary": "Dr. Liu is a PI at Beijing Institute of Genomics, a professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and an assistant professor at Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam. Dr. Liu received BSc in 1999 in clinical medicine from Shandong Medical University in China. He obtained MSc (2003), DSc (2004), and PhD (2009) in genetic epidemiology from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands (promotor: Prof. Dr. Cornelia van Duijn). In 2009, Dr. Liu pursued his postdoctoral research at the Department of Forensic Molecular Biology (now department of Genetic Identification, head: Prof. Dr. Manfred Kayser). He was awarded with EUR Fellowship and was promoted to assistant professor in 2012. In 2015, Dr. Liu was awarded with a prestige Chinese recruiting grant and consequently joint Beijing Institute of Genomics. Over years, Dr. Liu made systematic discoveries in the field of genetic epidemiology in explaining the heritability and identifying novel genetic factors for human complex traits and disorders. He dicovered a large number of DNA variants and epigenomic markers highly informative for accurate prediction of human appearance traits; his work laid the foundation for two DNA test systems for predicting eye color and hair color, which are already in use for forensic and anthropological applications internationally. He has published over 80 scientific articles on SCI journals including over 20 first/corresponding author papers published on journals such as Nat Genet, Am J Hum Genet, eLife, Curr Bio, PLoS Genet, Hum Mol Genet, Hum Genet, and Forensic Sci Int Genet.\nORCID: 0000-0001-9241-8161\n\nAs part of my employment at the Beijing Institute of Genomics Chinese Academy of Sciences (BIG), in 1st July, 2017, I started to collaborate with scientists from the Beijing Institute of Forensic Sciences, Chinese Ministry of Public Security. This scientific collaboration concerned statistical analyses of genomic and epigenomic data my group at BIG carried out. These data were provided to my group at BIG by the Institute of Forensic Sciences as part of this scientific collaboration. The samples from which these data were generated had been collected by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. After the collaborative papers had been published, this scientific collaboration was discontinued from my side in May, 2019.",

One important component of PM is the use of an individual\u2019s genomic information to offer the individual most effective treatment or preventive schema for certain diseases. It is thus critical to better understand how genomic information can be translated to human phenotypes and disease. In our department we aim to study the complex structure of the human genome and various types of genetic and non-genetic variation; develop efficient and powerful pipelines to uncover associations between genome variation and human complex traits including common diseases; and to access the use of next-generation sequencing for solving diagnostic dilemmas. Our research lines also have a clinical focus, where we aim to develop and evaluate the clinical utility of new tests; prenatal carrier testing and newborn screening for Mendelian diseases; predictive tests for common and complex diseases; and pharmacogenomic testing for selecting the most effective drug with the minimal adverse effect. Besides medicine related applications, we aim to develop prediction models for human externally visible traits that are useful in forensic investigations.",
