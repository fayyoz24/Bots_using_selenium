    "summary": "As founder & design director of Formworks since 2001, I have developed a passion for designing environments for acute mental healthcare and people living with dementia. I particularly enjoy working with clients and stakeholders to deliver complex briefs where no previous precedent existed including in remote and regional areas of Western Australia.\n\nAn example is the $30m Lime Street crisis and aged care facility. A first for Western Australia, the project provides an integrated accommodation model including dementia specific aged-care, crisis and transitional accommodation supported by onsite support services. Completed in 2013, the building was an immediate success as a vibrant new community for the formerly homeless and their service providers. The project received the Australian Institute of Architects (WA) Harold Krantz Award for Multi-Residential Architecture, and two UDIA WA Awards for Excellence including the Presidents Award and Sustainable Urban Development Award.\n\nIn 2018, as project director and design leader, I assisted SwanCare in designing the first purpose designed, \u2018whole of building approach\u2019 to dementia care. With a budget of $34m, I worked closely with their executive team and operational staff to design a facility that would seamlessly accommodate both individual and elderly couples requiring different levels of dementia and high care living.\n\nMore recently, in 2021 I worked as a subject matter expert to develop the design for the new secure Delirium Ward at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. It has been a resounding success for staff, patients and visiting families alike with patients transitioning with ease to their new environment. Staff have reported significant reductions in safety incidents, which were previously occurring daily, with no reported code blacks in the first four weeks.\n\nI am currently undertaking a Churchill fellowship, researching the latest designs from the UK, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands looking at how psychiatric wards can be humanised. In particular, I will look at evidence-based design features that reduce incidents of seclusion & suicide and improve staff safety as well as patient outcomes.",

However, EDs are not adequately designed as entry points to the mental health system. People may leave ED before receiving the mental health care they need. Others find themselves in institutionalised in-patient facilities that stigmatise their situation, isolate them from the community and hinder recovery. My project will research psychiatric facilities where design of the physical environment plays a key role in improving psychiatric care and normalising the mental health care environment. The solutions involve an integrated design approach for EDs, in-patient facilities and out-patient facilities.",
