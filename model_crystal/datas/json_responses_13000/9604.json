My primary responsability is that of Deputy general manager of the Dutch Payments Association. I know and feel 2015 will be an extremely challenging, interesting and exciting year for payments and payments people around the world -or, as one of my former bosses would call us: The Tribe. He was so right - payments people are different. I have been working in the payments industry for more than 25 years now and every year it has become more exiting. Happy New Payments Year!",
