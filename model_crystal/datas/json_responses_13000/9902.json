    "summary": "My name is Juan Cruz. I grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina, partly in a bustling city and partly in a quiet village. I have lived in three continents and have had the opportunity to experience vastly different cultures, from my European roots to the inevitable Latin influences and an unlikely Asian touch. Along the way, I have picked up a few languages: Spanish, English, Korean, a bit of Italian, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Oh, right. I worked as a software engineer for about five years. During this time, I worked on projects ranging from ad campaigns for Oreo and Philco to apps and data analytics dashboards for big names like the Argentinean Football Association (AFA), the national football team \u26bd.\n\nHowever, I wanted to do more than just code, so I moved to Amsterdam to study Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit, hoping that AI would allow me to work on more innovative ideas. Well, during the third year of my studies, I took a minor in neuroscience, which led me on an unexpected journey into entrepreneurship. During this minor, I learned about some of the applications for fungi that are currently being researched, from packaging insulation to treating psychological disorders and even 'growing' space stations. But one particular application that caught my attention is mycofiltration, which involves removing pollutants from water using fungi. I stumbled upon this concept during the farmers' protests that were taking place all over the Netherlands, and for me, it seemed like an obvious path to explore as a potential solution.\n\nNow, I finally have a chance to pursue my lifelong dream. In 2023, I founded MycoFarming with three good friends to put an end to the farmers' crisis. There is a real problem that needs to be addressed: our farms are leaking nutrients (nitrogen depositions), which is both a waste of resources and a source of pollution. At MycoFarming, we are collaborating with one of the world's leading experts in mycofiltration to bring this innovation from the lab to our farms. In addition to this biological innovation, we are also designing nitrogen sensors to detect areas of high emissions in pasture areas. With these innovations that blend science, technology, and nature, I hope to finally fix this design flaw in our farms, ultimately improving our food and freshwater supplies. It is an honor and a pleasure to work towards achieving these goals.\n\nSomeday, I will also tour the world with my band and open a restaurant to fulfill my other passions.\n\nBut for now, on to fixing our farms!",
