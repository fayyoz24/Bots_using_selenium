    "summary": "I'm an undergraduate Computer Science and Mathematics student interested in a wide range of fields ranging from hands-on topics like software engineering and deep learning to pure math topics like topology and analysis. My two research projects focus on knot theory and computational choice theory. On computational choice theory, I've worked on the theoretical properties of matching algorithms, implemented them, and empirically compared their performances under different circumstances. On knot theory, I'm currently working on the classification of theta curves. I aspire to push the boundaries of human knowledge on the theoretical side and help people and companies via projects.",
