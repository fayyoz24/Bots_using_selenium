    "summary": "Over 25 years\u2019 experience in (native English) copywriting, communication and marketing across a broad diversity of industries and countries. Currently dividing my time between the UK and the Netherlands, and available to clients anywhere.\n\nMy breadth of experience means I'm not a specialist in any specific industry, but a chameleon who brings valuable outside perspective. A quality which can break the stalemate of internal focus suffered by many companies. This comes with an inherent desire to make the entire jigsaw fit. I never look at words without interrogating the actions and processes they're designed to trigger. Contributing analytical, solution-focussed thinking to everything from backroom brainstorming to front-line promotion. Always conscious of audience and stakeholder needs and expectations.\n\nBeing both creative and logical, I particularly relish the challenge of transforming complex back-stories into tangible, audience-friendly propositions and narratives. An enthusiasm that extends into packaging up any subject matter into appealing reads and clear directives. \n\nI'm particularly useful to companies and organisations who need to reach international audiences, having gained experience with clients based in the UK, USA, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Japan and Israel.\n\n\u201cMeedenker\u201d\nMy Dutch clients often describe me as a \u201cmeedenker\u201d (pronounced \"may-denker\"). It\u2019s one of those words for which there\u2019s no direct equivalent in English, although your translation tool-of-choice will certainly give it a go! It literally means \u201ca person who thinks along with\u201d. Essentially someone who proactively works with others, contributing to their creative and problem-solving efforts. \n\nIt\u2019s a label I\u2019m proud to have. As it nicely sums up my passion for helping others succeed by complementing their expertise and thought-processes with my own. \n\n\nFor more about my experience, skills and current activities, see MiriamYoung.com.",

They trade a broad range of certifications and physical energy products which industry uses for both environmental compliance and voluntary carbon footprint reduction purposes. In addition to these, ACT also trades mineral fuels and various products within the biofuel production chain. This adds up to a complex mix of commodities and related support services.\n\nACT Commodities wanted to create a completely new website which would reflect the company\u2019s collaborative trading ethos and high level of customer service, while outlining its product portfolio in a logically structured way. Its aims were to reassure existing contacts, attract new clients and appeal to prospective new employees.\n\nBecause the content to be communicated had not previously been curated, the exact structure of the website could not be pre-determined. We therefore had to take an agile approach to developing the website. I worked closely with the project manager Floortje Geuze to achieve this. The two of us embedded ourselves in the company \u2013 working on-site 2 days a week \u2013 so we could get a feel of the culture while acquiring all the necessary input. During my 10-week involvement, I interviewed many of the company\u2019s employees to obtain the relevant facts and piece together the marketing story. I then translated their input into client-focused copy, which I structured to fit the website design layout, navigation flow and SEO requirements.  You can see the result at ACTcommodities.com.",

Tasks included liaising with stakeholders throughout the global Philips organisation, contextualising and editing content within Philips guidelines and entering correct tagging and presentation in the SharePoint CMS.\n\nGoing beyond the brief I was originally brought in to fulfil, I proposed and created an extensive online training resource which will be used by those editing content in the future. Achieving this involved simplifying and arranging a complex set of guidelines into digestible, easily searchable sections, which acted as live demonstrations of the way Philips' new intranet is intended to be used.",

My work transformed perception of Darwin Plants from a little-considered company to one of the leading players in the field, who became one of the first ports of call for many garden writers, lecturers and TV researchers when looking for products to feature.\n\nCopywriting: press releases, magazine articles, website content, sales catalogue, promotional brochures, point-of-sale materials, sales presentations. \nCommunications: building, developing and utilising relationships with journalists, customers, suppliers, plant breeders, garden designers, retailers, horticultural colleges and others. Distributing press-releases, attending industry events, giving presentations, planning exhibits. Negotiation/purchase of advertising space.\nNotable achievements: \nDevelopment of the Darwin PlantSpotters consumer brand.\nWriting PlantSpotters.com, which was nominated for the UK Garden Writers Guild Website of the Year in 2004. My articles inspired Canadian TV series Recreating Eden to visit the Netherlands in 2006 to film an episode.\nConstructing and arranging a schedule of visits that formed a part of the 2006 European tour by the Garden Writers Association of America. \nManagement of project to raise charitable donations from plant sales for The British Red Cross, which was given a high profile media launch at the 2005 Chelsea Flower Show with follow-up at Gardeners\u2019 World Live. \nInvited to speak at The Des Moines Botanical Center (USA) and the CanWest horticulture trade show (Canada).\nAs a sales representative, developed the previously neglected UK market into a key territory.",
