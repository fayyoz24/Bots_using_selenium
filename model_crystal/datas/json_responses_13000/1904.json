    "summary": "\nI am an Unreal/Unity generalist programmer with a strong work ethic and a keen interest in broadening and deepening my skills. I have professional experience working with Unreal Engine 4 and have made a fully-featured AI plugin for it. I have 5 years of experience in C# development for Unity. I'm fluent in C++ and have made a game engine with OpenGL rendering and Lua scripting support. When programming, I focus on writing readable, maintainable, and reusable code.\n\nI have great communication skills and have often acted as Team Lead in group projects.\n\nWhen I'm not working, you can find me gaming, reading or exploring exciting new technologies. I occasionally dabble in web design and machine learning.",
