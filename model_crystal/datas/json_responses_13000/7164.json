It is fact that 80% of all toxic emission gases are from cars that\u2019s why we want to introduce you new type of fuel will help to reduce amount of  harmful exhaust emission gasses as NOx, SOx and carbon monoxide. This new fuel is made by mixing of ethanol with diesel with the help of emulsifier. The use of ethanol in diesel engines has a number of possible\nbenefits. It has been found that it has an impact on reducing the  high temperature in engine and reduces the NOX and carbon monoxide emissions. Furthermore, the technique was developed to improve the thermal efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions, or used as the safety fuel. The commercial diesel which is emulsified with oxygen-containing compounds decreases NOx emission as a result of increased surface area of diesel droplets .This project will help to reduce air pollution which is one of the aims of Kiyoto protocol.",
