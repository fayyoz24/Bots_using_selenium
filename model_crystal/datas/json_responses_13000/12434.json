    "summary": "\u201cThe greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches, but to reveal to him his own\u201d \u2013 Benjamin Disraeli\n\nCorporate veteran/leader: I am a proud Filipina, working in Europe for most of my career. I have 20+ years of experience within the shipping, logistics and sports lifestyle industries in various leadership roles, but the ones closest to my heart are leading and making a difference to transformation journeys, commercial strategy and sales operations. \n\nCoach: In 2018 I have started my journey towards embracing my passion for coaching and I hold an accreditation from the European Mentoring and Coaching Council. Since then, I have been coaching women leaders, founders and emerging talent. This is my source of inspiration and my way of paying forward especially to Filipinas aspiring to become leaders in the international/global context.\n\nFounder: Currently, I also lead two tech startups in the Philippines:\n\u2022\tHero App \u2013 a startup striving to make a difference to skilled Filipino workers by uplifting their professional dignity and providing an ecosystem where work and pay are fair and clients are safe and happy. \n\u2022\tBetsy \u2013 is an all-Filipina Tech Startup supporting Filipino creative entrepreneurs by promoting their talent and products in an eCommerce platform that will help them grow their brand. \n\nI love bringing teams together towards a vision, inspiring and supporting them to its achievement. Intentional excellence and servant leadership are important to me. I believe that when teams and individuals are given the right amount of context, empowerment, autonomy and support, they can move mountains.I have full faith in people, potential and collective intent.",
