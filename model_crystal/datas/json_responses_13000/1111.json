In the 30 years with Shell and 10 years with Wintershall, in many different jobs and different environments, I gained a lot of experience in geology, petrophysics, integrated reservoir modelling, project management and petroleum engineering in general. Most interesting was my time as learning & development lead in Shell\u2019s training centre.  A lot of satisfaction gave me building and guiding  the integrated reservoir modelling  framework and community within Wintershall and helping with structuring modelling projects.  \nMeanwhile I am enjoying myself with lots of other things.

The outcome proved the required productivity and therewith satisfied partners. \n- Successfully convinced management that new seismic was required for accurate planning of the 500 m horizontal sections in a 20 m thick reservoir, despite the existing 3D seismic and 600 vertical wells. Additionally the new seismic increased the reserves  and therewith the value of the asset, which worked out beneficial for the partial divestment in 2006\n-  Co-ordinated the reservoir surveillance plans; contributed to and reviewed the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report.",
