    "summary": "As a Climate Studies student with an agricultural science background, I focus on relating my study of biogeochemical cycles to agricultural practices and social ecology considering colonial impacts today. Additionally, I squeeze in as many statistics classes as possible, to geek out over data analysis and listen to Profs singing statistic love songs \ud83d\ude09.\nWhat drives me is volunteering in areas that are close to my heart, especially education and sustainability. Next to my studies I run a local German climate foundation, engage in municipal politics, and tutor refugees and disadvantaged pupils.",
