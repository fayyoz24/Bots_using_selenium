    "summary": "Driven (account) manager with a lot of experience, working for a leading company in the industry. Working together, tackling and dynamism in a no-nonsense corporate culture is what I have always pretended in my business operations. As a sales employee I can make optimal use of my commercial management experience and customer-oriented attitude.\n\nDe Hoeve Multipower is part of the Muller group (more than 85 employees) importer, supplier and producer of batteries, battery and charging systems.\n\nWith the team where everyone is specialized in different disciplines, I try to achieve optimal results. I have daily contact with existing relations, responsible for building new relations and developing new markets.\n\nI am also involved in:\n* launching new products (lines)\n* developing the new web / ordering site\n* maintaining contact with the manufacturers of the brands for which I am responsible\n\nExample of an ongoing project that I am proud of: \n\nWe are in the final testing phase of battery monitoring at airports from behind your computer. Certified by a well-known national airline. We have installed battery monitors in electric 80V tractors . The monitor works on the basis of the peukert curve. This allows you to see exactly how long you can drive, what the history is and when the vehicle needs to be loaded again. The vehicle can also be switched off from behind the computer. In a 24/7 working environment, this data is essential for the proper management of electric vehicles. As a result, battery-related, there will no longer be vehicles that come to an unexpected standstill, so that ad hoc must be acted upon. Controlling costs efficiently and effectively, saving calamities and costs!\n",
