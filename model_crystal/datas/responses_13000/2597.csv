The technology is non-invasive and measures the activation of the myocardium at the torso using an array of usually 64 up to 256 electrodes. Moreover, the procedure is patient-specific, which requires a scan via MRI or CT to determine the geometry of the heart and torso, meaning their location, size, and rotation. Afterward, electrical activity may be reconstructed at the level of the heart using mathematical modeling techniques, commonly referred to as the inverse problem of electrocardiographic imaging.\nCurrently, research efforts are being made to solve this problem using machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks (DNNs), which will be the approach taken by this thesis. For this, heart surface potentials and body surface potentials must be recorded and preprocessed to be suitable as training data for a DNN.  A problem, however, is that data cannot be directly measured in humans, since this would require placing electrodes on the heart surface of the patient. \nSimulated data presents an opportunity, since it relies on correct solutions to the forward problem, therefore eliminating the possibility of errors in the data. Further, synthesized data is created with the measured geometries of past patients in mind, giving it an additional basis in reality.\nThe assignment during this thesis then will be to develop a model to solve the inverse problem of of ECGI without knowing the patient's heart-torso geometry. \nIn conclusion, this thesis aims to utilize data normalization algorithms previously created at Maastricht University and synthesized heart surface and body surface potentials to train a neural network on solving the inverse problem of electrocardiographic imaging."", 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Filip', 'last_name': 'Rehburg', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Bachelor of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (BS)'}]}, {'title': 'DKE Honours programme: Maastricht Research Based Learning (MaRBLe) 2.0', 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'description': ""Tasks\nWorking under the supervision of Cameron Browne and Kurt Driessens and in close collaboration with Filipp Dokienko and Nikola Prianikov, I am taking part in the Digital Ludeme Project.

This report goes into the potential details of planning and executing a manned mission to Titan. \nTo achieve this hypothetical mission, a model of the solar system has been created and the movement of celestial bodies is modeled using two ordinary differential equation solvers, a 4th order Runge-Kutta and an Euler method, as well as a root finding Newton-Raphson method. \nThe goal of the mission is to simulate the path of an omni-directional probe to Titan’s orbit. Once in orbit, a landing module is dropped and its landing is simulated in a stochastic wind model. After the implementation of the ODE solvers, the settings of the mission were decided by experimenting with different step sizes and evaluating the increase in the error. \nEven though Titan’s orbit was not reached, a close approach was made. Finally, the landing of the module on Titan’s surface was successful.', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Filip', 'last_name': 'Rehburg', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Bachelor of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (BS)'}, {'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Noah', 'last_name': 'Scharrenberg', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Software Engineer - MSc, Artificial Intelligence'}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Daan Schar', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Joaquin Monedero', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Carlo Peron', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Dino Pasic', 'headline': None}]}, {'title': 'Project 1-1: Vertex Coloring', 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}}, 'description': 'The vertex coloring problem is one of the most-studied NP-hard problems in computer science. As a\nvery influential problem, its implications can be found in all fields of computer science including\ngeographical map coloring, optimizing schedules, etc.\nGiven a graph, the goal is to assign a color c ≤ k to all vertices such that no adjacent vertices have the\nsame color and the number of used colors k is minimal. Many exact and heuristic approaches are\ncreated to solve this problem, including the Backtracking, Decentralized Graphs, DSatur, Greedy, and\nWelsh Powell algorithms. This study aims to obtain the most accurate and efficient algorithm to\ncompute the chromatic number, taking into account certain graph properties including the clique number,\nnumber of cycles, and the highest degree.\nTo achieve this, the performance of the aforementioned algorithms is tested on a suite of test graphs\nand compared, while bearing the special topology of each graph in mind. Hence, the final result of\nthese evaluations is a construct of multiple algorithms that first analyses the topology of a given graph,\nand based on that, the most suited algorithm calculates the chromatic number.\nFrom the results, it is known that Simple Decentralized Graph Colouring (SDGC) is the most accurate\nand efficient exact algorithm, while the Greedy algorithm proves to be the most efficient heuristic\nalgorithms. However, the DSatur algorithm is the most accurate heuristic algorithm and takes the least\ntime to calculate a chromatic number. Since the intention of this study is the optimization of the graph\ncoloring approach for any given graph, property detection is used to calculate lower bounds while\nDSatur is for obtaining a more accurate upper bound accordingly. Meanwhile, the DSatur algorithm\nprovides the upper bound for the SDGC algorithm, which then computes the exact chromatic number.', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Filip', 'last_name': 'Rehburg', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Bachelor of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (BS)'}, {'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Alexander', 'last_name': 'Safi', 'name': None, 'headline': 'AI and Data Science student | Co-founder of Another Perspective'}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Sander Keim', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Sara Yaghi', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Sebas van Sluijsdam', 'headline': None}, {'type': 'nonStandardizedContributor', 'first_name': None, 'last_name': None, 'name': 'Xi Chen', 'headline': None}]}]",[],"[{'name': 'Calculus', 'number': 'KEN1440'}, {'name': 'Computer Vision for Interactivity', 'number': 'CS4187'}, {'name': 'Data Structures and Algorithms', 'number': 'KEN1420'}, {'name': 'Data-Intensive Computing', 'number': 'CS4480'}, {'name': 'Databases', 'number': 'KEN2110'}, {'name': 'Discrete Mathematics', 'number': 'KEN1130'}, {'name': 'Foundation of Reinforcement Learning', 'number': 'SDSC4001'}, {'name': 'Graph Theory', 'number': 'KEN2220'}, {'name': 'Intelligent Systems', 'number': 'KEN3430'}, {'name': 'Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence', 'number': 'KEN1110'}, {'name': 'Introduction to Image & Video Processing', 'number': 'KEN3238'}, {'name': 'Introduction to Robotics', 'number': None}, {'name': 'Linear Algebra', 'number': 'KEN1410'}, {'name': 'Linear Programming', 'number': 'KEN2520'}, {'name': 'Machine Learning', 'number': 'KEN2240'}, {'name': 'Mathematical Modelling', 'number': 'KEN2430'}, {'name': 'Operations Research Case Studies', 'number': 'KEN3410'}, {'name': 'Probability & Statistics', 'number': 'KEN2130'}, {'name': 'Software Engineering', 'number': 'KEN1520'}]",[],"[{'company': {'id': 164802, 'name': 'Maastricht University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFA1gR1FvG8aQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1588059465102?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=eNfg1TglYD8B_0EKtDLAkSTAOhE7ckupKfTaBIFPISs', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/maastricht-university/', 'employees': {'start': 1001, 'end': 5000}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Maastricht, Limburg, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': 'Maastricht University', 'description': 'Selected as one out of fifteen of 150 students to for the honors program.
