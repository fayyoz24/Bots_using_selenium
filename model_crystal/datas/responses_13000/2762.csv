As a natural thinker and creative person I have a broad range of interests ranging from news, politics and history, to art, science and biology. Writing and creative work are perhaps my most defining skillsets. In both these areas, I like to imagine that my original, but approachable style is what sets me apart. When it comes to writing I can be quite versatile: I am interested in academic style writing, but also commercial work, news articles, opinion pieces or anything else with a creative edge. The same is true for illustration and design; as long as there is originality involved, I am up for the job!

In day to day life, I am a sociable person who likes to surround himself with friends and family, but I can also very much enjoy spending time on my own. When applied to my professional life, this means that I can thrive inside a team, as well as work on projects individually for extended periods of time. Always in search of new inspiration, I am open to other ways of thinking and like to discuss all kinds of topics and ideas.

When it comes to my intellectual endeavours, the large, all-encompassing stories have often captured my imagination the most. And so, when conducting historiography, my focus regularly lies with the big questions and broad, sweeping histories. When studying a historic theme, I look at the large structures of imeaning and nterconnectedness and try to unravel how they developed over time. My preferred approach may thus be described as ""total history"", while the subject matter often falls into the category of cultural history or the history of mentalities, as exemplified by the Annales school.

Creatively, I have practiced many branches of art, both traditional and digital. Drawing pencil work of historical subjects, fantasy and science fiction has always been a favoured pass-time for me. I also have a lot of experience in pixel art, digital illustration and logo design and I am well acquainted with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Premiere.

Hoping to have provided you with a sensible overview of who I am and what I do.
