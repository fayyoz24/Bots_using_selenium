Between 1979 and 1981 I worked in the cardiology department in the Binnen Gasthuis. In June 1981 we moved to the new Academic Medical Center. I worked there at the department of Cardiology, where I fulfilled many different roles, from chief of the Coronary Care Unit,chief of the Emergency Cardiac Care unit,  chief of the Catheterization laboratory and supervisor of the consultation service. I followed training and practiced intervention cardiology and implantation of cardiac devices (pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ICD's).
At the same time my research focussed on emergency cardiac care: prevention of ventricular fibrillation by anti arrhythmic drugs (the subject of my PhD thesis). After that my research centered on management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A registry started in 1995 which has recorded and analyses OHCA on an intense and uninterrupted basis since 2005: the ARREST (AmsteRdam REsuscitation STudies) study. A large intervention study of benefit of automated external defibrillators (AED's) was performed between 2000 and 2002. Ever since, I promoted and followed the introduction of AEDs, which was very successful. Introduction first was with police and fire fighters first responders, since 2009 also intensely in residential communities.
Our research group continuously engages in new research projects on OHCA. In association with Hanno Tan MD, PhD as co-PI (who received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 program with the program Escape-NET) and Marieke Blom, PhD as senior researcher there are now 7 PhD students and 5 data managers active in the ARREST group. 
I retired from the cardiology practice in 2014 but since then dedicate much of my time to the study of OHCA through the ARREST study, which I hope to continue several years to come.","{'country': None, 'short': 'Netherlands', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Research,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1964}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1971}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Amsterdam', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEfHBj_we-_kw/company-logo_400_400/0/1659945104460?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=jGa94q-77FlLotocNJtjQsKbb9S7XUwq4jL3kWKp6No', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-amsterdam/'}, 'degree_name': 'Doctor of Medicine - MD', 'field_of_study': 'N/A'}]",[],"[{'title': 'Lifetime Achievement Award American Heart Association', 'description': 'Recognition of contribution to Resuscitation Research', 'issuer': 'American Heart Association', 'date': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}}, {'title': 'Honorary Member European Resuscitation Council', 'description': 'Recognition of research contribution in Resuscitation, Membership of the Board of the European Resuscitation Council and contributor to European Guidelines in Resuscitation.', 'issuer': 'European Resuscitation Council', 'date': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}}, {'title': 'Ridder in the Order of Oranje Nassau', 'description': 'Royal distinguished order', 'issuer': 'State of the Netherlands', 'date': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, {'title': 'Snellen award', 'description': 'To recognise contribution to the goals of the netherlands Heart foundation, active as chairman of the Scientific Program Epidemiology of CV disease and active promotor of AED use according to the concept of the ""six-minutes zone"" as defined by the Netherlands Heart Foundation.', 'issuer': 'Netherlands Heart Foundation', 'date': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2011}}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Academic Medical Center, department of Cardiology', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 1981}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Amsterdam, the Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 1981}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Academic Medical Center, department of Cardiology', 'description': None, 'title': 'Cardiologist, researcher', 'employment_type': None}]}]",[],[],,,
