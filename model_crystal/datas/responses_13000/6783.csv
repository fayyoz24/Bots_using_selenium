During 7 months I investigated the interactions and influences between international (cross-cultural) project management and the implementations of sustainability. Sustainability in the context of the research is limited to actions related to LEED. \nThe reason for my research topic is that there is hardly any information available on the effects of cross-cultural management in international construction projects (such as the Mall of Egypt) implementing a sustainable certification scheme and the ways that incorporating these types of management can support the implementation of sustainable certification schemes. This led to the following research question: will the execution of international construction projects such as the MOE in Egypt benefit from taking cultural differences into account when drafting plans for LEED? The aim of the Thesis project is to provide BOJV with key issues in the execution of LEED projects in Egypt by incorporating cultural differences into the project sustainable certification process.\nCurrently I am in the final steps of writing the thesis.\n\nDuties\t\n•\tObserve the BOJV LEED team and the people they work with\n•\tAttend meetings of the BOJV LEED Team\n•\tEstablish a timeline of LEED related actions at MOE, specified for BOJV\n•\tReview project documentation, drawings and uploaded documentation from LEED Online\n•\tInterview people on the project for their experiences with LEED\n•\tMeet with the BOJV LEED Consultant, the client and others for their thoughts on LEED at MOE\n•\tAttend site visits to inspect LEED related on site\n•\tAssist in writing reports & verifying specifications of materials', 'title': 'Masters Graduation Internship at Mall of Egypt', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': 492822, 'name': 'Orascom Construction Industries (OCI)', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGX2psKVVgoTQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519952405927?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=dUwQG5ZiQdYuiDEvLLRtziZs5ZrAPLYDlidjI2VhkSY', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/orascom-construction-plc/', 'employees': {'start': 10001, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Egypt, Cairo', 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}}, 'company': 'Orascom Construction PLC', 'description': '2013: Graduation internship for Besix Orascom Joint Venture (BOJV), at the Mall of Egypt. \n\nDuties:\tFor half a year I supported the LEED team of BOJV.

Besides a ski slope the Mall of Egypt will contain over 350 shops, a VOX Cinemas Cineplex and a Carrefour. With a gross leasable area of 165,000 square meters, this project is worth 6 billion EGP of investments and has to be build according to LEED. Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) is a US green building certification program. LEED is well known because of its aim to be internationally applicable.\n\nCompanies involved in this project:\nBOJV is the main contractor in this project on behalf of Majid Al Futtaim.
