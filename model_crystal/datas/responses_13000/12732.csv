With that in mind, what better place to gather entrepreneurs at all stages of business development for the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES)?  This Summit will be the 7th installment in a series previously hosted by the United States and the governments of Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Morocco, and Kenya.  In bringing the Summit back to the United States, President Obama highlights his commitment to building bridges that help us tackle global challenges together. \n\n GES 2016 aims to showcase inspiring entrepreneurs and investors from around the world creating new opportunities for investment, partnership, and collaboration; connect American entrepreneurs and investors with international counterparts to form lasting relationships; and highlight entrepreneurship as means to address some of the most intractable global challenges. Hosting GES in Silicon Valley will highlight America’s entrepreneurial spirit and allow American investors and entrepreneurs to see the talent, solutions, and opportunities that exist globally.', 'title': 'GES Delegate', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': 9183521, 'name': 'InnerMotion Studios', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C510BAQH_sLMGK1VBvQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519879901764?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=YzBntC7MdRlE8dtobff6FgjFJwR3-n6aWHAFa_tb9hA', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/innermotion-studios/', 'employees': {'start': 0, 'end': 1}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Sydney, Australia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'company': 'InnerMotion Studios', 'description': 'production management, business planing and development, program development, audiovisual production, web development, brand development.', 'title': 'Co-Founder and Production Manager', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': 5212749, 'name': 'Career Lab', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGwEo4hhGPNNg/company-logo_400_400/0/1519890440728?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=7bxrUiiuBsMwt7Pyp4VIRvXIHlGlaNFXtyKdUiZ4wco', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/career-lab-enterprise/', 'employees': {'start': 2, 'end': 10}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Macedonia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'company': 'Career Lab', 'description': 'Employment, Human Resources and Career Development Company', 'title': 'Program Manager', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Millstone Road', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Greater Boston Area', 'date': {'start': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, 'company': 'Millstone Road', 'description': 'Renting and managing house property in Brewster, MA', 'title': 'Property Manager', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': 763734, 'name': 'Ocean Edge Resort & Golf Club', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFF1JA2SfRjkw/company-logo_400_400/0/1519890490176?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=muzfI_G5dAZCWidLEHFXkEg49QsfNjnAYPCyhcNTWUM', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-edge-resort-&-golf-club/', 'employees': {'start': 501, 'end': 1000}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2009}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Greater Boston Area', 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2009}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, 'company': 'Ocean Edge Resort & Golf Club', 'description': 'One of my best summer jobs that i had over the past few years, i love this place, great experience, great people.', 'title': 'Bartender', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Digital Star', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2011}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Macedonia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2011}}, 'company': 'Digital Star', 'description': 'Audio and video editing for the TV Show ""High Octane""', 'title': 'Video Editor', 'employment_type': None}]}]","[{'date': {'start': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}}, 'role': 'Co Organizer', 'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Startup Europe Week', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQEjWejd0I1PBg/company-logo_400_400/0/1673875729296?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=8kSVjS4VbvHxAQGHvKCwTQ1xCS3055Ok6WPsmXhoC94', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/startupeuropeweek/'}, 'cause': 'ECONOMIC_EMPOWERMENT', 'description': 'The Startup Europe Week will take place from 1-5 February 2016, SEW partners all over Europe will present the projects sponsored by Startup Europe and all other relevant initiatives being developed in regional ecosystems.
