I have developed competencies through a diversity of experiences such as piping engineering, site construction, engineering project manager, concept engineer, leader of proposals and proposals department manager.

As a Certified Engineer (Mechanical) I began my career as a hydraulic Engineer, working on airplane landing gear systems (patent registered). I then moved on to team leading and was responsible for defining the design of an unmanned remote deep-sea submarine. 

After a great experience as Proposal Department Manager in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I am currently holding the position of Concept Project Manager in Schiedam, The Netherlands. 

Motivation, dedication and ability to lead multi-cultural teams are integrally part of required working behaviors in this type of industry, skills and qualities I strongly possess. I have led conceptual studies, engineering scope of EPCI projects and full proposals for a wide range of worldwide oil production products including FPSOs and FSRU.

My favorite challenges are oriented towards business development, creativity and efficiency /economic improvements, by means of original but structured ideas, and novel tool / concept designs.
