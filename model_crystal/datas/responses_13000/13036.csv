- genocide and post-genocide Rwandan politics 
- Conflict and peace in the Great Lakes regions
- Media studies especially radio and visual arts
- Non-surveillance and Undocumented people in Europe 
- Networks of pro-asylum advocates 

My goals are to find work that combines my interest in research and advocacy with ways of organising and creative work to create art that aims to promote social and economic justice goals within localities at risk of polarisation and violence. This implies work within neighbourhoods in Western Europe, through forms of 'doorstep politics', in actions to defend rights of vulnerable people, citizens and others, on a daily basis.

Specialties: Intersted in capacitation of others, more than ambitions of my own. Deriving pleasure from others' positive learning. On-line role play simulations are a method of teaching that I have used in several different settings (see Roni Linser on Linkedin for an example of a good provider).","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'The Hague, South Holland', 'city': 'The Hague', 'state': 'South Holland', 'default': 'The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,"[{'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBhb2rGGxK0', 'title': 'Innovative methods of teaching at ISS', 'description': 'Uploaded by issmedia on 2012-12-13.

In their wisdom, the University management decided to run CDS down from 2003, first closing the undergraduate program, and then shutting the Centre it completely by 2010, despite continuing health recruitment into the Masters. The last batch of Masters students graduated in 2010.  The closure of CDS was resisted through a long campaign, and the decision to shut it, without any clear rationale, has proven a loss to Wales, and to the field of International Development Studies.
