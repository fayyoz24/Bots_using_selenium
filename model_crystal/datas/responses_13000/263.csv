My name is Carmen and after graduating from Zuyd University of Applied Sciences in 2019, I am looking for a job that fits my many interests.

I grew up with a passion for languages and other cultures and when the moment was there to choose a field of study, I decided to start a bachelor's degree in Oriental Languages and Communication Japanese at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences in Maastricht, the Netherlands. After successfully completing a study abroad program at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies in Japan as well as a minor program in professional writing, I received my degree in 2019.

In December of the same year, I started working for PostNL in Eindhoven as a mail sorter. A few months later, I got to take the role of mentor upon myself as well. In this position, I train new employees and act as a guide for these employees as well as employees with mental disabilities.

Ideally, I would like to combine a few of my interests in my next career. I enjoy teaching, writing and helping others and would love to spend my working days doing these exact things. I am open to moving abroad, preferably Japan or an English-speaking country.

Please do not hesitate to get in contact with me if you are looking for a friendly, passionate and reliable employee for your organisation!","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Eindhoven, North
