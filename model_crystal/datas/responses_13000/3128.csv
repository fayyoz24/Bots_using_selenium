Hello! I'm a results-driven Water Resources Expert with 10+ years of experience in water-food-energy systems, climate change impact assessment, geospatial modeling, and water management projects. My global journey has taken me to fascinating destinations, working on initiatives that address pressing sustainability challenges.

üî≠ About Me üî≠
I specialize in leveraging data, models, and new technologies for evidence-based decision-making on climate resilience and sustainable water management worldwide. Currently, I serve as a Senior Hydrologist and Climate Change Expert, also holding the role of Project Manager at FutureWater in the Netherlands. I lead international projects on flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, climate change impacts on water resources, and integrated water resources management.

üíºüéì Expertise & Impact üíºüéì
With a Ph.D. from Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, my research focused on modeling hydroclimatic extremes, providing a strong foundation for my career. I've contributed significantly to cutting-edge climate and hydrological research at ICIMOD, Practical Action Consulting, VU, KNMI, and FutureWater. My expertise extends to water-food-energy systems, enriching my understanding of the intricate nexus between these essential resources.

üöÄ Project Leadership üöÄ
As a skilled Project Manager, I've led teams in developing flood forecasting systems, assessing climate change impacts on water, agriculture, energy, and water supply, and using machine learning for drought risk forecasting. My projects span diverse regions, including Nepal, Netherlands, India, Spain, Italy, Mozambique, Myanmar, China, UK, Germany, Laos, Tajikistan, and offline work in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Colombia.

üåê Global Training Experience üåê
I take pride in being a seasoned trainer and capacity builder. Through workshops on hydrological modeling, climate risk assessment, and geospatial analysis, I've empowered professionals in Nepal, Myanmar, China, India, Mozambique, Laos, Tajikistan, and beyond to address water management and climate change challenges with innovative solutions.

üåç Open to Collaborations üåç
I'm excited to collaborate on projects and research that advance sustainable water management and climate resilience. If you share the vision of a greener future, let's connect and explore how we can make a meaningful impact together!
