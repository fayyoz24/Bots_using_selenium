I'm a Digital Marketer with a global perspective and with over seven years of Marketing experience in Sri Lanka and The Netherlands (combined).  My passions, experiences, and personal growth drive me to deliver impactful strategies that elevate brands and connect with audiences worldwide. 

Originally from Sri Lanka, I've been fortunate to call Dubai, Bahrain, and Sri Lanka my homes before embarking on my current adventure to The Netherlands. As a Third Culture Kid, I embrace the richness of different cultures, making every journey a colourful exploration.

In Sri Lanka, I've successfully managed diverse clients in Finance, Retail, FMCG, Education and Hospitality industries. As a team leader, I've nurtured a people-first approach, leading to award-winning projects that showcased our creativity and strategic thinking. 

In The Netherlands, my specialisation in social media led to exceptional growth, expanding the company's online community by an impressive 233% in just two years. My passion for social media strategy has driven me to deliver results and foster brand growth in diverse markets.

An avid learner, I've honed my skills through programs like the Spikes Digital Academy in Singapore and completing Digital Garage by Google. Spearheading the digital execution of a global campaign - Women of the World Festival in Sri Lanka and the What Now Project remains two of my proudest accomplishments, championing women's empowerment and gender equality.

Beyond my professional experience, I have a deep fondness for travelling and cooking. It ignites my sense of creativity, bringing joy and inspiration. Moreover, I'm a passionate advocate for animal welfare and nature conservation, finding solace in the company of animals and immersing myself in nature's beauty. 

Rooted in an empowered family of women, their support uplifts and inspires me, shaping both my personality and leadership approach.

Life's journey is a tapestry of strength and growth, where challenges become opportunities to rise. Overcoming PTSD taught me the art of healing and the power of my own will. This chapter in my life sparked a passion for uplifting others, embracing empathy and hope for those facing their own battles. It fills me with unwavering courage and a deep love for the beauty of constant growth, inspiring me to embrace each adventure with an open heart.

I'm excited to connect, collaborate, and make a positive impact in the digital landscape and beyond.
