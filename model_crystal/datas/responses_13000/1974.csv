daria-spivakovskaya-b382246,Daria,Spivakovskaya,Senior Petrophysicist at Shell,,,personal,ACoAAAEZu1wBTy8hIz87dDTqbX1ojrzuEYITElQ,18463580,,"Petrophysicist with broad experience in conventional and unconventional projects. Worked in a variety projects in offshore (Deepwater Norwegian Sea and Irish Sea) and onshore environments. Involved in projects at different life–cycle phases including exploration, appraisal and development.  

Experienced both in operational and study petrophysics. Involved in static and dynamic modeling, volumetric update, reserve reporting, uncertainty study, rock physics projects. Experience in planning and execution of coring, LWD, WL, pipe-conveyed logging, formation sampling and testing operations. Expertise in coring, routine and special core analysis.

Experienced working in multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary teams. Self-motivated professional with ability to multi-task and prioritize the work. Always focused on fit for purpose timely delivery of results and able to deliver through others. Flexible in working under stressful conditions. Good coaching skills.  Keen to broaden technical skills as well as leadership and integration skills.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'The Hague, South Holland', 'city': 'The Hague', 'state': 'South Holland',
