Throughout my distinguished career, I’ve demonstrated my ability to develop and implement transformational strategies with full accountability for operational and financial performance. I know how to establish and streamline various business processes, nurture client relationships, maximize bottom-line profitability, negotiate favourable agreements, manage large budgets, efficiently allocate resources, and slash operating costs. Moreover, I’ve garnered substantial experience working in heavily regulated, high risk environments with government audit oversight. I believe in leading by example and have successfully mentored and coached my teams to deliver consistently positive outcomes and thrive in fast-paced environments.

Over the last few years, I’ve successfully enabled Securitas to scale their market presence and revenue stream by 10 times, focused on driving operational excellence. I also possess a sharp commercial and financial acumen, able to identify new opportunities that ensure sustainable business growth for long-term success.

Please feel free to contact me at steven.richards@securitas.nl with any thoughts, comments, or questions about my work. Looking forward to expanding my professional network and exploring new opportunities.
