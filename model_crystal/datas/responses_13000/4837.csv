Isabel Pieterson is a seventeen-year-old, detail-oriented, high school student who is currently undertaking the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program at United World College in Maastricht.

Isabel is involved in both her school's community and the greater community: having worked with numerous non-profit organisations, like OnePwaa or HundrED, she is keen on advocating for lifelong learning. Furthermore, she is the Founder of 'collaborACE' - a website that offers both GCSE students and teachers the opportunity to freely view and use subject-specific notes, improving access to education amongst students; this platform has expanded internationally and, according to Google Analytics, has users from over 3 continents and 13 countries.

In 2022, Isabel authored a systematic literature review research paper, ""Evaluation of Helminthic Therapy as a Treatment for Autoimmune Diseases""; which was peer-reviewed by a panel of professionals and published by 'The International Young Researchers' Conference.' (In partnership with the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons Global Health Organization)

In her free time, Isabel enjoys skiing, playing the piano and is captivated by storytelling. Having grown up in an international environment, she adores meeting new people, so feel free to connect with her and say ""hello!""
