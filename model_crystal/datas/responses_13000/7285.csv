Dream Summary : I follow the life style of “NUN”  Who give his/her life for humanity. I want to work for save that life, which make plan to suicide himself. Want to work with them ! who are cheated by everyone who are knocking door to door for jobs. Want to work who have not any quality & experience, which have no any money for invest. An expert and dishonest man touch the success easily but an non-expert man don't touch that in our country. Is it right ? Every academy, who have scholar student only 5% and 45% normal student 50% is week student. It is easy to work with 5% who will develop by public/gov money and make his life colorful which color is not helpful for us.I want to work with 50% who have no way to do anything but who are honest & non-addicts. I am sure my Allah will help me on my every site.
