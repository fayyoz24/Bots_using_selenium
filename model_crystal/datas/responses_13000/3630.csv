Passionate about leadership and international business. 

I am from the Netherlands and have been working in logistics & supply chain for a Belgian company since 2011. I have worked in different commercial- and management roles, which gave me a deep and solid understanding of how cultural differences influence international business, leadership and just getting everyone to support the strategy. After my Masters in Russian Literature, I wanted to make my career in international business and moved with my future life partner to Saint-Petersburg and found a sales position with Ahlers in Russia. 

In my career with Ahlers I have >8 years of top executive management experience. I bring substantial international business accumen and commercial-, supply chain- and export experience to the table. I also have a deep understanding of managing team across geographies and cultures in a multi-stakeholder environment. 

I thrive as a first mover and in my current role I work with teams from Western-Europe, Russia, Baltics and China to deliver tailor made supply chain solutions, sometimes going beyond logistics, strategically facilitating the business of our clients. 

In 2021 I started an Executive MBA at Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden, studying alongside full time work. I chose to study in Sweden, a global leader in inclusiveness, equality and sustainability, to get a better understanding of best practices and how to implement them.","{'country': 'Netherlands',
