I have moved to the Netherlands to connect with my mum's Dutch relatives, the country my grandparents left after WWII, and to learn the Dutch language. 

I am passionate about language and literature, and have confidence through learning both we can have a stronger understanding of the multicultural world we all share. I love authors' depiction of the past, present, and futures of different cultures. I seek to learn all I can about our history as a human race, believing we need to reflect on our mistakes and triumphs in order to move forward. I endeavour to make choices for the sustainability of our planet. In my classrooms, I strive to create open and questioning learning environments, with a curiosity and growing responsibility for the world around them.  

I try to read as many novels as I can throughout the year, mostly fiction and anything by Stephen King that isn't horror. I love watching films in the cinema. Although I come from rural South Australia, I cannot surf or play football. I do enjoy dragon boat paddling and hope to find a Dutch team. I love exploring the Dutch countryside with my cousins and have embraced the Dutch cycling culture: ‘Ik ben niet gemaakt van suiker.’","{'country': None, 'short': 'Netherlands', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'French', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}]}",Primary/Secondary Education,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of South Australia', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHMHqwljNA2uw/company-logo_400_400/0/1614575914322?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=E76RM9xMeoJV6NjiSN6erYrs-3q2NkNVt3-hilplntE', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-south-australia/'}, 'degree_name': 'Master of Teaching (Secondary)', 'field_of_study': 'Education'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of South Australia', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHMHqwljNA2uw/company-logo_400_400/0/1614575914322?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=E76RM9xMeoJV6NjiSN6erYrs-3q2NkNVt3-hilplntE', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-south-australia/'}, 'degree_name': 'Associate Degree in Language and Culture Studies', 'field_of_study': 'Romance Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2011}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of South Australia', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHMHqwljNA2uw/company-logo_400_400/0/1614575914322?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=E76RM9xMeoJV6NjiSN6erYrs-3q2NkNVt3-hilplntE', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-south-australia/'}, 'degree_name': 'Bachelor of Arts (Writing and Creative Communication)', 'field_of_study': 'English Language and Literature, General'}]",[],"[{'title': 'Young Volunteer of the Year 2017', 'description': ""I received this award for being a critical part of the Library team in delivering the regular Baby Bounce program.
