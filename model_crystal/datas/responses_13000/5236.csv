I excel at identifying new revenue opportunities within complex commercial organisations and markets to drive top-line revenue growth.

I specialise in utilising deep-dive data analytics, insight generation and process development to extract innovative solutions that combat complex problems and risks while developing then converting transformative commercial strategies into actionable cross-functional programmes that over-achieve expectations.

VEON needed to implement strategy to optimise accelerated smartphones and data usage for 200m base. As Group Commercial Director, I developed a strategy to grow mobile data penetration, revenue and utilisation. Created deliverable initiatives and led implementation and operationalisation of initiatives. Succeeded in growing mobile internet revenue to ~$2bn, internet subscriber penetration 63% and smartphone penetration +50%. 

VEON recognised an upselling opportunity, migrating 3G customers onto 4G and to alleviate 3G congestion. As Group Director, identified accounts for 4G upsell. I identified heavy data users on 3G handsets and congested sites, created case for investment in handset subsidy per user and aided local teams to identify customers. Succeeded in delivering 25% uplift in ARPU, 5-point increase in NPS and 30% reduction in cell cluster Capex.

One of my core skills is developing products and propositions to readily satisfy customer needs and deliver best-in-class experiences that drive-up market ranking.

I am passionate about completing customer journey mapping and development projects to uncover then innovate new ways to optimise customer experience and ratings.
