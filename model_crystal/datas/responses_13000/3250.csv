The dynamic political and economic developments in East Asia after the Second World War have attracted a lot of attention internationally. The world was baffled first by the rapid rise of Japan, followed by the fast economic growth of ‘Newly Industrialized Economies’ such as South Korea and the swift emergence of the People’s Republic of China.\nJapan was, and still is, one of the region’s leading countries in political, economic and cultural terms.

The University has had a Center for Japan Studies since 2000, and in 2013 the Centre for East Asian Studies was founded.
