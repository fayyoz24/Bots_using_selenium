The digitised music treasures of Europe’s heritage institutions are rich resources that we propose to take to audiences outside of Europe (beginning with Russia) to promote an understanding of the variety and diversity - and value - of Europe’s heritage and history. \n\nThe project asks heritage institutions to recommend a piece of music and to provide a short introduction to the work. Each contribution (we aim for at least 10 EU countries to be represented) should present an internationally lesser-known national composer. The piece of music (score and parts) should be available digitally and available in the public domain or with a copyright license that allows free reuse. The piece should ideally be for an orchestral ensemble or other classical ensemble, e.g. choir or chamber group. The introduction to the work should outline information about the composer and socio-historical context, allowing audiences (including educators) to benefit from the institution’s expertise (e.g. using this information to develop learning resources or programme notes).\n\nThe collected works will be made available on a website that is designed for its target country. The website will be promoted with local partners, including conservatoires, commercial partners and networks of music educators and ensembles. Participation and performance of the music will be incentivised through a digital campaign.
