I lived in the UK for 27 years and worked in the early day's of the FPMT in Conishead Priory in the restoration of the Building because of my skills and studied for more than 30 years the Classical Buddhist teachings and the different traditions within. I made Buddhist sculpture from which I supported some projects,  some of my work went to the far regions of the world and have reached the Tröde kangsar Temple in Lhasa and Tashi Lhunpo.

I took ordination in the monastic tradition of the Gelugpa school of practice (Yellow Hats) with Kyabje Song Rinpoche in 1981 on Lhabab Duchen.  

Over the years I received instructions Lama Yeshe the founder of the 
(Foundation of the international Mandala of the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition),
