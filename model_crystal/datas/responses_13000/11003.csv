A champion of women's leadership, Ebere founded Rise and Lead Women, an international organisation with a mission to increase the representation of women leaders from diverse backgrounds in the workplace and the marketplace. 

Known to always inspire people with her words and writing, Ebere has been described as an inspirational leader and role model by men and women alike. She believes that leadership is not about your title but the impact you make through your position.

In her consulting role, she collaborates with global organisations to create and implement innovative programs and events that support and empower women.

She co-founded Ataro Group, a food production company that packages spices and sauces inspired by West African recipes.

Formally a multi-branch restaurant owner and female clothing retailer, she is passionate about sharing her business knowledge with other women. Ebere has built learning and networking ecosystems that support women to rise, break through glass ceilings, lead successful businesses, and allow them to create the impact and lifestyle they want for themselves and their families.


She gives back through the BIEL Foundation, a non-profit in the Netherlands and Nigeria that provides training and mentorship to help migrant women and at-risk victims of human trafficking to build successful careers and achieve their dreams.

An inspiring and compelling speaker, Ebere has spoken on several corporate platforms. She creates and manages high-end experiential in-person and virtual events for organisations like the United Nations, the Organisation of African First Ladies (OAFLAD), UPS Europe, Saipem Contracting, ILead Conference, and Rise & Lead Summit, amongst others.
