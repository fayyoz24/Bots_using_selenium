I started off by working as an intern using the working holiday visa in the logistics department at a company called STX. This is where I got to know how logistics worked and triggered my interests. With good reputation, I have got an offer to work full-time from the same company. This was the start of my logistics journey which eventually led me to staying in the Netherlands. I became to love the field of logistics since then. Each logistic process seemed like a challenging journey in which I had to handle from start until the end. The challenges and sense of accomplishments were the two main reasons I fell in love and got fascinated by logistics.

As of personal traits, I am an outgoing person who loves to make jokes and make people happy. I love getting people's attention so when spotlight comes to me, I tend to enjoy it!  As a fast learner, I knew how to adapt in any kind of environment and together with optimism, it helped me 'survive' foreign life. Now I am in a situation where I have the opportunity to teach other colleagues and share my logistics skills with them. With my multicultural point of view, I am flexible in understanding a diversity of things and have the ability to think out of the box. Adding the Dutch culture into my learning process, I am excited by the other possibilities and challenges that could occur in the future and would like to invite you by telling my adventurous story further on.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'South Holland', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'South Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'KR',
