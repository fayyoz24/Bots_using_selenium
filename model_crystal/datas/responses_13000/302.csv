My extensive experience includes pursuing new B2B and B2C business opportunities, collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop and implement go-to-market strategies, and expanding and upselling existing relationships with key partners. As a multilingual professional fluent in English, Italian, German, and French, I can effectively prospect companies in 10 European countries.
