Background of the Organization

The idea of establishing Menya Iwacu, as a community-based organization, was initiated by Congolese young generation, mainly composed of asylum seekers across the globe.

Initiators accordingly felt accountable to overcome challenges facing the Eastern DR of Congo including; ongoing atrocities, bad ideologies that kept on being spread out, and an increasing number of asylum seekers flowing outside the country. As it is a problem closely linked to the history of the whole region especially implicating ethnicity and discrimination aspects, in case there is no adequate intervention, still inhabitants are exposed to worsened situation.

Therefore, founders came up with an intervention, by contributing not only towards press (newsworthiness) but also airing relevant programs necessary for the sustainable peace building and social economic welfare in the great lakes region and Eastern DR Congo specifically.
