A plethora of skills that I've learnt out of necessity, from brand management to contract negotiation, has guided me through many difficult situations and out of many more failures.

The passion that grew from managing my own personal brand has led me to complete a diploma and degree in Marketing and Communications, in the hope that my prior experiences will be able to aid clients traversing the dangerous line between standing out and falling off.

Today I conceptualise, customise and create engaging and undeniably creative marketing, advertising and social media solutions for companies with a boutique advertising company. I also take on independent writing and branding projects for clients and editorials, like legit.sg and ""Wood and Steel Gastrobar"".

I also enjoy making connections on professional social networks. Reach out if you want to talk about advertising, music or spectacular hummus dip.
