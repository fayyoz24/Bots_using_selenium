I am a strong believer that the As-A-Service movement focusing on experiences versus possessions offers new opportunities to Corporates and is a great booster for new business models. From my own experience as CEO, I know that many CEOs are dealing with three major stones in their shoes: shifting business models, integrating startups and attracting the ""Y"" generation. The mind shift from possessions to experiences provides solutions from the inside. I love to integrate this way of working in the projects I run as well as in my lifestyle.

Along my 20+ years of professional journey, I have taken up demanding roles in sales, change management, general management and consulting. As a manager, speaker, coach or mediator, I always strive to integrate the professional growth of the professionals I interact with. This requires getting people out of their comfort zones. I firmly believe that this helps them grow faster. Delivering results by developing people at the same time energises me to move to the next challenge.

Following my role as CEO for Econocom Nederland, I have the pleasure to have developed, Black Winch, with the goal to accelerate the continuous growth of As-A-Service solutions. Black Winch helps you to stay tuned with your structural market shift. We implement and develop a successful, scalable AS-A-SERVICE business model by bringing value to your end-users and shareholders. 

I am a European from France. I have lived and worked in the U.S, Spain, Belgium and now anywhere in the world, being completely location independent.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",True,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Dutch', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'French', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}]}",Management Consulting,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1990}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1994}}, 'school': {'name': 'WIBS - Weller International Business School', 'logo': None, 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/wibs---weller-international-business-school/'}, 'degree_name': ""Bachelor's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'International Sales Management'}]",[],[],[],[],[],"[{'name': 'De digitale transformatie; het einde van bezit', 'publisher': 'Various publications in the Dutch Medias', 'url': 'http://blog.econocom.com/nl/blog/de-digitale-transformatie-het-einde-van-bezit/', 'date': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}, 'authors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Yann', 'last_name': 'Toutant', 'name': None, 'headline': 'As-A-Service Veteran - Founder Black Winch - Author - Accelerating the world’s transition to usership and circularity.'}]}, {'name': 'Digitale transitie: de toekomst was gisteren', 'publisher': 'Various publications in the Dutch Medias', 'url': 'http://blog.econocom.com/nl/blog/digitale-transitie-de-toekomst-was-gisteren/', 'date': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}, 'authors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Yann', 'last_name': 'Toutant', 'name': None, 'headline': 'As-A-Service Veteran - Founder Black Winch - Author - Accelerating the world’s transition to usership and circularity.'}]}]",[],[],"[{'company': {'id': 71717245, 'name': 'Black Winch', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQEVSWlhcP3z_w/company-logo_400_400/0/1680682157010?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=vbBcjo8MLkQ8AYYaN9q9sA5Rx2zDl1StgmJxHFKoqoE', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/blackwinch/', 'employees': {'start': 11, 'end': 50}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': None, 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Black Winch', 'description': 'https://www.amazon.com/AS-SERVICE-product-business-subscription/dp/B09ZCSPQKT', 'title': 'Author - As-A-Service - Turn your product base business into a subscription model', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}, {'location': 'Amsterdam Area, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Black Winch', 'description': 'At Black Winch, we secure the implementation and development of a successful and scalable As-A-Service business model by bringing value to both the end-users and the shareholders.\n\nTurn and develop your product-based business model into a subscription model : We support you in this journey in order to optimize the successful subscription model of product-based businesses and create new business models and income streams.\n\nThe 8 steps methodology developed by Black Winch will lead you to a scalable As A Service business model.', 'title': 'Founder', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': 3661933, 'name': 'Toucan Toco', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFVqjc_gOCOKg/company-logo_400_400/0/1643133882556?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=M4uHbcly0Dsp0-p4e5nLMXAGbzSdDi7kCa0LVisXhZI', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/toucan-toco/', 'employees': {'start': 51, 'end': 200}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Amsterdam Area, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}}, 'company': 'Toucan - Customer Facing Analytics', 'description': ""Toucan Toco's mission is to tell business performance stories through interactive data and storytelling.
