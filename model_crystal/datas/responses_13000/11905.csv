His recent works include a communication director for Mr. Chadchart Sittipunt’s Bangkok gubernatorial election, winning the biggest landslide in Bangkok’s election history, and a general manager leading strategic communication team at Pheu Thai Party in which he supervised the first major rebranding in 14 years of the party’s history. 

Since 2013, he has been in the leadership of planning and implementation of communication strategies for the well-orchestrated political campaigns in Thailand’s general elections. Prab has also contributed his skills to advocacy projects related to social activisms and civil society such as a digital archive of 6 October 1976 massacre (www.doct6.com), and founded Rethink Thailand, an initiative to help academics and NGOs making infographic animations about social issues.

Prior to his career, Prab became a student activist after the Thai military cracked down on the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) protests in May 2010. The student organization he founded, League of Liberal Thammasat for Democracy (LLTD), had been recognized for an early effective use of social media for political campaigns. While he was a 4th year student in 2013, he was recruited to work as a social media manager for Bangkok gubernatorial election campaign of Pheu Thai Party’s candidate Pol.Gen. Pongsapat Pongcharoen. After graduation, Prab continued his path of communication strategist with Pheu Thai Party and Yingluck Shinawatra’s government until the military coup occurred in May 2014.

Prab studied integrative business management at Thammasat University, Bangkok (BBA in 2013) and studied a master degree in communication and information sciences with specialization human aspects of information technology at Tilburg University, the Netherlands (MSc in 2017). 

In addition to political-related works, Prab’s interdisciplinary experiences in communication strategy and data science has been recognized as one of his core competencies. He is currently an adjunct faculty member at Thammasat Business School and a senior data scientist at Voice TV. In January 2019, he led the creation of data science and machine learning course at Thammasat Business School, the first machine learning course ever created at any Thailand’s business schools.","{'country': 'United States', 'short': 'Brooklyn, New York', 'city': 'Brooklyn', 'state': 'New York', 'default': 'Brooklyn, New York, United States'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Computer Software,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'school': {'name': 'Tilburg University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHNJkPAcEjYEg/company-logo_400_400/0/1631003396114?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=pmxkaQ2W7K-vpqyiSW215OvNG5wTY3voV4Aj1sLAp2s', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/tilburg-university/'}, 'degree_name': ""Master's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'Communication and Information Sciences'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2009}, 'end': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}}, 'school': {'name': 'Thammasat Business School', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQH5Ad_t48SfPQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1609745857358?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=g8jhlYfkfD592d6BchyXbL1qgxzycEFXgEzBn1wVSbU', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/thammasat-business-school/'}, 'degree_name': 'Bachelor of Business Administration - BBA', 'field_of_study': 'Integrative Business Management'}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': 1188358, 'name': 'Voice TV', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQG1M3zLuv9zkA/company-logo_400_400/0/1519882195138?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=hurYpamxLfiQc0wkiRXpxTh7Y7ejsrQtcVyApeZVYmI', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/voice-tv/', 'employees': {'start': 51, 'end': 200}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Bangkok City, Thailand', 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}}, 'company': 'Voice TV', 'description': None, 'title': 'Senior Data Scientist', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}]}, {'company': {'id': 38139446, 'name': 'Thammasat Business School', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQH5Ad_t48SfPQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1609745857358?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=g8jhlYfkfD592d6BchyXbL1qgxzycEFXgEzBn1wVSbU', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/thammasat-business-school/', 'employees': {'start': 201, 'end': 500}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Bangkok, Bangkok City, Thailand', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': 'Thammasat Business School', 'description': 'Over 70 machine learning projects from predicting used car prices to predicting SET50 Index Futures position:\n\n- Created an elective course “The Introduction to Data Science and Machine\nLearning” to teach BBA and Master-degree students how to use machine learning\nto solve business problems\n- Since 2019, 238 students have completed the course with over 70 machine\nlearning projects attempting to solve today’s business issues', 'title': 'Adjunct Lecturer', 'employment_type': 'Part-time'}]}, {'company': {'id': None, 'name': ""Mr.Chadchart Sittipunt's Bangkok governor election "", 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Bangkok, Bangkok City, Thailand', 'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': ""Mr.Chadchart Sittipunt's Bangkok governor election "", 'description': 'Increased his polling percentage from 22% in March 2021 to 51%, winning over 1.3 million votes — the biggest landslide in Bangkok’s election history.\n\n- Developed the foundation of his campaign such as campaign team structure,\npolicy framework, volunteer system and communication strategy\n- Supervised the development of www.chadchart.com, the first-ever open policy\nplatform in Thai politics.
