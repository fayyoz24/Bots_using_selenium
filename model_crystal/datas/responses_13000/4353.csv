I have an exceptional capability to manage projects, from initial inception to successful completion, under tight resourcing constraints and to the specific needs of both internal and external client groups.

I have been responsible for induction training programmes of 4-6 weeks that focussed on corporate policies and procedures, product knowledge, IT systems and the soft skills required to carry out a service based role. I was responsible for the ongoing development of the employees which included liaising with the CSM to conduct and report upon the full learning cycle.
 As a training consultant  and seller in the B2B, long cycle sales arena, I sold  and trained commercial skills (selling, negotiating, communicating) to organisations across the world. I've trained procurement professionals in negotiation skills in an Oil & Gas organisation in places such as Columbia, Trinidad, Pakistan, Angola and Algeria; I've trained Sales professionals in Selling in Manufacturing organisations in China, Singapore, UAE and most of Europe; for a financial services organisation I trained five commercial skills programmes on a train-the-trainer basis in over 30 countries including USA, Australia and New Zealand. This means I have a strong cultural awareness when selling and delivering training across borders and can adapt and be credible across the world. 

In addition to the traditional classroom training, I have been instrumental in developing and delivering training in the virtual environment. I have used Microsoft Lync and Adobe Connect Pro to deliver skills development programmes to geographically spread learners to the same level of engagement and skill improvement as their traditional classroom colleagues.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Human Resources,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'Association of Accounting Technicians', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'AAT', 'field_of_study': None}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'CIPD', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'Certificate in Training Practice', 'field_of_study': None}]",[],[],"[{'name': 'Insights Discovery Practitioner', 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}}, 'authority': 'Insights', 'url': None, 'license_number': None, 'display_source': None, 'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Insights', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHAXohHnGTNCg/company-logo_400_400/0/1519856827395?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=KroDIKXRTHhGIFyzEjpB571Thl9H-hlhYrSi7Bb6YsI', 'url': None}}]",[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': 11348, 'name': 'Booking.com', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEgzF5azm3fNA/company-logo_400_400/0/1628510256914?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=oaxCkHySuLgrEFLXxw_Q9XDv1cHJeWHoyplnre8Oexo', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/booking.com/', 'employees': {'start': 10001, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Booking.com', 'description': 'Responsible for the programme management of L&D programmes and projects at a global level', 'title': 'Manager L&D Products and Programs', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}, {'location': 'Amsterdam Area, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Booking.com', 'description': 'Responsible for the Learning and Development of the Global Finance department at Booking.com', 'title': 'Global Learning Manager', 'employment_type': None}, {'location': 'Amsterdam Area, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'company': 'Booking.com', 'description': 'Responsible for partnering with key stakeholders within the Finance teams to ensure that their learning needs are met throughout the year either by developing bespoke workshops or procuring the right external providers.', 'title': 'Senior Global Learning Specialist (Finance)', 'employment_type': None}]}, {'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Lee Cumberbatch Training', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Amsterdam Area, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'company': 'Lee Cumberbatch Training', 'description': ""I am passionate about Learning and Development and truly believe that it is an essential part of the growth and future of any organisation.
