Before that, I studied sociology at the Catholic University of Asunción and transfered my credits to Eastern. I am currently pursuing a Masters degree in International Development Studies at the University of Amsterdam

I have worked the last 3 years at SERVOME (Mennonite Volunteer Service), an organization created by mennonite churches in Paraguay to serve those most in need in this country. Among its facilities it includes a psychiatric rehabilitation center, an emergency relief team, a children's home, a day care, a school, and a home for volunteers. I have been involved in all of these areas.

My specific position at SERVOME was as the Service Centers Coordinator and it consisted of helping develop projects that could expand the organization's outreach using less resources, especially in the case of mental health.

I was also the Paraguayan representative of MCC (Mennonite Central Committee) and was in charge of assisting volunteers from Paraguay in their journey through the bureaucracy of obtaining their visas to countries across the globe such as India, Israel, the United States, and Honduras. 

I did all sorts of other jobs too. For example, I was the paraguayan representative of MCC (Mennonite Central Committee), I assisted volunteers and conscientious objectors, I did research for a book about the organization, I bought groceries for the children's home on a weekly basis, among other responsibilities.

I have also volunteered in many occasions: at youth programs, kids programs, retirement homes, relief actions, and house building; I went through the Royal Rangers program (A Christian equivalent to scouts) and was a leader for 8 years; I have volunteered at my church for more than 10 years and I have participated in volunteer and professional programs in Chile and Ecuador with Movida, and in Bolivia with the Mennonite Central Committee; and I volunteered as a caretaker, geography and bible study tutor for 5 months at the Give Back Hope Children’s Home in Nepal.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'German', 'proficiency': 'PROFESSIONAL_WORKING'}, {'name': 'Spanish', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}]}",Non-profit Organization Management,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2024}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Amsterdam', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEfHBj_we-_kw/company-logo_400_400/0/1659945104460?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=k8egLWP3eIqIloLFULSmlLPZQR7cvpzTKHpzgtnWaBI', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-amsterdam/'}, 'degree_name': ""Master's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'International Development'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}}, 'school': {'name': 'Eastern University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHCT_tdkaDYtQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1658151700033?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=xy501_-3iUu4dKVz704VZu6umY7-pwgWdEtszCNVI-g', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/eastern-university/'}, 'degree_name': 'Bachelor of Arts - BA', 'field_of_study': 'Sociology'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'school': {'name': 'Universidad Católica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHQGGvXqd-LYA/company-logo_400_400/0/1563892706988?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=ATYz4VPjJWWGmppPtGpAikXo1uCjgGQ1cm3j6hGWpQA', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/unicatolicapy/'}, 'degree_name': None, 'field_of_study': 'Sociology'}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'SERVOME', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'Asunción, Paraguay', 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'SERVOME', 'description': 'https://servome.net/', 'title': 'Coordinator', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}]}]",[],"['Interpersonal Skills', 'Project Coordination', 'Project Management', 'Research', 'fluency in three languages', 'Intercultural Management', 'Social Communication', 'an eye for detail', 'Report Writing', 'Writing', 'Creative Writing', 'Presentations', 'Leadership', 'Spanish', 'English']",,,
