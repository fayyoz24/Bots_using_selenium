Joos van Barneveld, better known as DOES, was born in Veghel, The Netherlands, in 1982. His prime passion was football and he trained and played as a professional player for football club Fortuna Sittard from the age of 9. In 1997 he discovered graffiti, a passion that coerced him into a double life. For more than a decade he was forced to combine the daily needs of a professional athlete with the night-time secrets of a graffiti writer. In 2010 a knee injury forced him to give up his career as a football player and rethink his future.
 
Where many would have experienced a drama, DOES saw the possibility to exclusively devote himself to art, developing his practice and carrying his craftsmanship to a higher level with the same dedication, focus and self-restraint that soccer taught him. Through the years, both as an artist and as a member of the LoveLetters graffiti collective, his style, which is today highly recognizable, has become a mix of influences from old-school writers and his own research. In his drawings and paintings you can discover the roots of 3D lettering, but you can also be surprised by his patient research of well balanced color schemes and his capacity of controlling the purity of outlines. As Phase 2 wrote in his Style Writing from the Underground manifesto in 1996: “Writing is centered on names, words and letters. Combined with the objective of their execution, this creates the product and the overall make up of the writer”. DOES perfectly understood this process and calmly researched his own style, which can be seen as a kind of controlled dripping. His letters, with their dizzying colour schemes, are stretched so much that they seem to release their energy and spread drips all over the wall.
 
While many recognize him as an ultra-talented draftsman and an amazing colourist, DOES is today moving the boundaries of his own artistic research in new conceptual directions, looking at graffiti as an archive from which he can physically pull out samples that embody his own roots. He drills or peels off walls covered with spray paint to include these artefacts into sculptures made of plaster. He develops a kind of contemporary archeology of urban spaces, keeping a trace of the geographical coordinates of these walls, readapting the tools of a science that normally deals with past times to underline his own story and the impact of graffiti culture on our society.

As soon as I opened up to it, the image of what the collage could become started to form in my head. From experience I know that if I can visualize something, then I can make it happen.\nI am not easily pleased with a result, but with this piece the result is better than I had hoped for.

DOES designed an anniversary shirt for the professional soccer club Fortuna Sittard celebrating its 50th anniversary.\n\nFull circle\nWhen it all comes together. When the pieces fit like letterforms on a mural and soccer on a green grass field. When the past and present become one and passion equals profession. When art transforms into fluent lines to embellish a shirt. That is when life becomes meaningful to its fullest extent and when DOES is overcome by pure joy, gratitude and humbleness.\n \nFortuna Sittard\nHolland has a huge soccer tradition. Soccer binds people; it’s what you look forward to throughout the week and enjoy on the weekend. The professional soccer club Fortuna Sittard played an important role in DOES´ life. From watching games with his dad as a little boy to wearing the green-yellow shirt of the team himself while playing in the highest division. Although his soccer career is part of the past DOES´ passion and love for the club has never faded. When preparing a list of influential companies to potentially collaborate with, Fortuna topped the list undisputed. Opportunity entered the game as the soccer club celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Putting heads together Fortuna Sittard and DOES came up with the idea of an exclusive anniversary shirt designed by DOES. This is not an assignment that DOES takes lightly. It’s all about putting care into details. \n\nShirt Design\nDOES designed a shirt that is both a homage to the club and a piece of art from his heart. As a sketch embodies the basis of an artwork that grows into a display of technique and composition, the training of young talent is the foundation for a successful soccer team. Fortuna has been well known for its solid training programme that develops talented players into first class professional players. The design of the shirt with its liquid lines in the bottom reflects the roots and foundation of the club.\n\nwww.digitaldoes.com\n\n\n', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Joos', 'last_name': ""'Does' van Barneveld"", 'name': None, 'headline': 'Artist'}]}]",[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'DOES ', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 1997}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'The Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 1997}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'DOES ', 'description': 'He who Does, Creates’\n\nJoos van Barneveld, better known as DOES, was born in Veghel, The Netherlands, in 1982.
