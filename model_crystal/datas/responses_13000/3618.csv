- Business Analyst (gathering and interpreting business need and convert them to requirements)
- Software Architect (translating those requirement in a High-Level Design)
- Software Engineer (implementing the Design)
- Software Tester/Validator (validating the implementation against the requirements)
- Release Manager (Ensuring the successful transition through the Software Lifecycle of a product or service)
- Second / Thirdline Support (As Subject Matter Expert (SME), troubleshooting where necessary)

note: there is an obious difference between could be, should be and want to be. At the current point in my career, technical leadership is more of interest than pure development. Sure, I will do whatever the situation might require, but technical leadership in a position that requires insight and can drive innovation, leading to practical solutions would be the most optimal use of my talents and potential .

I am  very gifted in the ability to translate technical jargon into executive and workfloor-friendly metaphors and vice-versa.

This technical prowess is coupled with an ability to formulate solutions to any problem on short-term, middle to long term, taking into account the business context (budget, time, material, resources).

This also means that I have a strong knowledge and theoretical background of algorithms, and I am an accomplished programmer in languages like C, C++ and Java, and can adapt to and learn new technology in a very short amount of time.

I have the ability to motivate people and nudge them gently out of their comfort zone. I am a leader by consensus, meaning that all team members are equally important, and each opinion is weighed on the base of its own merit. When tough decision have to be made, I am not afraid to make them. 

Bottom-Line: I am a Solution Provider, where Solutions take into account the complete context, rather than just the technical. For me, it is not a matter of thinking outside the box. I was not thinking in terms of boxes to begin with. I will tell you like it is - or how I perceive it is, what the dangers and risks are of any given proposal and I will leave the decisionmaking based on my assessments to you. Unless of course you delegate the decision-making to me.

Finally, while my profile says 'Hengelo' I am currently in the process of finding something a little bit more closer to my town of birth, Amersfoort. If you are reading this from outside of the Netherlands: yes, I am willing to relocate.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Maastricht, Limburg', 'city': 'Maastricht', 'state': 'Limburg', 'default': 'Maastricht, Limburg, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, {'country': 'NL', 'language': 'nl'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Dutch', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'French', 'proficiency': 'ELEMENTARY'}, {'name': 'German', 'proficiency': 'PROFESSIONAL_WORKING'}]}",Information Technology & Services,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1987}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1994}}, 'school': {'name': 'Utrecht University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C510BAQG6HfmPTdJKXw/company-logo_400_400/0/1519884681258?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=i09IbD7RibJlZYVNrl7o5pIy-Ip7_0I2XZqXZA9kXUI', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/universiteit-utrecht/'}, 'degree_name': 'MSc', 'field_of_study': 'Computer Science'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1981}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1987}}, 'school': {'name': 'Corderius College', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'VWO', 'field_of_study': 'Gymnasium'}]",[],[],[],[],"[{'title': 'Convoy Track Dissemination in ISAF', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}}, 'description': 'Goal: to disseminate convoy tracks from commercial companies to ISAF NATO systems in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Theater Movement Coordination Cell (TMCC) of the ISAF in Afghanistan requires situational awareness regarding the movement of convoys in Afghanistan.

Those parsers would then produce output that would be linked against a dictionary and a list of parsed items, also making use of stemming techniques for the language used.
