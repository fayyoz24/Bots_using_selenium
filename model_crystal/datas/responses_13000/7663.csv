I have devoted my whole career to setting up and managing supply chains that enable smooth operations, from large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Second Suez Canal in Egypt and the largest bio-diesel refinery in Europe to time-critical agricultural inputs and life-saving items for tens of thousands of people facing uncertainty.
 
With international experience and transactions spanning 30+ countries, I offer a consistent track record of sourcing suppliers that perform and deliver, driving multi-million dollar savings, breaking through bottlenecks, and complying with standards and regulations.

I‚Äôm not a supply chain professional who you can fit in one box though. And that‚Äôs precisely my value ‚Äì I have successfully devised, steered and implemented procurement strategies while setting up offices, training staff, cultivating supplier relationships and mitigating risks of stock-out for global companies and international NGOs alike.
 
üåè My added value comes from my wealth of experience with low- and middle-income countries. For instance:

‚õ¥I know what it takes to ship high-value medical equipment from the Netherlands to countries like Bhutan and Rwanda and reach the last mile, the final destination. I did this OTIF to 24 countries in Africa and Asia and overcame some COVID-19 obstacles in the process.

üíªI know what to do when you have just 2 months to set up an office, complete with a purchasing team and procurement processes, in a country you‚Äôve never set foot in before and you don‚Äôt know the local language. In this case it was Egypt, and for a consortium of major marine engineering companies. 

üíäI know how complicated 3rd party requirements can be, but I still managed to source hundreds of millions dollars‚Äô worth of medicines and work with ministries of health in countries like Vietnam and Zambia to fulfil their orders, all in compliance with The Global Fund‚Äôs standards. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a talented international supply chain specialist, I‚Äôm interested in having a conversation. Feel free to connect with me or email lucatrombella@yahoo.com.
