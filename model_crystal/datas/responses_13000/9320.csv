The user can find fuel prices based on a custom radius from his current location, per city, per gas station company, per fuel type. The user can also watch the fuel price history per gas station, using beautifully designed charts. Furthermore, the user could save his/her personal preferences for quick lookup, and was receiving push notifications with news. The fuel prices were received every hour from a public system and saved in a cloud service.\n\nThe tool is composed of integration with a public system that provides fuel prices, a cloud service, composed of a database and REST API, to save the fuel prices, a service the sends the fuel prices from the public system to the cloud service every hour, and an iOS application that fetches and displays the prices per gas station.

In a nutshell, while the user is walking, the algorithms count the user's steps and automatically recognize relatively straight paths and turns and use them to generate a map and a set of instructions in real-time. It allows for navigation inside buildings. The user can create new paths or use existing paths that are shared by other users via a remote server. The user interacts with the mobile application and the map recorder or navigator using a combination of custom screen gestures, vibrations and sounds.\n\nWe have used iOS for the mobile application and a server for the route saving and sharing.
