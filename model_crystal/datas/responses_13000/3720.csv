This created room to hire the right managers to build the team. After a year we were rated as the most engaged IT team in Russia.\n\nFor the transition I used my experience in vendor management, outsourcing and service management. My team was the first of 7 to finish the transition without any red indicator. I was recognised as a role model in methodology to follow. Our stream was the first to implement service desk for application as a pilot.\n\nNext I looked for opportunities to drive excellence through efficiency.

My recruitment experience helped me to overcome the challenge of recruiting the right profile, balancing technical and soft skills, according to the Russian market. With my strong network and influencing skills, I engaged with people in western Europe to support the transition of their job to Russia. With my experience and leadership, I helped and developed the new management into a Mars style leadership team.\n\nThe size of my job had increased a lot in terms of budget accountability (4M USD) and complexity with licencing, outsourcing and currency rates.
