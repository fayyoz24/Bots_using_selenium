During that time, I was still a senior student at Hoa Sen University and the study was good and practically useful for me and my future jobs. However, I felt there is something still missing. \n\nEventually, I found the answer for myself. I studied International Business, and even though my minor was about exporting-importing, logistics, supply chain I was studying and working in a national environment. The people whom I was working with are Vietnamese, most of the business cases I encountered was also related to the domestic environment. I thought that if I want to do business internationally, I will have to be international, I have to meet more people from different backgrounds and cultures so that I can have more experience to deal with intercultural problems and issues in business in the future. Furthermore, I also need to learn more languages as it is important to communicate and understand prospects, colleagues and partners    \n\nTherefore, I found that Stenden with a course of International Business and Languages can help me fulfil that knowledge and experience I lacked. Then, I decided to leave my current study in Vietnam for a new beginning at Stenden. \n\nAfter a year at Stenden, I learned a lot of things from not only the study course but also people surrounding me.

Therefore, by applying for this certificate, the school wanted to be officially recognised that it has reached the internationalisation requirements.\n\nThis application involved a quality check by an external panel who visited and talked to different stakeholders of the programme: students, alumni, lecturers, management, etc., as well as check the school's documentation so that the council can assure the programme is qualified in internationalisation.\n\nIt can be said that the activities involving in this quality check for the application are really important for the school as well as the students, lecturers and staff who is receiving the benefits from it. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSelf-reflection:\nDuring this time, I faced a lot of issues which influenced negatively to my productivity. As a result, I lost my balance in time management and tasks organisation. Eventually, one of my biggest unforgotten mistakes happened. I forgot to set the appointment for the last final interview with the CeQuInt council and I didn't present on that day. \n\nThe evaluation's result surprisingly turned out to be successful and positive. However, I still felt disappointed in myself. I regretted not paying much attention to what happened on the day I received an email informing me what time the final showcase and panel would occur. I knew that by my accident, I caused a lot of troubles for other people.\n\nIt took me a while to recognise that was a lesson for me and I have to accept it as one of my flaws.Therefore, I try to manage my time more efficiently. Then, I accepted that I do have limits and, therefore, I shouldn't accept tasks if I will not be able to do as I have to be full responsible for every assignment I accept."", 'title': 'CeQuInt showcase', 'employment_type': None}, {'location': 'Emmen, the Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'company': 'NHL Stenden', 'description': ""In a nutshell, the workshop is about Etiquette and making a good first impression when doing business. Therefore, before the workshop, every student including me was told to dress well. In terms of dressing well, it meant that each one has to wear formally. For men, we have to wear vests with ties and working shoes. In contrast, ladies were told to wear dresses or they can put on suits. \n\n\nThroughout the information gathered in the workshop, I realised that dressing is not the only thing needed to focus on in order to make a good first impression on somebody, but I will also need to learn how to start a conversation, maintain it and other activities. One of those is to use my knowledge on intercultural awareness adapting to the conversation which is being held. I have to control my verbal and non-verbal behaviours, even the smallest detail of my actions. Because what I believe I am doing right could be back-fired at me since it might violate my partners' expectations and, therefore, it will make a bad impression on me. \n\nI also needed to learn about the Etiquette. In my country, the culture is different from here. Hence, the way people eat is completely distinct from here. We normally don't use knives and forks, therefore, when I was introduced etiquette in here I was completely surprised. I didn't know that each knife and fork have different functions. Each one has its own purpose and it will be used for special dishes. Even glasses have many types depending on the usage and the drink I wish to drink. Many things else to learn, but yet I felt interested and wanted to know more. However, the time for the workshop is limited, so we ended the workshop and walked to the Stone restaurant inside the school.\n\nHere, we applied what we had learnt into practice and we had a wonderful lunch and conversation with our friends who were pretending to be partners to everyone else."", 'title': 'Etiquette and making a good first impression', 'employment_type': None}, {'location': 'Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam', 'date': {'start': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'company': 'NHL Stenden', 'description': ""Self-reflection:\n\nThis might sound unnecessary, but for me, this was worthy to be an experience that should be also included amongst the others. In my opinion, this is the turning point of my life, when I started to be independent on everything. \n\nSince the university is from another country, which is the Netherlands, I had to have a good preparation before beginning my future study there. First of all, I had to look up information of the course I would take in order to know what competencies I need to achieve. In my opinion, it was actually very important to know what I was going to take. I didn't want to take the course without knowing what I would get from it. I would have to be responsible for my decisions. I couldn't do everything instinctively anymore, instead, I should have plans for what I will do in the future. \n\nThen, I gathered required documents for school enrollment. I also prepared my VISA applications. I have to admit there were many tasks to do and I learned that I had to be careful with every single detail in the documents since if there had been any mistakes made by my carelessness, I would not only waste money and time but also would have to do everything again from the beginning. \n\nAlthough, those things were small details, they made me be more responsible for my life.
