I seek to give clarity to problems through my design solutions and I enjoy the challenges that come along the way.

Thanks to the teachings of amazing mentors and brilliant partners, I was fortunate enough to be honored with a few creative awards, including from D&AD, Cannes Lion, Spikes Asia, Tinta, Kancils, Adfest and recently the youngest woman ever at 24 years old to be honored on Campaign Asia's Women To Watch list alongside 39 C-suite superstars.

It’s the hunger for responsibility; to strive to do better and challenge the status quo because in my world, there are no barriers or excuses, only opportunities to question, think, play, make, do and fail.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'The Randstad, Netherlands', 'city': 'The Randstad', 'state': 'Netherlands', 'default': 'The Randstad, Netherlands'}",False,False,"[{'url': 'https://www.campaignasia.com/gallery/women-to-watch-2017-meet-the-future-champions-of-change/438885', 'title': 'Women to Watch 2017: Meet the future champions of change', 'description': 'The Herculean, nay, Nüwaen efforts of these pioneers are steadily turning our industry into a more prosperous, open-minded and generally desirable place to work—and not only for women.', 'image': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/C5627AQG6cYkYDDuarQ/articleshare-shrink_1280_800/0/1691993638793?e=1692957600&v=beta&t=it6fudIHqC4pvySf76_KQWhqWli9YfaeFntjjSn_Q9I'}]","{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'English', 'proficiency': None}]}",Design,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}}, 'school': {'name': 'LASALLE College of the Arts', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQGQg5Ghifb4EQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1688438524382?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=gpfrtKzmGdlbAh0M2OEVv6JDEv0RT4hgEl6774msBIE', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/lasallesg/'}, 'degree_name': 'Advertising Communication', 'field_of_study': 'Advertising'}]",[],"[{'title': '2018', 'description': ""I had the opportunity to represent Malaysia in the Young Lotus competition.
