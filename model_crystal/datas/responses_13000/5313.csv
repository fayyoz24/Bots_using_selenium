michiel-damen-b3180735,Michiel,Damen,Senior Lecturer at Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) of the University of Twente,,,personal,ACoAAAdqpZUB39GNWcVvmyaA8YJFT_n-m08vVro,124429717,,"Michiel Damen studied Physical Geography at the Department of Earth Sciences of the Free University in Amsterdam. He graduated in 1978.
The main subjects included geomorphology of the Netherlands.  Additional subjects followed were Social Geography and Landscape Ecology  (Dorschkamp, Wageningen).
    
Mchiel Damen continued his study at the ITC in Enschede in the field of Geomorphological Photo interpretation (11 month Postgraduate course) . 

After the ITC course, he participated in various consulting projects on aerial photo-interpretation on land degradation and terrain unit mapping (Cabo Verde, Burkina Faso, Moluccas).

From 1984 to 1986 Michiel Damen was the Assistant-Secretary of the Commission VII symposium of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). 

From 1983 onwards he became a lecturer at the ITC, specialized in geomorphic terrain analysis/image interpretation and the application of RS/GIS for Hazard & Disaster Risk Management. He joined as a supervisor student fieldworks in Italy (Basilicata, Etna), Spain (Daroca, Malaga, Extremadura), Indonesia (1986-1992: Chibinong/Bandung - Special course on Geographical Landscape Analysis for Indonesian Resources Development) and Nepal (1996: Expedition to Rolwaling, to create a GIS data base of the Glacier Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) hazard along the lowest river terraces). During this project a start was made of the mitigation of Tsho Rolpa glacier lake in Rolwaling valley. 

From 2007 – 2009 He was the Course coordinator of the Joint Education MSc & PGD program  on “Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Management”  between the Faculty ITC of the  Univ. Twente, Netherlands and the Indian Institute for Remote Sensing (IIRS), Dehradun, India. 

During his career he was a resource person in
