I specialise in sexual and reproductive health programming, organisational leadership and transformation, digital media for social change and programme management for non-governmental organisations, leading multiple teams across the African continent (Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe), working with donor agencies in Germany, and more recently leading global teams from the Netherlands. 

My professional background began in health care management in Zimbabwe. My areas of expertise and focus have been project management for primary health care and sexual and reproductive health and rights, resource mobilisation in crisis contexts, public health surveillance, treatment and prevention mechanisms for communicable diseases; and feminist movement-building for vulnerable groups where grassroots communities are not only recipients of aid and services, but also become agents of change within their localities.  

More recently I have widened my scope to work through public health communication and digital media, and movement-building in hostile contexts on issues such as gender-based violence, structural violence, extractives and the climate crisis, with special emphasis on community empowerment of young people, LGBTI community members, rural and indigenous groups and environmental and human rights activists. 

In my work, I always place special emphasis on equal opportunities for people on the margins, and I believe that my down to earth, practical approach is a proven asset to the many challenges faced in fragile and resource constrained environments.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,"[{'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHHS2P058f0', 'title': 'HagueTalks Portrait - Felicity Sibindi', 'description': 'A conversation on the importance of a decolonised, Afro-centric approach to digital data that amplifies the voices of young people to influence national and international policy spaces beyond the paternalistic lens of policy-makers.
