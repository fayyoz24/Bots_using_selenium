Our long-term vision is cultivating the next generation of emphatic critical thinkers. A generation of citizens equipped with all the mental tools that allow them to tackle today's pressing civil and political problems:\n\nFrom fake-news, political bubbles, polarization and political outrage: the faith in shared objective truth is in decay. Conspiracies feed on a growing distrust in authorities. Science is often reduced to just another opinion. With every enraging tweet or polarizing clickbait-news, we're taking out a debt on the social fabric of society, by bankrupting our democratic functioning bit by bit. The modern attention economy benefits greatly from the short term exploitation of our gullibility and persuadability. But the long term damaging effects are externalized on society, leaving us to pay for repairing social trust and understanding in the future. While awareness of the growing debt is dawning, we discover it has also left us still needing to figure how to repay this at scale; how do we depolarize?\n\nI believe we must learn to resist, for example by choosing which media sources (read truth sources) we trust more carefully and critically, and cultivating mental immunity against the spread of conspiracy, sensation, myths and the sowing of social distrust.\n\nTo solve this classic tragedy of the commons, it's my core belief that the true long-term solution - not fighting some symptom - has to lie at the root of where we're supposed to learn to think: education!\n\nI got involved shortly after founding.
