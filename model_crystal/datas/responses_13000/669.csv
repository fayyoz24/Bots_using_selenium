I'm Ruud Veltenaar - Global (TED) Speaker, philosopher, author of best seller Once Upon A Future, SDG-ambassador and Faculty Member (SLP) Nyenrode Business University.

With almost 30 years of experience as a thought leader, international serial entrepreneur, educator and impact investor I help people and organizations to create a better,  more sustainable world and just, inclusive society.

As a world leading future thinker I facilitate inspirements (keynotes, lectures, master classes, workshops, summer summits and board room interventions) on all continents about our world in transformation to the next phase in our civilization and the vital solutions for tomorrow's world.

What's gonna be: Rest? Retreat? Revolt? Or Reset through reimagination and redesign?

The past decades more than 1 million people from all over the world visited my inspirements about transformational leadership, innovative entrepreneurship, sustainability and living and working with impact.

My motto: In the end everything will be OK, and if it is not OK, it's not the end.
