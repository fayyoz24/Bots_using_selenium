I have worked in 3 different continents and 5 different countries and I can truly say I have experience in working in multicultural and cross-functional teams. 

I’ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries, this made me the person I am today; flexible, a hands-on attitude and a great team player who is not afraid to take on a variety of projects. I’m not only used to wearing many hats, I sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two working days are exactly the same. I am an expert in management consultancy, project management, technology matchmaking, international market research and business development. I totally enjoy networking and organizing (networking) events and I have a talent for teambuilding & management training.

I have worn many hats in my career, as a result I have a unique ability to work in multi-disciplinary projects, but I believe that my professional value boils down to my work experience in all three sectors (public, private & non-profit) and my ability to adapt to new situations/projects.

I am passionate about working in the NGO/non-profit sector because it engages both my heart and head and allows me to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to a positive impact in people’s lives, the wellbeing of animals and the environment.
