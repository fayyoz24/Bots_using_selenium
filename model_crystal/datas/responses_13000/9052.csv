Welcome to my profile. I am Ivica, 28 year-old young man from Croatia (depends on who you ask but still consider myself young) mag.ing. of logistics and management in the maritime industry and transport. 

During my studies, I was a member of the student council at my Faculty, a member of AIESEC and ESN, a participant in many student projects, case studies, volunteering events, even led my own project - a field trip for my university colleagues to Port of Koper.

I am 3 times Erasmus exchange participant - the first student exchange was in Wismar, Germany while 2nd was in Piraeus/Athens in Greece. 3rd one was an internship in Warsaw, Poland as an assistant forwarder. These ERASMUS exchanges taught me to step out of my comfort zone, adapt to new countries, cultures and mentalities, be more confident, assertive, proactive, met many new people from all over the world and perfected my communication skills.

After my internship, went to the Netherlands on two occasions to gain some experience in logistics/warehousing, saw how warehouse logistics & distribution processes work from the bottom to up and gained valuable experience working in large teams, learnt to be more resourceful, responsible and give my best to whatever I am doing. 

Aspiring to keep learning, developing and growing (personally and professionally) myself further in the field of logistics and supply chain, procurement, demand planning, project management, languages etc.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Hoofddorp, North Holland', 'city': 'Hoofddorp', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Hoofddorp, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Croatian', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'Italian', 'proficiency': 'ELEMENTARY'}, {'name': 'Spanish', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}]}",Logistics & Supply Chain,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2013}, 'end': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}}, 'school': {'name': 'Sveučilište u Rijeci / University of Rijeka', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFDxDCwcwRm0w/company-logo_400_400/0/1675943427933?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=patdLjHWE-N7xHCJjX2hnwupo1_1HvfoZVl4mKzgUI8', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/sveu%C4%8Dili%C5%A1te-u-rijeci/'}, 'degree_name': ""Master's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'Faculty of Maritime Studies - Logistics and Management in Maritime Industry and Transport'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Piraeus', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQGuMhsQPZheqg/company-logo_400_400/0/1689304636783?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=QAkY7Nc04aHur-fJF3LKRu2VslZ3mA0OU6eYwz83OUw', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-piraeus/'}, 'degree_name': ""Master's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'Maritime Studies'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}, 'end': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'school': {'name': 'Hochschule Wismar', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGmheLEnVcmZg/company-logo_400_400/0/1581584798209?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=40izVP_031Bvm2ODx3NhcxQHB3hIeZ-3eT8wrMmMcMw', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/hochschule-wismar/'}, 'degree_name': ""Master's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'Business'}]",[],"[{'title': 'Case Study Realizator', 'description': 'Winning 2nd place for Villa Kapetanović d.o.o, design hotel Navis  at the case study competition Realizator', 'issuer': 'University of Rijeka Foundation', 'date': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}}]",[],[],"[{'title': 'Case Study Realizator - City of Rijeka (Rijeka tunnel)', 'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'description': 'For the third time in a row I participated at the University of Rijeka Foundation case study competition called Realizator.
