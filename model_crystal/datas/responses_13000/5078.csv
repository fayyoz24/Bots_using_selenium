Currently, I'm based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
I have worked either with big world-wide-known products with a million audience or dozens of small mobile projects starting from the first launch and open beta tests.
A deep understanding of in-game activity KPIs, monetization mechanics, user paying and gameplay behavior as well as a good knowledge base in statistical methods for data analysis and testing statistical hypotheses allows me to provide professional analysis, draw up valuable recommendations for business metrics improvement and develop methodologies for evaluating the efficiency of implemented in-game features.
My experience in planning, running, and evaluating AB tests is useful in a modern market for improving product performance and delivering additional value either to the business or to its customers. Vast reporting experience, strong data visualization skills, and good experience in working with big data allow me to provide operative assistance in decision-making to management and technical specialists and can also be valuable for BI system development.
Accuracy and responsibility, effective communication skills and patience, desire to learn new knowledge, and sharing my experience with other teams make me a good candidate who can be an effective team member and make a contribution to products.
