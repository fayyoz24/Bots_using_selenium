ðŸ“Œ  Cross-functional Team Leadership
ðŸ“Œ  Strategic Planning
ðŸ“Œ  Operational Management and Planning
ðŸ“Œ  Process Improvement and Change Management
ðŸ“Œ  Strategic Consulting
ðŸ“Œ  Training / Organisational Development / Capacity Building / Knowledge Management

My biggest professional achievements so far: 
â€¢ As one of three field team leaders, led multi-disciplinary teams on several highly sensitive missions in Syria within the framework of the UN Security Council resolution, which led to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the OPCW in 2013
â€¢ Held the Chairperson position of the OPCW Staff Representative Association in 2010
â€¢ Led about 100 demilitarization and non-proliferation inspections in 40+ countries at the OPCW
â€¢ Developed, coordinated, and delivered approximately 30 training programmes in the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Suriname, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Serbia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia from 2010 to 2020
â€¢ At the Sasol One Site (South Africa), managed a chemical production division:
- Controlled annual gas and utilities budgets - 65 million gigajoules, an equivalent to about EUR 35-40M, and quantified financial losses
- Developed initial change and knowledge management processes necessary for the restructuring of two divisions

As a well-travelled professional with a robust work ethic, an adaptable personality, and the ability to thrive in both individual and dynamic team environments, I've developed excellent interpersonal skills grounded in leading cross functional teams and working in culturally and geographically diverse environments, as well as an impressive skillset as a critical thinker, negotiator, mediator, interviewer, and lead decision maker.
