This experience was accumulated during my activity in dozens of investigations carried out within: 
-The Fight Against Fraud Department, where, for more than 4 years, my entire activity was focused on combating fraud affecting European Union's financial interest, ensuring that legal persons can be held liable for any of the criminal offences, providing a report containing the evidence for serious financial offences which affected EU’s financial interests.
-Control Body of The Prime Minister, where, in more than 3 years, my reports were an important part of investigations undertaken personally, or by coordinating my teams as a Director, in cases involving projects financed with governmental funds and offences affecting the national budget's financial interests.
-Romanian National Police - Brigade for Countering Organized Crime, where I worked, as lead investigator or part of investigative teams, in Countering Terrorism Financing and Money Laundering Department and the main responsibility consisted in discovering, countering and undertaking criminal investigation regarding crimes committed in the financial domains by organized crime groups (fraud, money laundering and smuggling).
Most of my knowledge I achieved in a self-learning manner from the necessity to solve complex cases in short periods of time.
I consider that the experience acquired, the knowledge achieved in the crime investigation, legal, economic and financial domain, and, also, the ability to adapt anytime to new situations can help me to overcome any situation and circumstances that could intervene in my activity.
I have a solid knowledge in law enforcement investigative techniques, most important in money laundering techniques and methods, also in financial investigation techniques and methods as well as knowledge and experience of the techniques relating to the identification, freezing, management and confiscation of assets.
Many times, I proved that I can work in stressful conditions, and I participated in many cases of criminal investigation and countering organized crime.
Also, I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, I get along extremely well with my colleagues and I earned everyone’s trust due to my commitment to work.
