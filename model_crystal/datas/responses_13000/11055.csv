For more than four years, I was working on climate and conflict analysis at the local level and how natural hazards exacerbated by climate change, environmental degradation and limited adaptation capacities have severe consequences for the livelihoods, food security, and well-being of vulnerable communities and are among the main drivers of displacement and conflict in fragile and conflict-affected states (FCAS).

I have project managerial and technical experience in conflict sensitivity analysis and the environmental and climate dimensions of peace and security, strategy formulation, delivery of project activities, including workshops and output documents, environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) studies, stakeholder engagements, water resources, fieldwork; institutional capacity-building programs. I also have an understanding of the institutional and political context and exposure to the national and regional climate & environmental policies, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). During this working experience, I designed and implemented interventions that address the complex dynamics of climate change-induced displacement and migration. have managed various groups of professionals and I have developed good team working and leadership skills. I have explored the impact of climate change and environmental degradation on community cohesion, human security, conflict, and mobility patterns and decisions as well as how actors can increase their understanding of the links between those components and can access data and information to support their policy and programmatic responses. The impact of climate change and natural hazards on public health is an area of my interest.

Other key skills include analytical thinking, planning, organizing, problem-solving, knowledge sharing, communication, and interpersonal skills as well as successful experience working with multi-disciplinary teams.","{'country': 'Sudan', 'short': 'Khartoum, Khartoum State', 'city': 'Khartoum', 'state': 'Khartoum State', 'default': 'Khartoum, Khartoum State, Sudan'}",True,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Arabic', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}]}",Environmental Services,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}, 'end': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2014}}, 'school': {'name': 'UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, Delft, Netherlands', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'Master of Science (M.Sc.)', 'field_of_study': 'Environmental Science and Technology'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2005}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2007}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Khartoum', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'Master of Business Administration (MBA)', 'field_of_study': 'Business Administration and Management, General'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2000}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 2004}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'B.Sc.', 'field_of_study': 'Civil Engineering'}]",[],"[{'title': 'Best Graduation Project Prize', 'description': None, 'issuer': 'Sudan Engineering Council', 'date': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}]",[],[],"[{'title': 'Increasing the Knowledge Base on Community Cohesion and Mobility Dynamics in the Context of Climate Change and Environmental Degradation Through Select Country-Based Case Studies Within the MENA Region, Sudan', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'description': 'The project aims to enhance the evidence base on how climate change and environmental degradation have impacted social relationships at the community level and mobility decisions.
