Amazing. Incredible. Thousands, hundreds, millions, billions of light years away, there's nothing like it, nothing that able to bear us.  We were born here. It enclosed us in itself and merged into one with its and our history for many thousands of years. It helped us invent art, ancient and modern architecture. It gave us resources. It has led our world into what we see now, cutting out layer by layer, immortalizing it with decorations in the form of sacred temples and majestic buildings.
The Earth delights and inspires.  It's so different. Cold and hard to reach at the poles. Hot and capricious in tropical zones. And so sensitive in the heart of the equator. It showed us the stars and plunged us to the bottom of the ocean. Its gave us the opportunity to learn about it and to know it. Its gigantism in the mountains overwhelms my heart. The amount of its biodiversity ignites my gaze. At the boundaries of the lithospheric plates, collisions frighten and eruptions kill. 
But we don’t appreciate it. It’s dying. The only one. We polluted its beauty with garbage and noxious gases and slowly but surely destroyed its fragile natural uniqueness that gave us moments of life on the timeline.  For centuries, we have stuck knives full of gunpowder in it and tortured to possess it.
And now, in order not to become one of the extinct fossil forms that define a particular geological period, there is an extraordinary need to regulate the use of land resources and human ambitions.
These thoughts defined my future professional scientific interest - geology.","{'country': None, 'short': 'Netherlands', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Mining & Metals,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'Donetsk National Technical University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFwzDcDPcpk7A/company-logo_400_400/0/1640276221642?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=W_M_qrcQcnp1cByZ3mPrpkrQWZ95tONUeuJthbt_MUM', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/donetsk-national-technical-university/'}, 'degree_name': 'Магистр', 'field_of_study': 'Геология/наука о Земле, общее направление'}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': 30145639, 'name': 'ТОВ ""Геологічні Системи""\u200b', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHuSfEn5RDccA/company-logo_400_400/0/1572871928163?e=1700092800&v=beta&t=wwpm10UbjJybV4AZ9eT5wgPmbuNFxqkWk4NE1UfKyQQ', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/tovgeosys/', 'employees': {'start': 51, 'end': 200}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': None, 'date': {'start': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'ТОВ ""Геологічні Системи""\u200b', 'description': None, 'title': 'Geology Specialist', 'employment_type': 'Part-time'}]}]",[],[],,,
