Having made a transition from Albania/Kosovo to the EU Netherlands now, I am actively engaged in pursuing my next career move.  My extensive background in working for state and local governmental entities, as well as NGOs, gives me a solid basis and skillset that can be applied in a variety of roles.    

The Western Balkans, synonymous with turmoil, is where I have built a career spanning over two decades.  My primary roles have involved fostering governance and democratization within this highly volatile region. It goes without saying, that success within the Balkans requires a broad skillset to work in difficult, stressful and tense situations.  Over the years, I have honed my skills, which directly contributed to the success of my endeavors and earned the respect among professionals peers and not only.

My unique professional experience and background gives me a worldly perspective that I look forward to sharing in my next role.  By nature, I am motivated, enthusiastic, proactive, communicative, and more importantly, ethical.  I love to learn and do not shy away from any challenge.  I pursue all that I do with passion, dedication and commitment to the ultimate end goal.  

I am currently looking for a position that enables me to relay the professional experience but certainly enabling me to learn from the work I will be doing as I truly believe that every job is a stepping stone to career learning and further professional development. 
 
I look forward to speaking further and can be contacted at:
