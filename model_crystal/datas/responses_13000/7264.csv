The Bangladesh government sponsored the settlement of Bengali speaking people in the region, which was the main cause of violent conflict as it uprooted a large number of indigenous people from their homes and cultivable land. The aim of this experiment is to investigate current trust levels among indigenous and settler Bengali populations following a peace accord in the CHT of Bangladesh. \nThis paper investigates the effect of long-lasting conflict and ethnicity on trust and trustworthiness among indigenous and settler Bengali populations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh using lab-in-the-field experiments. We ran an incentivized trust game in the field with two interacted, experimental conditions: (i) whether the participants lived in an area where violent conflict took place; and (ii) whether they have been matched with participants of the same or opposing ethnic group. We used standard trust game designed by Berg et al (1995) in the field to examine this question. \nThe regression results show that conflict experience tends people to be more trusted as well as trustworthy while group cohesion has significant effect on trust and trustworthiness. Although ethnicity does not have any significant effect on the trust and trustworthiness investigation into the effect heterogeneity for ethnicity reveals that for indigenous people both conflict location and out group decision has negative significant effect on the amount sent (trust). On returned amount conflict does not have any effect but group heterogeneity has positive significant effect. The results are robust across OLS and Tobit regression model. The result also implies that previous conflict experience and out group interaction motivate both the communities to build trust and trustworthiness in other words positive social capital in the CHT region of Bangladesh.', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Muhammad', 'last_name': 'Badiuzzaman', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Development Researcher'}]}, {'title': 'Addressing the Aid Sector’s Accountability Gap for Survivors/Victims of Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment.', 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'description': 'Centre for Peace and Justice, Brac University is undertaking this research on the issue of Prevention of Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment (PSEAH).

The world has an estimated 26 million registered refugees and 4 million asylum seekers. Many people from conflict-affected settings move to neighboring states, settling in border zones characterised by intense commercial flows and informal cross-border trade. Despite humanitarian assumptions that refugees enter countries of asylum to remain, many use diaspora links to engage in cross-border trade, supporting both their own livelihoods and expanding host-country enterprise. Yet trade in legitimate goods faces many challenges, e.g. weak governance, political tensions, fluctuating border regulations, and arms/drug controls. Refugee cross-border traders are vulnerable to coercion, while the positive impacts of this trade remain unnoticed. Centre for Peace and Justice of Brac University in collaboration with School of Geography and Planning at Cardiff University, UK has been implementing a pioneering study on informal cross-border trade in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. This research has been undertaken as a part of a multi-country study where the other two collaborators are School of Women and Gender Studies, Makerere University, Uganda; and Universidad Simon Bolivar, Colombia.

The Grand Bargain drafted at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit recognised the need for humanitarian financing to be efficacious and cost-effective as global fragility increases and aid dollars are stretched. Localisation has been widely recognised as a strategy toward achieving effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and equitable participation due to the unique capacities of local actors to understand and respond to the needs of conflict and disaster-affected populations. CPJ has been commissioned by UNDP, Bangladesh to formulate a ‘Localisation Roadmap’ for the humanitarian response in Cox’s Bazaar. CPJ was entrusted to facilitate inter-stakeholder discussions as well as incorporating input from other relevant stakeholders in Cox’s Bazaar District (e.g. government, refugee, host community and private sector representatives), and put together a pragmatic localisation strategy. The ‘localisation roadmap’ is to incorporate global localisation principles and adapt them to the particular context of Cox’s Bazar. Finally, the roadmap will set clear targets to be achieved within the specific timelines through a delineated process.

As a result, a vast number of Rohingya families now live splintered across borders. Most separated family members possess no travel documents and have little prospect of reuniting.\n\nThe study aims to provide insight into the processes of decision-making and risk-taking by the Rohingya in relation to transnational mobility. It explores implications for personnel security and wellbeing of the refugees themselves and of their families, but also regional conflict and security dynamics. Finally, it aims to identify the positive and negative effects of interventions by state and development actors on the refugees’ access to relatives abroad and remittances, and on cross-border movement, with a view to informing more effective programming and policymaking.
