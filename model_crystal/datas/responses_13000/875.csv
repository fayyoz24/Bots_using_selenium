I advise advertising and design companies on the topic of AI and its impact on our industry. I help them implement AI to gain extra creative leverage.

Currently I am testing OpenAI's Dall•E Experimental, which is still in alpha phase, as well as the multimodal version of ChatGPT, which will generate images too. Additionally, I’m affiliated with D-ID whom I've helped conceiving their Creative Reality Studio. With Arno Coenen I founded award winning AI-art collective CØ11@BorAi+oR⚡

For design- and ad-agencies I conceived creative campaign concepts, big and long strategically and technologically powered ideas. I spark creative processes with and within creative teams and I explore how disruptive tech - like Artificial Intelligence - augments creative professionals in their creativity, reach and effectiveness.

I conceived many on/ off/ through and beyond the line ad campaigns, which I helped materialise in any way. Whatever the medium, for whenever moment in whatever funnel (I prefer Google’s model though).

On the way to DALL•E 2's beta launch, I -as part of a small group of people- tested that AI for unwanted biases through creative experimentation, conceived new relevant product concepts inspired by the AI’s capabilities and helped OpenAI find high profile Dutch creative professionals as well as renowned Dutch artists to be DALL•E 2’s first artistic ambassadors.

After DALL•E 2 was made accessible to the public, also our research phase crew of creatives were allowed monetising our historically significant creative explorations. DALL•E's launch served as blueprint launching ChatGPT, sept. '22.

Today I am testing new DALL•E version V2.Experimental, ChatGPT Multimodal and its revolutionary Plugin Store. I also help other AI developing companies such as D-ID, advice on EU vs US privacy and IP-complexity and on how to responsibly and safely integrate AI effectively into workflows.
