After graduation from undergraduate college , I learnt manual typing in English & Arabic at a private business school few months later. During the same time, I enrolled in an advanced  English course at the American Centre in Khartoum II and obtained a certificate of completion. Moreover, I held four) junior administrative positions: (three) as government employee (assistant finance officer/ assistant taxation officer) and (one) as NGO staff (relief & emergency coordinator) of PHC program. All roles from 1988 till 1991.
My other work experiences were with profit & non-profit organizations in the areas of Administration, Education, Women & Youth Empowerment /  Networking from 1991 till 2002 in Egypt and the Netherlands.

From  2003 to 2007, I was actively involved with displaced South Sudanese NGO in greater Khartoum, Sudan in setting up  micro & small businesses  (project proposals/impact assessment/monitoring, evaluation & learning), teaching English and History as a part-time teacher in a private secondary school and working as a translator in a private daily English newspaper: Khartoum Monitor.

From April 2007 to August 2016, I moved to South Sudan in pursuit of better employment prospects: Firstly, I worked as the head of the translation unit at the Secretariat General of the Upper Nile state government in Malakal town.Secondly,in about one year time, I got another job as senior diplomat and ambassador with the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.

Recently, I performed some volunteer work as a hostess for Kwintes Foundation in Hilversum from January to September 2019.
Afterwards, I tried to shift my activities entirely to the private sector as sole trader/ management consultant, but due to unforeseeable circumstances was unable to pursue that goal. Thereafter, I had to instantally terminate all the planned activities.
New and bold initiatives are emerging towards the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 till the end of 2022.
The year 2023 will be full of surprises, challenges and new opportunities.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Hilversum, North Holland', 'city': 'Hilversum', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Hilversum, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Arabic', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'Collo', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'Dutch', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}]}",Non-profit Organization Management,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 8, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2025}}, 'school': {'name': 'Linnaeus University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQH4fnk8lNmyuQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1634115245163?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=eMlItP_DC5SR-tF4IDwg9VcD_XROv2YiEx9u-bueI8c', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/linneuniversitetet/'}, 'degree_name': 'Leadership and Management in an International Context', 'field_of_study': 'MBA'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1996}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1999}}, 'school': {'name': 'Dutch as a second Language A1 A2 B1 B2', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'Higher National Diploma', 'field_of_study': 'Language'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 1991}, 'end': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 1994}}, 'school': {'name': 'The American University in Cairo', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGjzyYT-NNNFw/company-logo_400_400/0/1610442280959?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=wl6nF_D6KqgBwjHIbY5ue4lOf-hkeRT2yi2xNfJ5U3A', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/aucegypt/'}, 'degree_name': 'Master of Public Administration -
