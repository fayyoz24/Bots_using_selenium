As an open-minded individual, I thrive on collaboration and new opportunities, embracing diverse perspectives to foster innovation and drive success in software development.

My journey began as a Junior Frontend Developer, developing websites for local small businesses. Over the years, I honed my ability to work effectively in diverse team environments and expanded my technical expertise. I have held various roles, from Web Developer and Frontend Developer to Software Developer, Senior Software Developer, and currently, Lead Software Developer. In each role, I contributed to team and project success through adaptability, teamwork, and commitment to quality.

As a frontend engineer, my core skill set includes TypeScript, which I prefer over JavaScript. I am experienced with React-based frameworks such as Next.js and Gatsby, libraries like Redux, MobX, Effector and RxJS, and infrastructure toolchain like Webpack and Node.js. I am also well-versed in tools like ESLint and Prettier and have experience with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and *nix operating systems.

I am an alumnus of Moscow Power Engineering Institute, holding an engineer's degree in Optoelectronic Devices and Systems. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in engineering and nurtured my ability to efficiently learn, consume, and structure information.

Outside of work, I engage in developer relations by participating in a podcast about development and life at the company. This involvement allows me to connect with like-minded individuals, share knowledge, and contribute to the growth of the broader development community.

In conclusion, I am excited to engage in meaningful collaborations and explore new possibilities, whether working on a team project, mentoring a colleague, or taking on a new challenge. I am committed to bringing my passion, adaptability, and problem-solving skills to every endeavor, ensuring that I am always ready for collaboration and new opportunities.","{'country': 'Cyprus', 'short': 'Limassol', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'Limassol, Cyprus'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'RU', 'language': 'ru'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'RU', 'language': 'ru'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Computer Software,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}}, 'school': {'name': 'Moscow Power Engineering Institute (Technical University)', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQEHCXCnoQ0zAA/company-logo_400_400/0/1519862885663?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=QOs1ReRm_b-u3ajeZFbr35NsU0Ax9euhtAJb2DW995E', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D1%82-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82-/'}, 'degree_name': ""Engineer's degree"", 'field_of_study': 'Optoelectronic devices and systems'}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Smart Development LLC', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'St Petersburg, St Petersburg City, Russia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Smart Development LLC', 'description': 'Guiding a successful UI team\n\n- Led the UI development team, ensuring goal achievement and effective communication with business and other teams for integration and improvement purposes.\n- Conducted interviews to build a strong frontend engineering team.\n- Architected and developed solutions to deliver optimal results to end users.\n\nThis experience has solidified my leadership skills and ability to deliver high-quality solutions.', 'title': 'Lead Software Developer', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}, {'location': 'St Petersburg, St Petersburg City, Russia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2020}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': 'Smart Development LLC', 'description': 'Driving project success independently\n\n- Worked independently to build systems and propose strategic solutions to achieve project goals.\n- Enhanced performance and availability through process improvements.\n\nMy contributions as a Senior Software Developer have resulted in increased efficiency and project success.', 'title': 'Senior Software Developer', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}, {'location': 'St Petersburg, St Petersburg City, Russia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': 'Smart Development LLC', 'description': ""Developing versatile software solutions\n\n- Developed software solutions for internal and external users, including payment forms, custom CRM, administrative panels, documentation engines, and application build configurations.\n- Managed a small team and participated in problem-solving, clarifying customer requirements, translating between programming and human language, and delegating tasks.\n\nThis role allowed me to hone my technical and management skills, contributing to the company's success.\n\nOutside of work, participated in recording a podcast about development and life at the company as part of developer relations."", 'title': 'Software Developer', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}]}, {'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Tetrasoft LLC', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'St Petersburg, St Petersburg City, Russia', 'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'company': 'Tetrasoft LLC', 'description': ""Creating innovative web applications\n\n- Developed core functionality for new web app from scratch â€“ both backend and frontend.\n- Drove to integrate a new way to collaborate.
