My vision is of a circular industry that is inclusive, transparent and regenerative.

As an experienced project leader, I have successfully developed and delivered sustainability programmes and work of products from concept to execution for both public and professional audiences around this topic. Examples of which include: Educational materials, workshops, websites/platforms, transparency tools, grievance mechanisms, a consumer-facing carbon calculation tool, communication campaigns, guidebooks, exhibitions, talk shows and competitions. 

Through my various roles, I seized the opportunity to develop my facilitation skills. I enjoy engaging with and managing different stakeholder groups, public-private partnerships and realising effective cross disciplinary collaborations to tackle challenges of scale. 

My interests lie in cross disciplinary collaborations, engaging communication, extraordinary experiences and new approaches to fashion. I have a broad skillset, in-depth knowledge, an influential network and meticulous work ethic, and would describe myself as being a self-motivated, positive and energetic colleague.
