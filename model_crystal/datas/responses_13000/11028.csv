I have a bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science and Mathematics from Hollins University, Virginia, USA. While completing her bachelor’s degree, I did a semester abroad in Cambodia where I lived with communities whose livelihoods were highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster. This experience ignited my interest in environmental research and sustainability and led her path to the Netherlands where I completed her master’s degree in Sustainability Science and Policy.
