I’m specialised in social sector development and public finance management. I have over twenty years of worldwide professional experience with social sector projects and programmes for a wide variety of donors. My consultancy experience concerns projects in all stages of the project cycle including programme design, project appraisals, due diligence, technical assistance and monitoring and evaluation missions. In my profile, you will find a number of projects that I have carried out.

I hold MSc degrees in Business Economics and Development Economics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam. As a senior economist, I’m particularly experienced with strategic planning and budgeting. I have provided technical assistance to several ministries in Africa, Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, I have developed enrolment and costing tools, and conducted several cost-benefit analyses for large infrastructural works in the health and education sector. Working in social sectors, I’m experienced with child-related policies such as universal access to education, mother and child health care, and programmes for children with special education needs. I have worked for clients such as the European Commission, World Bank, UN organisations, bilateral governments and NGOs. 

I have strong analytical and communication skills. I enjoy working in teams and I can work under tight deadlines.

Nevertheless, this has not turned into action on the local level, because communities are either unwilling or unable to offer structured learning for pre-primary children. This is a matter of concern, since unequal spending leads to unequal opportunities to attend pre-primary education across the country.
