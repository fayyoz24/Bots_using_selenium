 Inter-cultural awareness and pedagogical skills in the EAP classroom, specifically focusing on Chinese academic degree-seekers in Anglophone programs and academies.

Since 2010, following from my ancillary university focus on Chinese language and culture, I and my colleagues Dr. Mark Vitullo and Dr. Yao (Amy) Hsiao have been involved in several projects relating to Chinese exchange students and their English language acquisition and production skills within the Anglophone academic environment (specifically EAP writing/oral skills at Tilburg University). We are currently exploring the practical English language acquisition and production difficulties with which these students struggle and which hinder their success in Anglophone programs. 

Our goal is twofold:
1)	 To offer EAP (English for academic purposes) university teachers information about certain Chinese (Mandarin) language characteristics, Chinese rhetorical essay structures and logical conventions of idea development that Chinese exchange students learn in China. This information should enable the EAP teacher to identity and modify potential interference patterns during EAP courses.
2)	To develop practical classroom methods to support and coach Chinese exchange students more efficiently and effectively so that they can acquire the academic English skills they need to succeed in the global, primarily Anglophone, academic environment. 
My academic interest in this has its root in my Bachelorâ€™s education in Asian Studies, as well as my current work with Chinese PhD candidates at Tilburg University.

During my undergraduate education, I took several courses in Mandarin Chinese. I have now resumed Mandarin language classes to gain a better insight into basic Mandarin  structures and pronunciation.
