Working with multicultural teams, international clients, and third party service providers at varying locations exposed me to situations that were ever changing, challenging and exciting, making me adaptable and flexible; adopting a chameleon mentality! All the while consistently applying my values of professionalism, integrity, dependability and honesty.

Seeking to bring my values, skills and experiences to volunteer work opportunities has been an integral part of my life and has given me the possibility to remain connected, gain varying work experiences while making a contribution to the community.

The varying skills, professional and volunteer work experiences, obtained over the years have proven to be highly transferable; most recently into the foreign diplomatic sector in a supporting role as an administrative and financial assistant at the Embassy of the Republic of Panama to the Kingdom of The Netherlands. Having the opportunity to serve my native country in this capacity has been personally fulfilling and a great learning opportunity.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'The Hague, South Holland', 'city': 'The Hague', 'state': 'South Holland', 'default': 'The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Dutch', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'Spanish', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}]}",Government Relations,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1983}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1988}}, 'school': {'name': 'LIU Post', 'logo': None, 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/liu-post/'}, 'degree_name': 'Bachelor of Science', 'field_of_study': 'Accounting'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1981}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1983}}, 'school': {'name': 'Evander Childs High School', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': 'High School Diploma', 'field_of_study': 'Accounting'}]",[],[],"[{'name': 'Certified Public Accountant', 'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'authority': None, 'url': None, 'license_number': None, 'display_source': None, 'company': None}]",[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': None, 'name': 'Embassy of the Republic of Panama to the Kingdom of The Netherlands', 'logo': None, 'url': None, 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'Embassy of the Republic of Panama to the Kingdom of The Netherlands', 'description': None, 'title': 'Administrative and Financial Assistant', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}]}, {'company': {'id': 77563120, 'name': 'AMERICAN PROTESTANT CHURCH OF THE HAGUE', 'logo': None, 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-protestant-church-of-the-hague/', 'employees': {'start': None, 'end': None}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': 'The Hague, South Holland, Netherlands', 'date': {'start': {'month': 7, 'day': None, 'year': 2019}, 'end': {'month': 12, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}}, 'company': 'AMERICAN PROTESTANT CHURCH OF THE HAGUE', 'description': 'Assistant to the Senior and Associate pastors.
