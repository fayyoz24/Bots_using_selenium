My qualities:

- Maintaining many (international) contacts at a working level.
- Making good use of my profound knowledge of English and German which I master at a 
  translator level.
- Being able to manage and organize groups (30 - 40 persons).
- Planning and executing travel programmes.
- Providing a broad (non financial) administrative support with logistic tasks as well.
- Organizing and arranging matters or events on a project basis.
- Doing research.
- Providing a collaborating and / or steering role.
- Being able to work abroad regularly.

When I am able to apply my keywords in a job I feel good and will be able to work at full speed.
My jobs at the Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Hanzehogschool Groningen or as a tour guide are very clear examples of that. Starting from day one I felt completely at ease every time.

My specialties are Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. I have a profound knowledge of these countries.
I am able to apply my competences and knowledge to a maximum as a tour leader.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Greater Groningen Area', 'city': None, 'state': None, 'default': 'Greater Groningen Area'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'NL', 'language': 'nl'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'NL', 'language': 'nl'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'Dutch', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'French', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}, {'name': 'German', 'proficiency': 'FULL_PROFESSIONAL'}, {'name': 'Gronings', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'Latvian', 'proficiency': 'ELEMENTARY'}, {'name': 'Swedish', 'proficiency': 'ELEMENTARY'}]}",Higher Education,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1987}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1992}}, 'school': {'name': 'University of Applied Sciences / Hogeschool Enschede (Saxion)', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': ""Bachelor's degree; International Business Studies"", 'field_of_study': 'HEAO-Economisch-Linguïstisch (EL) similar to International Business Studies (economy and languages).'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1980}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': 1984}}, 'school': {'name': 'RSG Ter Apel', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': None, 'field_of_study': 'HAVO & Atheneum'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'Stichting IVOR', 'logo': None, 'url': None}, 'degree_name': None, 'field_of_study': 'In March 2017 I did a course / training regarding tour leadership'}]",[],"[{'title': ""'Tänukiri'"", 'description': ""'Tänukiri' is an official acknowledgement of the the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia which was awarded because of strengthening Estonian-Dutch relations over a considerable period of time.\n"", 'issuer': 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Estonia / Eesti Välisministeerium', 'date': {'month': 4, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}}, {'title': ""'Atzinības Raksts'"", 'description': ""'Atzinības Raksts' is an official decoration by which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia expresses its acknowledgement to people who promote and strengthen Latvia over a considerable period of time.\nSee: http://www.mfa.gov.lv/lv/netherlands/zinas/2012/11-16/"", 'issuer': 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia / Latvijas arlietu ministrija', 'date': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}]",[],[],"[{'title': 'Delivering a lecture on Dutch colonists in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine during the Second World War', 'date': {'start': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}, 'end': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2015}}, 'description': 'The title of my lecture was: -\n""Nederlandse Oostlandboeren e.a. in Estland, Letland, Litouwen, Wit-Rusland en Oekraïne 1941-1945.""\nI told the audience about the subject with a power point presentation.
