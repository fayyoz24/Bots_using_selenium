To offer students the opportunity to explore the world of law beyond the classroom, the Unit focuses on organising internal moots, facilitating participation in external ones, and hosting reputable regional and international moots.\n\nThe Legal Practice & Development Centre was another exciting project that I worked on, aimed at putting ""Law in Action"" at the heart of legal education. The Centre offered sessions delivered by legal experts on lawyering skills. We also provided career advice to senior students and helped them apply for internships, build a competitive profile, and orient them with scholarship opportunities.\n\nIn my quest to explore collaboration opportunities, I secured a cooperation agreement with Raoul Wallenberg Institute (RWI) to sponsor the Faculty’s Human Rights Conference and for the BUE to join the Academic Network of RWI, which is a consortium of academic institutions cooperating to advance access to justice and the implementation of human rights.\n\nI was also honoured to participate in revamping the curriculum to keep up with the latest developments in the legal field and to make it centred around active learning. We ensured that clinical education and mooting were integrated into the new programme. That wasn\'t all. I drafted a module on IT law, which is a first for any Egyptian law school so students can explore such a niche area of law.\n\nLastly, I played an active role in the planning process of the Cybercrime Investigation Masters, the first of its kind in Egypt.

My classes focused on experiential learning – a cutting-edge approach that gets students thinking critically and participating directly in the educational process. With hands-on methods like open discussions, debates, case dissection, and legal analysis, students were able to engage in an active and effective learning process.
