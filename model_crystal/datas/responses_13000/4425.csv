As a natural communicator, I interpret the human experience through vibrant and beautiful words, supporting teams to create communities and achieve their goals beyond the layers of the day-to-day. 
I thrive in ethical and purpose-driven environments to help shape clear visions, present ideas and connect people through empathy, intuition and a mentorship approach.

{ MY PATH }
My 10 year career-cruise has allowed me to combine a background of marketing superyacht experiences with my passion for ocean conservation and conversations, wrapped in a spiritual journey of personal development.
This awakening to help protect and regenerate complex or interconnected ecosystems means I am pursuing opportunities that focus on enabling and empowering positive change through storytelling and creative content.
