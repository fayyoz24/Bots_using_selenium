My primary role was focused on the Reverse Shell Method, an innovative approach that involved establishing a connection from the target machine (running QuickSTEP) to an attacker's machine. This attack vector provided remote access to the PowerShell instance on the target machine, allowing the execution of PowerShell commands without QuickSTEP's knowledge. I was instrumental in setting up this connection, providing critical insights into the potential exploitation of this vulnerability, and documenting the process.\n\nAdditionally, I had a secondary role in bypassing the virtual machine (VM) detector to enable SEB to run within a VM environment. This involved altering VM configuration and modifying certain SEB DLLs. Although the task was less complex compared to the Reverse Shell Method, it required an understanding of the interplay between VMs and the detection algorithms employed by SEB. My team and I successfully achieved this objective, thus demonstrating the potential for students to cheat during exams."", 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Strahil', 'last_name': 'Peykov', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Student aan Technische Universiteit Eindhoven'}]}, {'title': 'TidyTeams: A Social App for Environmental Clean-ups', 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}, 'end': {'month': 3, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}}, 'description': ""TidyTeams is a social app I had the pleasure of developing with a team as the SCRUM Master during my studies at Eindhoven University of Technology.

The database was managed using Firebase.\n\nI had a crucial role in project management, code development, and documentation.
