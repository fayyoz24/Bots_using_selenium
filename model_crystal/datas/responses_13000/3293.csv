Over a period of almost 50 years he has acquired a profound experience in the fields of water and environment policy, management and technology. In various positions he gained an excellent knowledge of the policy, legal, institutional, economical and technical aspects of environment and water protection.

Theo Henckens was responsible for a large number of projects in European and Asian countries. He has acted as project director and team leader of multi-disciplinary teams of international and local experts in the field of environment, integrated river basin management, and wastewater treatment. 

After his retirement Mr. Henckens got his PhD title by writing a dissertation on managing raw materials scarcity. At present he writes articles and books on this subject, amongst others:
