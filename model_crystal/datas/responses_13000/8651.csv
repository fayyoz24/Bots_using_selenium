I am a driven and versatile product planning and product management professional. 

I combine multinational commercial experience within B2B and B2C environments and logical / analytical skills with a strong technical background.  I understand the unique requirements of different markets and cultures, and the different values and approaches that are sometimes required, having successfully conducted business in the US, Japan, Western and Central Europe and Russia.

I have demonstrable experience in project and personnel management and cross functional team leadership, where I am able to exercise good communication skills.
I have a robust sense of humour and am stress-resistant. I'm used to achieving stretch goals within tight (and ""dynamic"") deadlines, being very creative when the situation demands.

I have successfully run my own personal training business and am particularly passionate about anything cycling, fitness or automotive industry related.

My native language is English but I speak and write Dutch well and German at a reasonable level. I am currently attempting to learn Italian.
