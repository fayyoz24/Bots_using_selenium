I use this content as the starting point in the residency to explore how culture “rubs off” onto the artefacts in production, transaction, consumption, and discard on a day-to-day basis in the context of Northeastern Slovakia and convey the understanding that time and transformation of artefacts will result in a new layer of contemporary culture. This contemporary culture comes from that being fuzzy and indistinct in self-identity in the situation of breaking ties with native land and traditional culture. During the residency, the waste collected from daily life and from local industries is sculptured, programmed, and audible into dynamics. Audiences through seeing, listening, and interacting with the tangible objects are led to generate an understanding of underlying meaning as they complete their own perception of what these objects and their movements and audio actually present and mean.\n\ntechnology support: Mathias Funk \nactor: Miroljuba Ivelin Petrova\nvoice: Marina Provatidou and Arie Rommers \nsupported by SYMPOSIUM PICTUM of umumfestival2018\n\nRead the latest article on media at KRITH news  http://krith.phil.muni.cz/experiment/um-um-2018-rozhovor-s-martinem-jakubcem-a-adamem-vrbkou', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'ZHANG', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Founder&Artist  at STUDIO Ü '}]}, {'title': 'iwanttail', 'date': {'start': {'month': 2, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'description': 'In the last three years, the artist has represented important directions in interactive art practice and research work.

The work TWO FULL MOON is rooted in layers of emotion and inherent humanness that intentionally contradicts or even rejects any notion of the Space Age. It is a result of my experimentation with collecting, repurposing and locally grounding data streams of anonymous participation from the site http://twofullmoon.com. The data serves as input for dynamic physical artworks that selectively represent both remote audience and artistic intent. While technology permeates all my recent work, this project expresses the human desire to bond with nature without techne’s lens obscuring our being and feeling in the world.\n\n Three metal sculptures cast the phases of moon - dynamics from a crescent moon (30*30*16cm), to a gibbous moon (30*30*28cm), till a  full moon (30*30*17cm). By designing spatial and temporal expressions of textile movements and lighting dynamics through the input from the site (http://twofullmoon.com), the project tries to develop psychedelic interaction and metaphorical communication out of usually material or interface practice.  Interactive system (OOSCI) is used to build up connectivity and interactivity flowing through the digital and physical interface.\n\nIn this project, the first version of three sculptures was made of wood and modeled a form by Chet.

THE FALSE MAGRITTE extends art scene from where the art piece finally presents to the places where it produces and grows. 32 volunteers are invited to perform “arrogant” in front of a camera by using their facial expression, body movement, and stage property. Their performance is collected, edited and played as idiosyncratic, symbolic, and expressive materials in the interactive installation - as one object of conversation - facing directly to the audience.  In this work, Magritte’s “canvas” and “symbols” are being “stage” and “props” which are involving the audience in dynamics. In addition to thinking about diversity of stitching, penetration, and even conflict between audience, artwork, space, and time, THE FALSE MAGRITTE hopes to explore how performativity and interactivity, either for meaning-maker or/and for meaning-encounter, could integrate new forms of artistic expression or/and audience experience “beyond” traditional alignment and presentation. Moreover, THE FALSE MAGRITTE tried to dig out how performativity and interactivity could make artist and audience from being two separate roles of making/viewing an art piece to being together creating and blooming an art experience.\n\nspecial thanks go to performance participants: 张会; 黄芳; 缪静茹; 赵唯嘉; 张玉荣; 张怡珺; 陈殊; 王雅婧; 贺云琪; 张宇辰; 吴新宇; 郑锦程; 周冰; 汤秋蕊; 李雍; 逯瑞洁; 吕玲; 潘高琪; 盛火花; 赵凡凡; 严卓; 张小雪; 刘青; 冒婕; 陈依婷; 王令媛; 梦竹; 叶涛; 陈碧琪; 李珂心; 岳宇辉; 訾然\nand my student assistant group for this project: 赵唯嘉; 张怡珺; 严卓; 汤秋蕊', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'ZHANG', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Founder&Artist  at STUDIO Ü '}]}, {'title': 'MOUNTROTHKO', 'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2018}}, 'description': 'MOUNTROTHKO consists of three scenarios “day”, “noon”, and “night”, which are presented a single interactive installation which itself contains hundreds of thousands of single frames and 37 limited edition prints.

Each individual piece honours the attention to colouring, layering and composition of forms, forms flow off and away from the surface of the projected canvas, yet extends perceptive qualities through time. The concept of the scenarios is to explore different interaction styles and create gradually more dynamic aesthetics in the theme of mountain formations, light, and particles. MOUNTROTHKO as a multi-layer rendered interactive installation uses voice track and position track at the same time. White particles in this artwork have the depth of field rendering. Particles themselves are not rendered as dots, bus as complex composite shapes. The Kinect tracks the position of visitors and changes the three scenarios according to the horizontal position in space. The energy of sound in space is filtered in the two-step process that determines the increment moment of mountain starting from a randomized baseline.

The composition contains the conversation and the conflict which does create a debatable, but interesting perspective.  The composition remains differences based on language, gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.  On the occasion of the research on diversities, these two artists pose the question between the human beings and the nature, they integrate the question into two different forms of medium - film and interaction. Through the two-different expressive mediums, the artists have constructed animal masks and attempt to demonstrate the beliefs and everyday habits that apply in the time where animal rights are being violated. The audience, via interaction, will realize that they are in the unpleasant position of the animal and being accompanied by sounds of traditional organs derived from the sacrifice of animals.

The inspiration comes from the famous red, yellow-blue blocks and grid abstract paintings by the Dutch artist Mondrian during the 1930\'s. In notMONDRIAN, the artist first breaks the static grid into non-static, followed by the introduction of movement detecting technology, therefore the audience can move different parts of the body to control the positions of the red, yellow or blue blocks on the screen. At the same time, the magnitude of the action will also affect the rhythm and frequency of the sound produced by these patches during the collision. Traditional paintings mainly rely on the coordination of the artists\' hands and their tools, as well as professional painting techniques and experiences. What a traditional painting could present to the audience is the last frozen second of the artist\'s creative process. notMONDRIAN extends painting into the process of ""painting"" as improvised dance-style performances. Meanwhile, in notMONDRIAN, the painting is no longer presented in a single still way in front of the audience, the audience is being involved.  Since 2013, the artist began to use interactive installations as a means to explore the forms of stitching, penetration, and even conflict between art and technology. In addition to thinking about the relationship between art and technology in a broad sense, in this work, she hopes to explore how interactive technology can bring new forms of presentation and experience to traditional paintings, and how to make the audience from ""the bystander"" of a painting to become ""the participant"" and ""the co-creator"" of an experience. \n\nnotMONDRIAN was invited and exhibited in BEIJING DESIGN WEEK (Beijing, China) during 23 September - 7 October in 2017.\n\n', 'contributors': [{'type': 'standardizedContributor', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'ZHANG', 'name': None, 'headline': 'Founder&Artist  at STUDIO Ü '}]}, {'title': 'UNNAMED', 'date': {'start': {'month': 11, 'day': None, 'year': 2016}, 'end': {'month': 1, 'day': None, 'year': 2017}}, 'description': 'UNNAMED is embodiment of the interaction and cross-merging of multi-art forms.

This real-time interactive performance takes place upon a square, which functions as a stage and as a screen. A film themed in “Pattern of Lost” is projected on the left side of this stage. In the meanwhile, a performer is lit up from the backstage to the right of the stage with the appearance of the film images. During this passage, two bold white lines appear onstage and traverse the performer’s body. The digitally projected lines and the performer perform the same movement while both moving in the same direction and at the same speed. The lines move forwards and backwards in coincidence with the performer’s movements, as she shifts her body. Gradually, the lines are crossing each other and rotating around the performer. The lines form silhouette around the performer’s body and expand together with the performer’s movements. In addition, the silhouette intensifies its amount of light as the performer intensifies the force of her movements, in particular, the movements of her arms.

This interactive artwork stays in a space where the audience is given an opportunity to speak out. Using this interactive installation as a vehicle to explore different modes of engagement, the audience would experience the overlap between performance (the presentation of prepared scenarios) and performativity (the constitution of understanding through interactivity). The installation combines thousands of threads as a cylinder “screen” which carries physical aesthetics and embodied interaction to present multiple evocative moments latent in natural landscapes. The interactive experience offered is unfolding the layers of the artwork with movement and auditory input. It enables the audience to become a part of the happenings. The artist records her own sighs, whispers, laughing, singing, and humming as auditory reactions to the audience. By speaking and moving in the space, the audience transforms the floor into a dark sea, thousands of wires into a flowing sea wave, and the tunnel into his/her connections to the heart. The pace of the artwork is much more stable and slower than the audience normally experiences in interactive arts which leads to a ""frozen/mystical"" visual sense and a ""cold/calm"" emotional load.
