Some individuals had to pass exams or wanted to be admitted to universities abroad. Others needed to learn business English for work. One of the most illustrious students I had was the Ukrainian Minister of Defense. He was being offered a four week intensive English course by the Dutch Ministry of Defense as he was going to sit in on NATO meetings. He give me a riddle to solve. &quot;When the Ukraine became independent from Russia, how many soldiers were there?&quot; I said I didn't know. &quot;One...&quot; he answered for me. &quot;And that soldier was me!&quot;
I aspire to have interesting and motivated students from all over the world and I hope to be working not only in the Netherlands in the future, but also abroad, be it in Europe or Asia or South America.
