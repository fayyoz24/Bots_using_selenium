My experience working with a variety of artists and brands, such as D.O. Gibson, Atwell Music, Hip Hop Saves Lives, Subliminal Worldwide, Stroopwafel, Mill Green, JJ From Yonkers, Gambit Gasolina, Loud Life, and more, has provided me with a deep understanding of what it takes to create and market of successful campaigns and brands from the start up. Notably, I had the opportunity to work with Hip Hop Saves Lives, a well-known nonprofit organization that teaches humanity through hip hop. During my time there, I worked on creating content, social media marketing, tour management, video editing, branding, graphic, and other marketing initiatives to spread the organization's message to a global audience.

I have also been involved in the startup world, founding The Dutch New Yorker Barber Scholarship Program in Uganda Kampala and opening The Dutch New Yorker Barber Shop in Amsterdam. The success of both ventures has given me a wealth of knowledge in growth and marketing strategies for startups.

In my current role as a concept creator and content creator for Subliminal Worldwide, I have successfully launched the monthly Stroopwafel event which is a LGBTQ+ friendly, community driven, open minded event filled with different creatives doing live performances throughout the event and techno music in Amsterdam. The goal is to bring everyone from the community under one roof without judgment and without phones. Upon entry a sticker is placed on the consumers phone cameras to keep them present. So they can enjoy eye opening performances, visuals, and music. Subliminal Worldwide has become a staple in the local music scene. 
Additionally, I have helped Subliminal build a strong brand identity and increase its reach through social media.

My experience in navigating multiple industries, combined with my passion for music, AI, and startups, makes me confident that I am the right person for this position. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the growth and success of your startup.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications with you.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Marketing & Advertising,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2011}, 'end': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2012}}, 'school': {'name': 'Ithaca College', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQEBYvdf1Mo3UQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1620321858705?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=cGgZ1OIvc9C_-br131jxT77U0S8czu9d7UsS-chc-6Y', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/ithaca-college/'}, 'degree_name': 'High School Diploma', 'field_of_study': 'Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services'}, {'date': {'start': {'month': 6, 'day': None, 'year': 2010}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'High School 560 City-As-School', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQHUL8__esw4Yg/company-logo_400_400/0/1688075436444?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=0HBHbizbamrdhCeQAQ2obapqlZ4Toj140hrSSCnMuEY', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/high-school-560-city-as-school-11/'}, 'degree_name': 'High School Diploma', 'field_of_study': 'Marketing/Marketing Management, General'}]",[],[],[],[],"[{'title': ""I Ain't Going Back Tour For Social Change"", 'date': {'start': {'month': 3, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}, 'end': {'month': 3, 'day': None, 'year': 2023}}, 'description': ""The Dutch New Yorker Barber Shop is a stylish barber shop located in the heart of Amsterdam, Netherlands, and owned by Jacob Siegel, a native New Yorker with over a decade of experience in the barbering industry.
