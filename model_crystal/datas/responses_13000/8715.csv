Currently dividing my time between the UK and the Netherlands, and available to clients anywhere.

My breadth of experience means I'm not a specialist in any specific industry, but a chameleon who brings valuable outside perspective. A quality which can break the stalemate of internal focus suffered by many companies. This comes with an inherent desire to make the entire jigsaw fit. I never look at words without interrogating the actions and processes they're designed to trigger. Contributing analytical, solution-focussed thinking to everything from backroom brainstorming to front-line promotion. Always conscious of audience and stakeholder needs and expectations.

Being both creative and logical, I particularly relish the challenge of transforming complex back-stories into tangible, audience-friendly propositions and narratives. An enthusiasm that extends into packaging up any subject matter into appealing reads and clear directives. 

I'm particularly useful to companies and organisations who need to reach international audiences, having gained experience with clients based in the UK, USA, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Japan and Israel.

‚ÄúMeedenker‚Äù
My Dutch clients often describe me as a ‚Äúmeedenker‚Äù (pronounced ""may-denker""). It‚Äôs one of those words for which there‚Äôs no direct equivalent in English, although your translation tool-of-choice will certainly give it a go! It literally means ‚Äúa person who thinks along with‚Äù. Essentially someone who proactively works with others, contributing to their creative and problem-solving efforts. 

It‚Äôs a label I‚Äôm proud to have. As it nicely sums up my passion for helping others succeed by complementing their expertise and thought-processes with my own.

This adds up to a complex mix of commodities and related support services.\n\nACT Commodities wanted to create a completely new website which would reflect the company‚Äôs collaborative trading ethos and high level of customer service, while outlining its product portfolio in a logically structured way. Its aims were to reassure existing contacts, attract new clients and appeal to prospective new employees.\n\nBecause the content to be communicated had not previously been curated, the exact structure of the website could not be pre-determined. We therefore had to take an agile approach to developing the website. I worked closely with the project manager Floortje Geuze to achieve this. The two of us embedded ourselves in the company ‚Äì working on-site 2 days a week ‚Äì so we could get a feel of the culture while acquiring all the necessary input. During my 10-week involvement, I interviewed many of the company‚Äôs employees to obtain the relevant facts and piece together the marketing story. I then translated their input into client-focused copy, which I structured to fit the website design layout, navigation flow and SEO requirements.
