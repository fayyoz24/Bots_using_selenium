Bad actors are coming up with innovative tricks every day. The way to fight them is with people that think out of the box and at the same time are detailed oriented. That’s me. 
I’m also a team player, I strongly believe that 2 heads are better than one. I aim to create a work environment where people feel free to share their ideas, because I think this is what underpins the modern world - social interaction and information exchange. I strongly believe that life is all about lifelong learning and sharing with others.
