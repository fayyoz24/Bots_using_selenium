In 2015 RJ crossed +3M passengers carried on +36K flights for more than 52 direct destinations and contributed 3% to the country’s GDP. Fortunately, RJ granted access to preview their data of passenger trips, and cooperated to share their demand forecasting process for enhance opportunity of applying the KPIs on actual data. Focusing on forecasting models and approaches, in an attempt to minimize MAPE as much as possible by choosing the best mathematical model of forecasting. Lack of resiliency can be for the inappropriate forecasting model or error measuring KPIs application. Identification by statistical models lead to understand the behavior of trends and seasonal patterns. The analysis furtherly focused into causes of noise, trend, and seasonality using identification models. Assortment analysis, including the ABC and XYZ, for RJ's five key markets revealed that a more complete and cautious treatment to demand forecasting. RJ process is visualized by SIPOC, EPC and BPMN charts, root causes were revealed by fishbone diagram, prioritized by PFMEA matrix. This influenced the research to focus on forecasting models, as the MAPE accuracy indicator reached 8%.\rThe improvement phase was introduced by the application of 14 mathematical models, while accuracy indicators was the monitoring tool.
