I focus on international coproductins and strategic alliances. I have helped develop, finance and supervised the editing and release of approximately 250 documentaries. I am the chairlady on the board of the documentary working group of the EBU to realize my great passion for European co-productions. 

I have worked on about 50 international, award-winning films by makers such as the Dutch Hans Pool (the Emmy winner Bellingcat: thruth in a post thruth world), Maasja Ooms (Alica, Punks, Jason), Misha Wessel and Thomas Blom (the Hunt for Gadaffi's Billions), Stranger in Paradise by Guido Hendrikx as well as Scandinavian makers like Jonas Poher Rasmussen (Flee) Janus Metz (Armadillo and Heartbound), The Raft by Marcus Lindeen. Men Who Swim by Dylan Williams. The German films The Cleaners and the Forum and Victor Kossakovsy's Vivan las Antipodas. But also with the American, DA Pennebaker & Chris Hedgedus (Kings of Pastry and Unlocking the Cage), Lauren Greenfield's the Queen of Versailles, with English makers such as Steve mcQueen (the Occupied City) Sam Hobkinson (Misha and the wolves ), Kim Longinotto, (Love is All), Dan Reed (Children of the Japanese Tsunami), Dan Gordon (The race that shook the world), Jerry Rothwell (Donor Unknown, Sour grapes), Henry Singer (The Trial of Ratko Mladic) Sarah McCarthy (The sound of Mumbai: a musical). 

Each film has its own substantive challenge and dynamics in the team of makers. The great thing is that documentaries can be about anything: social topics, journalism, art, culture, human interest. In form they are observational, interview driven, ego documents, discourse, animation, experimentation and hybrid forms. In short, I am at home in all markets. 

I have been working in the film world since the 90s after training in documentary, production and editing at the film academy in Amsterdam. I worked as a producer, for festivals, forums as a matchmaker in the international documentary world, sales agent, financier, but also as crisis manager for various media companies. In my now 30-year career I always see my role as a kind of 'creators-creator'. I want to inspire, to ensure that the makers can shape their creativity under the best circumstances to come to the most beautiful films. Sometimes that works very well, sometimes less so, but the intensive maker processes are always interesting.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'NL', 'language': 'nl'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'NL', 'language': 'nl'}, {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': []}",Broadcast Media,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'school': {'name': 'Netherlands Film Academy', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQGz-bwljGwDpw/company-logo_400_400/0/1689149971599?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=Cm-d4EHGtqgUgX8tYjVzR5NffSRo6ilBU-p9zOC-LAg', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/nederlandsefilmacademie/'}, 'degree_name': None, 'field_of_study': 'Documentaire, Montage, Productie'}]",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"[{'company': {'id': 166844, 'name': 'VPRO', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEZV1wBL3bQXw/company-logo_400_400/0/1571128518707?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=Nodnf7eVPwgF4iCB3jhEEIvYbKHr_ODZJ4gwhWmtYqk', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/vpro/', 'employees': {'start': 201, 'end': 500}}, 'date': {'start': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2007}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'profile_positions': [{'location': None, 'date': {'start': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}, 'end': {'month': None, 'day': None, 'year': None}}, 'company': 'VPRO', 'description': None, 'title': 'Internationale Coporoducties VPRO', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}, {'location': None, 'date': {'start': {'month': 5, 'day': None, 'year': 2007}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'company': 'VPRO', 'description': None, 'title': 'Hoofd Documentaire', 'employment_type': 'Full-time'}]}]",[],"['Televisie', 'Documentaires', 'Storytelling', 'editing', 'Festivals']",,,
