Too many marginalised groups are being subjected to human rights abuses around the world. My work has been to develop rights-based strategies and models and promote change.

I am passionate about working practically to see the principles of international human rights implemented nationally, regionally and internationally, building on my extensive experience on refugee, asylum seeker, statelessness, migrant, LGBTIQ+ and indigenous programs and policy issues globally.

With 20 years of leadership experience in not-for-profit management and governance across 50 countries, my expertise lies in developing strategies for change and organizational development and in advising and problem-solving with civil society, governments and UN bodies.

I am the Head of Advocacy for the the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion (ISI) which is the first and the only human rights NGO dedicated to promoting the right to a nationality and the rights of stateless people globally. I am also on the Taskforce of The Global Alliance to End Statelessness, a UNHCR initiative that seeks to accelerate solutions to statelessness through a collective multi stakeholder approach, which centres those who are stateless and formerly stateless.

I was the previous Executive Director of Nationality for All, a regional NGO working to advance the rights of people affected by statelessness in the Asia-Pacific region, and was the Executive Director of the International Detention Coalition for 10 years, and a recent fellow at the Centre for Asia Pacific Refugee Studies (CAPRS) at the University of Auckland

I am a social anthropologist and recently completed my doctoral degree with a focus on how civil society can effectively engage governments for rights-based policy change.  

The model of effective engagement I developed as part of this research was called “ a new, original, and potentially life-changing contribution”, and that the research has the “potential to make such an important contribution to how we might understand this particular approach to bringing about policy change”.

My work ahead is to explore supporting communities and civil society groups in their human rights advocacy work using this framework.

My achievements include the Australian Human Rights Award in 2002, and was nominated for the 2004 French Human Rights Prize and the 2017 Trust Law Awards for my work with vulnerable groups in detention.
