Also interested in Instrument Applications, Laboratory Management, QC/QA, Science Communication & Education, as well as expanding into Strategy management and Consulting. 

I am a Materials Chemist with experience in Research and Analysis:
- Synthetic design and characterisation of novel materials 
- Big Data processing, analysis and interpretation
- Problem-solving and analytical thinking
- Oral and written communication (report writing, presentations)
- Teamwork and collaborations with local and international research groups
- Microsoft Office suite
- Operating a wide range of analytical instruments with different configurations
- Worked in National Synchrotron and Neutron facilities

As a Passionate Science Educator, I can:
- Effectively communicate complex theories and procedures in a simple, illustrative manner
- Provide support and solutions by troubleshooting experimental and instrumentation complications
- Manage large group of students and a small team of demonstrators
- Monitor, assess and improve OH&S guidelines and laboratory teaching materials
- Demonstrate the use safe and correct use of laboratory equipments and instruments
- Prepare and organise laboratory setup for different teaching programs
- Student-Academic liaison with the aim to improve student learning experience

I am also a Cosmetics and Skin Care Enthusiast:
- DIY projects including formulating and documenting new nail polish colours and types, and facial cleansing oil mixtures
- Collecting, testing, comparing and reviewing different brands and types of products

I am artistic and creative with interest in many traditional art disciplines and materials.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North
