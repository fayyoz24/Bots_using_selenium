I have also advocated for better drug education and reform, mental health, gender equity and sustainability in activism in both Canada and the Netherlands. I aim to carry these values and perspectives to diplomacy and policymaking. 

Through my education, extracurriculars and professional experiences, I have learnt how to collaborate and communicate effectively, as well as manage interdisciplinary projects. I am currently interested in working towards conflict resolution in the Post-Soviet World as well as deepening my involvement in drug policy and education in the Netherlands and the EU.","{'country': 'Netherlands', 'short': 'Amsterdam, North Holland', 'city': 'Amsterdam', 'state': 'North Holland', 'default': 'Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands'}",False,False,[],"{'primary_locale': {'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}, 'supported_locales': [{'country': 'US', 'language': 'en'}], 'profile_languages': [{'name': 'English', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'French', 'proficiency': 'NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL'}, {'name': 'Spanish', 'proficiency': 'LIMITED_WORKING'}]}",Hospitality,"[{'date': {'start': {'month': 9, 'day': None, 'year': 2021}, 'end': {'month': 10, 'day': None, 'year': 2022}}, 'school': {'name': 'Leiden University', 'logo': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQEFlK1wNecYbA/company-logo_400_400/0/1519855876129?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=KwFN5kUM6lyLgjAXaylWnuNQ6g0XLwvWDjTK4Ug_mEg', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/leiden-university/'}, 'degree_name': 'Master of Science -
