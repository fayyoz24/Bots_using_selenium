    "summary": " SHORT BIOGRAFY -\n \nJelena Popadic-Glass is an independent artist internationally active in the fields of art, culture, and education. The artist was born in 1964 and has Montenegro-Serbian roots. She spent some formative years growing up in Australia. In 1984 she immigrated to the Netherlands to study art at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. For two years she studied painting and graphic design and then found her passion in the glass department where she explored unique and industrial glass forming for four years. Since her graduation in 1991 Jelena has been working as an independent artist, designer, curator and teacher. During her career she has been active in the field of visual and performing arts. In the past, she worked as a painter, sculptor, and designer for theatre, dance, opera and film productions. She also collaborates with interior architects and designers, choreographers, and film makers. Her work results from research, innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and crossover.\n\nThe base of her work lies in the transparency of pure material, as well as primary colours and shapes. Her signature techniques include deep sand blasting and cutting, which allow her to create mysterious, surreal indents on the object's surface. The repetitive geometric visual elements that she creates refer to cell structures, crystals, molecules and atoms. She transforms glass into mysterious objects which are reborn in their outward appearance. Light that penetrates through the material, reflecting in the texture has a unique optical effect.\n\n ",

            "description": "Short Dance Film \nCollaboration of Artists\nEquilibrium is a short dance film performed by the spectacular freestyle skater Marco Gerris. At the edge of the harbor of Amsterdam where an old factory building, a 19th century iron crane and a new bridge intersect along the water, a young man performs a skate dance. He depicts in three different dance parts, three stages of a man's life: liveliness at sunrise, strength at mid-day and equilibrium at twilight. His journey begins at dawn. A young boy and an old man, who arrive mysteriously and disappear into the darkness over the bridge at nightfall, accompany him. The dance combines spectacular skating with poetic imagery. A quest for freedom.\nMarco Gerris is the Netherlands' Freestyle Skating Champion and mastermind behind the skate musical ISH, bringing music, theatre, dance and skating together in one remarkable high-energy mix. As a choreographer and filmmaker, Ruth Meyer has created a number of theatrical dance performances and films in which dancers are confronted with unusual locations and movement situations, such as a glacier (Breath Chrystal) and sand dunes (Zenith). \nDirector Ruth Meyer\nChoreography Marco Gerris/ Ruth Meyer\nSkate dancer Marco Gerris\nCamera Peter Brugman, Peter Lataster\nEditor Gys Zevenbergen\nComposer Harry de Wit\nVisual art/ glassinstalation: Jelena Popadic\nLine producer Simone van den Broek\nProducer Carmen Cobos, Ryninks Films BV\nThis film was made possible with the support of the Dutch Film Fund and Amsterdam Art Foundation.\n\u00a9 2002 RYNINKS HOLDING-Ryninks Films\nCobos Films 1017 ZS Amsterdam Netherlands\nCategorie\nFilm & animatie",
