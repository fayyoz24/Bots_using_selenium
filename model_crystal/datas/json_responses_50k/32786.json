More specifically, 3 different p-y formulations are taken into account\ncorresponding to the well-known and widely used p-y curves of API and DNVGL to\nrecently (2010) developed p-y curves that are characterized by their accuracy and\nthe absence of application constraints. The numerical modeling of the dynamic\nbehavior of the examined OWT is implemented through the application of FAST. The\nsoil stiffness values required for the analysis in FAST are obtained from LPILE.\nHowever, considering the non-linear behavior of the springs, the stiffness values\nfinally applied in FAST are calculated through an appropriate iterative procedure,\nwhich is developed in this thesis. The investigation is carried out assuming\nfoundation on clay, while three different undrained shear strengths and two different\nload cases (wave - wind) are taken into account. Initially, the effect of the examined\np-y formulations on the Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) and statistical quantities of\nappropriately selected variables describing the dynamic response of the OWT is\ninvestigated. Finally, for the case of the recently (2010) developed p-y curves, the\neffect of the soil undrained shear strength and of the different load cases is examined\non the above-mentioned variables as well as on the Damage Equivalent Loads\n(DELs).
