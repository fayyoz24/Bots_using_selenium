    "summary": "As a business professional I am driven by people and impact. I am focused on creating positive social and environmental outcomes while achieving business success. \n\nI started in healthcare industry due to personal reasons, as mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40. \nAs from that moment on, my passion for healthcare, woman empowerment, inspiring others and driving sustainable impact , are my drivers. \nThe last 18 years at Philips worked with Commercial Organizations in Europe, Asia and USA:\n- developing winning long-term strategic partnerships, varying form 6 to 14 years, and revenue between 10 Mio Euro and 300 Mio Euro. \n- driving change and transformation\n- developing critical commercial capabilities as part of the transition to solutions focused organization.\n\nWomen empowerment and financial freedom are second important aspect and want to drive impact. \nIn 2021 I founded non-profit organization Independent Women, focusing on helping women achieve financial and personal freedom. In the Foundation we connected hundreds of women , enabling them to learn, inspire and support each other on their way to financial and personal freedom but we also helped many women and children, who had to escape from their homes due to the violence. \nInvesting is my third vehicle, that I use to drive positive social and economical impact related to the real estate market.\n\nI have a strong need to drive change and connect people to leverage their strengths and maximize impact. Whether it is the healthcare sector, non-profit or real estate, it all requires shift in the way we operate and lead in our environment. It requires conscious choices and focus on driving sustainable value.",
