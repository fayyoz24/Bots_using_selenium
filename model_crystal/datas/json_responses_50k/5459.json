We created a wonderland experience for the shoppers travelling through the airport. Inclusion of interactive elements such as; the spinning flower garden and a leather-upholstered love seat was key to maximising interaction with the shopper.\n\nThe \u201cLove Seat\u201d generated a participatory environment through low-tech fixtures that encouraged users, in particular children to play the spinning flowers.\n\nThe layout of the space allowed shoppers to see a clear path from the main retail space to the Sunshines shop. This was achieved through creating a lighting path, which highlighted fixtures stocking the product and acted as a gateway to the point of sale. From the inception phase the design took into account ease of entry and erection by consulting with the assembly team early on.\n\nAt the end of that 3 month period the sales figures where 51% up on 2012 which is way above market trend.\n\n",
