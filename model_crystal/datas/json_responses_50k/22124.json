    "summary": "I am a firm believer that the course of fashion has to change. And it will.\n\nA chance meeting with likeminded individuals in 2014 led me down the path of seeking answers to the questions on sustainability, responsibility and ethical fashion. I was convinced, the intense love affair that people around the globe had with fast fashion had to end! After 5 years of co-founding a successful ethical fashion brand, it was time to take a solo flight with my brand JULAHAS, while continuing to seek answers.\n\nResponsible fashion is close to my heart and I know that just like me, people around the world make daily choices on what to wear, while wanting to express their personal style. I hope that with JULAHAS, people have been able to find an individual style expression that will help them feel happier and look great, while making a positive impact on the planet and people.",
