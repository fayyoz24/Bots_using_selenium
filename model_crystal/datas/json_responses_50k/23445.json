    "summary": "I love JavaScript. It's like that weird kid at school who you made friends with because you were able to appreciate their idiosyncrasies. You found value in them that all the cool kids missed out on.\n\nWhat started off as trying to keep a React.js-based web-app running solo as a rookie developer has turned into a career and a passion, fuelled by the desire to understand the next weird bit, and to figure out how I can use it to deliver a better product. \"Elegant\" is a subjective term, but I believe if you really want to finesse a program you have to understand what makes the language tick.\n\nI enjoy drawing on the knowledge and wisdom of those who know better, whether it's Uncle Bob Martin, or the new junior who just learned something I didn't know. I believe opinions make for good banter (#teamspaces), but that you need data to back up performance claims.\n\nI didn't always think I was going to be a developer. I spent a long time in the events hospitality industry while I figured out what my vocation would be. During that time I learned that understanding the people you work with goes a long way to bringing out the best in each other. Just like with a technical system, I think that understanding and looking after yourself and the people around you is the best way to ensure long term performance and satisfaction.\n\nI've been a React.js fanboy since the very beginning, but Angular and I get along pretty well too. I've worked with MEAN stacks, MERN stacks, static websites on FTP servers, and I've dabbled with Java back-ends talking to SQL and NoSQL databases.\n\nI think GraphQL just shifts the work to the back-end developers, I've got an alert set for any updates on WebAssembly, and I think VS Code is a sign that sometimes leopards can in fact change their spots.",
