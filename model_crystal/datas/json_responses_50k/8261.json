    "summary": "Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science for Decision Making at Maastricht University, complementing my background as a graduate in Computer Science Engineering from Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona. Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired strong knowledge in areas such as algebra, calculus, cryptographic algorithms, and distributed systems. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to put my quantum-related knowledge into practice through a project focused on Quantum Anomaly Detection using one-class classifiers. I consider myself proficient in Python, Qiskit, and other programming languages, and I have honed my technical skills to tackle complex challenges.\n\nDuring my experience as an IT Junior Consultant at KPMG, I actively participated in international projects, contributing to the process of gathering requirements, testing, and quality control. In addition to my technical skills, I have developed valuable soft skills, such as self-awareness, determination, and organizational ability, which complement my technical expertise and make me a valuable and determined team member.\n\nI am excited to apply my knowledge and skills in the fields of Data Science and Quantum computing. My commitment is to make a positive impact, and I am eager to explore new opportunities in this field.",
