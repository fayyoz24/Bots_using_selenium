    "summary": "I am a citizen of the world and by the age of 27 have acquired an extensive international experience. I was selected as one of 5 people across an entire Russia to win an Erasmus Mundus Aurora II Exchange grant to study media, psychology and journalism for a semester at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands (ranked Top-100 worldwide). I earlier participated in an impactful volunteering experience at the dogs\u2019 refugee camp in Naples, Italy. I graduated with a Master\u2019s Degree in Marketing and Communication with Honors at ESEI International Business School in Barcelona, Spain and later took an internship in an international hospitality placement company there as well. My last major experience was working as a Business Development Manager at a 3D visualization and innovative global business services company with top-ranked developers clients (WCT, 1 Pavilion, Sunway, UMLand, MRCB, Mah Sing and many others) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \n\nIn my work, I am focused on building authentic engagement: it is not simply about promoting a product or writing about a topic with a correct set of tools but rather making sure that each interaction with a brand is a fascinating experience that provides true value to a potential customer.\n\nMy knowledge of persuasive communication techniques combined with a deep interest in digital brand presence along with an experience of working with educational, retail, IT, and design businesses will make me a resourceful addition to the team who is focused on solutions.",
