            "description": "Small energy actors \u2013especially residential end-users\u2013 with distributed energy generation and storage units connected behind the meter (prosumers) are at the centre of the energy transition. Much research has focused on their engagement, either in terms of directly controlling their consumption or by exposing them to time-varying price signals reflecting power system or wholesale electricity market conditions. However, centralized ways of stimulating prosumers\u2019 activation have not been proven entirely successful due to the compromise in the end-users\u2019 comfort and the limited economic incentives provided. Aiming at increasing the engagement of small prosumers, P2P-TALES proposes the use data-driven knowledge extraction techniques in order to identify clusters of consumers with similar or dissimilar energy-related behavioural characteristics, preferences and flexibility potential and create incentive schemes that reflect their financial and non-monetary motives. Moreover, based on prosumer analytics, P2P-TALES aspires to address several challenges related to distributed transaction systems through which energy is traded in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. More specifically, the development of trading protocols and agents to improve sustainability and maximize value by promoting synergies between prosumers on the basis of complementary objectives or alternative asset ownership models based on the principles of sharing economy will be investigated. Finally, P2P-TALES will attempt to map the cyber P2P transactions onto the physical distribution system and the actual flows of power, aiming at assessing the operational and reliability impacts. This will result in enhanced decision making for distribution network operators (DNO), allowing the procurement of system services from prosumers preventively or in real-time.\n\nPartners: TUE, TUD, Enexis BV, ICT  BV, Synerscope BV \nRole: Co-Principal investigator \nFunding: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)\n",

            "description": "The SiNGULAR project investigated the effects of large-scale integration of renewables and\ndemand-side management on the planning and operation of insular electricity grids,\nproposing efficient measures, solutions and tools towards the development of a sustainable\nand smart grid. The goal was to generate solutions for the integration of highly variable\nenergy resources. The operation and planning tools and procedures were applied in different\ninsular electricity grids in five countries across Europe. Extensive demonstration took place,\nallowing the development of generalized guides of procedures and grid codes specific for\nfuture generation of smart insular electricity grids.\n\nPartners: (Portugal) Universidade da Beira Interior, Smartwatt \u2013 Energy Services SA, EDA \u2013\nElectricidade dos Acores SA, (Greece) Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hellenic Electricity\nDistribution Network Operator SA, (Spain) Universidad de Castilla \u2013 La Mancha, Instituto\nTecnol\u00f3gico de Canarias SA, Concepto Sociol\u00f3gico, (Italy) Politecnico di Torino, Wave for\nEnergy SrL, Comune di Pantelleria, Italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development \u2013 ENEA, (Switzerland) ALSTOM, (Romania) Universitatea Politehnica din Bucuresti, Electrica SA.\n\nRole: development of market structures in which various types of demand side resources are\neligible for reserve provision; incorporation of stochastic programming and risk management; investigation of distribution system optimization problems (reconfiguration); development of energy management systems to optimally couple residential-end users and the grid.\n\nFunding: European Union FP7 \u2014 ENERGY",
