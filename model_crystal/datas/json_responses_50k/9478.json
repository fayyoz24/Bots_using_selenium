A pro bono, cultural and political media product that calls for social inclusion and solidarity. A voluntary production, which dozens of professionals in the Music Production and Video Production industries took part in (including the president of the state of Israel and the leading artists in the country). \nThe project was released in Israel on 21/4/19, in the spirit of 'we are the world' legacy, and became the #1 song in most Israeli charts, including more than 37M views on Youtube alone. The product was also introduced into the Israeli education curriculum and won the prestigious 'Galei Zahal' broadcasting award. \n\nYouTube - A Tribe of Brothers and Sisters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWx3R7WaAQY"
