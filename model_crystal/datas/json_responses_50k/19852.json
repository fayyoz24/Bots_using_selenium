I have been involved in due diligence and acquisitions in countries like: Poland, Bosnia, Hungary, Ukraine, Turkey and Algeria.\nSince the merger of Mittal with Arcelor (in 2006) I was appointed as Vice President Employee Relations and Benchmarking for the whole Arcelor Mittal group. The group produced at that time some 120 million tonnes of steel, had a turnover of EUR 80 billion, activities in 27 countries and 320.000 employees. My scope of responsibility covered all employee and industrial relations as well as labour efficiency improvements worldwide. Managed massive restructuring plans around the world and concluded EWC negotiations forming a combined EWC for Arcelor Mittal within an initial hostile environment. I travelled extensively (more than 90%) under hectic circumstances and with continuous changing itineraries throughout my years with Mittal.",
