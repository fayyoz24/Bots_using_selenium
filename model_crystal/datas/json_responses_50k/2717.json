    "summary": "I was born in Budapest, Hungary and lived in different parts of the world ever since. Since I can remember, I was always doing art or going to art school where I developed a good eye for composition and colour combinations.\n\nAfter I graduated as a graphic designer my intense journey of travels really started and after I bought my very first DSLR camera my journey began.\n\nMy real passion for photography actually started in Africa, where I got to work as an assistant of a great photographer and close friend now. He was persistent in teaching me new things and inspired me to take as many pictures as I can. As they say \u2018practice makes the master\u2019. This is a long road that I\u2019ll be walking on probably until the end of the carrier, but the beauty I see in people and my images afterword gives me the fire that keeps me going.\n\nMy main passion is fashion and portrait photography.\n\nI use natural light in my photography to create beautiful, dream-like images that evoke a sense of emotion and beauty.\n\nEvery time I\u2019m behind the camera I just feel so liberated and happy, like its the place where I meant to be. I promise that if we work together we will have much fun and the outcome is gonna be great!",
