In taking up their role,  students need to take an entirely professional approach in the various elements:  in searching for the relevant facts and evidence,  in relating these to the applicable law and jurisprudence,  and in presenting their argument in written and oral pleadings. During the moot court, each student will perform his or her specific task in effective coordination with the other team members, aimed at correctly presenting their observations to the Court.

Through various tasks, it introduces students to EU institutions' functioning, the competence allocation issues between the EU and the Member States, and the different stakeholders working to influence decision-making at the EU level. The project covers elements of EU procedural and substantive law. Students will be expected to develop legal advising, analysis, decision-making, regulation, representation, communication, teamwork and self-organisation. \n \nFocusing on public health law and policy-making and using examples from other EU action areas, students will start exploring the internal functioning of the EU. They will simulate the decision-making process by first taking the assistant's role to a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and then taking the role of an MEP.  They will go through various activities in which a specialist in EU affairs is likely to engage over his/her career pursued in different institutions and at varying levels of responsibility. They will review, analyse, draft and amend various types of EU law. They will debate and negotiate draft legislative proposals, experience the complexities of the European Parliament's legislative procedure, and defend their position in simulation tasks.",

Every student enters the simulation as a newly hired young legal professional at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a given country. All members of a tutor group are working on the same legal team and their tutor acts as their head of department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n\nThe MUN project is designed to enhance the student\u2019s knowledge, skills and attitude required to become a competent legal professional. It challenges students to think, be critical, learn to retrieve and manage information, plan and manage both individual and group work, conduct meetings, take minutes, make summaries, communicate professionally both orally and in writing.",
