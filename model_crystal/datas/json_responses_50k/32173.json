    "summary": "I\u2019m Claudia Schalkx, a marketing strategist who works with consultants & facilitators like you who\u2019ve been in business for 3+ years and just aren\u2019t seeing the results they expect from their marketing efforts.\n \nI won't make you start from scratch because you don\u2019t need to.  You have already done the work, but you\u2019re just too close to see what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. I\u2019ll take what you are already doing and transform it into an organized, systematized, and easy-to-talk-about framework that consistently attracts the just-right clients that are ready to work with you. \n\nYou\u2019ve spent enough money & time chasing all the shiny objects: courses, webinars, podcasts, and blogs. You've downloaded hundreds of tips & tricks and done your best to apply them all, but don\u2019t know what\u2019s working (or isn\u2019t), so you just keep buying and trying something new, scattering your energies and exhausting yourself in the process.\n\nNow you're at the point where you need someone with an expert lens to make sense of all the work you've already done, to streamline and organize and convert it into crystal clear and compelling.  It\u2019s time for a blueprint for your process and a content marketing system that comes directly from that blueprint. Simple, streamlined, and sustainable. You\u2019ve worked too hard to be this frustrated, so let\u2019s figure it out together.  \n\nWant to know what some of my clients have to say about working with me?\n\"\ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26

Nabuur helped organised communities in developing countries to find answers to their local problems that did not involve receiving financial resources as part of the solutions. This meant the communities had to be very clear what request for assistance they would put out there for the volunteers to help. \n\nMy role was to help these communities to shift from asking for funds, to making better use of the knowledge and expertise available online and within their own resources, as well as supporting them in communicating the results to their respective communities.\n\nThis was in the early stages of mobile development, and  internet coverage in those countries was scarce and expensive. Nevertheless I managed to organise 145 communities, train the representatives to train new community leaders. And today I have the same approach with the clients I work with: What is the best we can do with what you have, and how can we do better.",

Gary was an early adopter of globalisation and always promoted this thought among the agency\u2019s clients. Not an easy thing. \n\nOne of their clients had an important event in Caracas, and Gary reached out to Estima for support. The rest is history. They were happy with my ability to seamlessly jump from Spanish to English and back to Spanish, not to forget Italian and Dutch. They appreciated my organizational and planning skills and the fact that I was  able to communicate throughout the world without causing major cultural incidents. And so I became an Account Executive Global Relations. \n\n9/11 put an end to my tenure in the USA as companies turned inward instead of global and I moved to the Netherlands where most of my family had relocated as result of the political restlessness in Venezuela (my parents were Dutch and had migrated to Venezuela in 1956).",

At that time my passion lay with working in the oil industry, combine this with living on Cura\u00e7ao - otherwise known as the place where the Dutch are relaxed - and I was living the dream.\n\nAs the liaison officer I worked with a diverse range of stakeholders. Diverse in cultural aspects and in the level of distrust that - at times - needed to be overcome. This is taught me how to define the problems and solutions in their words.",

On my return to Venezuela I wanted to stay in an international environment, I was lucky to see Nestl\u00e9 had an opening where my skills and experience were a great fit.\n\nOne of the best lessons learned during my time here, was that my interest lies in communication with external clients. When put in charge of finding the next venue for a touring exhibition, I put all my networking skills into practice resulting in finding the right facility and sponsors for the interactive exhibition.",
