I stimulated individual projects of the commissioners I was overseeing, assisting them in any of their problems, contacting external partners and coming up with techniques to engage our University's community. Organised a musical event with a local pub to our campus and managed to connect artists and art-enthusiasts in our university with a very significant turnout. Partnership was sustained. Engaged the community with 'artivism' and political engagement through art. Managed to raise awareness on several sociopolitical issues, such as period poverty, and raise money for a charity working to uproot the systemic issue at the root of this problem. This was achieved through the sales of mass-produced artwork by the student members of the committee, managing to further stimulate our audience by working with them to advance our goals."
