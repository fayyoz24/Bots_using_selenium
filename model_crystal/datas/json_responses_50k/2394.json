The first year I was the chairman of the group, a difficult part of the project because of not much knowledge was available and we didn't have land to build on. When we had acquired ground to build, the development process has been 3 years. We have had the full participation in the development (contracted architect, constructor, notary), advised by a consultant. In the last 3 years of the project I have been the treasurer of the board of the association. Finally we have gained the margin otherwise a professional developer would have gained. The 27 houses are build in Beusichem, Buren and Lienden. My own house was delivered in February 2010.",
