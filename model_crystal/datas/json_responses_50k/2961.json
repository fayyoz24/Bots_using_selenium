    "summary": "I am passionate about solving big policy issues that concern us all. As an optimist, I believe that we can change the world around us to a better place. I work every day to do just that.\n\nMy strength lies in the fact that I can see the bigger trend, problem or picture very fast. In my work, I am very result driven, which motivates me to stimulate people around me to work to a common goal. \n\nAs a person, colleagues describe me as a motivated and strong team player. During my training as an officer in the Royal Dutch Army I was submitted to stressful situations where I had to organize, manage, take initiative and cooperate in a team. Furthermore, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Security Policy Division, I learned to analyze and coordinate on policy level.\n",
