    "summary": "Throughout my career, I have travelled to and lived in several locations. Home has been London, Ethiopia, Switzerland and Turkey with my permanent base located in Den Haag, the Netherlands. Projects have taken me to the MiddleEast, China, the UK, Indonesia, India and more, and have included advanced urban locations as well as informal settlements in Jakarta and rural Rajasthan for example. Living and working in such different contexts, has allowed me to gain a clear understanding of the challenges of designing, planning, and delivering projects in diverse economic, social, and technical circumstances.\n\nMy professional career has seen me working alongside renowned architects where I have been a key part of many challenging and award-winning projects. My travels have exposed me to the challenges faced by many fast-growing mega cities and countries that are experiencing rapid and sometimes unpredictable patterns of growth and development. Contemporary challenges require innovative thinking and collaboration between often unexpected parties. We are in the midst of great climate challenges and major social, economic and environmental questions must be addressed immediately.\nIn my search for tools (other than traditional design and planning tools) to aid private and public clients, I turned to organisations such as the Ellen Macarthur Foundation and project Drawdown for inspiration and guidance. Over the last several years I have dedicated my time to exploring and gaining knowledge and skills related to these topics acquiring certifications and accreditations from the Circular Economy Institute, Cambridge University, Delft- Wageningen and more. At the same time, I have also created and co-created events, webinars and presentations and in turn, I have been invited to speak at many other high-profile events and collaborate on many fascinating assignments.\n\nWith my broad background and current skills developed in my role as Circular Economy Built Environment Specialist and Instructor, I bring added value and I look forward to many fruitful opportunities.",

Noteworthy projects include Aerocity New Delhi, India for the realisation of a high-end hospitality district landscape and commercialisation project at the international airport. In Jakarta, Indonesia, Chris was part of the team preparaing a master plan for safe guarding the future of the city as it struggles with flood risks and the chronic need for urban revitalisation.\n\nInspired by the regeneration of his home city of Manchester, England, Chris trained as a Landscape Architect at the Manchester Metropolitan University. From his first placement during his studies Chris has been involved in large scale master planning and urban design projects from greenfield locations to industrial brown-field sites. In many of these projects sustainable issues and environmental responsibility have played a major role from aspects of rain and waste water management to integrated solar and wind energy possibilities. \n\nDuring two years in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Chris undertook research into aspects of eco-architecture, sustainability and urban growth and renewal in often challenging circumstances. Recently Chris has been involved in various stakeholder workshops where his skills of strategic thinking and ability to translate discussions into visual communications, have been utilised and greatly appreciated by those involved.",
