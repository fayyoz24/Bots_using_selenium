I was shortlisted for an essay on philosophy, written without any prior education or help in the field. The essay question was: \"In what sense are you the same person today that you were when you were ten?\" In brief, I argued that personal identity depends on physical and psychological continuity over time. I rejected dualism and supported physicalism. I stated that personality, comprising beliefs, desires and memories, is key to personal identity. The extent of change in personality determines if a person remains the same. With significant personality change, identity becomes indeterminate. Fission/duplication examples showed identity requires single physical and psychological continuity. Ultimately, it's indeterminate if one is the same person from age 10 because of potential personality changes.",
