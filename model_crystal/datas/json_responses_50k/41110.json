    "summary": "Project manager and social housing specialist with experience in both government and private real estate projects. Passionate about the real estate market, interior design, zero energy building, and sustainable development. Affinity with real estate finance, management skills, and data analysis.\n\nWith more than 14 years of experience in architecture, interior design, and project management, I have been involved in various scales of residential projects. Altez show unit in Tanjong Pagar Singapore, Boulevard Vue at Orchard Singapore, and one unit bedroom Thamrin Executive Residence Jakarta are some of my interior design work profiles. Furthermore, I developed more than 20 locations of social housing complexes during my work for the Government of Jakarta, including social rental housing (rusunawa) Daan Mogot, which is fully aligned with state-of-the-art green building concepts. Through the Dutch Training & Exposure programme in 2017, I developed my skills in water management and gained knowledge about building resilient cities.\n\nI graduated with a Management in the Built Environment master's degree at the Delft University of Technology in 2022. Housing Policy, Management, and Sustainability was my favourite course, where I learned the strategy to manage and redevelop the housing stock to increase socioeconomic and environmental sustainability. My thesis dissected and suggested improvements for the Zero Downpayment Mortage program that the province of Jakarta offers their citizens, targeting low-income households. \n\nI enjoy cooking, following the news about animal preservation efforts, visiting design events, and travelling in my free time.",
