I investigated (1) to what extent there is support for or opposition to different types of antidiscrimination or diversity measures in the Netherlands and other European countries, and (2) who supports which measures to a greater or lesser extent.  In addition to its scientific contributions, this project has to potential to have a valuable societal impact by informing the current lively debate about ethnic hiring discrimination and how to reduce it. It can provide insights on where, for whom, under which conditions and for which policies support may be increased.",

This project first examines the number of women and men in higher management positions (i.e., with job authority) in the Netherlands and the changes therein over the past 25 years. Second, the gender gap in job authority in the Netherlands is compared to that in other European countries. Furthermore, the project examines who manages who; e.g., do women more often supervise women and do men more often supervise men? Finally, the project focuses on explaining gender differences in job authority, changes therein over time, and differences therein between countries. It pays attention to micro-level factors (like human capital, norms and ambitions), meso-level factors (like organization size, percentage of women in occupations and sector), and macro-level factors (like policies and culture). \n\nFor more information on the project (in Dutch) see: www.instituutgak.nl/research_programs/vrouwen-in-hogere-managementposities/\n\nThe following website (in Dutch) with inspiration for policies to enhance womens' representation in (top) management positions was developed as part of this project: http://www.vrouwenaandetop.nu/\nAlso, this project not only resulted in several scientific articles, but also in two publications for a broader public ('De toename van vrouwen in leidinggevende functies' by Tanja van der Lippe, Anneke van Doorne Huiskes & Lieselotte Blommaert appeared in Economisch Statistische Berichten in 2014 and 'Interventies voor meer vrouwen aan de top: wat werkt en wat werkt niet?' by Mieke Zijlstra and Esther de Ruijter appeared in Tijdschrift voor HRM in 2016).\n\nTEACHING: developing, coordination and teaching for several courses, supervising bachelor and master theses and tutoring (bachelor and master students in Sociology).",

This study examined the prevalence of ethnic doscrimination in recruitment in the Netherlands and investigated which individual and contextual conditions foster or hamper discrimination in recruitment. \n\nUsing data from field and laboratory experiments, surveys and reaction time tests (IATs), this study provided strong evidence of ethnic discrimination in recruitment procedures in the Netherlands. Discrimination of both male and female minority applicants occurs across sectors and occupational levels. During economic recessions discrimination appears to occur more often. Not all people are euqally likely to discriminate. Those who have more positive interethnic contacts and those with higher educational levels are less likely to discriminate, whereas males and those with religious (Christian) backgrounds are more likely to discriminate. Discrimination is not always the result of conscious (explicit) processes; having unconscious (implicit) negative associations with ethnic minorities also increases the likelihood of discriminating. \n\nMy supervisors (promotor and co-promotor) were Prof. Dr. Frank van Tubergen and Dr. Marcel Coenders (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). \n\nTEACHING: Teaching several courses, supervising bachelor and master theses and tutoring bachelor students in Sociology (bachelor and master).",
