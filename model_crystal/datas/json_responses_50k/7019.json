The related tasks were recording daily and monthly transactions in collaboration with other departments (e.g. sales and purchase department).\n\nAnother course, Supply Chain Management, taught me how to execute a quick scan to make the supply chain more efficient in both internal as an external aspect for a company. \n\nIn the Strategic Enterprise Management course, I learned how to come up with a strategy that in many ways will be beneficial for a company (e.g. when and how to enter a market).\n\nThe Control and Accounting course was an interesting one for sure. I had to come up with products, vendors, suppliers, and customers and enter this within the SAP system. The products had to be transferred from one entity to another with transactions included. \n\nWith the last course Treasury Management Project, I, as a virtual consult company had to record payments and receives on a daily and monthly bases in SAP ERP. \n\nAs a conclusion, the minor taught me a lot, especially with the SAP ERP systems. Since each of the courses was related to the SAP system, you get agility with it. \n",
