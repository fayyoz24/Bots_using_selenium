    "summary": "Being very creative and crafty, I started building several objects using all kinds of materials in my childhood already. Due to my vocational training as a glass blower, I deepened my passion for materials processing, (analogue) 3D-modeling and inventing products as well as my understanding about glass. Driven by the fascination for this material, I became materials engineer and subsequently a materials scientist. Through my education, I gained deep knowledge about:\n\n\u2022\tThe nature, properties and possible applications of glass, ceramics, polymers, metals and compounds\n\u2022\tProcessing techniques, testing methods and characterization possibilities for glass, ceramics, polymers, metals and compounds\n\u2022\tCoating techniques and methods to characterize layers and surfaces\n\u2022\tBio materials and recycling of materials\n\u2022\tComputer aided 3D-modeling and 3D-printing\n\u2022\tQuality control and statistics in experimentation\n\u2022\tDocumentation and presentation of results and scientific writing\n\nDuring my Internships and employments as a R&D Engineer in materials development, I proved an outstanding attention to detail, a very good ability to visualize my ideas as well as very good teamwork, critical thinking, hands-on-mentality and problem solving skills.\nI want to use my knowledge, experience and especially my high creative energy in additive manufacturing, toy production, packaging development, life sciences or similar industries.",
