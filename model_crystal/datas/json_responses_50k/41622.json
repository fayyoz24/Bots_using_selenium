    "summary": "As a Human Factors Engineer, I work with partners from academia and the industry to understand human behavior and improve user interactions with technology. My areas of expertise include user and usability research, qualitative and quantitative studies, human behavior analysis, and the design and evaluation of human-machine interfaces (HMI).\n\nCurrently, I am working in the space of automotive human factors and automated driving to understand and design for the interactions between automated vehicles and humans. My background in computer science and my work experience in the software engineering industry allowed me to work closely with users and product managers and incited a keenness toward designing for user needs. \n\nI enjoy applying a Design Thinking process towards problem-solving, and I believe that empathizing with user needs to discover product insights is at the core of any successful strategic design decision. Driven, detail-oriented, and committed to producing high-quality results, I am passionate about complex problem-solving and applied research, either individually, or in a team.\n\nTwitter: @deydavedey\nList of publications: https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=EPW7AMkAAAAJ&hl=en",
