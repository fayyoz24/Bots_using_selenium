    "summary": "I am a Rotterdam based pianist, arranger, composer, researcher and educator born in Rosario, Argentina. Specialized in River Plate tango, classical and contemporary music, I have toured the world with diverse ensembles, recorded CDs and published articles related to my fields of expertise. I have created and collaborated in works including music, theatre, dance, puppets, fine arts, animation and audiovisuals, and am currently working on diverse inter and transdisciplinary projects with international artists. Tango Tinto, f-LUID and Tango Gradus ad Parnassum are my main own ensembles. I am also the pianist of the famous Quinteto Astor Piazzolla (https://quintetoastorpiazzolla.com/), Latin Grammy winner as best tango album 2019, with which I have intense world tours. I also collaborate as a pianist and composer with other ensembles, including the NEuE (https://www.neweuropeanensemble.com/).\n\nAs a researcher, I am the author of The Art of Tango, a unique book with a companion website on tango performance, arrangement and composition published in 2021 by renowned Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group. I currently work as artistic research coach and piano and ensemble teacher in the Master of Music at Codarts University of the Arts, Rotterdam, where I also coordinate the Tango (World Music) Department and fulfilled a postdoc project focused on tango music creation and education in 2022. I also work as an artistic research coach in the Master of Music at Fontys University of Fine and Performing Arts, Tilburg.\n\nMy music education started in my hometown Rosario, Argentina, and continued in Europe, where I moved in 2000 to study and continue growing as an artist. I obtained two Bachelor degrees in piano, at the Instituto Provincial del Profesorado de M\u00fasica in Rosario (1998) and the Conservatorio Statale di Musica Giuseppe Verdi, Milan, Italy (2003). In 2009 I completed a Master of Music at the Tango Department at Codarts University of the Arts, Rotterdam, and in 2014 a PhD trajectory at the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, Leiden University, as part of the docARTES programme. In both occasions (Master and PhD), Maestro Gustavo Beytelmann was my artistic supervisor. I also completed studies in composition at the Conservatoire de musique, de danse et d'art dramatique du Pays de Montb\u00e9liard, France, 2015, under the direction of Prof. Dr. Jacopo Baboni Schilingi.",

            "description": "The tango ensemble Sobre el Pucho is formed by first class musicians who find their nexus in the popular music of Buenos Aires and the Rio de la Plata.\nWith a vast experience in the genre, each musician contributes to creating the unique atmosphere that this music evokes. From the intimacy of a solo piece to the full dynamic range of the trio, the ensemble offers to the audience a wide variety of colours and atmospheres as well as a journey trough different and exiting rhythms that constitute the soundscape of the River Plate.\nSobre el Pucho specializes in playing new tango repertoire: compositions and arrangements written by the members of the ensemble as well as by leading contemporary tango composers.\nThe main part of the ensemble's program is conceived and based on the search for interesting variations and arrangements of old tangos and the gems of a new tango generation.\nBased in the city of Rotterdam, Sobre el Pucho aims at performing on an extensive international scene, particulary in Europe. Collaborations with musicians from different nationalities and backgrounds, keep them constantly linked with foreign artists and keeps them open to the possibility of exciting projects with new perspectives.\nMatias Pedrana, Alvaro Rovira Ruis, Barbara Varassi Pega, Virgilio Monti.",
