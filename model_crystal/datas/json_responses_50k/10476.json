    "summary": "I am an experienced (people, agile, project, scrum) manager who knows how to make the combination between management and operation. I know what I want and am well able to achieve my goals. I like to set clear and challenging goals, and I am very results oriented. Handling or preparation of strategic objectives has always been an important element of the jobs that I do.\n\nI led several teams, where communication, diplomacy, quality and efficiency were important. I'm always looking for simple solutions to complex problems.\n\nCommunicative I am powerful, and in my experience, able to motivate all levels in an organisation for change and for the results to be achieved. Obviously, I am flexible, stress resistant and a real team player. I operate with a no nonsense mentality, and able to let people and department work conform targets, and deliver a project conform planning in a short time.",
