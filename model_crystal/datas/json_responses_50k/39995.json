The trip helped us gain a better understanding of how to  do business in a multicultural environment. \nDuring the trip, we visited local organisations such as JAFZA and DAFZA to get an insight on how the Government tries to attract companies to Dubai, which was supported by the visit of TURN8 a start-up accelerator.\nWe also spent time at cultural visits,such as the Sheikh Mohammed Centre and Dubai's souks, to get a good understanding of Islam and local history. \nMeanwhile, we paid a visit to Emirates catering to observe the operations in the world's biggest kitchen.\nBy the end of Study visit,we became knowledgeable on Dubai's culture and business differences which we presented on poster's to the Dubai Women's Colllege.",

Having a strong knowledge of the ergonomic logistics market in Europe I was given the freedom to research each product line further and make suggestions. I first worked closely with the sales team, assessing clients' needs and finding the best solution, realizing that all rentals were standard products I created a automatic quoting tool for the rentals. Finally, I spent some time with a team analyzing the potential takeover of a supplier going out of business and recommended the purchase which led to an increase in that product line's net profit.",
