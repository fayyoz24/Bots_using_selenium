    "summary": "I am a people's manager for a team of quantum software developers. Being a software engineer by experience and physicist by training, I am bridging the worlds of software and applied physics/engineering. I am interested in software technologies in general, and specifically in production-quality software development. My research and development background allows me to easily enter scientific and industrial engineering domains, and speak the same language with the users. As I believe that users are the most important, I always take the time to correctly identify user needs, and keep the users in the loop during product development. Due to my natural passion for quality, I am always striving for robustness, stability, and maintainability of the software tools that I work on. I enjoy working in a team, learning new technologies and teaching other people.",
