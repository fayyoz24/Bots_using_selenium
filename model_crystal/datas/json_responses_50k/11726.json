    "summary": "I'm a driven Finance professional with over five years of experience in various Accounting and Finance roles in internal environments and Post-Bachelor in Finance (QC). During my bachelor degree I've gotten my feet wet with leading a small team and enjoyed working with people on common goals and personal development.\n\nWithin Philips Intellectual Property & Standards I fulfill two roles: One of business partner for Global Brand Licensing, a strong and healthy growing business within Philips, and the other as Financial Office of the License Administration Department.\n\nA business partner supports the business with information, communication and relevant insight in the progress on budgets and forecast. I will be making the AOP and Rolling Forecasts and delivering ad hoc support wherever required by the business. \n\nMy second role gives me the opportunity to stay \u201cclose to home\u201d, working within a fully occupied administration that delivers results at a high standard. This is shown in excellent (internal / ICS SOx) Audit performance and the trust of the business in getting the right information in the right way and on time. In my role I focus on the payable side of things, with a responsibility in a set number of accounts (Balance and P&L) and a diverse working experience in intangibles, accruals and provisions.",
