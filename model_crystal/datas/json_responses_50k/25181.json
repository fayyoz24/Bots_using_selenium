    "summary": "I am a master student of Global Economic Transformation and Technology, a prestigious master ranked 5th Master in Finance Worldwide (Financial Times 2020). This is a pioneering track in the business-education landscape that awards three degrees:  \n- Master in Management Studies Degree, EDHEC Business School \u2212 Paris, France\n- Master in Management Degree, Sungkyunkwan GSB \u2212 Seoul, Korea\n- Global Economic Transformation & Technology Master Degree, University of California Berkeley - San Francisco Bay Area, USA\n\nI started my career as a screening operations analyst at Adyen, a leading Dutch financial company. I performed KYC and PEP checks and managed risk against potential cases of bribery and corruption, fraud, and money laundering. I took it upon myself to implement practices to safeguard customers' information, evaluate risk, and judge data authenticity. \n\nIn the Loan Markets Team of ABN AMRO, I was responsible for the origination and execution of club deals, syndicated facilities, and private placements. The role involved the development and pitching of tailor-made financing structures for ABN AMRO\u2019s clients, as well as the drafting of documentation and negotiation of legal terms. \n\nIn my current position at Karl Lagerfeld, I provide key support in the Product Merchandising of the Karl Lagerfeld Accessories product line. Some of the main responsibilities include sales analysis, market feedback, competitor benchmarking, and trend research. \n\nMoreover, I have broad international experience (Latin America, Europe, Asia, Oceania), a strong inclination for leadership positions and great eagerness to learn.",
