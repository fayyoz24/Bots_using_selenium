            "description": "Inspired by children, I have been designing different art and creative classes for ages 4-12. One of them was about biomimicry and inventions. \nTo create a bridge to the real world I approached the octrooi bureau Los & Stigter. They were so inspired by the idea of taking children's ideas seriously, that they offered to give a patent to the best idea. Jibbe's invention was selected by the bureau's engineers. He was only 9  years old at the time and became Netherlands' youngest inventor.",

These themes range from, Emotions, nature, sustainability, inventions, perspective, visualizing your dreams, light and dark, cultures and more. At the same time we learn and use basic techniques and different materials as paint, charcoal, clay, collage, 3 D,  integrating and experimenting with words, dance, video, music and theatre.\n I also create customised programmes for schools or organisation on demand across the globe and in multiple languages. My goal is to illustrate the freedom we have to our disposition through the arts and to empower the individual to find their individual voice and style.",
