    "summary": "My name is Nils Kroon, and I have been fascinated with nature and the involvement of humans with nature for as long as I can remember. Due to this fascination, I have become very aware of the necessary steps that are needed to find the balance between an economically feasible activity and the acceptance of such an activity, when considering values like sustainability. For me, this has resulted in a continuous curiousity about how such a balance can be achieved and how to promote associated socio-economic and ecological benefits.\n\nDuring my attendance at the Bachelor's Coastal and Marine Management, I have been focused on understanding how the human-nature relationship can take place in more sustainable ways for multiple industries that rely on the coastal and marine environment for transportation, and recreational and exploitative purposes. This was when I discovered my interest in the fishing industry and the ever-continuing developments and challenges this industry faces. Through the last few years, I have attended multiple courses and performed projects in the fields of marine governance, marine resource management, marine biology and ecology. Among other things, these projects have taught me that more sustainable fishing practices can take place in the most effective way when fisheries management is based on a collaborative approach with the fishing industry. This approach is complemented by a consensus on the meaning and value of sustainability, and the principle that the efforts that the industry are taking will be noticed and (where needed) compensated.\n\nMy intention is to help explore the possibilities to reach more sustainable fishing practices and to improve the processes that lead to such a result. Challenges are the precursor to growth, and I never let myself be restricted by what I do not know yet!",
