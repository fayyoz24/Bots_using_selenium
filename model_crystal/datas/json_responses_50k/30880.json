    "summary": "In January 2022, I graduated from Leiden University with a BS in Biology. To any position I will bring personal integrity, accuracy, enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. I seek to work for an employer that takes its social and environmental responsibility seriously and fosters personal and professional growth of its employees.   \n\n During my bachelor I focused my coursework on the molecular level. In addition,  I also have a back ground in microbiology and the medical laboratory.  My background has trained me to be precise and detail oriented. I am able to accurately keep track of data and when necessary find solutions to problems that have arisen. \n\n\nDuring my academic course work at Leiden and Wageningen University I have gained practical experience in many molecular techniques, such as DNA/RNA isolation, DNA/RNA purification, PCR, q-PCR, HPLC, SDS-PAGE, GC/MS, Identification of bacterial isolate using 16sRNA, made a  Aspergillus niger deletion strain (knockout) via split marker, Western Blot, Gel electrophoresis, yeast 2 hybrid, protoplast transformation, electroporation, Agrobacterium transient transformation Assay, gene insertions and gateway cloning to name a few. Furthermore, I have also worked acquired experience with using bio-informatics websites such as BLAST (NCBI) and primer design.  \n\nMore recently, I joined Janssen Biologics in Leiden as a manufacturing operator in their Vaccine Launch Facility actively contributing to the production of Covid-19 vaccines. During my time at the VLF I worked with a great group of people and was trained in Wave bioreactor cell culture expansion . In addition, I was responsible for daily monitoring and in process cell culture testing prior to cell expansion which required cell counts to be performed prior to cell expansion. This work requires excellent aseptic techniques as well as an ability to work in a cleanroom environment. During my time I have become trained in cGMP regulations as well as EHSS (Environmental Health Safety and Security) standards.  \n\nAt this time I am actively applying to positions within the medical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and molecular science fields.\n\nFor a more extensive list of my experience and skills please find my CV here under \"featured\".",
