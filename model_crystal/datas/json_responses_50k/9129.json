Originally it is a Danish initiative and the idea is that visitors, common people, get the chance to read a Human Book. Meaning: having a short conversation with a person. But not just a person. The Human Book is somebody who is deadling with stereotypes on a daily basis. Somebody who people have prejudices against. For example an ex-convict, a transgender or a refugee. Visitors of the Human Library get the chance to check their prejudices with one of these persons, or just have a nice conversation with somebody you would normally never speak to. The day was a success, with 15 Books, almost continuously being 'on loan'. For a photo impression of the event, please click on the title. \n\nI was responsible for a big part of the general organization and I conducted preparation trainings for the Human Books and for the volunteers.

It has 800 members and it combines educational and leisure activities. \n\nI organized several educational activities in different committees, with mixed responsibilities. Twice I functioned as the promotion officer for congresses about Russia and Religion & Politics (both sold out with 100 and 150 visitors), as chairman I was responsible for organizing historical movie nights with an inroduction from a lecturer and in my first year as a student I wrote for the student union magazine."
