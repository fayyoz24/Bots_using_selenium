    "summary": "I have always welcomed new discoveries with great anticipation. Whether the discovery was a simple exchange about a shared passion or simply a decision to embark on a new learning experience... I could name many discoveries which came along my way!\n\nMy heart led me to invest in the process of mentoring and coaching others to combine their passions and abilities in order to reach their personal and professional goals. What sometimes used to start as a casual conversation often inspired others. I think it is important for people to be given the chance to help them reach their goals - even dreams - and do great things together and, in turn, inspire others, too.\n\nI strongly believe it all starts with accepting wherever we are at any given moment, reflecting on our past experiences and being able to move forward with enthusiasm, curiosity and creativity, regardless of the situation.\nEveryone should feel appreciated, and love what they are doing. It\u2019s important to feel our \u2018feelings\u2019 and not to be afraid to share and express fully what we think. In the long run, it helps us all to develop ourselves fully and be happier with what we manage to achieve.\n\nMy warmest thanks and gratitude to all former and new fellow team members for helping each other on this beautiful and meaningful professional journey.\n\n\nLet your wisdom as a human being connect with the power of things as they are.\n                                                      \u2014 Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa, Buddhist teacher",
