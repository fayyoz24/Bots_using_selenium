    "summary": "My name is Ilaria Fichera and I am a PhD Candidate in the Building Acoustics research group at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). My research field is related to computation acoustics and to modelling software for room acoustics purposes.  \nI graduated from the University of Catania in 2016 with a master's degree in Civil Engineering and Architecture and have pursued my master's thesis research in Stage Acoustics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).  \nMy passion for acoustics and research has inspired and encouraged me to pursue a career in acoustics design and acoustics research ever since I began these studies. After working for five years in acoustics consultancy in the UK, I have decided to continue my career in research.  \nIn my ongoing research, I am developing a software to simulate room acoustics using the diffusion equation. The research is part of a larger project for room acoustics simulation software funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).",

This assessment concentrates on the accuracy of predicted calculations in general teaching classrooms of 55 m2 where rafts are used for the control of reverberation, as opposed to lay-in grid ceilings.\r\r\nIn terms of analytical method, the Sabine formula is used for the calculation of the Reverberation time. In terms of geometrical/ray-tracing method, the software CATT-Acoustics is used.\r\nThe hypothesis is to demonstrate that analytical methods such as the Sabine formula might underpredict/overpredict the amount of absorption since it assumes a completely diffuse sound field and that a geometrical/ray tracing model might be more accurate.\r\n",

Results have shown that the acoustic quality within the control room does not fully satisfy the conventional standards. The main problems are related to the room shape that leads to the superposition of different modes and consequently to the establishment of resonance effects. In order to improve the acoustic quality of the control room, a corrective proposal has been developed following the design standard criterion Live and Dead end (LEDE).",
