    "summary": "An asset at the intersection of Corporate & Internal Communications/Reputation Management, (Digital) Marketing and Sustainability. Happy to lead and/or support your Change Agenda.  \n\nFor organisations that take their reputation seriously along with the development and roll out of sustainability strategies, I can make a difference. My specialities include corporate and internal communications, (re)positioning, sustainable business development, stakeholder dialogues and the development of marketing & communication strategies.\n \nThe result is what counts for me: whether I\u2019m in a role as a visible leader or as a driving force in the background supporting others. With my theoretical background and hands-on experience I am able to develop sustainable strategies that are both feasible and ready for implementation. I help organisational leadership to define, execute and communicate sustainable corporate objectives and societal goals. \n\nAs a positive and energetic person, I am able to connect easily to people, earning their support in building a team able to fully maximise every opportunity. These strong interpersonal skills guarantee my ability to solve political issues, communicating in a calm, productive and appropriate manner. My ability to relate to people has also helped, over the years, in the development of my exceptional network of contacts, including many with sustainability expertise.\n\nMy openness to new ideas and innovation serves as a foundation for my interest in the latest developments in my fields of expertise (including digital). This progressive approach is backed up by experience across a broad spectrum of organisations including high-tech as well as heavy industries, shipping & offshore, real estate, professional services, semi-public domain and lobby circuit.\n\nBest situated in a leadership role as Marketing/Corporate Communications Director where knowledge of sustainability is valued or a Sustainability Director\u2019s function where (digital) marketing & communications skills are the key to success.",
