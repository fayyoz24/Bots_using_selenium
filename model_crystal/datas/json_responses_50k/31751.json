    "summary": "I am Caroline Dus\u00e9e. I work in the field of personal growth, spirituality and raising awareness on a variety of topics. \nI write and speak about my personal experiences and life story. \nNext to that, I have a background as a cultural anthropologist. I have spent a a lot of time living and travelling in many countries all over the world. Mainly on the African and South American continent. \nCurrently I live back in my native The Netherlands and spending much time in South Africa and Spain. Next to some other places and cultures. \n\nMy writing and speaking involves topics such as death and loss, how to connect to our soul and how to heal the relationship between men and women. \n\nTwo books of mine will appear in the coming time: One is about my life story and is a personal memoir about loss and how to be true to ourselves. It focuses on how to move on after loss and how to connect to our soul, to find our true path in life. The other book is about the hidden emotions of men, based on interviews with men worldwide and focusses on how to bring women and men closer together. Soon my Blog about different personal life themes will appear, next to my articles about the Roma Women in Southern Spain. \n\nWith my Foundation Victory for Equality, we have supported all different projects around equality and equity in different countries worldwide. Such as Ecuador, Peru, Tanzania and South Africa.",
