After six months of collaborative creation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing, we ended up with a winning product proposal. The final product is an app from which people can track their energy consumption in real-time, receive tips on how to reduce their energy consumption and an AR feature where people can visually see which device is/isn't energy efficient.",
