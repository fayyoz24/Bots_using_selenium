Through extensive interviews in both countries and through a process of discourse analysis, Lo interrogates the extent to which the disease has been successfully securitized at both the national and sub-national levels at the same time as offering a new framework of analysis for securitization theory. This is a well-written book that will have appeal to many, from area specialists and public health professionals through to scholars of securitization theory and HIV/AIDS.\"",
