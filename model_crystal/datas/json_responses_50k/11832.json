    "summary": "My entire career has been developed in finance departments. I have been working in Treasury, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, retail accounting (General Ledger), controlling the accounting of all of them as assistant controller and at the present time I am the manager of the Business Accounting team responsible for all  the accounting and processes related to margin (revenue & COGS). I am also leading the subsidy management.\n\nThese experiences together with the knowledge acquired by my studies (Degree, Bachelor and Master on Business Administration/Finance/Audit) makes me an ideal candidate for a job position such a Finance Controller, Accounting Manager, AP Manager, Business Analyst, Financial Analyst, or GL Accountant. I have experience with USGAAP, spanish GAAP, italian GAAP, and IFRS.\n\nThe managerial skills developed in the two last positions, where I have reporting to me a group consisting of 14 people, and the experience gained from the 11 years when I was football referee, provide me the capacity to be a good manager able to deal with my colleagues by listening  and analyzing the situation in order to take the best decisions.\n\nI have affinity with operating systems such as SAP, SAP BI, BEX Analyzer, Analysis for Office, Cognos, JBA, Hyperion, Oracle BI, Essbase, BPC, Nakisa, Sharepoint and advanced Excel skills. In addition, I had experience working in different cultural environments, which helped me to overcome any cultural barriers and made me a good team player.  I also possess good communication skills in both English and Spanish. Due to my international education and experience, I became an employee who can easily adapt into new organizations and projects. I am passionate about new challenges.",
