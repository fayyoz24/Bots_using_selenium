    "summary": "I started with Python in February 2021, exploring the world of data science and machine learning, before turning my attention to Game Development. In December 2021, I started programming in C++ before exploring Unreal Engine in January 2022. After producing a few basic games, serendipity allowed my path to cross with a small team in the US working on an indie game. Since then, I have been one of two programmers on the team, slowly expanding my knowledge of game development and Unreal Engine.\n\nAs I am unable to share work protected by NDA, find below a summary of my experience so far:\n- C++ and blueprints. Our project comprises around 80% C++. I am very comfortable with OOP paradigms, harnessing inheritance, virtual functions, static variables and functions, complex boolean logic, pointers, references, lambdas, access specificers, interfaces and carefully considering performance.\n- AI. Behavior trees with custom tasks and decorators, NavMesh, navigation evokers and query filters. Our friendly NPCs can be instructed to engage in tasks such as combat (inidividual and in teams), gather resources, build structures, farm and generally add life to the game. The interface between the AI and players is managed through UI menus.\n- Networking. All aspects of the game so far are fully networked using Unreal's server-client paradigm through a player's listen server. I am very familiar with server and client RPCs, net multicasts, correct and efficient labelling of networked variables especially as they interface with Animation Blueprints.\n- Animations. Given our small team, I have spent a great deal of time either retargetting and flipping third-party animations or creating simple, custom animations both in Blender and Unreal. I have gained considerable expertise using Unreal's much-improving control rig system and have experimented with procedural and physical animations.\n- Other. Sound, particles, source control (GitHub and Perforce), components, 3D math, integrating and understanding systems and code written by other developers, working closely with a small team, technical UI considerations, chaos destruction, AI and player controllers, game mode, game state, trigger volumes and much more.",
