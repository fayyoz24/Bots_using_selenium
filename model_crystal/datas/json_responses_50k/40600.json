    "summary": "A passionate communications and marketing leader with 16+ years experience in taking international, multi-channel programmes from planning to execution. German by nationality, I worked in Brussels, Beijing, New York, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, where I had the pleasure of collaborating with some of the most innovative startups and FTSE 500 companies in the world. \n\nMy experience covers corporate communications, media relations, communications and brand strategy, thought-leadership, executive positioning, crisis preparedness and management, as well as political campaigning and policy development, stakeholder engagement and navigating regulatory environments (EU/US). \n\nAs Head of Marketing, I also successfully built up marketing functions delivering go-to-market strategies that cover content marketing, product marketing, ABM, demand gen as well as product-led marketing strategies. \n\nMy core competency lies in creating compelling messaging and telling stories for brands, their products and services that make the complex accessible, that can change opinions and convert customers. \n\nTo successfully navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by a global marketplace, I believe a communications and marketing strategy needs to be data and insights-driven, and unify a brand's voice across the entire business. \n\nFull of energy and unafraid to roll up my sleeves, I thrive in fast-paced, high-energy environments. I am a team player and a team leader and am keen on collaborating with organizations that understand meaningful public engagement not only as an integral part of their business strategy but of their success. \n\nCorporates I have worked for: Microsoft, HP, PayPal, BSH Siemens, GE, Nielsen, Oracle, Symantec, Flex, Hartmann Health, DNV GL, most recently Autodesk\n\nStartups/scale-ups I have worked for: Solar Impulse, Habito, Mesosphere, MessageBird, Globo, Spacemaker",
