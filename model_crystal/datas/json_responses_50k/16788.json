    "summary": "As graduate and passionate biologist I have gained extensive experience in the scientific field of population biology. During my master I studied the genetic variation in Dutch populations of the critically endangered Tower Mustard (Arabis glabra). I looked at the effects of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity and its implications for conservation and management of the species. This has given me valuable experience with molecular techniques such as microsatellites and AFLPs. In addition, I examined the effects of invasive animals on native species within the reserves of a non-governmental conservation organization (Natuurmonumenten). In doing so, I build a bridge between the scientific and practical side of nature management and I succeeded in integrating both disciplines in management advice. Furthermore, I worked as a teaching assistant at the University of Amsterdam where I taught statistics to first-year bachelor students. This work equipped me with a broad knowledge of statistical analysis of biological data.\n\nI am currently working as a scientific researcher at Science4Nature. Within Science4Nature I have been able to continue my passion for biology and have worked on various genetic research projects. The qualities I have developed here are reflected in the successful completion of the various projects in which I have been involved. Besides my professional career, I have been active as a volunteer and player in various research projects. Here I have been able to stimulate my curiosity and use my experience and enthusiasm for the conservation of nature. ",

The aim of this study was to provide Natuurmonumenten recommendations on cost-effective policies for controlling invasive exotic animals within their reserves. Here, I challenged the difficult task to provide a link between scientific-based knowledge about exotic invasions and the more practical side of exotic animal control carried out in Dutch park management. At the end of the project, I succeeded to integrate both aspects into a management plan that now serves as a critical tool for action on invasive animal species. This experience enabled me to be familiar with the practical work in conservation management in general and, in particular, the decision making and policies of a Dutch nature organisation.",

(Turritis glabra) as Revealed by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)\n\nI have conducted this research internship within the Institution for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED). My research focused on the genetic variation in wild populations of the highly endangered plant species Arabis glabra (tower mustard). This project has equipped me with valuable practical experience in molecular lab work (e.g. DNA isolation, PCR amplification, AFLP analysis), population genetic structure analysis (e.g. STRUCTURE, AFLP-SURV), as well as population genetic data analysis (e.g. Arlequin, GenAlEx). The results of my study have made a significant contribution to the knowledge of genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation and its impact on the viability and decline of rare and endangered plant species. At the same time, this research gave me the opportunity to assess implications for effective strategies for the conservation of the species.",
