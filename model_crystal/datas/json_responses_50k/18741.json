    "summary": "Since 2009, I have successfully been building my career in one of the leading banks of Ukraine in Kyiv, and by 2011 I was the head of a customer service department of the CityCommerce Bank Information Department. During my work in this position, I was able to optimize the work of the department, implement new duty regulations and operating scenarios, and also create a wonderful team of professionals in my field.\n\nHaving built a successful career in the banking sector and taking the lead with the Informational Support Department of Avant-Bank in 2016, I realized that I did not want to stop there, that I needed further development and had to  look for some new areas where I could fulfil my potential.\nI have always been attracted to marketing and innovative technologies, as well as their endless possibilities and challenges they pose every day. With this, I decided to go on building my career and developing in the field of Digital Marketing and administration of business processes in the digital area.\n\nI have always been attracted to marketing and innovative technologies, as well as their endless possibilities and challenges they pose every day. In early 2017, I started working for one of the leading Digital Marketing companies in Ukraine, SocMediaLab. Over five years of work, I was able to optimize business processes in the company\u2019s social marketing direction, as well as to create and lead a new WEB-development direction for the company. Over the past 4 years, my team has successfully implemented 26 projects of website building (https://phyris.in.ua/, http://backstage.ua, https://pcu.socmedia.com.ua/, etc.), also 12 applications and 8 chatbots (m.me/McDonaldsUA?ref=start , m.me/opelukr?ref=start).\n\nI can say that throughout my career I learned how to be a result-oriented manager and motivate the others. I believe, my most important quality in this respect is my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively.",
