To start the process, the problem was carefully formulated considering physical and computational limitations. Then, the problem was rigorously analysed and checked to see if it could be further simplified for computer implementation. After this step, various industry standard algorithms were used to find the optimized design parameters in the chosen design domain. MATLAB's Optimization Toolbox was extensively used for the entire optimization routine, with inbuilt functions like \"fmincon\", \"fminbnd\", \"fminunc\", among others. These functions were understood thoroughly for the algorithms they implemented. Finally, a comparison study of the computational efficiency of these algorithms was also done by monitoring the number of function evaluations, number of iterations, and computational time taken by the individual algorithms.",

The physics was solved using COMSOL's CFD Module, with the optimization part of the process being handled by MATLAB. \nThe objective function was chosen based on the research done by the Stanford Yacht Research Group (http://syr.stanford.edu/). Response surfaces of the objective function were generated after realising the instability of COMSOL to handle all kinds of values of the design variables. \nThe optimization was done first using the popular global optimization routine, Genetic Algorithm (GA). The minima was found to be the global one by analysing the response surface and sail flow physics.\nNext a line-search algorithm, the Golden Ratio method in conjunction with the Steepest Descent method was implemented by us to be compared with GA. Line search algorithms are local optimization routines, as was seen by the local minima in which the algorithm would get stuck. \nFinally, conclusions were drawn on the type of objective function, and the different possibilities of algorithms to be used. The results we obtained were analysed for the different set of conditions a sail boat might experience in real life. The scope of future work in this field was also discussed while identifying the need of more robust and efficient physics solvers.",

            "description": "Modelled in MATLAB, the longitudinal dynamics of a Formula Student Car idealised as a 13-DOF system. The dynamics of the system was first mathematically expressed through the Lagrange equations, and then solved in MATLAB for better understanding of the working of the car. The modal solutions obtained were analysed to gauge the comfort level of the driver, and guidelines were formulated for the engineers to improve the car design.",

The work involved accurate modelling (in MATLAB) of the geometry and the thermo-mechanical loading that the connection goes through in its lifecycle.\n\n3. Different techniques and optimisation algorithms were programmed in MATLAB to test their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n4.
