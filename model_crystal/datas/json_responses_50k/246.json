There have been over 10 recipes launched and marketed in several cities (over 16 states) in Brazil, with thousands of liters sold already in the first months of operation.\n\nWith great creativity, we attracted the attention of the general public, beer geek enthusiasts, and even large brewing companies proposing M&A, both due to our \"rebel footprint\" and the high quality of our beers. You can check over 2000 customer evaluations and reviews on general social media, including https://untappd.com/AquelesCaras.\n\nDuring that journey, 3 of my beers have become medalists in the Copa Cervezas de America, Chile (2016, 2017, and 2018), amongst hundreds of breweries in North, Central, and South America.\n\nI did collaboration projects with other breweries, and famous artists, got featured in magazines like Revista Veja, and Revista da Cerveja, newspapers like O Globo (all nationwide publications), and got interviewed by many other people over social media and the internet.\n\nIn 2016, I had the chance to go to Bras\u00edlia representing the state and national brewers associations and meet the country's president Michel Temer to follow up and testimony on the sanction of a new law that would reduce bureaucracy and facilitate the collection of taxes by micro and small entrepreneurs in the craft beer industry.\n\nIn 2020, right before publishing my book, I was invited by AMBEV to give a masterclass to their audience regarding entrepreneurship in the craft beer market. \n\nMy book, telling a story of entrepreneurship and craft beer business, stayed in the Amazon Top 10 most-sold books during the first weeks after release and can be found at several other stores (and here): https://www.amazon.com/-/pt/gp/aw/d/B08PW5TDW7/ (available in Portuguese and Spanish).",
