    "summary": "I'm a broadly experienced data & processes professional with several strong skills.\n\nI help companies to innovate more efficiently with this experience and skills. My way of achieving this, is by forming hypotheses, doing experiments and develop proof of concepts. The fact I have tecnical knowledge, hands-on experience and know how to explain nerdy things to 'normal' people, makes me a valuable data analyst who is also not afraid to try and succeed.\n\nAre you in need for a witty, polylinguistic nerd translator and a to-the-point interest negotiator? Does your sluggishly moving projects crave a committed kickstarter who is very happy to land in the middle of your agile and innovative organisation? Contact me today to see what I can do for you!",
