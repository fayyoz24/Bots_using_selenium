The International Rainwater Harvesting Symposium was organized by RAIN, SearNet, AFRHINET, ICRAF, AgWA and IFAD. The meeting brought  together policymakers,  practitioners, the private  sector, scientists, NGO  workers  and  UN  agencies. Over  100 participants  from  15  countries  shared approaches and  techniques  on  how  to  better mainstream rainwater  harvesting  into policy  and  practice. This  was  done  during  a  High Level  Policy  Dialogue,  a Writeshop  and  a  Practical  Training. Through  interactive  panel  discussions,  keynote  presentations  and parallel workshops in the Policy Dialogue, key messages were captured in the Addis Ababa Declaration.\n\nRead the full declaration here: http://www.rainfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Unlocking-the-Potential-of-Rainwater_Final1.pdf",
