For example, 123TCS does not trade in its clients' gift cards, but rather facilitates any possible ambition of the client in terms of sales and distribution of their gift cards.\n\nAs a Customer Support Engineer, I played a crucial role in delivering excellent customer service and technical support to 123TCS customers. I was responsible for answering inquiries, resolving issues, and providing expert guidance to achieve high customer satisfaction and ensure successful utilization of 123TCS services. I analyzed and investigated technical queries from customers and offering appropriate solutions. This included resolving login issues, explaining the functioning of different systems to new customers, and customizing digital vouchers to meet customer requirements.\n\nDuring my tima at 123TCS, I worked as a first-line support, collaborating with the internal development team to prevent or address escalations; I was involved in the successful rollout of a new balance checker, where I took charge of communicating with customers to ensure a smooth migration process. Additionally, as a software tester, I actively contributed to the development of the new Order Portal, providing constructive feedback to the developers based on my findings.",
