    "summary": "As a recent graduate of MSc Industrial Ecology, a sustainability science program integrating technical, environmental, and social aspects for the systemic solving of human problems, I have a strong passion for innovating and supporting solutions in energy transition, circular economy, and sustainability. My graduation thesis project involved research on the techo-economic and environmental analysis of carbon nanomaterial production through a novel CO2 utilisation approach and a status quo CH4 based chemical vapor deposition approach. \n\nDuring the period of master's, I have demonstrated my entrepreneurial skills and vision by developing and pitching a cleantech startup idea involving CO2 utilization and conversion to carbon nanomaterials for application in concrete, which won me several awards and recognition, such as the Shell Energy Transition Award, the Falling Walls Lab Delft Winner, and the Climate Launchpad Netherlands Finalist. I have also gained valuable experience in  decarbonization solution, sustainability consulting, business developement, research and analysis, from my work experience at organizations such as Witteveen+Bos, Green Insights, and Greenko Group. \n\nI am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in impact investment, sustainability consulting, decarbonisation solution engineering, and cleantech startup development for a safe and sustainable future.\n\nFeel free to reach out and know more.",
