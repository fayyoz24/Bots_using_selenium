    "summary": "Ever since I was only a little kid I tinkered around with everything that had a monitor. It gave access to a different world with all kinds of puzzles and challenges. This became a fascination that I like to share with others and even extended to an academic study and a job as a developer.\n\nWith the skills I gathered over the years I am amazed about the endless possibilities which are out there. Unfortunately, complexity is often in the way of new technologies and this can make people reluctant to try them or to see their potential.\n\nBy creating simple and modular solutions I try to take away this reluctance. The simplicity should persuade people to try it. And the modularity should inspire them to use the full potential of new technologies. With this philosophy, I hope to get inspired by the ideas of others as well as to share my own fascination.\n",
