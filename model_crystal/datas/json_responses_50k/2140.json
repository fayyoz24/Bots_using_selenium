None of the other students in his Chinese Philosophy course under Dr. Cheng showed up on Saturdays in place of our Tuesday/Thursday lectures. Dr. Cheng, the class and I came to an agreement that I would attend the Saturday lectures and redistribute them over the normal Tuesday/ Thursday classes. This offered great depth of insight into Chinese Philosophy from a globally acclaimed expert in the field, and rewarding experience in lecturing at a university level."
