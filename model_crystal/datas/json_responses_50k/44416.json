    "summary": "Data Scientist | Quantitative Developer\nMachine Learning | Exploratory Data Analysis | Python\n\nHow come the above words describe me? Though question. I didn\u2019t plan to become any of these, but I turned into them on my way to find out what I\u2019m supposed to do in this world. Something that I\u2019m good at, also enjoy doing, and that has the potential to change the world (at some point).\n\n\u2014 Data! Data! Data! \u2014\nYes, I am the annoying person coming up with out-of-context fun facts just because she loves numbers. I am always fascinated to explore and analyze or just adore any kinds of data. As Student Data Scientist at MTA-SZTAKI, I have learnt how to do this programmatically with Python and with PySpark. I also worked on  ML and AI projects, building Recommender Systems and solving Classification tasks with Matrix Factorization, Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting Tree models.\n\nDuring my masters at Saarland University, as a Student Research Assistant in the EDA Research Group I could explore my own ideas in Exploratory Data Analysis projects. In my master thesis I investigated the black box of Neural Networks: using association rule mining, I introduced a new model that reveals how the neural network builds up its knowledge through the layers. These results turned out to be exciting not only for me as a fresh graduate, but for fellow researchers as well: it was presented at ICML 2021.\n\n\u2014 What the heck? Let me understand it! \u2014\nThis attitude motivated all my academic carrier, from my first math class up to my master degree. I love that in math I don\u2019t need to believe anything just because some wise people said it at some point. We can prove anything, plain and clear, so all I need is to work my way through it. And I never stop halfway, that is how I finished my math bachelors with highest honors, earned scholarship to one of Germany\u2019s best University in Computer Science, and graduated with excellent grades and an outstanding thesis.\n\n\u2014 Good idea, make it work! \u2014\nI realized early on, that great ideas in Data Science and Machine Learning always come hand in hand with a well-structured code. If there is no code that is easy to use, maintain, and improve, then the great ideas end up in dustbins. In my role as Quantitative Developer at MSCI, I have learnt how to construct production grade codes in Python, how to write unit tests, and how to be conscious about all the details that makes a code robust.",
