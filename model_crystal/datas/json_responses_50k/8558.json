    "summary": "My interests lie in the area of developing people, organisations, and organisational forms. I have experience as a facilitator and coach, as well as being a mindfulness practitioner. Aside from that, I cultivate a hobbyist fascination in evolution theory and complex systems theory.\n\nI maintain that I am a theorist at heart and a pragmatist by choice. If it were up to me, I would love to have all knowledge derived from first principles; abstractly, theoretically, beautifully. But until we meet our maker, we shall be humbled time and time again. Therefore, wisdom would allow a certain amount of testing and tinkering, trial and error. So do we overcome our prejudice and dialogue with nature, who alone knows herself in her full entirety.\n\nI have had the good fortune of living in several different countries and collaborating with people across disciplines, cultures and continents. This has helped me develop empathy, communication skills and intellectual openness. Along the way, I've become fluent in five languages which continues to be an immense source of joy.\n\nAs part of my Master in Management programme at Rotterdam School of Management,  I did my thesis at Aberkyn, a subsidiary of McKinsey & Company. My research looked into ways to proactively harness chance elements by generating, identifying and making use of fruitful unexpected events.\n\nTogether with a couple of brave people at Breathe, I am now \"Building Inspired Companies\" and working to nudge mainstream business to be of greater service to the whole.
