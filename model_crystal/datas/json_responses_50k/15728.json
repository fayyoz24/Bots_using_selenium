    "summary": "UX unicorn \ud83e\udd84 & Design podcaster \ud83c\udf99\n\nI am a Senior Product Designer with 6 years of experience in the B2B business/developer tools area. I have designed products such as a Customer Portal, Data Integration Tool, E-commerce Management Platform, Content Management System, and Forecasting tool.\n\nWith my solid technical understanding, I can be a UX unicorn who can bridge the gap between design and front-end development. I have implemented a UI refactoring project at Shell and developed a design system at Bloomreach.\n\nI am highly interested in maturing the design culture and designOps, including building a design process, templates, design systems, and scaling the design team. Also, I interact with real users and translate their context into easy-to-understand business processes, customer journeys, and user personas. I wear the hat of users and speak on behalf of them in product teams. And of course, I excel in all the must-have designer tools such as Figma, prototyping, and user workflow.\n\nBesides my professional work, I am a UX design Podcaster at Design Nomads, the most popular Mandarin-speaking design podcast in the world. We share stories of design leadership, service design, and design careers with 10k active listeners.",
