    "summary": "With my current role as Operations Manager and Lead Engineer, I not only undertake the responsibility of a mentor towards some of my peers, I am also involved in project planning & delivery along with the architectural design of applications. \n\nWith more than 13 years of programming experience with Java, J2EE technologies and with the skill of Certified Scrum Master and Scrum Developer, I believe I possess effective managerial skills which motivate me to improve myself and provide necessary help for my colleagues.\n\nI started my career as a software developer focused on Java, J2EE related technologies. Further on I was able to learn more about the design and architecture aspects of software engineering. From an architecture point of view, I am trying constantly to improve myself. As my career went along I took more responsibilities in my work and achieved the position of Operations Manager.\n\nAlong the path, I gained valuable experiences to manage and lead a team. Undertaking the role of a mentor I aim to improve my colleague's technical as well as soft skills. During the mentoring program, the objective is to make sure that the colleague attains skills that are necessary for the assigned project keeping in mind their interest and towards business growth.",
