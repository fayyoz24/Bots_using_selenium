The NXE:3300B is the newest of the machines based on EUV technology, which has superior imaging, namely image quality and overlay, as well as higher throughput. In NXE:3300 Metro project, we assure the system specifications of EUV machines, by providing the necessary software to control and correct all hardware components, for a fully functional, reliable and highly available lithographic system.
