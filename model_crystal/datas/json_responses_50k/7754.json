    "summary": "WHO IS SIMONE?\nI\u2019m an engaging, stimulating communicator, poised and capable of projecting enthusiasm and warmth, and of motivating other people. I have a strong sense of urgency, initiative and competitive drive to get things done, with emphasis on working with and through people in the process. Understands people well and uses that understanding effectively in influencing and persuading others to act.\n\nImpatient for results and particularly impatient with details and routines, I\u2019m a confident and\nventuresome \u201cdoer\u201d and decision-maker who will delegate details and can also delegate \nresponsibility and authority when necessary. I\u2019m a self-starter who can also be skillful at \ntraining and developing others. Applies pressure for results, but in doing so, my style is more \u201cselling\u201d than \u201ctelling\u201d.\n\nAt ease and self-assured with groups or in making new contacts, I\u2019m gregarious and \nextraverted, I have an invigorating impact on people, and is always \u201cselling\u201d in a general sense. Learns and reacts quickly and works at a faster-than-average pace. Able to adapt quickly to change and variety in the work, will become impatient and less effective if required to work primarily with repetitive routines and details.\n\nIn general terms, I\u2019m an ambitious and driving person who is motivated by opportunity for\nadvancement to levels of responsibility where I can use my skills as team builder, motivator and mover.\n\nIk spreek nederlands, I speak English, Jag talar svenska och ich verstehe Deutsch.\n\nportfolio: https://www.simonevandermeer.com/",
