However, there was no existing framework available to assess the resilience of these actors in their interactions with each other.\n\nTo fill this gap, I undertook research to develop a resilience framework that can analyze the interactions between formal and informal actors at multiple levels. My framework allows for the assessment of the resilience of these actors in the face of various challenges and can be used to identify opportunities for improving their cooperation and effectiveness.\n\nThrough my research, I made significant contributions to the field of urban governance and provided a practical tool for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. I am confident that my framework can help to promote more effective and resilient governance of urban systems, benefiting both formal and informal actors in the process.\n\nOverall, my experience developing a resilience framework for urban governance has honed my research and analytical skills and has demonstrated my ability to provide innovative solutions to complex problems.",
