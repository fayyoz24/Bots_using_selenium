    "summary": "I am an assistant professor in the Centre for Media and Journalism Studies at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I received a Ph.D. in Media Research and Practice from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I remain a Research Fellow at the Center for Media, Religion, and Culture. I have an MA in Cultural Studies, with a concentration in media studies, from Claremont Graduate University. Prior to graduate school, I studied film/TV/radio production and completed a minor in psychology. My first feature film \u201cCicada\u201d was shot in Japan and won awards at the Heartland Film Festival, LA Asian Pacific Festival, and Guam International Film Festival. I have also produced several music videos that have premiered on SPIN, Pitchfork, and mtvU.\n\nMy research explores the intersection of digital and screen media, national identity, and coloniality\u2014particularly within South Africa and the Global South. My dissertation, entitled \u201cWe are not South African\u201d, is a decolonial critique of national identity as a fundamentally broken form of mediation by which communities and individuals make sense of their belonging in the world. This project reflects my larger interest in how various processes of mediation, through technology (especially digital), language, or the body, reveal deep human anxieties over identity and belonging. Other research projects include work on video games as an extension of coloniality and analyses of outer space ventures as new iterations of imperialism.  ",

Jumpei's inability to have children causes him to become a father-figure to his sister Nanaka's young son Ryota, who is being bullied at school. Nanaka and her gambling-addict husband decide to throw a birthday party for Ryota in hopes of changing his classmates' perception of him. Unfortunately, no one shows up to the party except the quirky cast of adults in Ryota's life, and it is here that secrets are revealed and chaos ensues.\n\nCicada is the first feature film from the team that created the award-winning short films Jitensha and Persimmon. Their work has screened at the Venice Film Festival, Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival, and Aspen Shortsfest and won awards at the Heartland Film Festival, Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and Sapporo Shortfest.",
