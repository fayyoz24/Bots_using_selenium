That means that new methods need to be developed to analyze Akzo Nobel samples and to correctly interpret the data. In addition, new application areas need to be explored to best serve the different business units as well as people need to be trained to use the instrument.\n\nTask\nMy task was to explore the capabilities of the instrument, e.g. resolution limit, measurements in liquids, combining AFM and Raman data and automation of measurements. I also had to train my colleges to use the instrument, but also teach them the basics about AFM and data analysis. Furthermore, defining suitable application areas based on the instrument assets was an important part of the assignment.\n\nAction\nI started to learn the ins and outs of the instrument and tried to transfer my knowledge through writing several protocols and instruction manuals. I also gave several presentations to increase the awareness and understanding of atomic force microscopy within SRG-MAS. Furthermore I did some measurements on test samples to explore the limits of the instrument and to explore the noise level at the instruments location. Also some Labview programs had to be written to extend the capabilities of the software in terms of automation.\n\nResult\nAt the end of the project, several people were trained on the instrument and there is a better understanding about AFM within SRG-MAS. Several protocols and procedures help to perform different tasks more efficiently, and with troubleshooting in case of a problem. Furthermore, during this assignment I was involved in several SRG-MAS projects about analysis of coatings, paints and specialty chemicals using AFM and also Raman spectroscopy. In addition, I learned to work together with different people in different projects in a corporate environment.\n",

An important part was the development of a new sensor\nthat combines atomic force microscopy with scanning near-f\feld optical microscopy\nin a small easy-to-use device. The program was a collaboration between two university\nresearch groups and Philips Innovation Services. As the only Ph.D. student\ninvolved, I was required to manage the project and work as an independent\nresearcher. I enjoyed working with a large variety of instruments ranging from\nmicroscopes and spectrometers to fabrication equipment such as laser ablation and\nfocussed ion beam milling. The most important things I learned are taking the\nlead in a research collaboration and being flexible in combining hands-on experience\nwith developing management skills.",
