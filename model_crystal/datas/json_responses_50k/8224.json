    "summary": "I\u2019ve always been a salesman, quite naturally. From my youth and eventually in college and professionally, I\u2019ve enjoyed harmoniously working to peak customers' interest to have them purchase products (and services) that have benefited said customers--while bringing profits to the organizations and businesses where I have held positions.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0It\u2019s no surprise that over the years, through a combination of grit, hardwork, and competitiveness, I have translated my love for business into working as a sales professional and retail stock trader. More recently as an SV Academy certified and gainfully employed sales development representative, I enjoy applying my skills, even more thoroughly, with the best companies. I\u2019ve been able to figure out what my clients need and how to help them to obtain it.\u00a0\n\n\nInevitably, selling can only emerge as a part of larger life goals, but I have realized that with the right approach--including immense amounts of self-motivated analytical thinking--my coworkers and I can and will work efficiently to exceed our limitations and improve daily in the best way.\n\n\nAnd as one of the premier salesmen reminds us, gratitude remains key; so in this way and henceforth, I have to say to all interested parties: thank you very much.",
