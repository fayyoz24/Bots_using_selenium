    "summary": "I am a MEAL activist with over 8 years of pragmatic field and international experience in designing, coordinating, and implementing robust results-based M&E systems. \n\nI have worked in complex and small-scale programs and projects in Africa, Asia, and The Netherlands, guiding organizations and programs to define their results and anticipated change through methodologies such as the Theory of Change. Skilled in using efficient M&E techniques and frameworks to develop results-based plans for tracking project activities. I am also familiar with MEAL methodologies such as Outcome harvesting, outcome mapping (progress markers), Most Significant Change stories, and digital tools for measuring performance, and results. Knowledgeable in interpreting data from Monitoring and Evaluation activities into concrete learning and performance actions.\nWhen I am not involved in MEAL activism and think tanks, I enjoy cooking, watching soccer, travelling, and catching up on a good laugh with friends.",

For this to become a reality it is essential that sexual and reproductive health education that is accurate and appropriate to their stage of development is provided.  This is crucial for this type of education becomes the foundation for attitude formation and decision making.   Menstruation hygiene management (MHM) is a key topic in reproductive health education yet it is often overlooked in disadvantaged low socioeconomic status areas.\nGood MHM is defined as the following:\n1.\tProviding access to necessary resources which include sanitary pads, materials needed to collect/absorb blood, soap and water. \n2.\tProviding adequate private facilities where girls can change, wash themselves and their sanitary reusable pads. In addition facilities must include adequate disposal system.  \n3.\tProviding comprehensive health and sexual education related to MHM.  \nAn issue experienced in low SES areas of rural Uganda are the high dropout rates of girls due to poor MHM. This includes lack of washrooms at their schools, unavailability of sanitary pads, and bullying by peers. \nIn addition the lack of proper health education leads to lack of prevention sexually transmitted infections. Other consequences of not addressing MHM properly include lack of sexually transmitted infections prevention education and lack of gender equality education and empowerment. \n\u2022\tProvide free reusable sanitary pads for 300 schoolgirls in remote districts of Jinja.\n\u2022\tWrite and disseminate culturally appropriate manual on menstrual hygiene practice targeting school teachers and girls in 150 schools in rural and peri-urban areas of Uganda.\n\u2022\tOrganize and train health clubs in schools in Jinja to teach and make reusable sanitary pads. Organize and mobilize such clubs and community organization to advocate for clean water, adequate private toilet facilities in schools and materials for girls. \n",
