The prediction model is based on the principle that there are only 3 failure modes (design, parts and processes).  Design risks are mitigated by validating the design with an integration test. Remaining are the part and process risks. The processes used for manaufacturing are all coupled to either a part or a material. The Bill of material contains all parts and materials and based on this principle also all processes. The insight in part or process risk is given by the history of the parts or processes in the past.

This is based on using  the PCBA IPC7912 methodology at the start of the design by identifying the risks in the design phase. Based on the identifeids risk the solution can be a design change, a process improvement or as last resort  testing the product or process step. This project covers as a start PCBA's, populated racks and electro mechanical assies. Involved are a number of Eindhoven based OEM's and a number of their suppliers.",
