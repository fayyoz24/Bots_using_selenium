Based on the literature review drawn from journal articles and academic books, the entire lean philosophy, possible obstacles for lean implementation and performance parameters for measuring lean has been discussed. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with the company owner and its employees to understand the firm\u2019s manufacturing wastes, operational issues and the overall current production process. All the findings have been analyzed in order to devise the best possible lean implementation process and the associated techniques to overcome the issues and to open the opportunity to expand the business in India.",
