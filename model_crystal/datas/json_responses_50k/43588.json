    "summary": "A highly motivated and curious Ph.D. candidate in Astrophysics, at University of Amsterdam. Trying to tackle given problems and find insights based on the scientific method. Interested in Low-Energy Astrophysics and Data Analytics.\n\nMore specifically, my scientific research is mainly focused on the evolution of hierarchical triple-star systems and accretion disks around low mass stars, while I always find myself working on projects where I can apply Data Analysis techniques and draw conclusions from data. Furthermore, I am part of the Trajectory subsystem of SpaceDot, working as a Space Debris Data Analyst within the framework of  \"AcubeSAT\" project under ''Fly your Satellite!\" program, sponsored by ESA.",
