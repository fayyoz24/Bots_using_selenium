    "summary": "My areas of research expertise include contemporary literature (20th \u2013 21st centuries), postcolonial theory, world literature and comparative literature, life writing, Middle East studies, diaspora studies, memory studies, gender studies, and cultural studies. My publications have appeared in various academic platforms such as journals (Journal of Women\u2019s Writing and Journal of Intercultural Studies), academic book series (Routledge) and several blogs (Sanglap: Journal of Literary and Cultural Inquiry & Leeds University Library Blog).\n\nI have worked on various interdisciplinary and collaborative projects. I was the Co-Director for the Women\u2019s Paths Research Group 2017/2018. This project focused on intersectional feminism and activism with a key focus on women from the Global South. In 2019 I attended the Women in Conflict 1325 Fellowship hosted by Beyond Borders Scotland. As a fellow on this programme, I trained in conflict resolution, mediation and dialogue methodologies as part of the UN Security Council 1325 Resolution on the role of women in peacebuilding strategies. Additionally, I was the Administrative Assistant for the Institute of Colonial and Postcolonial Studies (2019 \u2013 2021). I assisted in co-curating and co-designing interdisciplinary research activities/public talks. I was also a LEAP (Leeds Excellence in the Arts Programme) Mentor (2018 \u2013 2021). This role involved supporting undergraduate students to access and participate in research networks within the university as well as organize and coordinate research discussion workshops. Most recently, I was a Research Assistant on the \u2018Iluminating Collections\u2019 project at the University of Leeds (2021). I worked closely with library curators and local women\u2019s organization (MAFWA Theatre) on making medieval illustrated manuscripts accessible for public engagement. I am also a British HEA (Higher Education Academy) Associate Fellow.\n\nI am passionate and committed to working on interdisciplinary projects both within and outside academia. My personal aim as an academic is to bring my critical approaches to engender meaningful change in the community, thus bridging the gap between theory and activism.",
