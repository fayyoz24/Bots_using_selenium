    "summary": "Raised and educated in the Netherlands where marine innovation and sustainability are key values, Joep gained his Masters Degree in Maritime Technology at TU Delft. From there he developed an expertise in energy efficiency and hydrodynamic hull shapes whilst working as a Navel Architect/Designer for a Dutch superyacht design company. During that period, he became increasingly passionate about the combination of luxury and sustainability, and decided to pursue what he saw as a gap in the market. \nTogether with David Czap, he founded Soel Yachts to design and build solar electric boats. The first production model, the SoelCat 12 was unveiled in Auckland, New Zealand in 2016, to praise from the likes of boats.com and Business Insider. Soel Yachts was also nominated for an innovation award at the World Travel and Tourism Council Global Summit 2017. \nThe SoelCat12 is now sailing in the pristine lagoon water of French Polynesia, operated by the Bora Bora Pearl Beach Resort and Spa, who are proud to be the first resort to take eco-tourism to the next level.",

Connections between the EU countries, connections for sharing knowledge between organisations and universities, connections in transport and connecting the world wide grid of energy and gas.\n\nA three day conference for about 100 EYE-members was organised with visits to Dutch Space Leiden, Maasvlakte 2 and the city hall of Rotterdam for an official welcome. Day two was a seminar at Dutch Space Leiden with workshops, lectures and keynotes from Boskalis, Rabobank, Univeriteit Leiden, just to name few. Day three was about cultural visit in Rotterdam were the conference was based.\n\nUnder the wings of KIVI NIRIA and Young KIVI we organised the full three day conference with a team of 7.\n",
