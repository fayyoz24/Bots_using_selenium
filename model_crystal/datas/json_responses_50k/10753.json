I believe Intelligence is the foundation of Mother Nature and Creativity is entangled with it. I become intrigued by fundamental progress. That is why I became an engineer. I am an inquiring mind, a humorous, creative and inspiring thinker, irresistibly drawn to difficult technical product/process performance and reliability issues. By customized training and using science as a tool practically applied in the workplace, sharing experiences and helping engineers learn something new about their own systems every day, we bring out the best in each other and accelerate the innovation rate.",
