By using design thinking methods as the Lean Business Model Canvas, problem- and solution interviews, prototyping and networking activities we tested, validated and rejected some of our assumptions. Eventually, we ended up organizing a successful pilot at De Arentschool in Rotterdam, in collaboration with Lekker Fit (an initiative of the municipality of Rotterdam), the Voedingscentrum and Hogeschool InHolland's PABO and FTC for over 80 primary school children.",
