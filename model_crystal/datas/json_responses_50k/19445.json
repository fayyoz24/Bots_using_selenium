I won the first prize :).\n\nThis resulted in being offered to create my first full-length choreographic work for the Chamber stage of the National Theatre in Belgrade. I suggested to director of ballet Lidija Pilipenko, that I would like to share the evening with a talented colleague Isidora Stanisic. This was the birth of double bill \"Osame' which was for 7 years on the repertory of National Theatre in Belgrade.\n\nThe 10 minute winning piece which opened doors for what today I consider my career, was made in collaboration with dancers Isidora Stanisic and Dusan Muric. My cousin made the costumes and we played Coldcut Ninja Tune mix and Amanda Lear's song 'Follow me' without copyright permissions and distorted by playing the single instead on 45 on 33 turns.

In addition, it called attention to other performance-related events in the city and abroad. Performance Platform was an entirely subjective, but broadly oriented mapping of the performance landscape. More than a user-friendly listing, it opened up existing pathways through the city and invited discovery across the various institutions where (performing) arts took place. Far from attempting an all-encompassing survey of the field, we included performance-related activities that have captured our imagination: mainly in Amsterdam \u2013 to strengthen the local scene \u2013 but also elsewhere in the world through our picks and recommendations.\nWe drew attention to the things that are already here, close-by, but which are perhaps overlooked, inconspicuous or as yet unnoticed. Every month a new landscape of artistic activity arose; full of not-yet-visible links and possible interconnections, new perspectives, viewpoints and secret gardens.\n\nThe platform contents were curated by the editorial board of Barbara van Lindt, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Bergholtz, Nicole Beutler, Bojana Mladenovic and later joined by Anne Breure. In last phase we invited a completely new editorial board consisting of a new generation of perfromance makers, thinker and curators: Annick Kleizen, Simon Assencio, Marjolein Vogels, Maria Roessler and Isobel Dryburgh.",

It was one of the rare places (out of 23 production houses in the Netherlands) that managed to secure both local (Municipality of Amsterdam) and national (Fonds Podiumkunsten) structural support onwards.\nFurther, in this period the house joined the Culture Europe supported network Life Long Burning as well as established a large number of local and international partnerships and collaborations.\n\nHitherto locally oriented and somewhat quiet in its presence in the filed, within four years the house became a vibrant gathering place for art students, visual artists, critical thinkers, performers, it became a household name within the European progressive performing arts venues and festivals scene, while maintaining serious efforts to open its doors for its neighbourhood and its surrounding community.",

The conference attempted to investigate if this is exclusively a local problem, or is it also a symptom of the precarious conditions for artists in other European capitals?\n\nBER-AMS-BXL was a collaboration and co-production between three Amsterdam-based organizations: Het Veem Theater, Flemish Arts Centre De Brakke Grond and the Theatre and Dance research group at de Theaterschool, Amsterdam. Supported by Goethe Institut, HZT Berlin, Amsterdam\u2019s School for New Dance Development (SNDO) and Amsterdam Master of Choreography (AMCh). BER-AMS-BXL events - The Performance Situation Room and Critical Practice - at Het Veem Theater were part of the Life Long Burning (LLB) project, supported by the Culture Programme of the European Union. The conference was promoted by the Nederlands Theater Festival 2013.\nCurated by Marijke Hoogenboom, Piet Menu, Tom Rummens and Bojana Mladenovi\u0107 with grateful thanks to Gabri\u00ebl Smeets, Jeroen Fabius, Barbara van Lindt and Loes van der Pligt.",
