    "summary": "My passion is to learn and share my knowledge with others so that they can achieve their goals. I believe that having a deep and detailed understanding of any complex problem is key to solve it successfully and in the best possible way. Having the chance to learn new concepts and tools is what pushed me to live in four countries, to start a PhD in applied mathematics and then to work in a scientific-oriented IT company.\n\nWhat I like the most is to draw on my experience in mathematical modelling and my coding skills to help others running a large computational model on a computer cluster or extract useful information from a large data set.\n\nMy key strengths are:\n- Background in applied mathematics, with a focus on the implementation of numerical methods; \n- Experience with build-and-test pipelines in software development and cloud technologies;\n- Curious mindset, confidence when facing new challenges and a self-learning attitude.",

Reduced order model (Reduced basis techniques) is a method for reduce the computational cost, and consequently the computing time, of physical simulation but preserving the accuracy of the solution. Hence, such technique is of high interest for engineers who want reliable computations within reasonable time. \n\nMultiscale numerical methods are used for simulating physical states in which two (or more) length scales are present; typical examples are the simulation of ground and reservoir for petroleum engineering and water infiltrations, but they can also be applied in the study of man-made materials such as composite materials. Multiscale method are used for avoiding to resolve the model at the small scale (which would be computationally unfeasible due to the number of variables) without totally disregarding of small scale effects. \n\nIn this project I studied how to apply the reduced basis technique to a multiscale problem in order to take advantage of both of them. These methods are implemented in MATLAB.",

We developed a FVM simulation of the phenomenon for showing the mixing of two fluids when gravity did not play a role. Besides this, we provided a mathematical model for capturing the effect of bubbles in the fluid mixing and adapted our simulation to this second model. ",

Due to the presence of convection, the numerical method in unstable for insufficiently small elements, so a stabilization technique was implemented. The code was implemented in FreeFem++.\n\nThe third implementation was used to solve a time-dependent equation, the heat equation with constant parameters.

Therefore, multiscale models and numerical methods represent the only way to simulate the behaviour of multiscale media and, in the past decades, many researches addressed different aspects of multiscale modelling. \n\nSome multiscale methods are based on an \"upscaling\" approach to compute effective properties from microscopic structures. The computational cost of the upscaling step increases with the required accuracy.\n\nWith my research, I developed a new upscaling paradigm, which dramatically reduces the computational cost compared to other well-established techniques.\nThe results of my research are reported in three scientific publications, as well as my PhD thesis.",

The aim of our research was to study under which conditions thrombosis can arise, in order to provide doctors with a tool for preventing it in patients. Moreover, a optimization of the simulation was necessary, in order to cut the computation times up to 90%.\n\nThe task required a deep knowledge of mathematical modeling for (bio-)physical processes, mathematical analysis and numerical methods for solving sets of PDEs. \n\n- mathematical modeling of chemical reactions in blood\n- developing alternatives for modeling the clot growth\n- implementation in COMSOL\n- optimization of the simulation in order to reduce the computation times",
