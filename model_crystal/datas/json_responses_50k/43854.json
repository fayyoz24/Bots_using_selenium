    "summary": "Currently, I am an Artificial Intelligence student at the VU Amsterdam in the third year of my study. \n\nI am currently the vice-chair of the USR (University Student Council) of my university where I mostly focus on team management, work overview, training and professionalisation (including evaluation) of the council as well as sustainability (especially in relation to the impacts of animal agriculture). I am also a support portfolio holder in Research and Education as well as Public Relations and Internationalisation. \n\nI also work as a Teaching Assistant at my university where I give tutorials and classes to students from years below me in the subjects I am most passionate about. This consists of preparing classes as well as presentation and explanation skills for problem solving oriented exercises in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\nLast year, I was the chair of the communication committee in the student council of the science faculty at my university, where apart from making sure other committee members stay motivated and bringing new ideas to the table I mostly focused on work regarding student contact/feedback such as polls and questionnaires and opinions as well as event organization or international student support. As a part of my position I was also the Ambassador of the Green Office VU where I worked as a liaison between them and my faculty as well as helped them with generating new ideas or projects to work on to improve the sustainability of the university. \n\nPreviously I have been a member of scouting organizations for over 6 years where for a major part of this I took leadership roles. I have also worked as a mathematics tutor for various age groups (from primary school to high school) over the years as a side job to financially support my study. I am highly motivated and easily adaptable to change, as I dedicate my efforts to making the world a better place not just for humans, but for the rest of its inhabitants which is my main driving force. For that reason, my passion for what I do grows stronger every day becoming my great asset.\n\nI have obtained education across multiple different systems in Poland, The UK and the Netherlands allowing me to have a broader international perspective on the current state of European academia.\n\nI spend a lot of my free time looking for ways to engage in animal activism as well as actively working on my personal lifestyle to minimize my environmental footprint, as well as cooking, gardening and  searching for alternative ways to improve my local community.",
