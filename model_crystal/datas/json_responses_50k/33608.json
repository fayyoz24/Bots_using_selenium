Successful research has been conducted in many countries all over the world for a broad range of (Dutch) companies since 1990. Each year, a project group is formed by 18 internationally oriented students from the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam. In July 2014 the IRP has conducted research in Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru and Brazil. More information: www.irp-maa.nl\n\nAs chairman of this project my responsibilities were amongst others leading and motivating the team. With the board, we successfully professionalized the process previous to the field research, by adding different marketing resources, organizing a seminar in cooperation with Netherlands Enterprise Agency, and developing a collaboration project with Latin American students.\n\nI conducted research for a Dutch process supplier that manufactures high-end tooling and parts primarily for Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the automotive industry. The research consisted of an extended analysis of the automotive supply chain in Brazil and Mexico and provided insights into the opportunities, pitfalls and potentials for the Dutch process supplier concerning these countries.",
