College Utrecht. I started this initiative as part of my Law Track Representative duties at the College, where Diana and I realized that the lack of continuity in teaching legal skills, writing, and methodogy is lacking in the department. Therefore I researched, wrote, and edited two student guides on 1) legal writing and guidelines on course-specific assignments and 2) an introduction to legal methodologies. These guidebooks are on track to be published for student use in 2022. I earned a 7.5 ECTs for this internship with a grade of A.",

As part of my duties, I successfully appealed to the Law Fellow and Cluster Chair (a professor who oversees certain Fellows, including the legal one) to make concrete plans on improving the Introduction to Law (UCSSCLAW12) and International Law (UCSSCLAW22) courses after integrating student feedback. I also wrote guidebooks for law students based on their feedback that strongly recommended more information on legal writing and methodology, which became an academic internship (see above).",

University College Utrecht has campus-living as one of its requirements for first- and second-year students as an integral part of our education. However, I came to find out that, due to complex legal maneuvers on the municipal level, students do not have formal contractual rights with the landlord company and no official document that secures their rights either. I contacted the Campus Affairs Representatives (a student organization of UCU that specializes in campus affairs) and the College's Managerial Board (including the Dean and Managing Director), and we made a team of student volunteers to draft a contract between the students and College to secure the College's advocation of our rental rights. This was approved by the Utrecht University legal team and implemented as of August 2022.",
