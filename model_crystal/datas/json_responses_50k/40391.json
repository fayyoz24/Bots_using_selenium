    "summary": "Hello! I started working as Software developer in the Delta1 Team at Optiver, Amsterdam right after graduation. I am pretty new to the trading world and its really fun and exciting working in this domain. \n\nI graduated with a major (with honors) in Computer Science and a minor in Electrical from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2020.  I submitted papers on \"Bifocal attention for Question Generation\" and \"Numerical Question Answering\" from paragraphs to top tier conferences in NLP as a part of my Batchelor Thesis under the guidance of Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan. My interests back in the college were inclined towards NLP and Computer Vision. I also did explore other diverse fields like Block Chain and Web mining too.",

Used background subtraction algorithms like Rolling Ball Algorithm for efficient detection of background, employed clustering algorithms like K-mean and DBScan for noise removal in result.\n3.  Made the prototype more robust by choosing multiple backgrounds depending on color of stones in jewel and finally mined existing data to convert found area into total weight of stone.\n4.   Implemented a testing framework for the application and improved the overall build and infrastructure of the prototype, achieving an accuracy up to 80% \n5.  Used AWS S3 for raw image storage and deployed the prototype as a web API using Node.JS framework on an AWS EC2 instance.",
