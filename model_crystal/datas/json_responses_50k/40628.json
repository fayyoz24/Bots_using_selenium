    "summary": "I'm a student at the CBS International Business school, currently pursuing a B.A. in International Business, with a Management Consulting major. I'm in the 6th, and final, semester of my studies, whilst also doing a \"Double Degree\"-program at the Fontys University of Science, allowing me to receive a Bachelor of Applied Science in International Business as well.\n\nI was born, lived, and studied in Cologne, and am now living in Eindhoven for my semester abroad.\n\nTo describe myself, I would say that I am a very driven and ambitious person. I have high standards for the work I do and want to use my potential to the highest degree possible. Learning and understanding new concepts is exciting to me, and I like to challenge myself. If I find something that fascinates me, it sparks my desire to fully comprehend and master it, in business, as well as privately. Additionally, I enjoy working with people from different backgrounds and ideas, the various perspectives on working inspire me to think \"outside the box\" and find innovative new ways to improve the project I'm working on, myself, and the people I'm working with. This is also the reason I study in an international context and hope to work in different countries in the future.\n\n\nMy affinity for problem-solving eventually led me to discover my passion for\nconsulting, which I then decided to specialize in. The steep learning curve is something that immediately intrigued me, as well as discovering the various ways you can approach consulting problems. I enjoy learning about different aspects of businesses, and how they interact with each other, to fully understand them. Additionally, using different perspectives to examine a problem and being able to distinguish between more or less effective and efficient ways of solving the said problem, is fascinating to me. Ultimately, I want to contribute to sustainable improvement in the companies I work with and provide creative and efficient ways to aid in the achievement of the client's goals.\n\nOther fields in the Business Context are also very intriguing to me, especially the HR field, because of the high impact you can have on the different stakeholders of a company, not just financially. I was closely considering HR as my major, and even though I finally decided on consulting, I hope to eventually work in this field too, be it in connection with consulting, or not.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy doing all kinds of different things in my free time. Sport is a big part of my life, I enjoy drawing and painting, growing different plants, cooking, and many other things.",
