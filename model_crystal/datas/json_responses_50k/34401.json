    "summary": "I am an Assistant Professor of English Literature at Radboud University Nijmegen (Department of Modern Languages & Cultures). My research interests include theatrical engagements with Brexit and the European project, Irish drama, postcolonial cultural memory, national identity formation, and modernist poetry. \n\nI was awarded the 2015 Irish Society for Theatre Research (ISTR) New Scholars' Prize for my research on postcolonial mythological plays, and in April 2017, I received my PhD (cum laude) for a thesis on cultural memory and national identity formation at the Dublin Gate Theatre. I was the Assistant Director of the NWO-funded Gate Theatre Research Network (2018-2021) and the recipient of the 2017 Education Award for Best Junior Lecturer in the Faculty of Arts at Radboud University. In February/March 2018, I held a Visiting Research Fellowship at the Moore Institute (National University of Ireland, Galway).\n\nMy book 'Avant-Garde Nationalism at the Dublin Gate Theatre, 1928-1940' was published by Syracuse University Press ( https://press.syr.edu/supressbooks/3470/avant-garde-nationalism-at-the-dublin-gate-theatre-1928-1940/ ) in 2021. In 2023, I received the RICH Outstanding Research Award.\n\nhttp://www.ruudvandenbeuken.nl (Dutch)",
