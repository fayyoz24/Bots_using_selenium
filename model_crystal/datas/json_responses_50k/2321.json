    "summary": "After having graduated at the KU Leuven I quickly found a job as employee proces control at Action. Here I have learned how to work with the logistical software of SAP. Furthermore I managed to gain firsthand experience in working with logistical procedures that affect shops all over Europe.\n\nCurrently working for the national Dutch statistical office. First as a planner for the data collection department and now as a statistical specialist for the international trade in services department.\n\nBecause of my first study I still have an interest in public administration, politics, journalism, education, EU-related institutions/companies and history. I hope to combine both my current working experiences and international background in my work. Furthermore I have an interest in PR and how a message can and should be transmitted to a certain target audience.\n",
