    "summary": "Put simply. I design and manage video content systems that build a flow of inbound leads to businesses. It\u2019s been a long road to get here though. (Literally.. 18,105 km's) \n\nWhen I was 22, I started my dream job in media production with Paramount, little did I know I was going to quit that job one day.\n\nI learned:\n\n1. How to produce international television shows\n2. How to create and streamline content systems\n3. What made enterprise-level clients successful (Sony, Netflix, Amazon)\n\nAnd yet somehow, after working with the best in the world for five years. I felt compelled to find a new challenge.\n\nEveryone told me creative agencies were tough. \n\n\u201cIf you can make it in an agency, you can make it anywhere,\u201d They said.\n\nIt just so happened, they were right.\n\nI learned:\n\n1. How creative agencies produced social media content\n2. How the next generation of content production at scale was finally here.\n3. \u2026 And no matter how hard I worked for clients like Heineken and Mentos. Driving impact and change as one person was not possible.\n\nI knew what needed to be done.\n\nI traveled from Amsterdam to Auckland in search of businesses to help grow.\n\nBusinesses that I can drive effective change directly with the enterprise knowledge I had learned.\n\nAfter producing content for the best in the world\u2026\n\nMaking results-based video content with businesses is simple.\n\nIf you want to become as well known as you deserve. DM me.\n\nI got you.",
