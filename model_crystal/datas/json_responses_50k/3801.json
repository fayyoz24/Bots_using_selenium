Didn't we rush headlong into a common currency without stopping to concider the consequences? We have come to realize that some of the members are unable to meet the EU's financial obligations. Many people are predicting the end of the euro. An uncertain and turbulent future awaits each of the member states. Desintegration is perhaps a more likely prospect than political union.\n\nThese uncertainties sparked the series of works titled Circus Europe, which were created by Machteld van Buren in 2012. These eight collages illustrate how the struggle for survival is being waged in various European countries. Each country is depicted as an animal: the body consists of a map onto which the realistic head of an animal has been superimposed. The juggling acts which these animals have to perform to keep themselves going are indicative of how each nation functions. But just how the stunts work is not entirely clear.\n\nEach year Machteld van Buren wil create new collages. The aim is to have at least one exhibition per year in an EU country. Local poets will be invited by Peter van Lier to give a reaction on one of the new collages, making sure to include an image of Europe's future. Every two year a book will be published with the new images and poems.\n\nRather than leaving it to politicians to define the Europe of today and tomorrow, it is good to have artists depict it as well. Given the tone of the debate, alternatives with a playful or visionary element might actually be quite useful. So let the fun begin: 'Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to Circus Europe!'\n\nFor more information about this project see: www.circus-europe.blogspot.nl",
