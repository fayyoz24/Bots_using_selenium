Ever since, it has been the main project of ISN Leiden and one of the biggest expat event in the area of Leiden and The Hague. Each year, the event attracts hundreds of participants, both students and people from the local community.\n\nThe event was organized by an 8-members committee. As ISN representative in the committee, it was my responsibility to oversee every aspect of the project, in close collaboration with the President. This included: communicating with local businesses for sponsorships, contacting promotion channels to boost awareness of the event, mediating with venues for the festival and the fundraisers, managing logistic aspects of the event and coordinating more than 20 country teams together with guest performers.",
