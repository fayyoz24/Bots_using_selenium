    "summary": "Science is an idea, a framework for creating knowledge, a social utility, a worldview, and an active element of human society and culture. It is energizing and enlightening but by no means infallible. In all that complexity, there is certainly a lot to explore. Furthermore, the need for knowledgeable science communicators is at an all time high, and I desire to fill that niche. \n\nI seek to apply my historical understanding of the history of science into debates on science, technology, and society that draw parallels to our present predicaments. Wish me luck or join the ride, because I'm definitely out to do some good.",

Focused at the intersection of history of science, technology, and science & technology studies, SATFUTURE employs concepts of sociotechnical imaginaries and visioneering to showcase how the communication of the future shapes the way technologies are developed and utilized. It asks: How have expectations shaped the development of past satellite infrastructures? In what ways were these expectations incorporated into the final product? And how have these expectations changed over time?\n\nSATFUTURE will contribute to understanding Europe\u2019s history in space by looking back to two of the European Space Agency\u2019s first satellite infrastructures: Meteosat, for meteorology, and the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS), for Earth observation. These two case studies offer a unique opportunity to reflect on where Europe\u2019s expectations of space infrastructures once were, and where they stand today. \n\nSATFUTURE aims to analyze how expectations, packaged in satellite futures, shaped Europe\u2019s first satellite infrastructures. Examining these satellite futures provides a powerful means of understanding the forces that shaped our satellite infrastructures to this point, and how we are transcribing our expectations of the future onto the technologies of today.",

I've approached my study of the history and philosophy of science very practically, always striving to find histories with stories relevant to modern challenges. \n\nAdditionally, I have taken multiple courses in science communication, investigative journalism, and STS (Science, Techology, Society), as a historical and modern understanding of science will best prepare me to speak to scientific practice with greater authority. I'm still on this journey, but there is ample room for more knowledge in the old noggin'.",

The NASA History Division, part of the larger Office of Communication, is composed of historians and archivists stationed at each of the NASA facilities that work to preserve, study, publish and share NASA\u2019s history.\n\nMy main task was daily management of the @NASAHistory social media accounts, researching and creating content for Flickr (17K followers), Twitter (887K), and Facebook (2.3M).\n\u00b7 https://twitter.com/NASAHistory\n\u00b7 https://www.facebook.com/NASAHistoryOffice/\n\u00b7 https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/\n\nI strove to provide the necessary context and relevance to make the posts more valuable than just pretty pictures (which sometimes were a-ok). This took time to learn, and by the end of the internship, engagement metrics showed I was trending in the right direction. \n\nThe Apollo 12 50th anniversary (Nov. 14th-24th) took place during my tenure, and I led the charge in curating #Apollo12 content, including a featured article in NASA's quarterly newsletter titled \u201cApollo 12: Why Don\u2019t You Know Me? You Should.\u201d (Attached below)\n\nOverall, I developed firsthand experience in the collaborative realm of professional public communication, from assisting NASA\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs with promotional events on the Hill to participating in the production of professional history books. I engaged in production meetings, manuscript reviews, and image selection, seeing how these books were made, start to finish. This meant I read a lot, and I developed a foundation of space history knowledge beyond the main highlights.\n\nUpon the internship's conclusion in mid-December, I returned to Utrecht to complete writing my thesis, using material I gathered throughout my time contributing to NASA History.",

The value of a positive and collaborative team is immense!\n\nI supervised 13 professional staff and student employees who assisted in incoming transcript evaluations, course equivalencies, grade changes, document imaging, and outgoing transcript orders. I had to ensure all of this happened in accordance with Federal, State, and University regulations, but it didn't stop there! I had to become the Subject Matter Expert for FERPA Laws, accreditation standards, transfer guidelines, the OnBase ECM Imaging software, and a variety of specific forms on Ellucian's Banner software.\n\nBy the time I left, I had done all of the above, along with acting as the project manager for the initial   implementation of e-transcripts, streamlining processes between advising and records, and participating in hiring committees that interviewed and selected over 10 new employees. I genuinely enjoyed my time at UCO.\n\nI also took a Documentary Film making course on my lunch breaks that sparked my hobby in video production. Go Bronchos!",

Turns out it was interesting work, and I kept coming back, joining the propagation team every summer for 10 more seasons, 2000-2009 and again following my return from Taiwan in 2012.\n\nEvery year, I assisted in growing over 300,000 propagules of nearly 400 different species via softwood cuttings, seedlings, and grafting, while acting as additional support in maintaining the greenhouses through weeding, pest management, soil creation, and irrigation repairs. \n\nI take pride in knowing I helped bring millions of new organisms into the world, and I learned a valuable skill in the process!",
