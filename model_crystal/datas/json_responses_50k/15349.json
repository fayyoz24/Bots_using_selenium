    "summary": "What if we could develop the next-generation of cyber-physical systems with all the bells and whistles faster and more cost-effectively than the previous, while still ensuring that they work correctly? Well, the truth is that industrial cyber-physical systems, such as lithography machines, x-ray machines, production printers, radars, and cars, are getting increasingly complex and difficult to efficiently design, implement, and evolve. Addressing this complexity through new design methodologies has been the common denominator throughout my research career, spanning almost two decades and including both fundamental research in academia and applied research in the Dutch high-tech systems industry. \n\nI believe that model-based design methodologies are key to addressing complexity and have many years of experience modelling hardware and software at different levels of abstraction and in a variety of formalisms and use them to generate artifacts, such as code or documentation, or analyze and optimize non-functional properties of systems, such as timing behavior or energy consumption. I enjoy the puzzle of looking at industry challenges, and defining and leading the research needed to address them through a combination of fundamental and applied research projects and programs. I also love working with people and organizations to sustainably embed the developed knowledge and technology, both in industry and academia, turning research results into impact and managing complexity step by step.",

            "description": "Cyber-physical systems often have long life-times and need to continuously evolve to reduce the risks and costs of infrequent big upgrades. Service-oriented architectures are an important enabler for this, since service interfaces decouple services from their implementations and allow implementations to be modified or added, as long as they are compliant with the interface. However, when the service interfaces themselves need to be updated to enable new features or reduce technical debt. The problem is that changing an interface may cause all service implementations to simultaneously become incompatible and stop working. Currently, all incompatible implementations would have to be manually updated, integrated, and verified, which is time consuming and costly. \n\nThe DYNAMICS project studies how to automatically detect whether a change to an interface is backwards compatible in terms of both structure and behavior, and if this is not the case, semi-automatically generate adapters that bridge the differences with previous versions. The benefit of this approach is that it reduces the time and cost of interface updates, allowing them to evolve faster and avoid creative workarounds that ultimately lead to unreliable systems and lower software quality.",

The tool is based on the DRAM power model developed jointly by the Computer Engineering Research Group at TU Delft and the Electronic Systems Group at TU Eindhoven and verified by the Microelectronic System Design Research Group at TU Kaiserslautern with equivalent circuit-level simulations. The tool supports all basic DRAM memory operations including read, write, refresh, activate, precharge and auto-precharge, besides active and precharged power-down and self-refresh modes. The current version of the tool is v2.0 and was released on 14th March 2013. The tool can be downloaded at: www.drampower.info",

            "description": "The partner company is active in the defense domain and designs and manufactures highly valuable products, which means that building prototypes and testing them is extremely costly The matter is further complicated by the large number of possible system configurations that can be envisaged, since customers need to know what configuration best suits their requirements now and going into the future. Testing the many possible configurations using physical prototypes is prohibitively expensive and time consuming.\n\nThe PROGNOSIS project addressed this problem by proposing a model-based virtual prototyping environment based on a domain-specific language (DSL) eco-system for specification, and tooling for simulation and visualization of different system configurations. The main impact of the project was that it contributed to acceptance and adoption of virtual prototyping within the partner company. It also supported an informed discussion about DSL-based development in the company by gathering relevant knowledge and disseminating it at all levels within the organization.",
