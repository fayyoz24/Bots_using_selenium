    "summary": "Growing up in Germany, I attended an international school and discovered my interest in cultures. Wanting to continue studying in an international environment, I chose the study programme International Business. My studies enabled me to interact with people from all around the world, broadening my intercultural understanding.\n\nBesides holding an interest in cultures I enjoy tackling challenges, which is why I began learning Mandarin as my fourth language and Croatian as my fifth language. My belief in the importance of personal and professional development made me join the Honours Talent Programme, where I engaged in various lectures, seminars, and activities that furthened both.",
