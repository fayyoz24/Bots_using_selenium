The HU students from the International Business programme help high school students in South Africa to develop business plans. All students are encouraged to share their different perspectives across cultures. The main objective is to create a business plan and present it to judges from the community.\n\nAs a HU student who participated in the project, I can confidently say that the YEP project was\u00a0an excellent opportunity\u00a0to learn and grow professionally and personally. Throughout the project, I met many\u00a0fantastic people. We shared\u00a0our expertise and contributed to the well-being of a community in need.\n\nFor me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape your intercultural sensitivity, challenge yourself, and step outside of your comfort zone by learning a lot about business methods, cooperation, other cultures, and entertainingly applying your current knowledge.\n\nI worked flawlessly with my fellow mentor Odi Chadinha (my South African project partner) and guided a team of 9 girls from Nigel Secondary School. We were fortunate to have such a dedicated, diligent, curious, and creative team. We spoke about projects and personal\u00a0topics, and I learned about their\u00a0society, a way of life, and, most significantly, how to make business theory enjoyable and accessible to everyone. The more time we spent together, the lower our barriers were and the closer we became.\n\nI truly recommend this project. My advice is to trust the process and find the best wait to organize and operate the team regarding cultural differences, goals, vision and mission. You can only learn by practice.",
