After 3 years I obtained a personal grant, VENI (250.000 euros from Dutch Science Ministry) to head and finance my own project.\n\nA large part of my work at the Interface Physics group has been devoted to the development and construction of the high pressure scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This custom made STM is unique in the world since it is designed to study the surface of operando catalysts at the atomic scale while reaction takes place. In this way we can correlate the structural changes on the surface of the catalyst with the gas composition and formation of reaction products, gaining insight into the mechanisms that govern the reaction. \n\nMy research has mainly been focused on the industrially relevant Fischer-Tropsch reaction. From this reaction we can obtain linear hydrocarbons (e.g. octanes or fuel) from a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a cobalt catalyst. We have recently discovered that on a cobalt single crystal surface, long hydrocarbons (length circa 14 C atoms long) accumulate on the surface, increasing the surface coverage with time. When the concentration of the molecules is high enough (fraction of a monolayer), these molecules self assemble forming a stripped pattern that covers the surface completely. In terms of the Savatier principle, this may have a positive effect on the catalytic activity since the newly created molecules will find it \"easier\" to desorb from the surface covered with a close packed monolayer of tetradecane molecules than from the bare metallic surface.",
