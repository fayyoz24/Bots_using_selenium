    "summary": "Development Professional, Ben Kalkman, has accumulated extensive international experience spanning Europe, South America, Scandinavia and, in particular, Africa. \n\nHis personal interest in hiring, training and coaching of staff to build organisations from scratch under challenging circumstances has yielded unprecedented transformations.  Kalkman\u2019s determination and expertise achieves results, often against all odds, tribal rivalry, and corruption. \nUnwavering belief in upholding the western values he grew up with has enabled Kalkman to continue working in areas where the plight of people calls for urgent improvement. He affirms that teaching skills engender fundamental change and well-being. By offering tools and education to stimulate the right mind-set in his staff and co-workers, real, sustainable development in a country is possible, be it radical or seemingly small. His aim at all times is to leave behind a functioning company. Leading by example, he gives the loyalty and dedication he expects from others.\n\nTwenty years as a career expatriate at ABN AMRO opened paths to disparate corners of the globe, from primitive trappings in Ecuador and Paraguay to state-of-the-art environments in Sweden and the UK. A deeply rooted love of history and languages has instilled in Kalkman the importance of intercultural knowledge and communication with people at varying levels of rank, status and education, and from all walks of life. He deems a profound understanding of people, their traditions and modes of interaction equally imperative when engaging in negotiations focused on mutual satisfaction. \n\nBen Kalkman holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Civil Law (LLM) from Leiden University, the Netherlands. Aside from his native Dutch, he is fluent in English, Spanish and Swedish, with professional working knowledge in French and German. A connector by nature, he has established and maintains an impressive international network of people he has met and worked with throughout his career.\n",

Crucial as it is for the running of the daily operations, the real challenge lies in the preparation for the establishment of the very first bottling plant in this country (the world's newest). The challenges are quite serious, with an economic depression due to the civil war and the falling oil prices. There is virtually no import facilitation due to the lack of dollars, and business is fading rapidly as a result of the political deadlock and the economic crisis; only the serious investors remain.
