    "summary": "I am an award-winning science communicator, an enthusiastic speaker and event moderator, a PhD candidate, and Marketing Associate at BioLizard. My missions are to improve public understanding of science and to support women in science. Alongside my doctoral research (which focuses on the role of autophagy - the recycling system of our cells - in protecting humans from viruses), I am active in the worlds of science communication and empowering women in science. As the writer and creator of \"Microbial Mondays\", a blog that aims to improve public understanding of microbiology, I have published over a hundred articles and award-winning short videos that explain biological concepts in jargon-free language. I am also a junior ambassador for TOPX, a network and training platform for ambitious women in Life Sciences, where my tasks include speaking and moderating at live and online events, and writing career articles relevant for the TOPX community of women in science.",
