    "summary": "In the past years I gained a lot of interest and experience in SAP HCM and SuccessFactors Employee Central. First as an intensive user and currently as a senior consultant. My main focus is Time Management next to Payroll, Organisational Management and Personnel Administration. \n\nIn addition to the technical experience in SAP HCM and SuccessFactors, I also have managerial experience gathered as team leader and test lead at NorthgateArinso in Budapest, Hungary. In this position I had supervision over 5-10 advisors located in Budapest and in satellite offices in Moscow and Tel Aviv. With the team I was responsible for the HR and Payroll administration in upto 24 EMEA countries.\n\nWith my hands-on experience as SAP HR consultant, my management skills and my technical and analytical background as Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering, the position as SAP consultant is particularly relevant to my interest and experience. The knowledge that I gained in these 3 disciplines is a good basis for a further growth in my career as SAP consultant.",

One of the defined methods was worked out in more detail during the master thesis project. The research entailed the introduction of a polythene covering film on the glass fibre prepreg material that is used in the production of Glare panels for the Airbus A380. Together with the introduction of the film, a security system had to be developed to prevent film inclusions in the Glare laminate.",
