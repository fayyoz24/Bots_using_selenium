To learn about our career management services, please check my Barrett Group profile below or visit our website https://www.careerchange.com/eu/. \n\nLeading The Barrett Group Europe enables me to combine my passion for coaching and helping executives with their career transitions in a more proactive way. \n\nI help people to fulfill their potential based on how I\u2019ve done it #WinningWithaSmile.\nWorking under stress and pressure, I discovered that there can be a better way to work and to live. When you get a strategy right, a strong teamwork and a disciplined execution, you can actually win with a smile, rather than a stress. \n\nThe strategy is right, when our customers prefer our brand / solutions, when we can keep it unchanged for years and when most of the people can perform well following it. I\u2019m happy to spend on a strategy development 5-10% of my budget, because it means a remaining 90-95% is spent on the right thing.\n\nStrong teamwork is driven by a trust, \u201cus before me\u201d attitude, and an empathy. We all come from different countries and cultures, however, our emotional needs: being heard, respected, and loved are universal, meaning we are more similar than different.\n\nDisciplined execution is a key to whatever we want to achieve in life or at work.  What helps me to achieve my goals, is my Monday morning routine: when I look at them and decide on the next step to take\u2014however small. \n\nLife is too short not to enjoy your work and life. I am passionate about people development, helping them to get to the next level and win with a smile.  #WinningWithaSmile",

That's why we are #1 Career Management Firm in Europe & Middle East.\n\nAs you probably realized by now, landing your desired executive role via the internet is not very likely, because it focuses more on junior roles or jobs are simply posted for compliance reasons, whereas the candidate has already been chosen. \n\nIt\u2019s even less likely to secure your role with traditional recruiters, who could only help you when they have an order on your profile, but most of the time, they don\u2019t.\n\nOur program addresses those challenges with our 5 step proven methodology:\n\n1.\tFirst, We start with the Clarity Program\u00a9 to define the ideal role for you and a realistic career plan, so you can fulfil your potential or build a legacy you are proud of.\n\n2.\tSecond, We help you build your Personal Branding including your resume(s) and LinkedIn profile, demonstrating how your skills are transferable to whatever company or industry we are targeting.\n\n3.\tThird, We help you with the Market Access including published and unpublished jobs. This is where our research team makes a difference having access to millions of executives\u2019 data, helping you to accelerate the whole process.\n\n4.\tFourth, once you secure Interviews, we help you to prepare for them and to Negotiate your offer and that\u2019s how our clients recoup our fee, because we typically increase the package by at least 10%.\n\n5.\tFinally, we will help with your Onboarding to ensure you are successful from the very beginning in a new role.\n\nIf you think this process would be valuable in your situation, please connect with me on LinkedIn to explore it further.",

It was a combination of making the global innovations highly desirable by local consumers via localized communication, and a superior execution in online and offline retail.\n\nInterestingly enough, we achieved that with the existing teams, however mostly middle management, who was promoted to the top management roles. This is a good example that most of people can perform well if the strategy is right. \n\nThis is also when I developed my coaching program on \"How to build your business, your team and yourself\", which I shared with tens of team members in Bucharest, Prague and Warsaw over four years.

It was very rewarding to able to work with R&D to define the product innovation roadmap, matching the local consumer needs in the best possible way and then to develop a campaign based local insights that would \"wow\" consumers. \nThis is a period where I developed most as a marketer:\n- I learnt the power of strategic planning: quantifying your source of business, understanding its barriers and triggers and developing an activation idea before going into communication. The 5% of A&P budget spent of the research was the best invested part, because it ensured that the remaining 95% is working effectively.\n- I also learnt how to buy the best creative work, which is about having the best agency people working for you (Ogilvy in this case), rather than pitching the business too often.\n\nMarketing Director Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, Russia and CIS, based in Moscow, Russia 2006-2009\nMarketing Director Kleenex, Central Eastern Europe, based in Reigate, UK, 2003-2006\nBrand Manager Kleenex, Central Europe, based in Vienna, Austria, 1997-1998",
