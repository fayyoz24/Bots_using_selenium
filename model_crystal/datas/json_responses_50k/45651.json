    "summary": "I feel strongly about personal improvement. I like to think I have excellent communication skills in all levels. I communicate with top-level personal as well as the people on the work-floor. I have no financial or status ambitions, but my desire to improve myself and the love of pressure and responsibility does make me desire the more upper level jobs. I like my current job at which I improve my knowledge about various fields of science. The goal is to obtain a job where I am involved in various projects. I am able to create circumstances and conditions to optimize a team performance. In addition I would ensure that there are no solutions overseen by preventing people to settle to much in their ways and methods, but maintaining enough of the same in order to keep the people comfortable in their work.\n\nSpecialties: Communication, statistic/process analysis, innovation, social structuring. A wide range of Beta knowledge and interest outside of the field of electronics. Creating an excellent base for mechatronics projects.",
