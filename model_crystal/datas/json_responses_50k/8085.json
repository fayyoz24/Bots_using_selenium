My work consisted on helping the communication process between Spanish speaking refugees arriving the United States and the IRC staff.  Along with IRC staff, we visited the refugees at their homes, providing them with anything they need such as food, clothing and home supplies. Furthermore, we assisted them on their legal process of settling down as a refugee in the United States by guiding them and by doing periodic calls and visits during a period of 9 months right after their arrival to the United States of America.
