    "summary": "The road to launching a new product or service can be rocky. Turning your business around into a more customer centric organisation might look like a huge challenge. And the question where to start with often feels overwhelming.\n\nI support companies (and agencies) who want to improve their digital presence and performance, and who need guidance and support with getting things off the ground, set up and running.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last years as entrepreneur, freelancer, and explorer. Explorer of the many possibilities there are out there - be it in terms of jobs, projects, things to learn or places to live; but also of the questions who I am, what I truly enjoy doing and what I can offer to the world. \n\nWhile this of course is a journey of a lifetime, till now it has brought me to realise that I love working for myself but together with others; that the projects that energise me most -and thus I can contribute to most- are those that give me a sense of purpose; that I need nature around me and that I like to mix my week with various activities, projects and people. \n\nAs a \u201cINFP-A mediator\u201d (cf. 16personalities), my personal strength are the vision I can give and keep on a project, the direction and organisation in a team to get towards there, and a good portion of creative solutions on the way when needed. Mostly I apply those in digital marketing and innovation teams. Interim or project based. \n\nWant to collaborate? Send me your message to hello@katrin.mx ",
