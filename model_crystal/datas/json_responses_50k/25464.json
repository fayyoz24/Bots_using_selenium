    "summary": "I research into design for a sustainable future with clean materials. I also co-founded a Dutch eco-brand, Dzukou, which makes and sells lifestyle products made from clean materials with global shipping. In my own company I look over strategy and marketing. The vision is to experiment with eco-materials in future and make breathtakingly refreshing material experiences with daily products. \n\nAs much as I love working on my startup, I love wearing a workshop suit and getting my hands dirty tinkering with products and materials. I strongly believe human centered design for communities, both in the global north and south, is the way to go for a sustainable future.\n\nTrue DIY aficionado. Lover of minimalistic design.",
