After two years I grew into the role of Creative Director, managing the creative team and guarding the essence of Hutspot in everything we do, focusing more on accessibility and local community building, storytelling and sustainability throughout our photography, social media, events, collaborations and merchandise.\n\nRetail design\nThe minimal, yet playful and bright visual identity, I translated into a modular and progressive retail interior system, including subconcepts such as a lunchroom, barber, shop-in-shops, etc. The design is graphic and organic, addressing a wide audience, but specifically resulting in a millennial/gen z, instagrammable and convenient space. Neatly displaying many various products, the retail system also includes options to display campaign images and other marketing exposure.\n\nCollection & e-commerce\nExploring creative opportunities for Hutspot, I developed Hutspot\u2019s own sustainable \u2018never out of stock\u2019 collection, including branding and packaging. Working with agents and factories in Holland, Portugal, Turkey and China, we produced womenswear and menswear (about 50 styles, 150-300 units per season), and homeware, becoming one of the best-selling brands in store with a higher margin. With the collection, we also launched our webshop, for which I directed the website design, e-commerce photography, campaigns and packaging.",
