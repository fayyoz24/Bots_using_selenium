    "summary": "Today\u2019s world is becoming more complex. \n\nParadoxically, we are currently more connected with one another on a scale like never before in terms of technology, travelling and media. Simultaneously and admittedly, there is a rise in political polarisation and social disconnection on a local, national, and international level. I often call myself an institutionalist activist and social sciences nerd, therefore I inevitably enjoy analysing this contemporary paradox. My interdisciplinary academic background (political science, anthropology and urban governance) allows me to analyse the dynamics of today\u2019s complexity. I use different concepts, perspectives, unit of analyses and frameworks. \n\nA human-centred approach in my work is important for me as a bi-cultural queer person. Empathy is one of my main core compatibilities, which I have developed during many years of conducting qualitative research. I have interviewed many voices and lived experiences on topics such as domestic violence and migrant activists in European politics. I carefully listen, therefore I like to connect with people in a personal manner. Not surprisingly, I found myself working on topics of diversity, inclusivity, and politics.",
