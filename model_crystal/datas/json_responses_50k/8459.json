    "summary": "I am a professional IT Director who is driven by client-focused communication and their success. Working with clients is more than meeting a set of goals through standardized processes. It\u2019s about building long-term relationships, being fully trustworthy and reliable, understanding their business needs, and genuinely enjoying working with them regardless of the effort involved. The thrill of exceeding client expectations through solid project management is the core of what energizes me. Clients have told me that I make them feel like my only responsibility when in reality, I manage several accounts at any given time. My goal is to continue to provide clients with that level of dedication. \nI\u2019m a process-driven person who proactively and continuously works to streamline internal processes and the way client-relations are handled through hands-on experience. Improvements can always be learned with each client interaction, and I trust both my project teams\u2019 input and client feedback to work towards better solutions. I believe that having a strong support team with open communication is a large part of what makes projects successful. I focus on building internal trust, empowering colleagues, and achieving full alignment on all processes and documentation to ensure client contracts are successfully executed.\nI have over fifteen years of operations and project management experience within the banking, telecommunication, and software industries. Leadership, problem solving, and excellence in communications resulted in positions of increasing responsibility throughout my career. I\u2019m successful at what I do because of what drives me internally as I'm constantly motivated to be productive whether at work or home. Client relationships and process improvement initiatives are my keys to success in being an operations leader.",
