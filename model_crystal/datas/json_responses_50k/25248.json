    "summary": "After studying the singing voice for 18 years now, I'm highly trained to teach all voice types (including transgender & non-binary voices) for whatever your goals may be! I attained my Masters of Music in Vocal Performance/Pedagogy from Arizona State University, and received certification to teach contemporary vocal styles from Shenandoah Conservatory\u2019s Contemporary Commercial Music (CCM) Vocal Institute. I have a growing voice studio online, and teach most genres, including: classical/opera, musical theatre (correct belting), pop, rock (safe scream/distortion techniques), jazz, R&B, gospel, folk, and choral music.\n\nWith 10 years' experience as a vocal music educator, I've had the opportunity to teach music to a wide range of singers in various settings, including private voice lessons, children\u2019s group classes for voice and piano, directing summer music and Glee! camps, directing youth and adult choirs, teaching elementary general music classes, directing and accompanying service music, vocal directing musical theater productions, and lecturing workshops on vocal pedagogy. I have also enjoyed being part of several operatic & musical theatre productions over the years, playing the roles of: Jack's Mother from \"Into the Woods\" by Stephen Sondheim, Pitti-Sing in \"The Mikado\" by Gilbert & Sullivan, Shirley Kaplan in \"Street Scene\" by Kurt Weill, Belinda in \"Dido & Aeneas\" by Henry Purcell, and recently in 2019 as the Moon Goddess in the Western Premiere of \"The Heart of Oksana\" by living Ukrainian composer, Stefania Turkewich, performed at ASU.\n\nI strive to help my students achieve their current musical goals, such as: get cast in lead/paid roles for musical theater productions, prepare for choir performances and college auditions, qualify for Regional and All-State Choirs at the HS level, or even just to have some fun belting out your favorite karaoke songs for friends without strain! I truly believe that a strong technical foundation not only makes singing in any genre possible, but ensures healthy singing, and speaking, habits for life. I am committed to helping my students find their unique voice, hoping they'll share their music in such a way that brings a positive impact to our stressful lives today!",
