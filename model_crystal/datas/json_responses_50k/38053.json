I had been a part of UNFPA Tokyo Office\u2019s major works on advocacy for Women\u2019s Health, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Youth and Ageing.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have met influential parliamentarians, ministry officials, experts, and women leaders to advocate and lobby for Women\u2019s rights and empowerment, Gender equality, and Universal access to Sexual and Reproductive rights. The most important work I have been involved with so far through UNFPA is in successfully advocating for Women's Leadership and the inclusion of Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights in the Sendai Declaration and Framework, which is post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction, at the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR) held in March 2015 in Japan. I also represented UNFPA in advocating and lobbying for women\u2019s health and empowerment, gender equality, and universal access to sexual and reproductive health at the  International Conference on Universal Health Coverage and the Global Fund Fifth Replenishment Preparatory Meeting held in Japan in December 2015. I hope our work will help bring focus to the issues of Women's rights and improve the lives of women all over the world.",
