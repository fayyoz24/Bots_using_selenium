    "summary": "My greatest wish is that I will be able to provide people with principles that spark collaboration, bring to life their vision of work thus giving them self-fulfillment and pride in the achievement of their goals. My professional experience in the finance industry spans more than a decade, with direct experience and expertise in contract management, and project management, with a strong focus on project deliverables and stakeholder management. Furthermore, my passion and focus on fairness, integrity and quality, coupled with my ability to deliver projects efficiently and effectively have seen me excel within the finance industry. My degree of competency in this area of practice stems from the fact that I am a financial professional with two Bachelor degrees from the Netherlands and Finland with an array of financial experience that covers multiple areas of the banking sector.\n\nI firmly believe in never quitting and instead always endeavouring to find a reasonable solution alongside bringing people together to perform to the best of their abilities; and all with a grounded mindset filled with a structured delivery approach. I put my experience, grit & relentless pursuit of client satisfaction to work at EY, across the EMEIA region.\n\nI\u2019m well-versed in planning, relationship building, removing friction from operations, driving tight schedules, managing trades and growing teams to perform the best to their unknown abilities. \n\nThrough my experience, I have been able to get a clear perspective on both the pros and cons of the different methods employed by my team and I. My various work experiences and knowledge acquired from these experiences put me in a position to accurately provide training to individuals based on a practical approach as well as engaging individuals in discussions. It does not just stop there. My willingness to learn which has always played a part in driving my decisions will ensure that I engage people on discussions regarding their most preferred tactics and results. A holistic approach to work and communication of which everyone benefits from in the long run.",
