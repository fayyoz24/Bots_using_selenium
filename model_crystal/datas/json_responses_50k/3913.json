As a result, we achieved a significant improvement during the deployment of the final business products for two major flagship projects maintained by Baker Hughes.\n\nThe project was realized mainly for facilities in Celle (Germany) and Kochi (India), but they also affected employees at Houston, TX (USA), and Aberdeen (Scotland).\n\nI participated in establishing branch policies, workflow for further contributions and code review processes, as well as helping DevOps teams during refinement compliance agreements before introducing a new system on production. I managed to propose technical solutions on how to migrate History of commitments from TFVC to Git and, finally, prepared knowledge transfer materials and practical exercises to train all engaged employees.\n\nDuring the last \"implementation\" phase, I hosted 3 large workshop sessions (between 4 to 7 hours) - stationary (Germany) and remotely (Kochi / COVID-19) for approx. 120 total number of participants. Workshops were dedicated to share good practices, GitFlow, nomenclature, differences, and similarities between two systems, commands and operations, as well as basic and intermediate Git concepts. Every aspect of the content was covered with live examples, exercises (prepared earlier), and real case scenarios to visualize real strategies and decisions.",

Proxima Majoris is my private non-commercial initiative, combining different aspects of the software development cycle and a neverending deep-diving journey into the process of creation - a hobby, independent PC game.\n\nAbout the game:\n\"Proxima Majoris\" is a survival-horror, science fiction game, settled around base building and storytelling MVP. We are focusing on social interactions between spaceship crew members; forcing the player to make hard, painful choices; making the game overwhelmingly difficult, and offering the player a lot of space novel Sci-Fi stories. The game is stylized to old-school isometric games such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, Fallout, Arcanum, Jagged Alliance 2, and StarCraft, as well as retro movies/cyberpunk animes from the '80s & '90s: The Thing, Alien, Blade Runner, Mad Max, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Armitage III.",
