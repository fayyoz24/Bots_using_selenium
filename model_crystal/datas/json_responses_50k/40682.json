The project was to program a NAO Robot with aldebaran software, some added python image proccessing and speech recognition with python. The NAO Robot when activated will be in an interaction status. Once the NAO recognises a user  with the facial recognition software it will ask \"Are you ready to learn tai chi young one?\". Furthermore it will give a choice in which one on the 5 lessons you would like to do. these lessons require the user to wear a special outfit with different colors on the different body part joints and a white backround. The NAO then could for example show you what to do and then afterwards use its camera to check if your doing the right movement.\nMy role was to program a big part of the Human interaction software. So i programmed which randomised things the NAO said while communicating with the users. ",

This team, \"Steiger tilhulp groep 8\",achieved the following:\n\nA scafholding lifting aid with two main functions:\nAssembly of scafholding\nDisassembly of scafholding\n\nThe Assembly:\nThe scafholding lifting aid will start with the assembly by lifting up 1 level of a scafholding twice its height so that another level can be buildt under it and attached to it. Once it has been attached to it the hooks will slide down with the hindge mechanism. Then it will pick up the scafholding once agiain to twice its height. This procces wil carry on until desired height is reached.\n \n\nThe Disassembly:\nThe scafholding lifting aid will finish off by lifting up x level(s) of a scafholding twice its height so that the bottum level can be disassembled. Once it has been disassembled it will lower the level(s). Then it will release the hooks with help from two servo motors and move up so that it can pick up the scafholding once agiain to twice its height. This enables the bottum part to be disassembled. This procces wil carry on until the entire scafholding has been disassembled.",
