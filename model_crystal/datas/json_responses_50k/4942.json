    "summary": "In the past 25 years in higher education administration, at 7 different higher education institutes (both in The Netherlands and abroad), I have gained experience in many aspects of higher education administration. \n\nI am, however, always eager to learn more, to broaden my horizons and to apply my experience in new surroundings.\n\nI think on my feet, am able to quickly grasp the most important points of the issue at hand, and can zoom in from a helicopter point of view to more detailed levels.\n\nMy main interests within higher education are: quality assurance, internationalization, translating national laws and rules and university regulations to manageable policies and procedures on the shop floor, and the daily contact with students and staff from all over the world.",
