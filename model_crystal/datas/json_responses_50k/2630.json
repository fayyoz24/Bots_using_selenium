    "summary": "I\u2019m a woman of the World\n\nFor the past seventeen years, I have lived and worked in several countries, including the Netherlands Antilles, the Middle and the Far East, Russia, and also closer to home in the Netherlands. \n\nThis has given me a wealth of work and life experience:\n\n\u2022 Through all these different circumstances I have developed a healthy dose of flexibility, so I easily adapt to a \n   new environment.  \n\u2022 I have learned to look at similarities foremost and discover what connects people, regardless of any \n   differences in color, origin, language or culture. Because of this I\u2019m very interested in diversity and inclusive. \n\u2022 I look at things from a broader perspective and love maintaining the overview in complex situations. That is \n   why I have great orzganizational talents.\n\u2022 I love bringing people together focused on a good cause or transfer of knowledge.\n\u2022 I am a positive and enthusiastic person, and therefore a pleasant team player to work with. I combine hard \n  work with cordiality, which makes many appreciate me. \n\u2022 I am ambitious and what I want to achieve is achieved. \n\nFor a job: \nI get very excited about a position where I can organize and build bridges and thus ensure that we are a goal-oriented and collaborative team. Where I can use my qualities: communicating, picking up signals and taking responsibility. I always do this with a smile. \n\nCall me 06-25-210-210 or \nEmail: Ingrid.venner11@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
