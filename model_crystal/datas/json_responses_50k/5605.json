These stories, which were almost all the fruits of fun collaborations with colleagues in different corners of the world, significantly helped me and colleagues in building credibility among key stakeholders within the financial industry.\n\nAdditionally, I was happy to give a voice to the people in Dordrecht who had worked, or were still working, at the Dupont chemical plant.",
