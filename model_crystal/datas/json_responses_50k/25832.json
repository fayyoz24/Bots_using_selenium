Pant\n\nWorked on developing a Matlab code for generating parameters for creating candidate tri-lobed airship envelopes using OLHS design approach. Assuming CFD results for the candidate airship envelopes, I created another script to build a surrogate model for the drag coefficient over the range of parameters used to generate airship envelopes. Furthermore, an optimization technique was carried out on the surrogate model to obtain the parameters that provide the configuration of the envelope which offers the least drag.\nThe codes are to be tested with the actual simulation results.",
