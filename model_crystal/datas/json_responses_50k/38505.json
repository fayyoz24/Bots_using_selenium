    "summary": "To summarize a person is, almost by definition, an impossible task. As impossible as understand a piece, any piece, of reality. And yet that is what we do every other day. \n\nI have trained as a scientist, as a climber and as a diver. I understand that there will be some phenomenon that I will not understand, some mountain that I will not climb, some deep wreck that I will not reach. And yet every day I, with many others, strive to know more, to climb higher, to dive deeper. \n\nPerhaps that drive to walk paths without end is what drives me to function as a data science consultant. Because knowing that I do not posses the truth is knowing that I can get closer to it, and -more important- get my client closer to it too. ",
