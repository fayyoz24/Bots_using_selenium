After all, \u201cListening is Hearing with a Passion\u201d. Doron Zilbershtein. \n\nAs for a quick overview of who I am: \n\n1. I view my life purpose, and what makes\u00a0my life meaningful, is to make a positive impact on the lives of others within my circle of influence. It includes\u00a0family friends\u00a0colleagues and students, to name a few\u00a0examples.\u00a0\n2. I was born\u00a0happy and I spend my life\u00a0seeking opportunities\u00a0to stay happy.\u00a0\nI am a passionate person in both, my\u00a0personal and professional life. I live comfortably in challenging situations. Beware, my passion is contagious! \n\n2. My creative horizons are boundless; I hate Thinking Out of the Box because every box has only six dimensions! I always Think Out of the Sphere! \n\n3. I regard being \u201cAhead of the Curve\u201d as a failure. I prefer to be the one who defines the curve for others to follow rather than one who follows a curve that has been defined by others. \n\n4. I enjoy and thrive on intellectual ping-pong and emotional acrobatics. \n\n5. I feel elated when I share my knowledge and experience through teaching with aspiring young adults.",
