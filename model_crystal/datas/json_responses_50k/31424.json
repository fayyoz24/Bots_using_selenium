    "summary": "As an electrical engineer, I am passionate about research and development in the field of electric mobility and high-voltage technology. My interest was sparked when I came across the research work of Jens Hohloch*, S. Tenbohlen, W. K\u00f6hler \" Measurement of transient pulses on high voltage Automotive power network\", which compels me to explore new technologies and find innovative solutions to industry challenges.\n                                                                       With a Bachelor's in electrical engineering, I started my career in power engineering, but my desire to make a meaningful contribution to the industry led me to pursue a career in electric mobility and high-voltage technology. I am committed to developing new technologies and systems that can make electric vehicles more efficient, affordable, and accessible for everyone.\n                                                              Overall, I am a highly motivated engineer with a keen interest in the future of electric mobility and high-voltage technology. I believe that my skills and knowledge can help shape the industry and contribute to a sustainable future.",

            "description": "The young Indo-Pacific Summit 2022 was organized by ASEF(Asia-Europe Foundation ) in collaboration with Indo pacific forum. As a youth delegate and a panelist at the youth round table, I spoke about the role of different countries in climate change,  carbon credits, and European territories such as Poland, where 93% of the energy is produced using fossil fuels or we can say that its a hub for carbon-intensive companies. Moreover, I also tried to answer the audience's questions and one question I personally like was \"There are some countries, for example, Belarus in which government does not allow any kind of protest related to climate change, so how do youth deal with such kind of situation? In my capacity I tried to answer this question as a youth, we all are connected by a human chain, it doesn't matter where you are living. So whenever you face any criticism from the government side, it's better to discuss your problem with international people working in the same domain, so they can raise your voices on an international platform, and definitely it makes a difference. Moreover, on the 3rd day, I got selected from the climate change panel for policy recommendations where I tried to cover technical parts primarily focused on the use of green data centers for grid stabilization,  the role of green & blue hydrogen, and viable renewable energy transportation to energy deficit regions such as Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Poland. As the outcome of the event, targeted policy paper recommendations were shared with EU Policymakers. In the last, I attended the Higher education Summit and youth summit 2022, where I got an opportunity to discuss the current flaws in targeted climate change policies with the European commission directorate at the round table.",

            "description": "In grid-tied three-phase inverter systems, the design of a proper power conditioning system is an important issue to ensure high-quality power injection to the grid. Among various control methods for a grid-interfacing inverter with an LCL filter, the converter-side current feedback (CCF) method has been widely used due to its inherent resonance damping feature. Applying the CCF method requires extra attention to the delay effect of the control system. In such systems, the delay narrows the stability region of the resonance frequency of the CCF control method, especially, in the presence of wide variations of the grid inductance. Adequate tuning of the LCL filter and consequently, the proper choice of the resonance frequency can remarkably affect the performance of the CCF control. In this project as part of the course Advanced power electronics, a tuning procedure for the LCL filter has been proposed. Mathematical tuning of the Proportional Resonant (PR) controller parameters has also been included to avoid typical trial-and-error procedures of tuning. Simulation of the overall system also includes an LCL filter to model the grid-tied three-phase inverter with the most possible details. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink, and it has been proved that the proposed control system maintains its stability against grid parameter variations.",

This technology combines the benefits and reliefs the land constraints as well as conflicts of interest between energy and food demand.\u200bMy work focused on the development of an Integrated community energy system and the simulation study is exploratory with the outputs of the simulations, the value of different ICES compositions on the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the energy community of Germany is compared. Moreover theoretical calculation of storage size minimum and maximum value can be used to simulate the ICES model. I used this formula to evaluate the values of storage  Energy storage size = daily electrical load * days of autonomy  *  temperature compensation factor / (voltage of battery *  load subsystem efficiency * depth of discharge)\u200b. Furthermore, energy storage SOC versus voltage variation profile is simulated using MATLAB. I got the following concluding remarks after the simulation.\n1) In the peak demand hours (10:00 to 18:00), the electricity storage requirement decreases because solar insolation starts building and reaches a maximum value at 12:00 noon. However, the notable difference that can be observed by upscaling the solar plant capacity (250 GW), is an almost constant electricity storage requirement during off-peak periods. \u200b\n2)Hence, fewer electricity storage requirements during peak hours allow us to provide ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation, black start regulation, and electricity to contingency reserves, to earn profit.\n3)Li-ion batteries (48 V) connecting to the grid characteristics are simulated on MATLAB. They show SOC variation with the voltage. The battery will never be kept at 100% for a longer period as it causes degradation of the batteries. \u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",

Volunteers organized a series of workshops for the local community in Nurmes, Eastern Finland to celebrate the EU Green Week: age groups from kindergarten to seniors.  The idea behind choosing people from the Sustainable engineering domain is to teach farmers about carbon neutrality. Moreover, as a volunteer, I explored farmland in Finland from close quarters and took part in Talkoot's  Finland harvesting festival, and try to impart knowledge through seminars and workshops to farmers about climate change."
