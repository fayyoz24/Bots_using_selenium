Furthermore there have been developments arising from the growing demand for quality, personal care and a declining labor force, which have also changed the demand. There is a growing awareness that the created environment has a positive effect on health, welfare and wellbeing of the residents, health professionals and visitors. As a result, healthcare institutions are forced to become more strategic in their current and future real estate portfolio. In my thesis I have mapped which elements are important in the realization of a strategic housing plan for healthcare institutions. This is partly based on my own observations and conversations with healthcare professionals, property managers and researchers specializing in the created environment and health care. All aspects I then arranged visually in an arrangement plan of a living room.",
