    "summary": "I am currently a master student in Political Science. I have been living in The Hague for five years now. I was born in The Netherlands. After being born in the Netherlands, for five years my family and I moved every 6 to 12 months to places such as Trinidad and Tobago, the Dominican Republic, Singapore, Nigeria, Mauritius, and more countries because of my father\u2019s expat work. I grew up in Rio de Janeiro for most of my life, followed by two years in Mexico City before moving to The Hague to do my bachelor's degree. My goal is to work for an international organization. That is what I hope to achieve with my studies. During my studies I do not want to sit still and that is why I am looking for a job next to my Study.\n\nPeople in my environment describe me as hardworking, independent, and communicative. I easily connect with people, learn quickly and am confident. I find work quickly and can easily motivate myself.",
