DMP-Executive Director Environment Dr Phil Gorey said the project stood out to the selection committee and was a very deserving recipient of the 2015 Golden Gecko Award.\n\nThe Wheatstone micro-tunnel (diameter 2.0m ID / 2.5m OD x 1,250m length) is the first large scale micro-tunnel shore crossing in Australia and within Chevron worldwide and it is the longest pipe-jacked tunnel in the southern hemisphere; it links a 44inch - 225km long offshore gas pipeline to the onshore processing facilities, protecting the coastal area adjacent to the Ashburton River Delta.\n\nOver a 4 year's period, I have contributed to the success of the Wheatstone MicroTunnel from early start (concept selection and feasibility) all the way to construction completion as MicroTunnel Subject Matter Expert (SME) and as Chevron's Upstream Person in Charge (PIC) on Site.
