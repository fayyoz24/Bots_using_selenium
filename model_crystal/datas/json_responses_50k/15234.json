    "summary": "Valerio Fortunati was born in Rome in 1983. After the high school he has started studying Electronic Engineering in the university of Roma Tre in Rome. He graduated 'cum laude' in 2010 presenting his master's project called \"Texture synthesis using local descriptors\". This project has been developed in the University of Groningen(RuG) in the Netherlands during an abroad study period of 8 months.\n\nFor four years he worked as a PhD student in the BIGR group involved in the project: \"Developing tool for Hyperthermia treatment planning\". His work consists on segmentation of the head and neck anatomy to build electromagnetic and thermal models which are needed for Hyperthermia treatment planning and guidance. For his PhD work he received the STW Simon Stevin Gezel of 2016.\n\nHe started working in Quantib in 2015. At the time Quantib was a newly born start-up with the aim of bringing the advancement of research to clinical practice. During his years at Quantib he was involved on development and validation of machine and deep learning methods for automatic processing of volumetric images for various tasks such as brain volumetry and lesion segmentation and quantification, stroke biomarker quantification, prostate segmentation and lesion detection and quantification.",

This project was carried in collaboration with the Hyperthermia Unit of the Erasmus MC Radiotherapy department and was funded by STW technology foundation. \nThe aim of the project was to improve the automated generation of 3D patient model for Hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP). From the image processing point of view two parts can be distinguished:\n- Development an automatic segmentation algorithm for the tissues in the head and neck anatomy which are relevant for HTP. The idea is to integrate magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images to improve the segmentation accuracy and precision to automatically segment these tissues. \n- Development and integration of patient specific thermal model for HTP. MR angiography can be used to generate models for the patient vasculature. Blood perfusion lead to heat dispersion in the patient during the hypethermia treatment. Modeling this effect may have a large improvement on the treatment planning quality.",
