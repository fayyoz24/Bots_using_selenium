    "summary": "A passionate master of food science and technology: Everything I have engaged in so far has been driven by my keen interest in delivering high quality and safe food to consumers. It is this passion that has driven every one of my career decisions. I am motivated by working on setting up systems and standards, developing tools and communicating this to both internal and external stakeholders so we can work on achieving the same goal. In the projects I was involved in at Danone I was able to do this already in the product development phase of projects, making sure to explain the quality and food safety WoW and my opinion seen from a quality and food safety perspective. And do things first time right. \n\nCuriosity and eagerness to find solutions: I am very curios and eager to find solutions to problems. In my role at Danone it has helped in i.e. solving complex issues for factories and on a more global level. In order to be able to take the right, sometimes pragmatic, decision, I see it as a necessity to really understand all aspects of a topic to be able to ask the right questions and find the best suited solution.  \n\nA disciplined mindset. I have a strong work ethic and a dedication to success, and am not easily pushed over by unforeseen bumps on the road. I like things to have structure and take the initiative to create this if necessary. \n\nAs a person I am engaged, have a good spirit and tackle challenges with dedication and a smile. I always strive to learn more an develop my skills. I am culturally understanding, fluent in English and understand and read the Scandinavian languages on a high level. I have lived in Ethiopia, Singapore, Denmark and The Netherlands.\n\nKeywords: QA, Root Cause Analysis, Enzymes, Dairy, Regulatory affairs.\n\n",
