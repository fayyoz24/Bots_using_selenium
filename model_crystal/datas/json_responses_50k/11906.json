Having 20 years of experience solving customers needs with tech products and a professional background in business, machine learning and technology. Nothing recharges my energy like being surrounded by nature; when not trekking or on bike tours, I spend most of my personal time supporting sustainable projects that aim at finding a more balanced way of living.\n\nI get excited about opportunities to create mutually beneficial partnerships that drive growth on both sides of the relationship, specifically in the world of tech/digital.
