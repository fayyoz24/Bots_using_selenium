    "summary": "I have dedicated my career to creating memorable experiences through meaningful human connections. For over a decade I have been involved with events from corporate functions through to wedding ceremonies. \n\nI take great pride in personalising experiences and seeing a vision come to life flawlessly. I am highly organised with strong attention to detail and focus on maintaining an engaging, calm and helpful demeanour to ensure an amazing event from concept through to completion.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Communication, majoring in Public Relations and Marketing. And rather randomly to most, I am a Registered Marriage Celebrant, authorised to solemnise marriages Australia-wide.\n\nI have dual citizenship with Australia and Spain, I have a crazy passion for travel and in recent years have intensively studied both Italian and Spanish. In March 2023 I made the bold move of relocating from Sydney to Amsterdam to explore the dream of living a European lifestyle.\n\nI'd love to connect here with peers in the events industry and fellow travellers.",
