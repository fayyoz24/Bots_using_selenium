    "summary": "I am a user experience and interaction researcher and designer with the believe a human-centred design approach is needed to design successful products and services. I am curious, eager to learn and enthusiastic. As a researcher I can easily empathise with people. This, together with my creative and thorough research methods, lead to the wanted, but also surprising results. My attention for detail and accurate work help me as a designer to translate research results in user friendly and desirable products and/or services. I prefer to work in a team in which I have my own responsibilities. I like to be involved within the complete design process with a focus on research and conceptualising. ",
