    "summary": "I earned my Bachelor's degree in Corporate Secretaryship from the University of Madras, complemented by a Diploma in Information Systems Management from NIIT in Chennai. Subsequently, I pursued a Master of Commerce from the University of Madras through distance education.\n\nIn my pursuit of knowledge enhancement, I embarked on a Full-time MBA Program in Human Resources and Marketing Management at Anna University in 2009. I am proud to note that I secured the 38th Rank in the University and was awarded a gold medal from my College in recognition of my academic achievements.\n\nIn 2011, I assumed the role of HR Executive at Voltech Engineers Private Limited, where my responsibilities encompassed overseeing the company's branding activities. During my tenure, I received training in the preparation of newsletters, brochures, and profiles for our Group Companies, as well as coordinating diary management, calendar planning, and the design of invitations and banners. My duties also entailed liaising with external printers and designers to ensure the highest quality of output. Additionally, I managed the distribution of printed materials across our companies and maintained an efficient database of my tasks.\n\nSubsequently, I made a significant life transition, transitioning from the corporate world to full-time family life after getting married and relocating to the Netherlands. However, my passion for contributing to nonprofit organizations that provide assistance and education to those in need remained undiminished. In my search for volunteer opportunities, I discovered Taal Doet Meer, which perfectly aligned with my goals. I embarked on a journey with Taal Doet Meer as a \"Boekstart Coach,\" where I have been actively engaged in developing my Dutch language skills and fostering connections within my community.",
