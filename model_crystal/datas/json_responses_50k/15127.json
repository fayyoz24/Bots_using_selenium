    "summary": "After receiving his PhD in physics in 2004, Jeroen Koelemeij pursued a career in the measurement and distribution of time and frequency using lasers, atomic clocks and fiber-optic networks. He acquired five prestigious stipends and fellowships which enabled him to work in some of the world\u00b4s leading physical laboratories. After a productive one-year stint at Statistics Netherlands (CBS), he continued his career in academic science with a Veni grant (2008) and subsequently a STW/Vidi grant (2012), awarded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). In 2014, he co-founded OPNT BV, a fast-growing provider of fiber-optic time synchronization solutions based on CERN's White Rabbit protocol.\n\nApart from experimental studies of fundamental physical law using lasers and trapped ions,  \nJeroen has been vigorously pursuing his vision of the telecommunication network of the future, which will not only provide high-capacity connectivity, but also extremely precise time and location information ('SuperGPS') - essential features needed for 5G mobile Internet, the IoT and safe autonomously driving vehicles. He has done so both in his role as principal investigator at LaserLaB of the Vrije Universiteit, and formerly as CTO of OPNT. Throughout his career, Jeroen has collaborated nationally and internationally with numerous academic research groups and companies. Since October 2019, he has been a full-time assistant professor at VU Amsterdam, focusing on laser-based metrology of small molecular ions, the determination of fundamental constants of nature, and the development of robust time and frequency distribution methods through telecom networks.\n\nHard skills: time and frequency distribution through fiber-optic telecommunication networks; general math, applied physics & electrical engineering; atomic clocks and timekeeping; atomic, molecular and laser physics; systems engineering; optics; electronics. Soft skills: project management, entrepreneurial skills, team player, mentor and motivator, innovator, knowledge transfer and communication skills.",
