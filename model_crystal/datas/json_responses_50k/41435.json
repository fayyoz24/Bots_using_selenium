            "description": "The Agricultural Water Management Solutions Project (AWM Solutions) has identified a variety of small-holder agricultural water management interventions (AWM Regional Mapping ) that have a high potential to improve the food security and livelihoods of the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The study results have now been made available online through the Investment Visualizer tool. This tool is directed at policymakers and investors in agricultural water management in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to assess the profits, costs, yield improvements, number of (poor) people reached, area expansion, and water use consumption of various smallholder water management options by country and region. \n\nAn ex-ante GIS analysis uses a set of suitability criteria to identify areas where the technology could potentially be applied, pixel by pixel, across the region based on environmental suitability and labor availability. The results are then further refined through the application of two biophysical and economic predictive modeling tools: the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the model of Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (DREAM) for a combined agronomic-economic-hydrologic cost-benefit analysis for each crop and technology assessed. Given limited market access in much of sub-Saharan Africa, we simulate local, national and international crop markets for this region, for vegetable, root and cereal crops, respectively.",
