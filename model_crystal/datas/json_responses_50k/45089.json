                    "description": "I joined the Hoechst plastics division Plastomark to learn about the fascinating field of plastics and brought my knowledge and experience of the automotive industry.  I received formal training, first by completing a certificate in plastics technology (3 modules: Materials, Supervisory Management and Injection Moulding Processing) through the Plastics Federation of South Africa, and thereafter a National Diploma in plastics technology through the Pretoria Technikon (3 - year diploma course).  I developed more than 15 new polypropylene compounds for automotive applications, including inter alia bumper fascias, door panels, interior trim components, and HVAC housings for Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen and General Motors.  I applied in several cases unique technologies for polypropylene compounds to meet the exacting standards set by the respective OEM, and utilised full factorial design models in the development of those products.  I also lead the evaluation and validation processes through the OEM to attain full approval and release of these products in new vehicles applications.  This included running injection moulding trials in new and existing tools on equipment up to 4500 tones clamping force for part evaluation and testing.\n\nIn the mid 1990's I was nominated as representative for Plastomark in the Hoechst works council, and later nominated to represent the Hoechst SA head office as site representative in negotiations with management on employee matters, annual salary reviews, performance award system, etc, and remained in this position until the final break up of Hoechst in 1999.  I also consulted with legal representation on changing legislation in South African labour law and the application thereof in various matters.",
