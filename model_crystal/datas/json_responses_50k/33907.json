I was responsible for the design, execution, analyses, and dissemination of the experimental work, applying psychological approaches such as mood induction, and combining quantitative and qualitative research methods, making use of Motion Capture equipment and high level audio recordings. Acclaimed for the exceptional large range of research methods - from a diary study and qualitative in-depth interviews to experimental work with performers in the lab, to a perception study using animations generated from the experimental data - I applied in order to investigate the elusive effects of performers' emotions on their performance.  \nMy work got published in various international peer-reviewed journals, and I presented it at conferences around the world. \nI have been teaching qualitative research methods in the international master programme 'Music, Mind, and Technology'.",
