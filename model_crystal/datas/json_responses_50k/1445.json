    "summary": "Inclusivity, diversity and flexibility are three qualities that I am looking for in a company, while my personal and professional values are integrity, adaptability and reliability. To broaden my knowledge, I have started the International Communication Master at Hanze University of Applied Sciences and I have been actively participating in suitable projects of the media field. \n\nThroughout the past 4 years I took part in 3 internships in Marketing and E-commerce, as well as became a Freelance Journalist, working in collaboration with a student association and promoting studying abroad. Also, during my third year of Creative Business I participated in two minors: Event Management in Bali and Integrated Digital Marketing in Thailand. I chose these minors based on my passion for marketing and management and because I think they help me create a diverse and complete professional profile. I learnt a lot about how to properly organise and design an event, how to implement digital marketing strategies and how to match the needs of the client to the ones of the customer. All these aspects mentioned before will contribute nicely to building my desired career, together with my ambition, determination, and dedication to becoming the best version of myself. \n\nMoreover, the skills I acquired while working in and studying about the creative industries include research, planning and organising, media concepting, critical and analytical thinking, problem solving and intercultural awareness. Additionally, I worked and studied in international environments and got to build on my intercultural skills.",
