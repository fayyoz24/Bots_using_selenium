    "summary": "Hello there, I am Isha \u2014 a dedicated Python and data enthusiast driven to bridge the gap between AI and people. I work on diverse problem domains to expand my skill set and create transparent AI-powered solutions. Some of my projects include-\n\n1. Detecting lung cancer in longitudinal CT data (image processing)\n2. Identifying novel biomarkers in DNA sequence (natural language processing)\n3. Detecting pollution through environmental image segmentation (computer vision)\n4. Stock data forecasting (recurrent neural networks)\n5. Digitizing campus cafeteria ordering and billing system (database, SQL, Bootstrap, HTML, PHP)\n\nI am focused, determined, self-motivated, and always interested in talking to new people about AI and hobbies (painting, chess).  Curious to see my work? Check out my portfolio here: https://isha-git.github.io/. But if you have read this far, why not take the next step? Reach out to me at ishaa3098@gmail.com, and let's have a quick chat about what brought you here.\n\nLooking forward to connecting and sharing insights. Have a wonderful day!",
