I have professional training in media production and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Media Creation and Innovation at the University of Groningen to build a strong theoretical background. In addition to my media work, I have had the opportunity to work in the cultural industries, where I have often taken the role of planning, organizing and executing events and projects, collaborating with artists in different fields. \n\nThroughout my academic training, I also constantly seek to improve my skills and knowledge and have developed proficiency in research methods such as interviews, survey design, statistical analysis with R, content analysis, discourse analysis, and social network analysis. \n\nI am excited to continue growing and learning as I pursue new challenges and opportunities in the media and cultural industries.",
