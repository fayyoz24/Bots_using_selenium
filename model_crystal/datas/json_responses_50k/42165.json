    "summary": "*At the moment I\u2019m working as project leader, engineer electrical, instrumentation and automation at the Projects & Engineering department of Nouryon for the factories and for the site services organization SSC at the Chemie Park Delfzijl. Because we work close to the factories we know the installations quite well which help us at scoping the projects and take into account the maintenance aspects to come to a greater availability. To realize this I\u2019m working together with the maintenance department and technologists to reduce the performance killers by making proposals for improvements. \n\n*Experience in field instrumentation & specifications, familiar with ATEX and SIL, DCS (Valmet, Honeywell, Emerson) and SIS (Honeywell and HIMA) projects, basic- & detail engineering, managing engineering partners, sparring partner for maintenance and technologists, discipline member during TRA, HAZOP and SIL, SIF and cost calculations for investments, interest in maintenance aspects.\n\nSpecialties: Flexible team player, working together with other professions and multi discipline project teams to complete a project on schedule and within cost calculations. \n\nProject example: \n*At the CPD we realized a Hydrogen Discharge Station together with Pitpoint & Groningen Seaports.  Hydrogen is used by the regional bus company. My responsibility was discipline engineer EIA including ATEX verification file. During construction my role was discipline CSU manager and responsible for safe connection and start-up from Pitpoint to the Nouryon plant. To realize this a conversion plan was made and discussed on daily basis with all stake holders to control progress and the right steps to come to a safe start-up.\n\n*Upgrade DCS system MCA/MEB factory. Complete system upgrade including new HMI & additional PIN network for maintenance & upgrade services. System upgrade during turnaround. FAT at supplier. Cooperation with maintenance & automation.",
