With the growing number of elderly people this sounds like a contradiction, but it is so.\n\nVia NBL (www.nederlandbreedbandland.nl) we developed a concept to allow local inhabitants in a certain area to make use of those services via virtual 3D worlds in which both individuals and service providers could meet when needed, share documents, discuss subjects and make decisions.\n\nThe second goal was to prevent loneliness by offering a local environment where people can get together online and meet with their friends and relatives without having to walk or cycle or be pushed there. This also offered care services to monitor how people were doing.\n\nThe third goal was to offer thousands of unemployed and/or disabled people a virtual job. This has since become a new and on-going project.\n",

The lab contained many potential innovations to be used in prisons, ranging from toilets automatically analysing drugs or alcohol content to new tracing methods and virtual 3D worlds.\n\nThe film shows an inmate in prison for car theft who is given a job in a virtual city. Not only math and language skills can be honed, also social aspects play a large role. When the inmate even loses is job virtually, he wonders what he can do. Two passers-by talk to each other about the math building where they learned their skills. Who knows! could that work for him? And of course it does, and he is starting to become a working member of society.\n\nIncredibly fun project with great people.",

            "description": "NV3D was set up with educational publisher NijghVersluys (now ThiemenMeulenhoff) offering a central virtual environment on the web, connected with their different curricula for different levels.\n\nThe environment became a virtual 3D city in which groups of students and teachers could together walk around, talk with each other and solve challenges, Each level of education had its own environment with representations of nine different companies (bank, estate agent, flower export company, government, unemployment agency, etc.), containing exercises allowing students to play a role in a company. A exam centre, cinema and research centre, and a central \"Math building\" offered all the basics of mathematics and economy with exercises teaching the concepts.\n\nOne of the most important aspects we noticed during the project and after launch is that not the students needed guidance, but the teachers. We organised several short evening courses for teachers with great success. The main idea was simple:\n\nLet the students play, while you as a teacher set the boundaries and rules.\n\nFor instance: They can go online and do whatever they want, as long as for the next lesson, they have done exercise 1, 2 and 3 in the bank successfully.\n\nA dashboard system was developed to allow all to see the results and progress at a glance and in depth. It allowed teachers to concentrate on specific skills for specific students.\n\nThis project also showed the way groups of students communicate and use them. Depending on the level of education and school, students would either help each other with exercises, or play \"illegal street races\" with the Porsche Avatars.\n\nThe method ran successfully from 2007 to 2012, with tens of thousands of students using it. Due to political, economical and merger factors, the system was unfortunately discontinued.\n\nAlso see Justice project.",
