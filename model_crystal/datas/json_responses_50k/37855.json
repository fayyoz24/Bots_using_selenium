    "summary": "When I was 12 I moved to India with my family. Attending the American school in Delhi allowed me to experience a multicultural environment and reinforced my ability to pick up languages quickly. During my studies I was very interested in the history behind the inequality I witnessed first-hand in India. Over the course of this research, I became ever more interested in the concepts of good governance and the positive or negative effects that outside attempts to establish positive institutions can have on a country. During my research, I have focused on political dynamics in various African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Niger. Political speeches and election manifestos were a particular focus here and were mostly looked at through a populist lens. I would like to work with local stakeholders to improve the institutional quality of African politics to give the people more of a say in their future and to combat sentiments of disenfranchisement and being left behind.",
