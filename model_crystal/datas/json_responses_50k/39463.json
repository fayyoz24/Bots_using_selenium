    "summary": "I am a passionate music teacher with a diverse range of experiences in teaching and musical activities. My journey in music education has allowed me to explore various methods of teaching musical concepts through games, improvisations, and group activities. I have successfully conducted choir sessions, implemented psychomotor learning activities, organized theater classes, and facilitated messy play and painting lessons.\n\nIn addition to my teaching roles, I have actively participated in cultural initiatives, such as the \"Culture Travels\" program, where I conducted music-motor education workshops at the primary school of Apeiranthos in Naxos. These workshops focused on imparting basic musical concepts through engaging games and improvisations, culminating in memorable musical celebrations.\n\nDuring my tenure as a music teacher at the Center for Children's Creative Development, I dedicated my time to nurturing the creative potential of children. I also volunteered at the Children's Psychiatric Clinic, Agia Sofia, where I provided music therapy activities, contributing to the well-being of young patients.\n\nApart from my teaching experiences, I have gained valuable skills in the corporate sector as an Energy Sales Consultant at Elpedison and as a Telephone Sales & Customer Service Consultant for Vodafone - Cyta. These roles have honed my communication and customer service skills, allowing me to thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments.\n\nI hold a Bachelor's degree in Musicology with a specialization in Ethnomusicology and Cultural Anthropology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Throughout my education, I have developed a strong foundation in pedagogy, musicology, and music technology. My thesis on \"Popular Music and Gender: The Case of Women in Metal Culture\" reflects my research interests and dedication to exploring diverse musical genres.\n\nIn my personal life, I am an avid performer and have participated in concerts and competitions both in Greece and abroad. I am a trained vocalist, songwriter, and chorister, and I continue to refine my skills through ongoing voice training and repertoire development. Additionally, I have a keen interest in first aid and have received training and certification in various medical and emergency procedures.\n\nI am passionate about nurturing the love for music in my students and creating meaningful learning experiences. I am open to new opportunities where I can utilize my skills, creativity, and dedication to make a positive impact in the field of music education.",
