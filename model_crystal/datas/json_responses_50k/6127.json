Now I am embarking on a new journey at Dyson as a commercial trainee for the German market. \nWith a passion for beauty, I have already acquired knowledge in marketing in the beauty industry through internships/positions in brand management at COTY, for prestige brands (Gucci, Chlo\u00e9, Burberry, Bottega Veneta) and marketing & sales at Maison Godet (a niche luxury French fragrance house). I have also worked for IKEA Sweden by contributing to the company\u2019s digital journey through a master thesis project. \n\nIn the future, I seek to dive deeper into the managerial field, specifically brand management or category management roles. I stay open to any other marketing management related roles.",
