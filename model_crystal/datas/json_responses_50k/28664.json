In depth knowledge on current standards and guidelines for certification of wind turbines and wide experience on rotor blade factory inspections and adaptation of design in to serial production.\n\nThe next lines help you to undertand my laboral mindset. \n\nWhat makes a good engineer?\n\nBeing accountable for the tasks and roles that you are entrusted with.\nBeing willing to do an extra to fulfil your tasks as good as possible.\nLearning everyday as much as possible, technically and personally, on your own or from other people's experiences.\nNot repeat your mistakes... and apply what what you have learnt, of course.\n\nAm I a good engineer?  I don't know... but at least I am trying.",
