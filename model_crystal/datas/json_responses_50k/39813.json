This makes the ETIM method easier, faster and more efficient in one fell swoop. Users do not have to worry about ETIM updates because the extension updates classification changes fully automatically.\n\nAdvantages of the ETIM extension:\n- Fully industry standard compliant\n- Limitation of product data errors\n- Full support for dynamic classification updates\n\nMy role was to design and implement the inRiver PIM solution which included:\n- Architectural design of the inRiver PIM extension according to ETIM standards\n- Design of inRiver PIM marketing model adjustments\n- Design of inbound/outbound channel integrations (e.g. Excel ETIM data import/export, BMEcat based datapool interface, INSBOU import interface) \n- Managing the development- and test-team\n- Documentation and user manuals\n- Field support\n",
