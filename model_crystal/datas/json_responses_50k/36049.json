    "summary": "With my developmental psychologist background I'd like to look at companies or creative concepts to see what else is possible, what space is there to improve, and how to take things to the next level. I love helping people to become more happy and successful, to make companies healthy, to connect worlds together, to create the best possible experiences together.\n\nI work together with a bunch of talented people: The Experience Enhancers on the development of experiences & events; taking your (event)-experience beyond entertainment and fun, adding transformational layers. We also look at existing concepts and help to develop them further.\n\nI graduated from the University of Amsterdam as a Developmental Psychologist. I specialised in the influence of humour on the immune system but my passion has always been transformative experiences.\n\nDuring university I worked at Supperclub Amsterdam and organized several original events and festivals under the name \u201cLust het Leven\u201d (Lust for Life) and All is One. Both concepts were nominated for the Golden Gnome Award (best festival of the year and best innovative new concept in Amsterdam).\n\nAfter living in Asia for 1,5 years, l worked at ID&T for over 5 years in the Creative- and Sustainability Department.\n\nIn 2015 I founded The Experience Enhancers, a platform where creatives and business meet. I was involved in the development of Awake Amsterdam with Lama Sogyal Rinpoche, Healing Garden Festival, Beyond Festival, Indian Summer Festival, Welcome to the Future Festival, Mysteryland, the Dream Festival and the Dream-to-go Parade.\n\nI worked (amongst others) for Mandali in Italy, the Boom Festival in Portugal, for Envision Festival in Costa Rica, for Mysteryland NL, USA, and Chile and 5 years TEDx Amsterdam, consulting for the design of the experience.\n\nI design transformative events on request, but also work autonomous.\n\nSpecialties: Manifesting Dreams into Reality.\nEvents, Development, Transformational Festivals, World-bridging, Creativity, Innovation, Ideas, People, Connections, Solutions, Strategy.\n\nMotto: \"Opening the mind, the imagination and maybe even raising consciousness through meaningful experiences\".\n\n3 days a week I work at the Embassy of the Free Mind. A museum for and about Free thinkers with the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica as it's core collection. It's housed in the \"House with the Heads\" on Keizersgracht 123, Amsterdam - there's so much more to say about that then fits here: www.embassyofthefreemind.com or email me: jvanderwel@efm.amsterdam to be continued  :)",

            "description": "Twelve years ago, Indian Summer started with only 750 visitors and a lot of help from family, friends and volunteers. Today the festival has grown into the largest one-day festival in North-Holland. Now, the festival even cooperates with FKP Scorpio in order to make the festival better and even more interesting and more beautiful.\n\nThe festival offers a unique mixture of pop, rock & dance (including two pop-rock areas and three dance areas), 80 's & 90 's, a theatre area and also a wide variety of national and international artists. \nIt is THE festival for free spirits and thus the most relaxed and casual festival of the Netherlands. The free character, the variety and diversity of artists/music styles and the idyllic location of recreational area Geestmerambacht, gives you the real Indian Summer Festival feeling of coming home and is completely free of any obligations. \n\nOver the last years, Faithless, UB40, Anouk, Blof, Kane and many more artists have entered the Indian Summer-stage. This year, it\u2019s up to Madness, The Kooks, Selah Sue, Wombats, Erick E, DJ Roog, Gers Pardoel, Racoon and many more! With a mixture of several music styles, established names and surprising new acts, Indian Summer Festival guarantees the ultimate summer feeling more than ever.",
