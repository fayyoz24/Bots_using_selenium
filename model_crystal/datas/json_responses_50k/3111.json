    "summary": "Hi. I'm Kashish. Born in the multicultural melting pot that is Rotterdam. Being surrounded by such an eclectic mix of people has sparked my interest from a young age, in how we behave and communicate as individuals. This combined with a backdrop of rapid technological advancements made it pretty clear where my passion lies: solving problems and creating opportunities in the digital space for users and businesses. \n\nAs a product manager, I focus on seeking a perfect balance between business goals, user needs and technical feasibility. Part of that taps into my passion of understanding user behaviour and creating delightful experiences that meet their needs. But it also involves unraveling the challenges that come my way when developing products including limited resources and competing priorities. I get excited by bringing all the puzzle pieces together on the basis of research insights to drive meaningful products and services.\n\nI\u2019m interested in working in a wide variety of industries as each industry has its own unique set of challenges and opportunities. Working in collaborative and multidisciplinary environments is where I thrive best.\n\nBesides my knowledge on product management, user experience and other tech-related topics, I\u2019m always eager to learn more about sustainability and other cultures. If you\u2019re interested in any of these topics and want to discuss, feel free to reach out and let's have a chat!",

With the increasing number of passengers using trams, using the full tram capacity is important. Bottlenecks in this process can cause delays which increases costs for GVB. One of these bottlenecks is passengers blocking the entrances of the tram, leading to empty spaces in the middle of the tram. The proposed solution was inspired by nudging principles, which refers to a subtle way of altering behaviour, by making small modifications to an already existing design. This entailed experimenting with type of lights, footprint stickers, entrance door colours and strategic placement of information to influence passenger movement in the tram.",
