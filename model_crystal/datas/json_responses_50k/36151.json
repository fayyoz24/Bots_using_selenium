    "summary": "I've worked on presentations especially, on pitch decks for a wide range of industries and with many renowned clients, including technology companies specializing in AI and SaaS, beauty companies, healthcare firms, and big brands like Samsung, Tata, and Sony.\n\nThe pitch decks I've designed have played a pivotal role in raising substantial amounts of funding. My approach to pitch decks goes beyond just presenting information; I believe in crafting narratives that captivate the audience. A successful presentation should not only convey facts but also evoke a visceral response.\n\nI firmly believe that the difference between a stellar presentation and a lackluster one is as clear as day and night. It only takes a moment to recognize and feel this distinction. Moreover, in the world of presentations, you often have just one opportunity to make a lasting first impression. This is why I consider presentation to be the key to success.",
