    "summary": "After a couple of years working in the fashion industry as a product developer & coordinator I've become more and more interested in the tech industry. Therefore I decided to learn frontend development and got very much hooked on it.\nI've been learning modern front-end development - Single Page Apps with React & APIs. Building and understanding apps from scratch and experiencing the entire design process through a final assignment.\nAt the moment: I am continuing my development and trying to gain more experience by practicing to make \u201cpixel perfect\u201d CSS designs based on Figma designs & build complex projects.\nMy journey continoues with Server Side Rendering with Next.js & Connecting CMS systems to my apps.\nBased on my previous experiences I can say that I am strong in finding new and creative solutions to problems, successful at implementing new strategies, designs and bringing detail-oriented work to any project. I enjoy acquiring new knowledge and developing new skills with great enthusiasm to quickly perform my tasks independently. I do all this with a smile and I always try to create a good working atmosphere around me.\nI am currently looking for an opportunity in frontend development where I can further develop myself in this area, where I feel socially involved and my efforts are appreciated.",
