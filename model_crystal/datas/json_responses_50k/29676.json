    "summary": "I am currently pursuing PhD in the field of subsurface energy storage in the form green fuels such as Hydrogen or green methane gas. I am part of DARSIM research group in the department of Geosciences at TU Delft, where we develop computational simulators to understand different applications such as energy storage, induced seismicity in highly fractured porous media. I graduated in the field of Energy, Flow and Process Technology in Mechanical Engineering  department at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. I pursued my Bachelors of Technology (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Surathkal (NITK). I constantly believe in expanding comfort zone and trying out new things. ",

Using 3D CFD model and further employing single phase and multi-phase flow simulation to study individual phase buildup, molecular mixture viscosity and facet averages of wall shear stress. Fluid Structural Interaction was further studied to observe the equivalent von-mises stress in stenosis regions.",

The project involved simulation the para-magnetic eutectic alloys (Sn63Pb37) under high frequency magnetic fields for 3D metal printing.  It involved simulating the magnetic field and power captured in the alloy considering the rise in the resistivity of the material as the temperature of the alloy increases.  Accordingly the heat transfer from the system to the surroundings was calculated by employing appropriate correlations. The results were compared to the experimental results and theoretical computations.",
