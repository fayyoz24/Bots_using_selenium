    "summary": "Currently being Signify's global system expert for Interact Pro, our wireless lighting solution for SME's. If friends ask me what it is, I simplify the explanation by telling that it can be compared with Hue for professionals. I train our call centers world wide (Puerto Rico, Malaysia, The Netherlands, France, Denmark) and I am their contact for major escalations. I analyse customer feedback and make sure that this feedback is being used to prioritize R&D activities. I created and maintain a knowledge base and also advise on continuous improvements of activities and procedures in our systems business. It's great to construct and improve our quality while always keeping our customers at the first place.\n\n\nPrevious Highlights:\nThe Edge Amsterdam, installation of one of the most innovative lighting solutions. During the realisation I became one of the experts of Connected Office Lighting (based on Power over Ethernet). \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW0LxjB4eGw\n\nRijksmuseum Amsterdam, realisation of the impressive Light Racks with their indirect and direct lighting hoovering above the art:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U4NX6tZ1A\n\nProject manager @ Lighting renovation De Lage Landen: \nhttp://www.lighting.philips.nl/projects/de_lage_landen.wpd\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ecd64qzw55o\n\nProject management for the renovation of the lighting offices on the High Tech Campus",
