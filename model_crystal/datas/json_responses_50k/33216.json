    "summary": "I'm passionate about learning national and foreign languages and cultures! I'm also an art enthusiast and love exploring topics such as psychology, sociology, history, technology, and music. I believe that education and empathetic communication are key to creating a better world.\n\nFor nearly four years, I had the opportunity to travel, explore new cultures and nations, and learn new languages. I participated in paid cultural exchange programs in the United States, the Netherlands, and England to make this possible. These experiences helped me develop valuable personal and professional skills that are highly valuable in the job market.\n\nMy professional journey has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Being part of an innovative industry that focuses on education, technology, and creating a better world is truly inspiring. The ability to contribute to the development of educational products that can make a difference in people's lives is both challenging and fulfilling. Through my work in EdTech, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with passionate and talented individuals from diverse backgrounds, learn about cutting-edge technology, and explore new ways to improve educational content and delivery. The fast-paced and dynamic nature of the industry keeps me motivated and continuously learning.",
