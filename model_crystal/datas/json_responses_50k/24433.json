    "summary": "I am an accomplished business leader with 28 years of experience in complex turnarounds across multiple countries and industries, including Banking, Insurance, Technology, Manufacturing, Staffing, Logistics, Government and FMCG. \n\nMy career started in Finance with P&G and GE when I found my passion: helping businesses and people grow through sustainable performance improvement. I excel at implementing big ideas with tight constraints - both as entrepreneur and business leader. I am passionately curious with a thirst to develop myself and others. For the past 10 years, I have been Visiting Professor at two leading European business schools. While I love winning, it gives me greater joy to help the team to win.\n\nExpertise: digital transformation, operational excellence, strategy development, Lean, Six Sigma, Agile and learning & development",

Women-led founders receive less than 5% of the total venture capital money globally while studies show that they perform substantially better financially than their male counterparts. One important reason for this is that there is still a real lack of female role models, especially in the Tech and AI space. That\u2019s why we need programmes like Women in AI Accelerate. \n\n"

Trying to find ways to tackle these challenges, Hack The Crisis, a global movement of hackathons, was born. The NL Hackathon had 831 participants from 69 different countries, 131 supporting organizations and created 55 new solutions. Our team started by reaching out to teachers around the world about their biggest challenge during the Covid-19 distance learning period. Their answer: to continue to motivate their students sitting at home. To tackle this problem, team Changingly developed the platform \u2018Ediya\u2019. Teachers can continue to provide inspiring education by working together and sharing student gamification challenges."
