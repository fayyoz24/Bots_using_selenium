    "summary": "Student at Lund University in the Master's programme Human Ecology: Culture, Power and Sustainability. As part of the program, I am currently doing an internship in the research project Plastics in a circular society: Alternative organizing beyond resource efficiency. \n\nIn the realm of environmental sustainability, I have experience through Groentetas, a non-profit organisation run by student volunteers in Utrecht. \n\nI also have experience in administration and communication as acquired during my time working as an Assistant International Admissions Officer at Utrecht University and Exam Invigilator at the British Council.  \n\nGraduated with a Master of Science from Utrecht University in the Master\u2019s programme Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship in September 2022. My thesis investigated the human-plastic relationship through visual methods. I hosted Plastic Waste Art Workshops where my participants created visual artworks out of their plastic waste. In turn I looked at how perceptions of environmental awareness and value-making were influenced and how this created what Amanda Boetzkes\u2019 calls \u2018The Plastic Dilemma\u2019.\n\nGraduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts and Sciences, major: Anthropology and Human Geography from the University College Utrecht in August 2020. My thesis explored the importance of recognition and defence of Aboriginal rights and in combatting climate change, with a case-specific focus on the Anangu at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Australia.",

Drawing on the concepts of degrowth, alternative organising and feminist geography, the project investigates initiatives intending to reorganise the plastic system and tackle the plastic crisis by diverting from dominant structures. My role is to look into localised initiatives that are particularly tackling issues around plastic waste and pollution either at the source of production, through open-source recycling technologies, by designing alternatives to plastics, or raising awareness and creating localised policies about the problem.",
