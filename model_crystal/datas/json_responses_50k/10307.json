    "summary": "I am a footwear designer and product developer. I have also studied Graphic Design which includes Typography, Brand Design and Visual Communication. \n\nOverall I have over 20 years of experience in the shoe business. I have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in footwear design and manufacture and therefore I have comprehensive technical knowledge of different footwear constructions and great hands-on experience of both design and development processes. The range of products I have worked on include everything from pumps, sandals, sneakers and boots to house slippers and rainboots. I have worked with leather as well as synthetic materials and I have strong know-how of footwear materials, constructions and components. \n\nAs a designer I pay meticulous attention to detail and I have a strong awareness of trends, current and classic. I believe my designs offer a very good balance of commercial and innovation applied product. I understand pattern construction, upper and outsole materials as well as other technical issues and I can carry a project through from initial sketch to pre-production. I am well-organized and can work quite independently after a clear brief.\n\nI have a lot of experience working in the Far East. I have frequently traveled to and maintained business contacts allover Asia and Europe. My strengths are the strong technical know-how of shoe making, ability to think creatively, extensive knowledge of the European shoe market and good people skills. \n\nI thrive in a team though I am quite independent and used to responsibility. I have guided junior designers and coordinated external designers within a team environment. I am experienced in working to development time lines and maintaining the critical path. I have also been involved in testing product for fit and comfort. Having worked from global brands to private label suppliers demonstrates true diversity and understanding of consumer needs and requirements. With my graphic design studies I can bring also visual communication to the table as well as produce high quality print and logo design.",
