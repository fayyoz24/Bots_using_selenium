    "summary": "Reactor is the beating heart of any chemical process involving transformation of a molecule into something valuable. As a PhD candidate in the Sustainable Process Engineering group at TU Eindhoven, I work with my colleagues to design and develop an efficient chemical reactor and catalyst using experimental data and modelling. As part of my work, I work within a consortium of six industrial partners from Germany, Spain and UK.\n\nA keen interest in chemistry, mathematics and physics from my high school days, I grew an interest in the subject of chemical reaction and kinetics during my bachelor studies. During my stint as an engineer at RIL Jamnagar refinery in India, I became well versed with safety aspect of process design. Upon observing the size of reactors as tall as 40m and observing reactor internals from the inside, my fascination for chemical reactor engineering and kinetics increased. Once while working in a turnaround to replace the catalyst, I briefly discussed designing of catalyst and reactor from fundamental level with the catalyst vendor. This talk got me hooked on the subject of reaction kinetics and catalysis and the only way to stop was to gain an advance knowledge on the topic.\n\nThis led me to TU Delft in the Netherlands for my master's in Chemical engineering. I have worked in diverse and multi-cultural teams to provide conceptual design solutions to clients such as Shell and TATA Steel. For my thesis, I worked on CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at high pressure in the group of Prof. Urakawa. I gained practical knowledge of catalyst synthesis and characterisation techniques. My hunger to work on sustainable projects involving reaction kinetics and chemical engineering led me to TU Eindhoven. Here, I work on reactor design for biomass processing to renewable jet fuels.\n\nDuring my master's I worked with Career Centre of TU Delft to offer advice to students on CV and motivation letter, so that they have a great chance of getting their desired position. I also love cooking, gaming, watching football and have participated in 10 kilometer runs and half marathons. Back in September 2019, I was able to complete an AFF (Accelerated free fall) training in skydiving. This involved 7 solo skydives at a height of 14,000 ft from an airplane. I was happy to have fulfilled my childhood dream of skydiving and look forward to a license-A training in the summer.",
