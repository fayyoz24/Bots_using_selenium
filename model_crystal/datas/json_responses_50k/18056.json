    "summary": "My name is Mattia and I'm an Environmental Sciences graduate from Avans University.\nI wish to work in the energy sector (in particular I would love to make analyses on decarbonization scenarios for different regions/countries, etc.), but I also very much enjoyed my internships doing life-cycle assessments (LCA), which I find to be an extremely interesting and useful methodology. I am not very experienced in the energy sector, I only worked on LCAs in my internships, but I am very motivated to learn as much as possible about the energy world and how we can achieve the climate goals.\n\nI am interested in renewable energy and also in nuclear energy, and believe not only that it is a fundamental source to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but also that it's heavily targeted in a negative way. Because of this, I wish to spread awareness and paint in a fairer way both renewables and nuclear, hoping that transparency helps people understand these sources more, and see that nuclear is not as dangerous and apocalyptic as most people think.\n\nI am also interested in streaming platforms, more specifically Twitch.tv and wish to combine my interest in sustainbable energies with this platform, to increase awareness and spread knowledge, of course on topics that I am very informed on.",
