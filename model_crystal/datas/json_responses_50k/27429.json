            "description": "Self-assembly of polyhedral-shaped particles have attracted huge interest with the advent of new synthesis methods to realize these faceted particles in the lab. Recent studies have shown that polyhedral particles exhibit rich phase behavior by excluded volume interactions alone. Some of these particles are alleged to show a transition to a glass phase by quenching the liquid sufficiently fast beyond the glass transition (supercooling) such that the formation of structures with long-range order is suppressed. Despite the recent progress, no study has been made on the glass formation of polyhedral-shaped particles. Here we study the glassy behavior of polyhedral particles using advanced Monte Carlo methods. In the ?first part of this thesis the formation of glass by mono-disperse polyhedral particles, namely octahedra, tetrahedra and triangular cupola are discussed. At the end, the fragility of these particles is calculated and compared with that of other systems. In the second part of this thesis we performed preliminary calculations on binary mixtures of polyhedral particles. Possible candidate crystal structures are studied using the floppy box Monte Carlo method.",

Also helping to bring the latest one-short 2D to 3D conversion algorithms in production for helping patients to choose appropriate respiratory masks, clothing, etc. As with previous work, we make heavy use of years of development of a high resolution parametric model of head and body.",

Furthermore, I was involved in designing the Bodypass architecture for Philips. Beyond Bodypass, I have implemented the live visualization of Philips Dreamwear masks on customers faces, using advanced face track- ing techniques. On other projects I\u2019ve worked, I have effectively applied the latest AI algorithms such as differential rendering and neural networks, including GANs, CNNs, RNNs, etc. to solve complex problems such as the detection of meals in pictures, the generation of daily human activity, skin reverse engineering from spectral data, and cut- ting edge medical image segmentation. Furthermore, I\u2019ve worked on developing motion tracking algorithms from 2D and 3D video using advanced techniques such as differ- entiable rendering and depth estimation from 2D video. During this time, I\u2019ve been the author of several Invention Disclosures (ID) and Technical Notes (TN). I have also supervised students and interns.",

During this period I had to discuss with trades and validators, and come up with models and implement pricing and sensitivity calculations for total return swaps and long-dated forward bonds. I also parallelised and refactored big parts of the code, improving the code quality and leading to big performance improvements. I also worked on the integration of code coverage tools, designing a versioning system for the regression test data. Languages I worked the most with include C++, Python, and CUDA.",

During my PhD, I built cutting-edge Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for various models, including a lattice model of binary solvent mixture with colloids, a binary solvent mixture with salt (i.e. including electrostatics), and hard particle models. All simulations where programmed by myself in C and C++, and Python was used for scripting purposes. MPI and Cuda was used for massive parallelizations that were run on the Dutch supercomputer cluster \"Cartesius\". During the period of my PhD, I supervised three M.Sc. students in collaboration with my colleague, and was teaching assistant in our University's simulation course for three years. As a perk, I greatly improved my skill in foosball during this time!",
