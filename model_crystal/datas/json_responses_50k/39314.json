    "summary": "As a business anthropologist, I focus on helping companies inspire and convince Americans, to listen carefully and to truly understand their business culture so it will lead to better results.\n\nAs a listening coach, I focus on helping anyone who needs to think deeply about their questions and challenges they want answered.\n\nInspire & Convince Americans\nWith an understanding of American business culture and people, you can anticipate what is most likely to happen. Situations, people, their reactions and actions will become more understandable to you. You will be able to interpret what was said as it was intended and anticipate and adapt your reactions accordingly. You will be able to see the person behind your American interlocutors. For more information about this online training and bi-weekly supervision by Marjoleine, please check www.4cunity.com.\n\nThink deeply for yourself\nBy listening to yourself, you can better understand your assumptions, thoughts, feelings and actions. They are interconnected and you can affect them positively. By easing your mind and listening to yourself first, you can better listen to others and truly understand them. With really listening to others, you will improve their thinking and your own. Thinking deeply in a safe and quiet space with the right preconditions provides pure and enlightening insights, directions, messages, presentations, answers, ideas, solutions and innovations. I will help you tap into your resourcefulness and that of others with listening and coaching.\nFor more information about coaching sessions, please check www.4cunity.com.",

The starting point of the training is the client and his or her difficult work situation. Tailor made trainings.\n\nSeveral complex situations of clients:\n- Americans who interrupt too fast so you can't do your proposal as a Dutch, French, German, ... person.  How to grab their attention and convince them? \n- French colleagues who won't fill in reports (to ensure structure and one way of working during projects). How to work with them with respect for their way of working and yours?\n- Gemans whose leadership is too authoritative for others. How to manage people coming from a less authoritative culture and still making sure the job is done?\n- Dutch who are complaining and negative. How to filter and how to win them for your ideas?\n-  How to make contact with Russian people and work with them?\n- etc\n\n I've talked to clients and made a diagnoses of their complex situations. Based on that I 've made tailor made trainings. At the end of the training they were able to work with the cases they are dealing with in their international work environment. They have cultural sensitivity skills and communication skills. They learned about it, understood why they are doing the way they do, how they can adjust with respect for themselves and others. And they practised with the new behaviour (with  short checklists), so they can use and apply it the next day on the job. \n\nHappy to discover that during my cultural communication skills trainings everything I've learned and experienced comes together and works out well. My background in communications, firm anthropology, EFT therapy, coaching, training and even yoga. I am thankful for the chances and choices I've made and the people I've met. Looking forward to all inspiring years to come.",

Dus om te ontspannen in de spanning. Om zich daar niet tegen te verzetten, maar om het te accepteren. Dan komt er ruimte en lenigheid. Blokkades in het lichaam en de geest worden opgeheven. Het is rustgevend om met de ademhaling ruimte in het lichaam te maken en rust te ervaren. Heel hard nodig in deze hectiek; even bij jezelf komen en aan jezelf toe komen. Hoe meer je dat op de mat oefent, hoe meer je dat toepast in je dagelijkse leven als je van de mat afstapt. Het geeft voldoening om mensen 'hoog' binnen te zien komen, vol in de actie en in het hoofd, en weer gegrond en vol energie de les uit te zien gaan.",
