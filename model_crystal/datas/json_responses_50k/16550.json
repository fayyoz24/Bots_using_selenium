    "summary": "I love to push boundries, do the unexpected and go where others fear to tread.  With over 30 years experience in both FMCG and B2B businesses, I have developed extensive experience in multiple commercial areas including: Marketing and Corporate Branding, Product Development and Innovation, Business Strategy, M&A, Sustainability, Project Management and Sponsorship. And over the last 3 years, extended this into the areas of Talent Management, D&I and Social Responsibility\n\nI have worked for multi-nationals such as Unilever and Henkel as well as small start-ups in the finance and entertainment industry.  As the champion behind the launch of the Vifit Sport brand, this provided me an unparalleled opportunity to truly create a unique new business and way of working to increase speed, flexibility and an always-on approach to consumers for FrieslandCampina \n\nI am now very proud to be part of shaping and implementing the D&I ambition for FrieslandCampina which has allowed me to work with an incredibly passionate and dedicated new network of people. \n\nMy philosophy on life remains: Excellence is the result of dreaming more than others think is practical, risking more than others think is safe, caring more than others think is necessary and expecting more than others think is possible. \n(Quote from Mac Andersson)\n\n\n\n\nSpecialties: Marketing, Branding, Product Development, Business Strategy, Communications, Human Rights, D&I, Social Responsibility, Talent Management",
