    "summary": "I was born in 1953 in Corpus Christi, Texas USA. I grew up in Texas, went to college in Colorado, spent two years in Berlin and then moved to the Netherlands. I went into ministry, serving a congregation and then for a longer period working as a chaplain in psychiatric care and as an ethical consultant in care for those with a mental handicap. In 2008 I moved into a teaching and research position, first as a lecturer in health care ethics, and then in spiritual care and chaplaincy. With Sjaak K\u00f6rver of Tilburg School of Theology I now lead the Dutch Case Studies Project in Chaplaincy Studies. See below.",

            "description": "Since the first invitations in 2015 more than sixty chaplains from various health care fields and from government institutions (military & prison system) have committed themselves to the Dutch Case Studies Project in Chaplaincy Care. The chaplains work in learning communities of 8 to 12 chaplains under supervision of an academic researcher. From the chaplains we ask a four year commitment in which period each will present two examples of good practice according to a set format. We are looking for feedback from clients (or significant others) and other professionals. We are interested in relations between practice and theory, in interventions and their effects, as well as in desired and reported outcomes. Research leaders are Sjaak K\u00f6rver of Tilburg School of Theology and myself. Interested persons can ask for more information on the nature of the project as well as on time and financial investment at mwalton@pthu.nl. Although the chaplains are \\participating as researchers on behalf of the profession, the research method which stays close to daily chaplaincy practice proves to be a rich and valuable learning process for one's own practice.",

The position was at the Protestant Theological University in Groningen where I worked as a lecturer from 2008 on. In 2019 I retired.\nI am still coordinating the Dutch Case Studies Project in Chaplaincy Studies in which more than sixty chaplains and 10 academic researchers are participating. The project is part of the University Center for Chaplaincy Studies (ucgv.nl), a joint effort of the Protestant Theological University and Tiblurg School of Catholic Theology.\nUntil my retirement in 2019 I chaired the Academic Advisory Board of the Dutch Association of Spiritual Caregivers.\nYou can have a look at my academic webpages https://www.pthu.nl/Over_PThU/Organisatie/Medewerkers/m.walton/",
