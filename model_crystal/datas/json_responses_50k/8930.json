    "summary": "I am an airport civil engineer specialized in the design of the airside infrastructure. My focus is on delivering a future-proof design that enables airport's operational success today and is flexible to accomodate its future infrastructural needs. To achieve this, I put the close coordination with the airport operator and stakeholders at the heart of each project.\n\nIn addition, I get highly motivated from the multi-disciplinary engineering and architectural challenges that an airport development project brings, and solving them within the dynamic and enthusiastic team of NACO.  \n\nI have experience in various type and size of projects, just to mention a few:\n- Expansion of Mega HUB airports like London Heathrow in UK;  the current busiest airport of Europe,\n- Greenfield airports like Mexico New International Airport, which had a construction budget of $13.3 Billion (US Dollars),\n- Rehabilitation and expansion of point-to-point airports like Kuk\u00ebs Airport and Tirana International Airport in Albania. \n\nMy expertise has delivered solutions in different phases of the airport infrastructure project: \n- from concept design to detail design, \n- preparation of tender documents for construction, \n- technical evaluation of bidders\u2019 offers, \n- construction support. \n\nOn top of standard airport projects, I am enthusiastic about innovative projects that might transform the future of aviation. Therefore, I am working on the development of the Circular Runway, and the Vertically Curved Runway. \n\nBesides my aviation knowledge, I have research experience on structural engineering in The Czech Republic, and I assisted several geotechnical consultancy works in Spain.",
