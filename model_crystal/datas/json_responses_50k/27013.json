    "summary": "I have primarily worked in academic computational and experimental research at the intersection of biology and physics. During my MSc, I began research in a soft condensed matter lab, studying the conformations and dynamics of small peptides (EAK-16 peptides). After that, I started my Ph.D. in Biophysical Chemistry lab (BCL) at Tehran University and Nader\u2019s lab at Sharif University of Technology, studying single-cell mechanical analysis of RBC treated with the statin family of drugs. As a postdoctoral researcher at Mashaghi\u2019s lab at Leiden University, I have been involved in several projects in the fields of single-molecule force spectroscopy, single-cell mechanics, computational biology, and 3D bioprinting. Currently, I am incorporating Circuit Topology (CT) theory and single-molecule/cell force spectroscopy methods towards studies of the Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions, with applications towards protein conformational disease.",
