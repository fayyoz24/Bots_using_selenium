    "summary": "Passionate about driving international business innovation, I am a resourceful professional skilled in developing effective marketing strategies across multiple channels. With expertise in project management, data analytics, B2B consulting, and campaign management, I have a proven track record of building strong client relationships, streamlining operational processes, and seizing emerging opportunities.\n\nCurrently, I serve as an External Delivery Coordinator at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, where I excel in coordinating global export and import operations. Through this role, I have gained extensive experience in logistics and supply chain management. Working closely with customers, suppliers, and freight forwarders, I ensure compliance with regulations while identifying opportunities for process improvement and cost reduction.\n\nAs a B2B E-commerce and Digital Marketing intern at Buyamia, I provide valuable guidance in establishing digital marketing plans and strategies for the startup. Conducting thorough needs assessments and market analysis, I develop comprehensive marketing plans encompassing SEO, PPC advertising, content marketing, email marketing, social media marketing, and influencer marketing. By continuously monitoring key metrics and staying updated on industry trends, I optimize strategies to effectively reach and engage target customers.\n\nDuring my internship at La Pradera in Spain, I leveraged data analysis to drive strategic decision-making and maximize ROI through targeted ad campaigns. My experience in sustainable business development at Ableboat aligned with the UN SDGs, integrating sustainability across operations, products, and services. I played a pivotal role in raising public awareness and promoting societal responsibility, utilizing diverse communication channels for impactful campaigns addressing labor exploitation.\n\nWith a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree in Global Project and Change Management from Windesheim Honours College, specializing in Sustainable Business and Innovation, I possess expertise in marketing strategy, agile project management, and business development. My enriching Erasmus semester at La Salle Barcelona studying Digital Business Design and Innovation broadened my horizons and honed my analytical skills. \n\nWith my diverse skill set and adaptability to ever-changing market conditions, I am committed to driving consistent growth and delivering exceptional results.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve remarkable outcomes.\nContact Info: touraysohna22@gmail.com",
