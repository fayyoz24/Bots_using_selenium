    "summary": "I am a lawyer and climate policy expert with 14 years experience advising governments, international organizations, and companies on solutions for the climate crisis. During this time, I have worked with dozens of governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, and companies across five continents to develop and implement practical and impactful solutions to address the climate and biodiversity crises. My work is profoundly interdisciplinary and integrates a deep understanding of national and international legal and policy frameworks to address forest and nature loss as well as the economic, financial, and political factors that determine their success. \n\nOver the course of my career, I have established myself as a leading expert on climate and forest law and policy, as well as an independent and creative thinker who is always looking for more effective and efficient ways to achieve impact. I have strong leadership qualities, including the ability to take initiative, inspire others, build support for ideas, and facilitate shared visions among disparate actors. I am also a skilled communicator who is able to effectively engage with high-level decision makers as well as journalists, technical experts, and members of the public.\n\nI have a particular interest in how to use legal and governance frameworks to address deforestation, including through leveraging human rights regimes and recognizing the rights of Indigenous people, Afro-descendent communities and other local and traditional communities. In addition, I am a leading expert on carbon pricing policies, a topic on which I have authored or co-authored numerous influential publications and governments across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America in designing, reforming, and communicating their policies.\n\nMy other areas of expertise include legal and institutional frameworks for addressing climate change, financial management of climate funds, carbon project structuring, contract negotiation, and dispute resolution.\n\nI also write a regular blog: https://medium.com/@darraghconway_45566",
