    "summary": "I'm a Professional in International Business with more than 10 years experience within International Organizations. Thanks to my job in the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I managed the transition of three different consular administrations over a period of 8 years, improving the administrative procedures and constantly working in challenging and diverse conditions. In addition, I have worked with individuals from several nations, all with diverse backgrounds. \n\nAfter a career change, I took an approach towards supply chain and logistics, and embarked on a self-taught journey, focusing on business analysis and project management. I improved my Microsoft Excel skills, learned key concepts of logistics, supply chain, and data analysis plus data visualization on Tableau. \n\nFor two years and a half, I worked within the sales side of a global logistics forwarder with a focus on implementing reporting tooling to support both customers and internal management.",
