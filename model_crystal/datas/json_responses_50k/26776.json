    "summary": "Eric P. Visser is medical physicist and radiation safety expert at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre since 2003. His present research is in the field of quantitative imaging and modeling for pre-clinical and clinical applications in nuclear medicine. Special focus is on dynamic PET and pharmacokinetic modeling, radionuclide dosimetry, and quantitative SPECT/CT. He was co-promotor of 7 PhD candidates, and (co-)authored 55 papers in international, peer-reviewed journals.\n\nBesides these research activities, as a medical physicist in nuclear medicine, he is responsible for the radiation safety and quality of equipment at the department and performs several educational taks in these areas. He participated in the Dutch committee that standardized PET/CT imaging for multicentre studies, which later evolved to the \u201cEANM procedure guidelines for tumour PET imaging\u201d. He authored and co-authored the chapters in the \u201cDutch Recommendations for Nuclear Medicine (2015) on radionuclide dosimetry and FDG-PET/CT standardization, respectively. He authored the chapter \u201cQuality Assurance of Equipment\u201d in the EANM \u201cBest practice in nuclear medicine\u201d Technologist Guide of 2007. Recently, he co-authored the EANM white paper \u201cAccurate molecular imaging of small animals taking into account animal models, handling, anaesthesia, quality control and imaging system performance\u201d. In 2007, he obtained the \u201cYoung Investigator Award\u201d of the Dutch Society for Medical Physics.\n",
