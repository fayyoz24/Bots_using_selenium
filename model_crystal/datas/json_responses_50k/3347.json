Since then every year we organize several events where funds that are collected are donated to big charitable organizations in Dubai. \nBesides organizing events to collect funds, we have also organized events to distribute basic food items to people in need in Dubai as well as India.\nThrough our own money, we have also sponsored education for multiple girl children in India (their parents are serving a life sentence in prison).\nMore info on our facebook page: www.facebook.com/umeedworld"
