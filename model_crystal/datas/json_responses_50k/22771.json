    "summary": "I am a first-generation American of Egyptian descent. I completed my first degree in Psychology, focusing on Society, Law, and Thought. I also have a second undergraduate degree in Political Science with an emphasis on International Politics, Law, and Human Rights.\n\nI am currently doing an MSc in Political Science, specializing in International Relations, Security, and Global Order. My focus is on decolonizing politics, especially regarding non-Western states and societies, in the Southwest Asia and North Africa region.\n\nI had the fantastic opportunity to work directly with NGOs in Athens, Greece, to assist people fleeing from civil war, extreme poverty, famine, and severe cases of trafficking in Southwest Asia and Africa. I currently work in the youth, peace, and security sector through capacity development for organizations and initiatives in the MENA region for protection and financial sustainability.\n\nI worked with two Professors at Arizona State University in research; completed three research projects heavily focused on social psychology, with two accepted for national conferences, and third in the process of being published: \n\nStowers, M., DeGouff, R., Rasoul, H., Porter, E., & Hall, D. (2018, April). Wielding the power of the purse: Social class as a predictor of ethical consumption. Poster accepted for presentation at the Annual Meeting of the Western Psychological Association, Portland, OR.\n \nPorter, E., DeGouff, R., Rasoul, H., & Hall, D. (2018, March). #Boycott: An investigation of value-based consumption among liberals and conservatives. Poster accepted for presentation at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality & Social Psychology, Atlanta, GA.\n \nRasoul, H., & Swank, E. (2018, April). Community Characteristics and Sexism in Restaurants. Poster awarded third-best presentation at Arizona State University Research Symposium.",
