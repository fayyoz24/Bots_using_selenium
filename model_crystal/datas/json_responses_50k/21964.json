    "summary": "I'm passionate about purpose-driven projects/initiatives, startups, entrepreneurship, leadership, people and project/process management. I thrive when I can contribute to projects where we want to make a difference and have a positive impact on society/environment etc. What I enjoy the most is when I can transform chaos into controlled chaos/improvised order as it is not about getting 100% perfectionism but making things happen and keep on moving (and improving)! \nMy strengths are leading teams, optimising processes, leading cross-team projects, data-informed operational excellence, putting structure and clarity with \"just do it\" mentality.\nMy Gallup strengths are:\n1. Relator \n2. Discipline \n3. Maximizer \n4. Adaptability \n5. Connectedness \n\nMoreover, I am a founder of Temple of Movement and Inner Peace. I find physical, mental and emotional health extremely important, especially nowadays. That's why, I've become a certified Yin Mindfulness Yoga, Barre and Pilates instructor and I teach in different studios and work places in Amsterdam!",
