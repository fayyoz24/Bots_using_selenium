She will partially leave her home base in the Paraplufabriek by entering all kinds of different spaces: spaces who offer new and different opportunities for disclosure and who will enrich her identity as an art institution. \n\nBy not only operating from her existing space, but by using other forms of territory, the Kunstenaarsinitiatief Paraplufabriek can exist in many different, fluctuating shapes.The artists collective will be in 2010 simultaneously and sometimes temporary only a poster, an essay, a medium, an exhibition, a spoken word or just a thought.   \n\nBy ignoring hierarchy in all her activities \u2013 a organised group exhibition forms a theoretical and parallel space to a published essay \u2013 the Kunstenaarsinitiatief Paraplufabriek will profile herself to the outside world by constant dynamics so she can obtain a certain position as an art institution.\nEvery space functions as a division and a stroke of an idea and also as a place where it can manifest itself.  By numbering every activity chronological, a database or a sort of archive will arise of every kind of space the Kunstenaarsinitiatief Paraplufabriek has entered and made her own.   \n\nHow do works of art relate to space, to specific properties of the space, to durability, to visibility or to the work of others? Every obstacle that we encounter we want to turn in a useable context and base for an exhibition.  \n\nThe starting point here is the exploration of the boundaries of an artists collective, of being a curator or an artist, of the making of exhibitions, of the public, the PR, the possible spaces.\nThe final goal is for us, the curators to engage in an intensive and experimental dialogue with the artists, where both parties can obtain new insights in their work and which will result into innovative, complex and self reflecting forms of making exhibitions.\n \n",
