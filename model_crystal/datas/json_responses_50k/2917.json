    "summary": "Hello, \n\nMy name is Lonneke, 37 years old with over 15 years of experience in strategic startup -and corporate innovation.\n\nI provide clients with a clear direction through the innovation processes, bringing new propositions, products and services to life, using combinations of innovation methodologies such as the Lean Startup, Agile / Scrum, Design Thinking -and Design Sprints.\n\nSince August 2022 I have been working at the Rabo Carbon Bank, a Rabobank initiative that develops carbon solutions, to reduce emissions and green house gasses. In a nutshell the Carbon Bank helps farmers to repurpose idle land by planting trees, or implement regenerative farming solutions like cover crops. For the dairy industry, use of feed additives are implemented and reduced fertilizer to reduce emissions. As a result this generates carbon offsets, that can be bought by corporate organizations to offset their residual emissions.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore I have facilitated over 130+ design sprints so far over the last 6 years. A Design Sprint is a 5 day process whereby we start with the 'problem to be solved' and work towards a functional prototype which we test on the 5th day with actual clients. Design Sprints help companies to quickly create new impactful business propositions, and test them, before making any expensive commitments. \n\nI have facilitated Design Sprints and guided longer term innovation projects for clients such as; \nQurrent / Greenchoice, Unilever, Greenpeace, Amnesty International, WTS Global, CERN, Randstad, ABN AMRO, EmployBridge, Roche, Independer, Loc.tax, Sanoma, , Friesland Campina, Engie, Centraal Beheer -and many more. And in collaboration with oneUp: Tommy Hilfiger / Calvin Klein (PVH), Airbus, Cargill, Schiphol, Rabobank, JDE, DHL, Aegon -and more. \n\nCurious and want to know more? Drop me a line or give me a call. \n\nBest regards, \nLonneke \n\nMail: lonneke@thesprint.agency\nWebsite: www.thesprint.agency\nTel: +31 6 46 89 26 76",

The 5-day Design Sprint program, based on the book 'Sprint' written by Jake Knapp (Google Ventures) has set the stage over the last 5 years in the innovation industry and changed the way we design and develop new products. \n\nAfter having worked for 10 years in the startup -and corporate innovation industry, Design Sprints got my attention and since then it has been one of my innovation passions.  \n\nI founded The Sprint Agency in 2017 and have been facilitating Design Sprints ever since then for companies such as; Unilever, Greenpeace, EmployBridge, WTS Global, CERN, Randstad, ABN AMRO, Roche, Independer, Loc.tax, Sanoma, Qurrent / Greenchoice, Friesland Campina, Engie, Centraal Beheer -and many more. And in collaboration with oneUp: Tommy Hilfiger / Calvin Klein (PVH), Airbus, Cargill, Amnesty International, Schiphol, Rabobank, JDE, DHL, Aegon -and more. \n\nCurious and want to know more?
