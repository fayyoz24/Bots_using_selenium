    "summary": "*WHO AM I*\nMy interests are very diverse, ranging from social psychology to corporate social responsibility, from physics to philosophy. This applies to my educational and professional interests, but also the sports I play and the people I hang out with.  I have always been very technical, with interest in numbers and rational thinking, but during my studies I have become increasingly interested in social behaviour of people in groups: how people interact, what influences their behaviour and how I can influence these group dynamics. During my Bachelor Human Resource Studies I discovered that so much of this has to do with communication, that I decided I wanted to learn more about this in my Master's degree. For my first job I found something that made me go back to my roots a bit with a focus on numbers, but combined with the social and communicative aspects that I have come to love.\n\n*WHAT DO I HAVE TO OFFER*\nI have a lot of experience leading teams and turning groups of individuals into well-functioning teams. My preferred leadership style is more laissez-faire, in order to empower individual team members and facilitating the team in whatever they need to work well. I also have a strong focus on wellbeing, as I believe this has a ways bigger impact on performance than most people realise, since it is very hard to measure.\nBesides my expertise in leadership and group dynamics from extracurricular activities and in communication and human resources from my studies, I have a very broad knowledge. I have always found it interesting to link different pieces of information together, and that is exactly what I will do when I work somewhere. I will not just complete my task, but also think about how that ties together in the big picture. Ideally, I would like to not only be able to think about the big picture, but also have a say in it.\n\n*WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR*\nCurrently I am happy with the job I have, so I am not looking for anything new. However, if you think you have something interesting for me I am always open to hear more about it.\nAs mentioned above, I prefer to work in a position where I can work on multiple different things, tying them together in the bigger picture. This is why I am currently drawn to the idea of (strategy) consulting and project management, but I know that it's possible in many more positions, so I am not limiting myself to anything.\n\nIf this sounds like we could mean something to each other, feel free to connect with me with a message about how you believe we can be of importance to each other.",

The theme of the congress was 'from stress to success' and featured three speakers and nine workshops. I was responsible for the actual content of the conference: finding the right speakers, determining the contents of the workshops and making sure every aspect of the conference aligned well with the theme.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this year of intense preparation, mainly about how I work in a group. Normally I like to keep a helicopter view, but for this project I challenged myself to be concerned with the details, sometimes even too much. I learned that I will often adapt to the needs of the team in a certain moment, which often turned out to be playing devil's advocate. I also learned a lot about communication, both towards my team members and the external parties I was in contact with. This has motivated me to pursue a master's in communication studies."

Since I was the chairperson, I was ultimately responsible for everything that happened. At the study trip we visited international companies like Philips and Unilever, but also more local companies. We experienced the local work ethic, and saw some big differences with the Western productivity we were used to.\n\nBesides learning about the differences in work ethic, I also learned a lot about myself. This was the first big project I chaired in a while, so I didn't have much experience yet in keeping a team motivated over a long period of time. This is something I learned over time, as well as redefining roles, trusting team members and ensuring the safety of all participants on the trip."
