    "summary": "Dominic Doyle was a senior optical engineer with the European Space Agency at their technical centre ESTEC in the  Netherlands. He was responsible for leading the industrial teams during the final phases of procurement, testing and integration of both the Herschel and Planck cryogenic space telescopes. He is a science graduate of both the National University of Ireland Maynooth and Trinity College Dublin. During his career in Ireland and the Netherlands he has specialised in optics and has a wide range of experience covering fields such as atmospheric physics, optical metrology and researching the effects of radiation on optical materials among others.\n\nHave worked in the last few years as a volunteer staff representative at ESTEC. As part of this work have gained on-the-job experience as a confidential counselor. Will continue this work in 2012 with some professional training. Interesting parallel skills development to the normal technical work ;-)",

We aim to organise and perform significant projects. Inherent in our working method is the cooperation at a high level between experienced amateur singers and professional musicians and other creative artists. The educational aspect of this cooperation plays a very important role, and is carried out for example by means of specialised workshops and master classes. We perform our own research on original sources and manuscripts and on the techniques used with the voice for specific types of performance, e.g. Gregorian (or other) chant styles, Baroque opera, spiritual music etc. In addition we also record and publish CD\u2019s and specialist musical scores. WE are a non-profit organisation.\n\nChairperson: Ton Hol\nSecretary: Andr\u00e9 Bruggeling\nTreasurer: Ben Weber\nArtistic leader: Margot Kalse"
