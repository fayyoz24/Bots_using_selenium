I demonstrated my organizational and time management skills by taking part in the organization of the launch event of the Israeli Medical Alumni Society for Israeli doctors, who graduated from Hungarian medical schools. I have significantly enhanced my interpersonal skills by participating in meetings for European and Israeli diplomats, where I got an insight to the building process of high-level bilateral diplomatic relations. I also accompanied the deputy head of mission and the commercial attach\u00e9 to the Ministry of Economy in Jerusalem to prepare the fourth annual Hungarian-Israeli Joint Economic and Social Committee. It was exceptionally useful to experience how negotiations in the field of interstate economic cooperation work. My responsibilities included producing a report on a highly important matter in Israeli politics that has an effect on both bilateral and international relations. By writing this report I conducted thorough research in Israeli politics and got acquainted with the local media outlets, demonstrating my dedication to the task and using some of my research skills that I have acquired at university.",
