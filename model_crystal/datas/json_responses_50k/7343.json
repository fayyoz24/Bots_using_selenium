    "summary": "I am a seasoned legal professional with 6+ years of experience in commercial, energy, arbitration, tax and international law. Professional focal points include arbitration, complex legal problem solving skills, tax planning structures, business advancement and development, contract drafting, team leadership, tendering, energy disputes, negotiation of international agreements, regulatory compliance, cross-functional team collaboration and project management. \n\nI have strong analytical skills and enjoy very much researching in various legal and technical topics. During the course of my professional experience I have worked with a myriad of inspiring professionals who have shaped my personality, ranging from yoga-enthusiasts to professional baseball players, fundraisers, environmental activists, entrepreneurs and tech-lovers. I have been blessed for having the opportunity to work at what I love most, work in multicultural environments, and travel to numerous regions as part of my professional responsibilities. I try to bring positivity and good energies to those around me.\n\nMusic and family are my other passions. Having studied piano for more than 10 years in a conservatory, I get amazed at the power of music to your soul and well-being. Being able to create music is a feeling I cannot get tired about.",
