I identified, evaluated and proposed for drilling the Ghafeer oil discovery, which at the time (1999) was the largest exploration find in PDO for the last 10 years. I gained experience in following through projects from seismic acquisition proposals, seismic processing, PSI reprocessing, regional prospectivity screening and prospect specific interpretation and maturation, through drilling and well testing, to final reserves booking, involving close liaison with geophysicists, drilling & reservoir engineers and production technologists. I was project leader for the Precambrian Athel silicilyte play, for which I was required to manage all exploration activities, ensuring that the subsurface evaluation (prospect/play generation, portfolio creaming, well proposals), seismic & drilling programs were optimised.",

As Operations Geologist I was responsible for all communications between exploration and appraisal departments in London and the operations and well engineering departments in Aberdeen and Lowestoft, producing daily operations reports for the exploration and appraisal departments. I acted as focal point for all communications with UK governmental bodies concerning obtaining approval to drill exploration and appraisal wells in the UK Offshore sector. I was focal point for communications with co-venturers on all drilling and well test activities. Typically 4 to 6 wells were operating at any one time, requiring daily attention, plus 6 to 10 other wells in various stages of planning, requiring coordination activity. As area geologist I was responsible for the geological evaluation and play analysis in the Outer Moray Firth and Quadrants 30 and 31, focusing on Lower Cretaceous Scapa sands, Upper Jurassic Fulmar sands, the Triassic sequence and the Rotliegend. I carried out studies on reservoir overpressures and on porosity/depth relations.",
