This provides students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and make international contacts in the maritime industry.\n\nDuring my tenure, I was actively involved in the overall management of the organization. One of the highlights of my experience was being part of the team that acquired and constructed a new lightweight carbon boat, and representing DWT at the International Waterbike Regatta in Berlin and Zagreb."
