    "summary": "Commercial, Marketing and Sales are still too often seen as separate departments, owning separate steps in the clients' journey. It has been my mission over the years to demonstrate how to drive client value by bringing it all together and the role predictive data-analytics and AI can play in this, enabling colleagues to be more successful.
