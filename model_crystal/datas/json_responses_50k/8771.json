    "summary": "I am an experienced PHP, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue developer and like to try out new tools, languages and frameworks. My scientific background helps me to formulate problems precise, untangle them and solve the root cause. However, web development itself isn't what makes me tick...\n\nAt a young age I was inspired to understand the world in the finest details. My curiosity has been a guiding principle in my professional life. I really enjoy to create something from the beginning, come up with a bright idea and develop it in a simple and clean solution that will add value for the long term. \n\nFlorisdeleeuw.nl distinguishes itself in its market by thoroughly understanding what the customer really wants to achieve or wants to solve and (e.g.) discussing alternative approaches. In combination with solid support, the customers highly appreciated the solutions build for them.\n",
