I am creating the original visual languages with interests in motion graphics, creative coding, and typography. Studio 165 is also experimenting graphic design as a cultural medium by organizing self-initiative design/culture projects as well. I have developed expertise in graphic design and relevant profession by working at LG, Social Venture Startup company, and graphic design studio, doing a variety of projects, such as print/web design, UX/UI research of mobile/web application, data visualization, and so on. \n\nAs an artist-researcher myself, I am currently working on the long-term research/production project \"The Matter Trilogy,\" through a film, scientific installation, and text. It explores the critical materiality of three selected matters, aimed at exposing the untold narratives of the humiliating ideologies geared in non-human materials. The project attempts to demonstrate how to unravel the intertwined arguments within the matter in the past, and current socio-political situation through the artistic/design-research methods - a critical visualization in and through filmmaking and scientific study on the materiality of matter.",

Transcending time and territories, the film cuts the temporal dimension of the geographies where the coins were born and follows the transformation of the monetary material as vitalized by capital.
