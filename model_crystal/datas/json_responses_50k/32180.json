Gerimedica is a SaaS company that builds software for elderly care homes in the Netherlands and I was responsible for harnessing the power of data analytics.\n\nWith my deep knowledge of data analysis and strategic vision, I build and led a team of professionals to design and implement BI solutions that provided valuable insights for our customers. I worked closely with senior executives to identify opportunities for growth and optimize resource allocation, ensuring that data-driven insights were aligned with business objectives.\n\nOne of my key achievements at Gerimedica was transforming healthcare professionals into data professionals by integrating the use of data into their day-to-day work. Through training and support, I helped these professionals develop the skills they needed to analyze data, make informed decisions, and improve efficiency. This approach not only supported their decision-making processes but also freed up valuable time that they could spend on providing care to patients. By empowering healthcare professionals to use data to drive decision-making, Gerimedica became a more agile and responsive organization.\n\nThrough my leadership, Gerimedica became a data-driven organization that leveraged analytics to make informed decisions. I built a culture of continuous improvement, fostered innovation and implemented best practices to maximize efficiency and minimize risks.\n\nIn addition to my achievements at Gerimedica, I am also a thought leader in the field of BI and Data Analytics, having contributed to industry publications and spoken at conferences. I am passionate about helping organizations leverage the power of data to drive growth and innovation and am excited about the opportunity to continue making an impact in this field.",
