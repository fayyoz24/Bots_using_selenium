    "summary": "Achieving results together which contribute to our society and environment is what drives me. I enjoy looking at spatial issues in particular the energy transition in relation to our society and I am fascinated by political dynamics. With my enthusiasm, I am able to quickly recognize opportunities and possibilities and to implement them or translate them into feasible project proposals. My environmental and urban planning background combined with my broad interest in people and organizations make me a connecting factor. I like to play an active role, whether this concerns team development or organizing social activities. I love to play volleyball, to sail, to ski and to make trips around our beautiful world.",
