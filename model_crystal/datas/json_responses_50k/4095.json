During the case competition, we as a team had to solve Harvard/Ivy business cases within 3 hours without consulting the internet. After the time was due, we needed to pitch our idea/strategy to a jury (business/academics) who acted as or were the representatives of the company.\n\nThis competition consisted of the 16 best business schools from all around the world, which resulted from a successfull qualifying round in November 2016. Our university qualified as a top-4 ranking team!\n\nAfter a very successfull poule-fase where we came out as the group winner and we continued to the quarter finals. Unfortunately our story ended there, based on a split decision.\n\nMore info: www.nibscasecompetition.org",

The aftersales includes the sales of accessories and spare parts, but also other Value Added Services (E.g. warranties).\n\nThe main objective of this research was to develop a strategy for FCA on how to enhance partner retention in the aftersales market. In order to develop the perfect strategy, I have conducted both primary and secondary research in order to gain great insights of the needs and wants of the market whilst observing the current trends.\r\n\nThe main outcome from the secondary research (includes reports, theories and models) was that the automotive industry is in a strong shift towards being a more service-orientated market, where price has become less important in comparison with quality of service delivery. By optimizing the value added services, FCA can ensure more loyalty in the market.\n\nI have presented the company a strategy on how to tackle this together with an in-depth implementation plan.",
