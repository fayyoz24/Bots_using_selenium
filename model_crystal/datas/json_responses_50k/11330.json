They had joined forces to make a substantial difference in the world of recruitment (including process outsourcing) and outplacement. Topshore is active in several heavy technical industries such as machine building, heavy lifting and shipbuilding.\n\nI started as an Account Manager focusing on bringing in new business and helping those clients with finding Engineers, Project Managers and Engineering Managers. Besides that, I had an all-round startup role meaning I did marketing activities and did everything that was needed to build Topshore. This included business trips abroad to build a network in Spain. During the pandemic I was involved with outplacement programs as some companies unfortunately had to cut back in staffing. Later the market became positive again and I became more involved as a recruitment specialist within the MeeMaken Group by helping the companies KenzFigee and LiftWerx Europe with their recruitment process and HR activities. A short overview of the things I was involved in: \n\n-\tSales\n-\tRecruitment\n-\tMarketing\n-\tHelping new junior team members \n-\tRecruitment advice (sparring partner HR, COO, CEO) \n\nWhen I left Topshore I had mixed feelings; proud of the team we built, excited to start a new chapter and sad to say goodbye. I am proud of what we accomplished with all the hard work and perseverance.",
