Alongside supporting on the inbox I also managed my own new joiners, company inductions, probations, fixed term contract extensions, contract amendments, leavers, maternity leave employees, training courses, lunchtime tutorials among other projects and updated employee records in Oracle. Within my role in the Services Team I also supported other HR Departments with any queries that they had and helped from an administrative perspective.\n\n* I also spent 4 months working within the Talent Development team as part of my rotation schedule. Within the T&D team the work was a lot more project based and I spent most of my time working on the Global Orientation Programme for the new CDP\u2019ers joining in Sept 2014 and the Recruitment Campaign for the 2015 CDP and SIP. This involved liaising with marketing agencies, the internal marketing team and our recruitment team. I was also involved with the testing of our new Applicant Tracking System.\n\n* As part of the graduate programme I also spent some within the Underwriting and Claims departments to gain a deeper understanding of their roles and processes. Alongside these rotations I worked with the Claims team on designing new marketing material for them and conducted a 3 month research project on whether Catlin\u2019s stock market valuation was fairly valued. This involved conducting interviews with Senior Members of the business including the Chairman and CEO, comparing our financial results, global footprint and product mix with those of our competitors globally and analysing analyst reports on all insurance companies both within and outside of the London Market. This project was then delivered to a panel whilst I was in Cologne.",
