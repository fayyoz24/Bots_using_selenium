    "summary": "I am a Dutch citizen and was awarded my Ph.D. degree in Mass Communications/Media Studies in Australia. In the last twenty-five years, I have studied, lived and worked in America, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. My experience of living and working in different countries and various cultural environment has undoubtedly broadened my horizons. Also, my previous work experience in senior student administration, teaching/higher education, international trade promotion/publications and student affairs has helped to shape my personality and enabled me to establish a keen and industrious work attitude essential to my future career. \n\nSince January 2001, Emerson College, a Performing Art and Communication College in Boston, USA, have hired me as the Director for Faculty and Academic Support Services at their Study Abroad program in the Netherlands. My current job assignment requires me to manage a team of more than 20 adjunct faculty (instructors) catering to almost 90 American students attending a three-month External Program on our Dutch campus. My current job also requires me to design, execute and monitor policies catered to enhancing the cultural learning, traveling and living experiences of American students. Much of the daily work tasks require management skills regarding budgeting, training staff members and overseeing projects and excursions activities.",
