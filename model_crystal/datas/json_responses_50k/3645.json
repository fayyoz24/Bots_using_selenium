In collaboration with students, partners and colleagues, I develop, organize and facilitate inspiring (Bieb Inspireert) and connecting (Bieb Verbindt) activities, such as the 'Student Meet Up: Game Night' and the 'Shut Up & Write' study sessions. Bieb Werkt is the name of the reservation system for study and workstations at the library, and also the monthly newsletter for young people and students that I create in our CRM tool. \n\nPart of my role consist of 'traditional librarian' tasks and customer service at the main desk. For instance, I help library visitors with subscription, and with borrowing, returning, reserving and locating books. In the context of the 'Informatiepunt Digitale Overheid' (IDO), I assist guests with a wide range of questions they may have about the (digital) government, (social) institutions, and electronic devices. \n\nMy previous role as Project Assistant at the library resulted in a close collaboration with the Communication Team, and an expansion of my CRM duties. The proceedings of the research I conducted in my former role resulted in the installment of a project team which aims for continuous growth. As part of this team, my tasks include research and data analysis for which I use various tools such as our CRM platforms. \n\nMore information: \n- Student Agenda of Bibliotheek Venlo: https://bibliotheekvenlo.op-shop.nl/?tags%5B%5D=78\n- #studentsofvenlo and (potential) partners: feel free to get in touch with me anytime if you share my mission!",

My tasks include project management, action planning, multi-method research, data analysis, critical assessment of internal tools, reporting, and providing advice. \n\nThe project assignment is to use a mixed-method approach (quantitative data analysis and qualitative research) to map the target audience in the smaller locations of the Library Venlo (the 'Kernen' Arcen, Belfeld, Blerick, Tegelen, and Velden), and to give advice on a successful rollout of the programs and activities of the City Library to these 'Kernen'. The ProBiblio Business Model Canvas was used to create a business plan for this aim. The project resulted in presentations of the findings to multiple teams (Director, Leads of Public Services and Programs, Business Services, Communication, and Community Librarians), and two business and marketing plans (a Community Librarian version, and a Communication version). \n\nThe research and its findings have been a stepping stone to further explore the opportunities in the form of a project team of which I am a member.",

Aan de hand van de theoretische concepten occulture, herbetovering, invention of tradition, perceptie en de wisselwerking tussen toeschrijving en toe-eigening onderzoeken we de verbeelding van de geschiedenis en de toenemende popularisering van magische denkbeelden vanaf de Romantiek. We gaan dieper in op religieuze identiteitsvorming binnen de moderne magie van de 'Westerse Esoterische Traditie', New Age spiritualiteit, hekserij en Wicca, het hedendaags Paganisme en aanverwante religieuze stromingen. Aan het einde van deze cursus begrijpen we de zoektocht van de moderne mens naar een authentieke religieuze identiteit beter en zullen we het ontstaan van nieuwe religieuze bewegingen kritisch kunnen evalueren.",
