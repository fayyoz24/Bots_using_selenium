This included the design, development, and delivery of both open and custom programs; the former are short open-enrollment courses typically of 3-5 days duration while the latter are customized courses of varying duration for specific multinationals. My emphasis was on expanding RSM\u2019s Open Program portfolio with market-relevant offerings.\n\n\u25ba Systems Design\n\nIn this role I initiated internal projects aimed at improving a plethora of departmental structures and processes that support program development. While originating from personal needs in Open Program development, these efforts have since scaled towards systemic innovations that influence multiple functions in the department. As such, projects have been adopted and adapted by cross-function teams as a means to improving department-wide effectiveness. As a budding change manager in an extremely complex corporate and academic environment, I realized many of these projects to various levels of success.\n \nResults of the following key responsibilities are further detailed in the Projects section below:\n\nOpen Programs\n\u2022\tDiploma Program in Digital Transformation\n\u2022\tPersuasive Leadership\n\u2022\tSuccessful People Management\n\u2022\tDoing Business With China\n\u2022\tLeaders in Sustainability Management\n\u2022\tIntegrated Reporting\n\nCustom Programs\n\u2022\tSwedbank (www.swedbank.com) Digital Transformation in Banking\n\u2022\tGAIN (www.gainhealth.org) Food & Nutrition Public-Private Partnerships\n\nSystems Design\n\u2022\tPortfolio Management\n\u2022\tOpen Program Development\n\u2022\tMarket Research\n\u2022\tProgram Administration",

In doing so, I often leveraged instructional technology to increase the scalability and quality - and thereby the effectiveness - of each learning activity. In designing and executing six different core subjects as well as the Honors Program I experienced the importance of co-creation with students, faculty, and staff, and in utilizing technological innovations to meet the expectations of both users and management.

My immediate contribution was to business formation, where I helped write the business plan of the startup for use in fundraising efforts. Later, I was asked to produce a number of reports on the potential of Ghana as an initial launching market: a market research plan, a logistics plan, and a product selection report. I enlisted three student colleagues with complementary skill sets and managed the team towards the successful completion of each report. The company has since launched successfully in Ghana based in no small part on recommendations from these reports.\n\nMy involvement with the company after the intensive first 5 months has been in an advisory position to the CEO, where I have made recommendations when requested regarding business strategy, business growth and upscaling, fundraising, and marketing. \n"

The organization aims for universal access to education and focuses its efforts on developing countries. The immediate issue they were facing was the withdrawal of government funding within the nonprofit sector and the subsequent gap between revenue and project-allocated funds.\n\nTogether with three other consultants, we assessed and analyzed the fundraising mechanism of Edukans as well as their project-allocation processes. Aiming to fill the funding gap, we restructured their corporate fundraising initiatives as well as the associated internal management support structures. Moreover, project proposals and funding allocation procedures were standardized to remove inefficiencies and further shorten the funding gap.

My analysis of business and stakeholder management weaknesses and opportunities and subsequent execution and monitoring of various significant changes at the academy ultimately: removed curricular inefficiencies, improved relations with the community, and reduced its operating costs by 12.5%. Within this unfamiliar cultural landscape I was able to generate significant support by making the changes visible and tangible to all stakeholders. This demonstration motivated the CEO to embark on similar processes in other areas of SAN Nepal.\n\nSince then, the organization has successfully scaled up its various operations within Nepal and I have maintained an advisory role to the CEO throughout, advising him on business management, innovation processes, and fundraising initiatives when requested. \n"
