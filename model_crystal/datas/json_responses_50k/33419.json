The clinical perspectives of the project were assessed by performing in-depths interviews with experts. This study fits into the bigger project of the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. This study is mainly designed to investigate the potential reasons of the high prevalence of obesity and T2D in African migrants, by exploring contextual factors, social circumstances, lifestyle and biological aspects as well as their complex interplay. \n\nThe internship was completed by the production of a written thesis and oral presentation.\n\nThe internship was graded with an 8.0/10",

I received training in molecular biology techniques (qPCR, flow cytometry, FISH) by the members of the team in Bordeaux. The project was set up in collaboration with the group of K.
