    "summary": "As an IT professional I like to be involved in innovative and new IT technology driven projects and programs, but with a view on the practical side for the implementation. Always keep the goal in mind and solve problems by using my wide practical knowledge and experience in the IT. Designs high available and scalable infrastructures with detailed knowledge of infrastructure and middleware components, tools/software and private/public cloud offerings.\n\nMy strong team player and professional skills appear best when working in projects together with teams and approach it in an agile way. Due to my wide IT experience, knowledge and overview over the IT landscapes my role is best described as a Solution Architect who assists and coaches devops teams on design and implementation phase. Align with domain and enterprise architects and other stakeholders and assist with solving technical issue like performance.\n\nThe roots of my knowledge and experience arose from implementing a large number of projects based on Java solutions which includes IBM platforms and middleware like WebSphere Application Server, MQ series, Tivoli monitoring, development tooling like IBM RAD. Also, the advanced skills of designing and implementing high available infra and middleware architectures where developed. Infrastructure and middleware projects like www.mijning.nl, ATM solutions, Cards and mobile solutions, call Centre solutions are successfully executed by creating and implementing HA designs. The designs and implementations include a safe and sound security model which are based on risk assessment.\n\nIn the new modern world of cloud computing classic projects in classic datacenters are converted to solutions using the cloud technology. New IT designs are made for ING Private Cloud (IPC) but also for Microsoft Azure and AWS. Solutions are designed using VMs for some larger projects but also  Container based technology (Docker) managed by OpenShift (Kubernetes)for Microservices / APIs. \nBasis is a pipeline which supports continuous integration and delivery (CICD). Deployment of infra is done in a modern way using infra as code (Terraform). Design and implementation are done keeping risk in mind and thus uses a solid and sound security model. Policy checking (e.g. Sentinel) during deployment via infra as code  is done to be in control.\n\nA Curriculum Vitae is available if you have a nice and interesting job offer for a contractor which fits a Solution Architect, Infrastructure Architect or Cloud Architect role.",
