Gofilex handles e-deliveries to venues in, amongst others, the Benelux, Germany, Switzerland and the Nordic countries. Our customers ranged from small content owners who operate nationally to big studios like Disney, Warner, Fox, Universal and Paramount.\n\nMy work included the download, inspection, archiving and delivery of DCP's and other content. For these tasks, we used different systems, server set ups and applications. For these, I handled some (remote) maintenance.\n\nTo ensure timely delivery, we continually improved our methods and systems and I was involved in researching them and providing feedback to our IT department. Additionally, I was one of the people responsible for the functional management of the Gofilex Portal, always working with the developers and the business to improve the Portal and keep it running.\n\nAdditionally, I was responsible for the support we did for live events organised through the Gofilex network, as well as providing participating theaters with the information they needed. As such, I reached out to broadcasters and other live content owners who wanted their live content streamed to cinemas.\n\nMoreover, we helped venues when they experienced problems with the playout of the content, even when the content had been delivered in order. As such, my previous experience screening content in an arthouse cinema and print traffic at film festivals proved very useful, while also learning about special formats and the quirks they have.",
