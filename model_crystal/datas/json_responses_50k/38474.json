    "summary": "I use math, domain knowledge and scientific methods to gain understanding and reach valuable insights for the companies I work in. What I enjoy most is to work with a team on interesting problems that impact business decisions, and while doing it get to learn and understand new things, as well as share my knowledge. In my career I\u2019ve had several changes in environment and fields, which strengthened my ability to adapt to new circumstances, to quickly learn new skills, and to be a versatile team member. I am also skilled at presenting and explaining complex concepts in a simple way, and creating a story out of the data so that anyone in the company can understand it and give their input.\n\nKeywords: Data Analysis, Algorithm Development, Data Science, Data Visualization, Modeling and Computer Simulations, Analytical and Statistical Estimation Techniques, PhD, Python, R, SQL, Tableau, MATLAB, C++",

The overall satisfaction of the speakers with the event and of the team with the quality of the talks was significantly higher than previous years, thanks to all the new procedures I developed with my team.\n\nTEDx conferences are independently organised TED-like events, which follow TED's mission of \"ideas worth spreading\"\u200b. At the event, a series of speakers present their innovative ideas in an engaging way to a broad audience. We believe that this can open people's minds to new ideas and world-views, and inspire them to change their lives and the world, which is what motivated me to work in this amazing organisation.",
