Multiple studies showed a decrease in infections by the norovirus in mice, when their food contained oregano. To test the hypothesis that elderly in care homes on a oregano filled diet are less likely to be infected by the norovirus, our team designed a research proposal and explanatory material such as posters and video\u2019s.\nDue to our research and creativity we managed to win the national finale of the viruskenner project, leaving 11 other team behind.  \nThe Viruskenner project is an international initiative of the Viroscience Lab and the Cirion Foundation.",
