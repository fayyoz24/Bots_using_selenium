    "summary": "Growing up in a third world country and in lower class, I've been inspired by my family on the power of knowledge and accessible education. Throughout my whole life, I heard from my parents and grandparents that they didn't have the opportunity to get higher education. This motivated me to pursue my passion for writing and research in innovative fields, and make educational resources more accessible to the general public through my work and talents.\n\nMy professional experiences happened in a wide range of fields. From Logistics to Communications, I developed a strong base of soft skills, which later helped me advance into my actual expertise. As a Content Specialist, I've worked with brand strategists, creative directors and user experience designers on building brands of companies from the Educational, Scientific and Psychedelic Research fields.\n\nAlong my work journey, I've worked on brand development, strategic communications and rebranding projects. Through these assignments, I developed research, analytical and writing skills that help small businesses in the educational and scientific field to drive revenue through delivering high value content to their customers. My expertise is to turn complex subjects into various compelling and accessible communication forms, but mostly written. This way, I am able to bring value to people from making knowledge more accessible.",
