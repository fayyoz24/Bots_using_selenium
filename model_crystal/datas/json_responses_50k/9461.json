    "summary": "I am an architect and city planner with significant design and planning experience from nearly 20 years of professional experience. I have worked on everything from the intimate spaces of a family house to the magnitude and complexity of a territory. \n\nMy design philosophy embraces the principles of plurality joined together by a pervasive spatial and social framework that binds us into one global society. This can take many forms and is always adapted to the needs of my clients as well as the immediate environment. \n\nI strongly believe that design and planning should contribute to further our civilisation. The projects I lead respond to indeterminable future changes, respecting environmental qualities and responding to social and economic needs. \n\nWorking with teams of designers, technical specialists and stakeholders is the greatest pleasure of my job. My goal is to bring out the best in others through our involvement in a common goal and make every work an opportunity to learn and become better.\n\nI am currently conducting research on the extended territories of urbanisation in Southeast Asia. I am especially interested in how people construct ideas of geographic space through the medium of water. As river, waterway, irrigation canal or even subterranean resource water pervades our being and influences how we think of our place in the world. What will happen when the flow of rivers is reduced and the canals gradually become dry? Will our conception of space in the world change? How can we help others prepare for these radical changes to our environment and our place within it?",
