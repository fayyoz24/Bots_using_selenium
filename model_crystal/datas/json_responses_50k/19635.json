    "summary": "I have recently relocated to Amsterdam and my entire work experience so far has been in India.\n\nI specialize in teaching English and Social Science as subjects. Over my one and a half years of teaching experience, I have won several accolades for choreographing numerous children\u2019s programs and activities like mime acts, singing, dances, dance dramas, skits, mono acts, etc. The parents of my students have always been very pleased with my sincerity and my level of dedication towards my work.\n\nMy prior experiences include customer service, settlements, quality analysis as well as training (both new hires and on-floor associates). I am experienced in training the associates in terms of communication (which includes grammar, tone, intonation, speech clarity, sound and pronunciation), soft skills, telephone/verbal etiquettes, email etiquettes, accent neutralization, personality development and customer handling skills. I have immense exposure to different European and American culture as well as linguistic skills.",
