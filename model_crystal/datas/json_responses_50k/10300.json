The shop accepts book donations, with 75% of its revenues given to charities including Oxfam and Amnesty International. \n\n  During my time here, I contributed to the usual activity of running the shop: taking in new books, doing research on each to determine their pricing, based on the existing code, then sorting them on the shelves according to their determined category, as well as dealing with customers, helping them find what they needed and aiding them in their purchases. This helped me improve my inventory and sorting skills, as well as my sales aptitudes. \n\n  In April 2015 we successfully organized a 'Super Sale Week' event, which raised awareness of the shop, and totaled a revenue of over 500 Euros in just 5 days, a fantastic result for Books4Life. I have also participated in awareness-raising initiatives, both on campus, through the distribution of flyers and the design of shop signs, as well as through social media.",

Some of these consisted of cleaning rubbish from green areas, such as parks or fields. Others were Recycling Days, which meant working at a provisional recycling centre in my hometown or nearby villages, where people had the opportunity to bring their old, unusable electronics and household items, in exchange for a raffle ticket, which, if a winning one, could claim one of several prizes.
