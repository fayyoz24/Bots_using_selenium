We believe that through awareness campaigns, students will become more conscious of their consumption choices, leading to a reduction in plastic usage and more circular thinking. Some examples of the events we host are Zero waste weeks or city clean up events. \u2018Post plastic generation\u2019 has given me the ability to work well in a team and coordinate tasks effectively. Furthermore, it has given me the chance to take initiative by organising events and thinking of new actions to achieve our goal. As part of post plastic generation, we have successfully campaigned for many environmental issues such as recycling on our university campus and have organised various climate strikes and other similar protests.",
