The deployment of urban wind energy systems gives rise to multiple visions of how cities with extensive presence of wind turbines might look like in the future. These visions set in motion transformations of various urban systems. \n\nMy PhD project investigates how visions of urban wind energy futures open up new ways of integrating wind energy in the urban environment. It interrogates how these visions affect the (re)design of buildings, infrastructure networks, and public spaces in cities.\n\nThis PhD project is a part of a larger Horizon 2020 project zEPHYR: Towards more efficient exploitation of on-shore and urban wind energy resources.",
