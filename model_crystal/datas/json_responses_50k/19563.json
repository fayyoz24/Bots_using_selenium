    "summary": "The latest research work I have done involves proposing and writing a new research grant on cancer-on-chip technology. I have worked on breast cancer-on-chip 3D in-vitro model, to study migration of breast cancer cells in the new system. Further, I also have extensive experience in Molecular Oncology and Immunology. \nAs a person I am driven, determined and easily shoulders new responsibilities. Specialized in Oncology, enjoys working in a team with several scientific disciplines. A hard-worker who is intuitive and willing to learn. As a creative researcher, I am actively seeking for a challenging position in the life sciences industry.",
