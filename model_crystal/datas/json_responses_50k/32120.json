The purpose of my volunteer work was to use my skill talking in Norwegian, getting new contacts and friends, and being part of the city where i lived.\n\nI worked 35 hours in this festival, in 5 different events.\n\nAs part of the 'host team' I worked in various events to create comfortable atmosphere for the audience. Tasks that I have done are: \n- responsible at 'bycicle hotel' : as a green festival, there was a space where the visitors could leave their bycicle (s) safely; with or without keylock. \n-    counting visitors in historisk marked; keeping track on how many people interested in knowing how the market was in the viking era\n- checking tickets in indoor and outdoor concerts\n- serving alcoholic beverages to corcert audience (and making sure, they are not underage)"

I get some fresh air, practice my Dutch, and do something for community. \nThis garden is a  good place to introduce kids about food and nature. All the plants in the garden are organic. And it's free entrance "
