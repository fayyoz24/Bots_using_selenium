'Voice banking' helps those with MND by digitising their voice, so as the disease progresses they can still sound like themselves. But only a fraction have done so \u2014 most put it off because they find the process difficult and impersonal.\n\nWe've worked with VMLY&R, Dell Technologies & Intel to create \"I Will Always Be Me\". Working with author Jill Twiss and artist Nicholas Stevenson, a story book was created that could be read aloud for people with MND to express what they\u2019re going through. And the story contains all the syllables needed to accurately bank their voice in less than 30 minutes \u2014 turning the cold, solitary process of voice banking into an experience that\u2019s full of life.\n\n\"I Will Always Be Me\" has become the most popular choice for voice banking in the UK today. Over 72% of those recently diagnosed with MND are now using the book to bank their voice. The launch campaign generated over 1.2 million social media engagements and 200 million PR media impressions, driving more people to bank their voices and raising awareness around MND.",

Designed to debut groundbreaking new products, partnerships, integrations and other key announcements, the tech-forward experience encompassed a variety of touchpoints built to demonstrate Ledger\u2019s positioning at the forefront of Web3 and digital assets like NFTs. \n\nThe brand took over the 12,000-square-foot Moonlight Studios in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood for the event, leveraging the venue\u2019s auditorium space and XR stage to livestream all of the Ledger Op3n\u2019s programming and presentations. On-site, attendees could explore a hero product display housed in custom resin casing that, when picked up from its pedestal, triggered a reaction that enveloped the room in a dynamic content spectacle with digital screens showcasing everything from animation graphics to branded content. Another highlight: an NFT Marketplace vignette with 24 LED screens and four interactive POAP and NFT minting stations teasing Ledger\u2019s new Marketplace product in the leadup up to the official launch. Steve Jobs would be proud.\n\nSee more here: https://www.eventmarketer.com/event/2022-experience-design-technology-awards/",

Being ambassador for some of the largest NGO\u2019s in the world like the Aids Funds, WWF, Oxfam Novib, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Save The Children and Care Nederland have helped me to work professionally and responsibly and also allowed me to learn a lot about these large companies. Starting at the bottom and working my way up I have especially gained knowledge on influencing and understanding people and their behaviour. Motivation and also setting goals (targets) are some of the key  elements that have helped me during my tasks at Pepperminds and are also skills that I have developed and become tremendously good at. \n\nFurthermore working with short- and time-specific goals and also balancing work and fun have been the core elements of the activities at Pepperminds. Supporting each other and working in teams are some of the other responsibilities that was expected as a senior sales captain. Introducing new people to the workflow, but also the introduction with the vision and goals of the company are also \nimportant tasks that the job description consists of.",
