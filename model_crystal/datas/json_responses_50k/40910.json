    "summary": "In March of 2023 I successfully defended my PhD dissertation \"Introducing the Resilient Peace System: New Potentials for Peace in Kosovo and Medell\u00edn\". Over the course of my PhD research, I build on my experience with both academic and policy research in the area of among others peacebuilding, resilience, transitional justice, social cohesion, and the rule of law. As a result, my thesis I present the Resilient Peace System (RPS), an analytical tool to unpack the complexity of conflict-affected situations, with the aim to offer new opportunities for durable peace. \n\nInterested in learning more about the RPS? Please send me message, I am eager to share my results, both among academia and practitioners within the peace and development sector. \n\nBesides this, I currently work at the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) Amsterdam, at the department of Political Science and Public Administration. As such, I am part of the international security team and coordinate courses as \"Peace and Conflict: From Theory to Practice\".",
