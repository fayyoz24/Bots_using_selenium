    "summary": "Guido Guerra (Oviedo, Spain, 1988). I finalized my Business Management Degree at the University of Oviedo in 2012 and a few months later in Economics, having studied as well in Mexico, Turkey and Malta.\n \nAfter graduation, I obtained a scholarship to study in Madrid an International Business Management Master endorsed by the Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade (ICEX) which allowed me to work at the Embassy of Spain in Vietnam as an International Trade Advisor for SMEs and afterwards move to Sidney (Australia) to work as Business Development Manager for CAF.\n \nIn 2016, following my passion which is economic development, I joined the Dutch Foundation Agriterra as country representative for Bolivia to advise farmers organizations of all sectors (cattle, cocoa, coffee, dairy, oilseeds, poultry, quinoa, rice) how to enhance their services, commercialization, governance and financial management. Almost at the same time, I started a PhD in Economics at the Autonomous University of Madrid to investigate the effect of the internationalization process on small firm\u00b4s productivity, for which I was awarded honors cum laude in Juanuary 2020.\n\nMost recently, since August 2020 I work for Agriterra Foundation as senior analysts and since August 2022 as team lead for the monitoring and evaluation department. \n\nFanatic of books and always keen on traveling I seize any opportunity to visit every corner of this great world to discover local customs and traditions, as well as getting a taste of the regional folklore and cuisine.",
