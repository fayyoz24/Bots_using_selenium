In addition to these insights I was able to see how one of the biggest fashion magazines in the world operates in The Netherlands and I was honored to have been able to work with such great, ambitious, hard working talented and creative colleagues the past few months. Some of the great experiences that I've had included being a fashion assistant on set during shoots, working and supporting the creative team for the print version. Writing and pitching ideas for the online platform. Handeling and processing e-mails, as well as working for a large company. I could have not wished for a better head start in this industry.\n\nI have worked with the following stylists: Thomas Vermeer, Kelly Staa en Esther Coppoolse",
