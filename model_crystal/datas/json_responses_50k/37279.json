The MoonLight is an affordable solar-powered LED lighting solution for the poor rural population of Cambodia that has no access to the electricity grid. It is intended to replace the traditional kerosene lamps, which are toxic, dangerous and have high running costs.\n\nSince October 2009 the MoonLight is sold a few thousand a year in Cambodia ($15) and the market is extended with Tanzania and Malawi. The MoonLight is awarded with two prizes: the 'Toon van Tuijl Design Award 2008' and the 'CIFIAL Design Award 2009'.\n\nMore about the product can be found on: http://www.kamworks.com/product-details/moonlight/",
