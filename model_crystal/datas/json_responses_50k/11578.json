Theo has two roles:\n1 - Lead for system migration and automation: work with CBS as external supplier and the internal sales team to define correct scope of customers / materials / order types to be migrated. For each phase we did one test migration in a sandbox, and subsequently we migrated in our quality system as preparation for the UAT. Phase 1 of the project (APAC and US entities) went live on May 1st 2023 and Phase 2 (EU entities) went live at the end of May 2023. All sales order and invoices flows are now rerouted via the enterpreneurs through our regional billing entities towards our customers. Sometimes we had parallel activities for phase 1 and 2, so we had to manage these activities and user involvement carefully as not to overload the team.\n\n2 - Support in the setup of plants abroad and VAT determination for all sales activities in the new setup.\nHere another (small) team was in charge and Theo supported the go-live where was needed.",
