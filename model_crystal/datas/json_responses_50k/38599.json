    "summary": "I am a Belgian-Indonesian recent International Law Cum Laude graduate from Leiden University living in the Netherlands. I currently work for Omnia Retail as part of their Junior Consultant Traineeship program. Prior to living in the Netherlands I lived in Indonesia, Singapore and Australia having also completed internships in the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nMy 2 internships were at L'Oreal Luxury as part of their marketing department and at Phillips Collection as a logistics intern in the UK and US respectively. My internship at L'Oreal in the summer of 2019 had me manage and support marketing initiatives at in person L'Oreal sales points. This had me working with domestic retailers serving as an intermediary between them and different branches at L'Oreal. On the other hand my internship at Phillips Collection in the summer of 2022 involved me creating new procedure to improve supply chains by working with suppliers in South and South-East Asia as well as create new warehouse procedures. These new procedures aimed to improve sustainability, profitability and safety of the wider Phillips Collection supply chain.\n\nIn the Summer of 2022 I graduated from Leiden University College, the honours program of Leiden University. During my studies I majored in International Law, graduating Cum Laude and as class representative for the graduating class of 2022.  I focused my studies on socio-legal studies writing my thesis on the legislative developments of the Indonesian education system. On top of academics I was heavily involved in faculty decision making as an elected student member of the Universities Advisory Council as well as College Council in 2022. \n\nWhilst at University I was regularly engaged in student life chairing and working on multiple student committees such as but not limited to the sports committee, travel and debate as well as theatre events for over 600 people. In conjunction with that I was also elected as board member of Fortuna, the faculty study association between August 2020 and July 2021.\n\nBeyond that I was also fortunate enough to start up Vision-Swipe, a student committee where we had the chance to interview and write articles with notable individuals including the then EU Special Envoy to Afghanistan focusing on active negotiations with the Taliban and the Belgian Ambassador to Japan on women in the diplomatic field.",
