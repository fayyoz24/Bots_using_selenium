Samen met mijn team kwamen we met een succesvol PR plan, want de boer in kwestie heeft tegenwoordig een maandelijkse column in De Stentor.\n\nNaast het PR plan kwamen wij ook met een PR stunt.

The project became a little bit bigger, than we thought it would be, but a challenge doesn't scare me off. With the organisation talent/skills I already had, some extra research about project management, some assistents and great guidance from my tutor at CCOG Duiven and my economy teacher, we accomplished an event for 300 people between the age of 16-23. \n\nHeartBeatz was an event organised for the local youth from Zevenaar and a great opportunity for upcoming DJ's and bands to show their skills to a bigger audience to become more well-known. Heartbeatz was as well an event with charity goals, supported by HOPE XXL. \n\nHOPE XXL: http://www.hope-xxl.com/nl/index.php\n\nAt the event there were three area's: 1 area for bands, 1 area for DJ's and 1 area to be introduced to HOPE XXL and their activities. \n\nWe arranged some great sponsors back then: Heineken, Damn Sound and Light, Rabobank, CCOG Duiven and several well-known DJ's like The Afro Bro's and Frequencerz\n\nIn the end I received a 9 for this project that got a little out of hand. But it was all worth the stress and I've learned a lot from it. ",
