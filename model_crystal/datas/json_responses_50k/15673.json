    "summary": "(I am not very responsive over here, it's best to contact us via: info@simonepost.nl)\n\nSimone Post is a Dutch textile and product designer. She graduated with honours from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2015 and since then her work has received numerous accolades and been distinguished with several international awards and nominations including \u2018Domotex Best Studio Artist Design\u2019,  \u2018Dutch Design Award Product\u2019. Her work is characterized by material experiments, in-depth research and a love for colour, print and crafts. She strives for her designs to be sustainable, either in terms of material use or with reference to cultural heritage like traditions, storytelling, clothing and traditional skills and technologies.\n\nIn addition to running her own design practice, Simone has been one of the initiators of Envisions in 2016. Seeking cooperation with a variety of industries, she has specialised in spotting new innovative possibilities. As an outsider, she can bring a completely new view and concept to existing companies. To Simone, the finished product is not necessarily the most interesting aspect of the design process, but she has a penchant for the research process itself, the potential of materials and techniques, the unexpected outcomes of experiments and the beauty of semi-finished products, making designing into an infinitely intriguing process and business.\n\nSimone is  collaborating with companies like Adidas, Kvadrat, Vlisco, Hema, Return to Sender, Eco-oh! and Finsa. Her works have been acquired by several museums including the Utrecht Centraal Museum, Vitra Design Museum and Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde Hamburg.",

The collection of works lets process be its defining factor, offering insight into different phases that would normally never be seen by the public\u2019s eye. By revealing the steps of the extensive research process that precedes a design\u2019s final outcome, the collection breathes life into initial concepts and pushes them towards reality. Emphasizing the team\u2019s efforts above the individual, the group is the first to proudly expose its still-developing work on an international stage. The group\u2019s ideology encourages its members to have unhindered creativity, without the presumed restrictions and predicted complications which can limit a product from being realized before it has a chance to grow. \n\nMaking its debut in Milan and showing a sequel in New York during the first half of 2016, the Dutch collective Envisions plays on its home turf with a third edition. A showcase of experimental material samples and preliminary prototypes, Products in process \u2013 Part 2 promotes the relevance of design produced with unlimited creativity and multidisciplinary cooperation. \n\nResembling a conceptual breeding ground, the assemblage of works aims to function as an industry-inspiring laboratory \u2013 from manufacturers to design labels \u2013 by shining spotlights on a product\u2019s process. By illuminating the possible applications of the omnifarious outcomes, the collection triggers a dialogue between designers and potential clients. The ultimate goal? To give rise to newfound collaborations. A hub for creation and discovery, Envisions formulates an environment filled with possibility for future ventures.",
