Despite that, our community has survived for so long, because we are exactly that: a community. And what does a community do? It sustains itself. It shares resources. It lifts others and so the others whom we\u2019ve lifted up can raise others as well. \n\nI chose to be a digital marketer who helps LGBT+ entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of color because I knew I would be miserable working in the corporate environment, only allowed to do my activism after 5 pm if I wasn\u2019t exhausted enough from the work that drains most of my days. \n\nSince realizing our potential as a queer community, I\u2019ve worked with amazing companies that have seen me for whom I am and valued me for what I am worth. That transformation can happen to you too. From Queerency, a phenomenal news hub for all things queer business, housing me for a month to cover queer fashion, to the worldwide queer dating app HER which welcomed me for their affiliate marketing program \u2013 I have connected LGBT+ entrepreneurs together and spotlighted the history-makers, only scratching the surface of our community's potential in this field. \n\nI intend to share my knowledge and resources not only with my digital marketing skills, but also my speaking skills, which I have exercised at events such as TransTech and Lesbians Who Tech to Pride & Joy Summit. \n\nI could have never imagined facing my disillusionment with the world we live in by diving head first into a growing, robust community such as one of queer professionals, leaders, business owners, and so much more. \n\nDo you feel disillusioned with the world we live in and want to help others with your awesome product or service? Let me help you with an amazing brand strategy; let me tell you where you need to be, and guide your team on how to execute in a sustainable way. What do you say?
