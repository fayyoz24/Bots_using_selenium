    "summary": "Kars Alfrink (MA, Utrecht School of the Arts, 2002) is a designer, researcher, and educator working at the intersection of emerging technologies, social progress, and the built environment.\n\nCurrently, Kars is a Ph.D. candidate at Delft University of Technology. His research focuses on ensuring that AI systems are contestable by design.\n\nBefore coming to Delft, Kars was active as a design consultant, design entrepreneur, and design community organizer for 15+ years. \n\nSome highlights include: co-founding and coordinating Tech Solidarity NL, a grassroots community of Dutch tech workers who seek to advance the design and development of more just and egalitarian technology; from 2009-2016 founding, and being a partner at Hubbub, a boutique playful design agency; and initiating and co-curating the Dutch offshoot of This Happened, a series of events about the stories behind interaction design.\n\nKars has worked as an educator and researcher at the Utrecht School of the Arts and as an interaction designer at a couple of web agencies before that.",

Crash Masters was one of the first companies in the Netherlands to recognise the potential of games for non-entertainment purposes. They created what would now be called serious games and advergames, first for the web and later for mobile.\n\nDuring my internship I worked as a game designer and game artist on 'Melk the Game', a project consisting of an online multiplayer game and an online community, for the Dutch Dairy Association. After my internship I was hired to research mobile gaming opportunities.",
