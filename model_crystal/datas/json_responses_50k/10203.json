    "summary": "Ishtar Hsu\u2019s works are often presented in shattered images, photographic collages, abstract textures, and zoom-in displays. In the process of creation, she has always indulged herself in questioning the common sense of beauty, keeping trying to break the rules that limit us and the entire society. During the time of studying Master of Information Design at Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) in the Netherlands, where she found the impact of art in the visual aspect. This inspired and encouraged her to dive into the exploration of the combination of new media and images. At present, Ishtar is a freelance graphic designer and also a visual artist, swinging between 3-D objects and 2-D images with various medias that include ready-made items, resin, pottery, moving images, a home printer, collages, and an iPhone 6X that has been dropped for many times.\n\nNot very active on LinkedIn.
