    "summary": "I am a graduate from Maastricht University with a MSc. in International Business - Strategic Marketing. After obtaining my Bachelor of Business Administration at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences, I decided to pursue my Master's in the field that I am most passionate about. My interests lie in researching and satisfying customers needs by understanding the relationships between brands and its customers and the current business environment; thus creating value for the organization as well as the end user. In addition, I am also passionate about data and utilizing the latest customer- and marketing trends in order to improve the performance of KPIs.\n\nDuring my study, I was privileged to spent one year in Asia for my study exchange and internship. I have also explored the world after my study to further broaden my mind. I describe this period as the most valuable and educational experience of my life. I have had the honour to be surrounded by people from all over the world, which has enabled me to develop strong communication skills and to perform well with people from different backgrounds.\n\nOver the years, I have gained invaluable experience every business professional needs to reach key deliverables. I have developed a wide range of applicable skills, including planning, problem-solving, excellent communication, analytical thinking and teamwork. I describe myself as an open-minded go-getter, which allows me to be motivated and energized in every workplace. Moreover, I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn and I can easily adapt to new surroundings. \n\nFeel free to connect!",
