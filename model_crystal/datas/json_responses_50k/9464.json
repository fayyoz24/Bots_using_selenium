    "summary": "I am currently (2023\u201325) an IRC Post-Doctoral Fellow in International Security at Dublin City University. I earned my Ph.D. in History from Royal Holloway, University of London in 2019. My primary area of interest is the international history of the Middle East during the Cold War, which he explores through the lens of archival research, foreign policy analysis, and interviews with prominent diplomats and intelligence elite. \n\nMy research has been published in leading academic journals such as the European Journal of International Security, Intelligence and National Security, Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Oral History Review, and Cold War History among others. My academic publications also include three book chapters in prestigious edited volumes among them one in genocide denial in the 21st Century and one in Transitional Justice.\n\nIn the last three years, I have been working in a policy-oriented environment creating synergies between cutting-edge (academic) research and policy advice. I have authored six peer-reviewed policy reports as an expert guest writer, providing policy advice to decision-makers. I strongly believe in knowledge transfer. I published (in Hebrew and English) short essays on current affairs and published more than 27 op-eds. My work appeared in Newsweek, The Conversation, The Jerusalem Post, Haaretz, The National Interest, Times of Israel, Mekomit, and Globes News.\n\nI am a regular contributor to national and international media outreach. I have been invited to provide commentary to The Washington Post, The Jewish Insider, The Media Line, TRT STRAIT TALK, and Gloves News. I was also an invited speaker to international podcasts such as 'Secrets & Spies'. For invitations, please send me a DM via LinkedIn or Twitter.\n\nMy current research interests include:\n\n- Nagorno-Karabakh conflict \n- Israel's foreign policy and political history\n- Israel-Turkey relations (all periods)\n- Israel-Iran relations (all periods)\n- Israel-German relations (all periods)\n- The War on Terror during the\u00a0Cold War\n- Israel's Intelligence and national security\n- Critical security studies/Securitisation theory \n- Emotional diplomacy\n-\u00a0Elite Interviews and qualitative research \n- Jewish and\u00a0Armenian transnationalism\n-\u00a0Holocaust memory in the global age\n\nMy forthcoming book (Edinburgh University Press, Islamic & Middle Eastern Studies series) offers a critical re-examination of Israel\u2019s relationship with Turkey in the last decade of the Cold War.\n\nTwitter: @EldadBenAharon\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0039-9827",

However, this debate has mostly concentrated on the intelligence history of the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 alliance, while neglecting the Middle East. Using Israel as a case study, this article explores the factors underpinning this lacuna. I argue that there is an acute need to apply a constructivist approach (as understood in international relations theory), with an emphasis on foreign policy analysis \u2013 i.e., a single-actor focus, which examines the experiences of individuals and their influence on decision-making processes. Elite interviews are the ideal methodological and epistemological means for this inquiry. Although they are not a silver bullet for the study of Israeli national security, elite interviews help not only to explore and situate Israel\u2019s role in the field of global intelligence studies, but also to imbue intelligence scholarship with a sense of humanity, emotion and feeling. Crucially, this highlights the individual actors in a history that would otherwise be composed of merely impersonal processes and \u2018top-down\u2019 decision- making.",

Subsequently, on 24 April 2021, also US President Joe Biden has officially recognized the Armenian genocide.\u00a0 These decisions reinforced the importance of the subject\u00a0matter\u00a0and which offers the opportunity to learn how the 1980s were a formative period for the campaign for international recognition of the Armenian genocide. In his talk, Dr. Ben Aharon will assess how from the 1980s onwards, the state of Israel found itself in the remarkable position of supporting denial of the Armenian genocide. His talk takes us behind the scenes of the Israeli foreign ministry in the 1980s to examine how these state actors strategically\u00a0mobilised\u00a0the memory of the Armenian genocide into International Relations where it has remained for the following forty years. Dr. Ben Aharon will explore how Israeli diplomats took advantage of the growing international prominence of the 1915 Armenian genocide to court Turkey in the late Cold War period, leading to the emergence of a unique relationship between Israel and Turkey. The importance of this relationship is underlined by the successful role Israel played in supporting Turkey\u2019s attempts to undermine the campaign by the Armenian diaspora to secure international recognition of the 1915 genocide.\u00a0\n\n",

While the British tradition of oral history gives emphasis to the neglected voices of ordinary people and their life stories, the American approach highlights the voices of the elite. We can, therefore, include businessmen, decision makers, state officials, and diplomats as those who are generally regarded as elite. The oral testimony here recounts the professional experience of these elite, in a wide range of topics related to historical and contemporary affairs.     \n\nSince 2013, as a Master student at the University of Amsterdam and subsequently during my doctoral research at Royal Holloway, University of London, I have conducted more than 60 oral interviews with prominent Israeli, Turkish, and American former diplomats and state officials. the data emerging from these interviews promises to cast new light on the critical research questions emerging from a range of topics, such Cold War history, Middle Eastern studies, intelligence history, and Israel's foreign policy. \n\nDuring this extensive field research, I have gained considerable experience and insights which has provided significant advances in my current and future research projects. One of the outputs of this project, which summaries some aspects of my field research, can be found in my forthcoming article entitled: \"Doing Oral History with the Israeli Elite: History and Memory and the Question of Israel's Clandestine Diplomacy\". This manuscript is scheduled to be published in Spring 2019 in the Oral History Review. This article focuses on how the oral history methodology can enlighten the history of intelligence and clandestine diplomacy, specifically, Israel's Clandestine Diplomacy. You can find excerpts and anecdotes from the oral histories discovered from this project in my previously published articles.\n",
