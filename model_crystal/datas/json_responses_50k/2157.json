    "summary": "After my experience as defence lawyer and a career in the field on humanitarian and legal assistance programs, I work at the International Criminal Court since 2007, a cross-road between justice an diplomacy. As a Legal Officer, first within the Judiciary and now in the Legal Office working for the Registrar, I have been advising elected officials, judges on various complex legal, policy and strategic issues in relation to all judicial proceedings before the Court. This includes legal advice on human rights, victims, detention, asset recovery, confidentiality, etc\u2026I also deal with staff cases against the Court and propose, when appropriate, alternative dispute mechanisms. My office is in charge of developing policies to this effect.\nAt the Court and earlier in my career at the United Nations Office in Vienna and Addis Ababa, I advised staff on conflict resolution in the work place, including through  mediation. Now that I am an accredited mediator from the London School of Mediation for two years, I intend to strengthen my mediation skills and make good use of them whenever a particular situation requires so.\nThis evolution in my career - from litigation to mediation \u2013 is based on my experience, expertise and personal reflection on what to achieve for yourself and for others in the most efficient and peaceful way. It also meets my needs for transmission of knowledge and reciprocally teaches me the \u201csimple\u201d life lesson \u201cBe yourself, and magic will happen\u201d! \n \n",
