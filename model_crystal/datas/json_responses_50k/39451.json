    "summary": "I am educational advisor for online learning at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. \nI hold an MSc in e-learning, University of Edinburgh, UK and Master in Pedagogics and Creative Learning, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece and a PhD in elearning, Open University of Catalonia, Spain.\n\nI am particularly interested in online course design, both as a researcher and as a practitioner. So far, I have designed and developed online courses for the MA in DTLT as well as several online and blended-learning short professional development courses addressed to adults, teachers, and teacher educators.\n\nIn collaboration with a few fellow educators I started in 2012 an initiative called ICT4ALL with the triple aim to support teachers in developing digital competences for lifelong learning, help them strengthen their knowledge of how to use digital technologies in their daily teaching practice, and promote openness of educational practices. Towards this goal we developed an online survey to gather teachers\u2019 opinions and preferences as regards digital tools, we planned and run several blended learning courses, we developed and maintain an online platform on Moodle to host our courses, and we are supporting a growing community of teachers who publish their activities and digital artifacts on a collaborative blog. In 2016 the ICT4ALL initiative was accredited as one of the best practices in Open Education by the Open Education Europa.\nI am a MirandaNet fellow and regular reviewer in academic journals and conferences. For several years I was guiding and mentoring teachers during their introduction in the eTwinning and Teachers4Europe programmes. I am also supervising postgraduate students\u2019 dissertations at the MA in DTLT.",

Under the directions of my supervisor, I submitted a proposal for the construction of a new Virtual Learning Environment that would facilitate students\u2019 learning and inquiry activities. Although my proposal received very positive feedback both from my supervisor and the programming team, unfortunately at that time the university could not allocate the required resources for its construction. \nAfter discussing with my supervisor on ways to continue, we agreed to conduct research on the teacher-inquirer identity in face-to-face and online environments. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant literature I constructed two self-report questionnaires on components related to the development of the teacher-inquirer identity and I sent these questionnaires to the respective populations. \nI presented preliminary results of my thesis at three conferences (ICERI 2019, EDEN 2020, and EARLI SIG14) and I also wrote a book chapter in collaboration with my supervisor. My thesis is titled: 'Teacher-inquirer identity in light of educational innovation and during online master thesis: Examination of the inquiry skills and other related components' and I will defend it this winter.",
