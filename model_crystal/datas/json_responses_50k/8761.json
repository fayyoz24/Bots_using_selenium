After three years I got the responsibility for the hematology part of the lab. In 1987 the lab bought the Technicon H*1 Hematology analyzer. In order to be able to much faster troubleshoot the instrument in case of errors, I wrote a software program in Turbo Basic, with input of the Field Service Engineers of Technicon. In 1990 I was asked by Technicon to present this program during their annual hematology user meeting. Shortly after this I was asked to join their Field Service team.",
