    "summary": "I am a people-oriented person with over 15 years of financial analysis experience under my belt. I enjoy digging into the numbers, learning of the stories they tell, and acting upon them. I am a good communicator and take pride in helping people with non-finance backgrounds better understand their area of business. Accountability is something I pride myself on, and I am considered both reliable and dedicated to meeting objectives and deadlines. I find that working within a team gives me energy, but I am used to working and producing independently as well. Lastly, I'm light-hearted and try to find the humor in most things, which I think is an underrated aspect to any successful working environment.",
