    "summary": "I am an all-rounder with more than thirty-five years\u2019 experience in an industrial and/or technical environment. Mainly in organizational and supervisor context. I have a track record in the accomplishment of operations improving programs, and the management of a wide variety of multi-disciplinary projects. In general managing all project stages (Design, Construction, Commissioning, Hand-over). It comprises CAPEX-, engineering- and maintenance projects. Technology fascinates me and in particular the human role at it.\n\nAs an experienced manager I am effective and strive to cooperation. I care for people and take others in account. I am a firm and pragmatic person with a pro-active and dynamic attitude. I have executive abilities, with well-developed communication- and management skills. I will perform best in a challenging environment. I feel comfortable in a position where I can overlook the situation, take the lead and make the difference. Involvement in operations is a stimulating element for me. In particular stakeholder management and communication with people at all organizational levels. However well interested in people and being a team player, I certainly perform fine independently. I have an open, inquisitive and enthusiastic personality. In addition to motivation and good fellowship, it helps me improving the performances of my team.\n",

Because of this, the requirements for the employees and the technical integrity of the plant are very high.\n\nIn that period this section was the \u2018pilot\u2019 for a crucial change of transfering 'break down maintence' to a modern maintenance approach, according  to a corporate supported maintenance policy and related work-flow and procedures. For this the Maynard Maintenance philosophy was adapted by ICI Holland. A 180-degree change was finally made for the entire process (\u201cfrom reactive to pro-active\u201d). This had a mayor impact at the organisation. Finally, this pilot was proven to be very successful. For me this was an important and instructive experience. The Maintenance Engineer plaid a key role in this change process. He had to set out the lines for this and fulfilled a pusher role.",
