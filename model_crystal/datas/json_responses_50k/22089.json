This current process involves manually check to assign the corresponding payroll administrator and creating a certificate by reading more than 14 different information from SAP is a lot of time-consuming and more manual prone to copy-paste mistakes. \n\nThis use-case aims to automate the entire process using RPA, by assign \"Employment Certificate\" HR Case directly to Bot, which will read the HR Case details including the user info, letter type, and access the SAP tool to generate the document as per standard template in France and update the same as attachment to HR Case and mark HR Case as \"Closed\".",

Different data set has to be changed and provided in both Boss Kadrovik and Oracle HCM. Moreover, the input file has to be developed and rules to be created to meet the expectations of both, HRBP and Workforce Administration site. \n\nOther challenges were presented below:\n\u2022\tDouble work on manual data entry due to the fact of having 2 systems: local one \u2013 Boss Kadrovik and Schneider Electric global solution \u2013 TalentLink (Oracle HCM)\n\u2022\tRoutine in performing repetitive tasks\n\u2022\tDelay in data delivery and Complexity of input template \n\u2022\tThe challenge is also to receive a complete data set from HRBP, which require checkouts and additional emails or ticket(HR CasE) rejection at Support@Schneider (S@S) \n\u2022\tHRBP claims and changes status checkouts are time-consuming. In its current form, the probability to make errors is high and so is the amount of time that is required to handle all cases. \n\nHRBP submits a \"TalentLink Request\" Service Catalog Item in Self Service Portal ( ServiceNow) with type/subcategory \"Employee Job Data Change request\" with a mandatory attachment in the desired format which contains all the required changes to CIS region employees. \n\n\"Talentink Request\" HR Cases are automatically assigned to CIS HR HelpDesk Team, the HR Agents will validate the data provided by HRBP in the HR Case and create the required spreadsheet in the desired template and with a security lock on the file, which is attached to new HR Task and it will assign to Bot profile. The bot is designed to read all the HR tasks assigned to it and process all the required steps in Boss Kadrovik and TalentLink, if all the transactions/operations are successfully on both applications, the bot updates the information to HR Task and closes the HR Task in s@S. \n\nWe automated the process with RPA and ServiceNow to reduce the overall costs, time to complete, and error probability.",
