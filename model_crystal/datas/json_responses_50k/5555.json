    "summary": "Since 1993 working in maritime container terminal automation projects and traffic control projects. As leading developer of Crane Management Systems I have been working in terminals in Europe, the Middle East, China, Taiwan, Korea, Australia and New Zeeland. Current focus is developing solutions to improve logistic processes in container terminals. 3D Visualization, Virtual reality, Big Data / Smart Data are the current focus areas for me. \n\nI am used to work on all product/project lifetime stages; cost estimates, design, prototyping, developing testing, commissioning, after sales and marketing.\n\nI have done presentation on international conferences and for terminal operators. I joined many technical workshops during the startup phases of projects. \n\nMy know-how is to a large extend based on actual experience gained in the many development projects I have been into. \n\nI graduated in 1981 as Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Engineering). Worked until 1987 for GTI (now called Cofely) as electrical engineer. Joined Siemens in 1987 as automation engineer. Worked for 5 years on batch oriented processes in chemical and food industry. Developed in that period object oriented software components for equipment control.\n\nSpecialties: \nPredictive Maintenance (AI)  \n3D based Equipment Visualization, Simulation, Virtual Reality,\nBig (smart) Data, Cloud bases solutions \nCrane Management and Traffic Management Systems\nCrane Automation and Remote Crane Control\nMiddleware solutions for container terminals\nInterfaces between IT-systems\nDesign, prototyping, commissioning of automation systems \n\nMendix, Python, Keras, Tensorflow, CUDA, Unity 3D, Oculus Rift, Axis Video systems, Microsoft Azure, DotNet VB C# C++, Java, OPC, XML, TCP/IP, SQLServer, Siemens PLC and SCADA systems",
