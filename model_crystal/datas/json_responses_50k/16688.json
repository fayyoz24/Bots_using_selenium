Since then, these devices were applied to a wide variety\nof fields. Bandpass filter is their most common application, which is an\nimportant component in consumer products such as televisions and mobile\nphones. SAW devices can also be utilized as chemical and biological sensors.\nDriving force behind the development of SAW sensors is their small size, high\nsensitivity, reliability, and durability.\n\nThis thesis presents the development and characterization of ZnO/Si based\nSAW devices. ZnO thin films with c-axis orientation were deposited using rfmagnetron\nsputtering. Effect of post deposition annealing on the structure of\nZnO and on the SAW device performance was studied. It was found that\nannealing ZnO above 600oC is detrimental for SAW device performance.\nSurface roughness of ZnO increases as the annealing temperature increases. In\nliterature, roughness increase is presented as one of the reasons behind device\nbreakdown. This work shows that roughness is not the primary cause for the\nbreakdown. In addition, effect of SiO2 interlayer insertion between ZnO/Si\nstructure on the device performance was examined together with the effect of\nZnO thickness.\n\nThesis is available via national thesis center.

            "description": "In power reactors, increasing the temperature of the gases entering to reactor increases the efficiency of energy production as explained in heat engine concept. Thus, from heat engine point-of-view it is better to use gases with temperatures as high as possible. Also gases must be high pressure gases for higher efficiency. Materials are the main limitation for the usage of high temperature and high pressure gases. The highest temperatures and highest pressures that can be used are the temperatures and pressures which materials used for the reactor components can withstand for long times. Today the temperatures and pressures that can be reached at power reactors are 600-650 C and 25-30 MPa, respectively. Therefore the materials are the key components to increase the efficiency of power reactors.\n\nGrade 91 steels are extensively used in power reactor components due to their high creep strength. They are used in steam pipes (Grade 91 used in piping is called P91) and welding of these pipes is a major issue due to the long term performance of the welds. Welding with conventional welding methods, such as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), adversely affects the high temperature properties of P91 steel which will be explained in further chapters in detail. Hybrid Plasma Arc Welding (HPAW), a new welding technology, can offer more economical and metallurgically stable welds.\n\nIn this project P91 pipes were joined with GMAW and HPAW. Microstructural and mechanical properties were evaluated and compared in both welds. Also welds were examined economically. In HPAW, less filler additions and less weld heat inputs were anticipated due to narrower gaps. Additionally higher integrity and microstructural stability of the weld was expected.\n\n\n",
