My drive to make the world a better place (as clich\u00e9 as it sounds) made me undertake my bachelors' in International Business where I was exposed to economic theories of growth and profit, to then look at what i learned with a critical lens during my masters specialised in Corporate Sustainability to find ethical, sustainable and future-proof solutions in the way business is performed.",
