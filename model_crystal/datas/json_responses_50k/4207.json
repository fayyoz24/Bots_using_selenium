    "summary": "If I were asked to use one sentence to describe my biggest strength at work, that would be 'getting things done'. Delivering in time and with high quality is the goal I set for myself and for my team. When others see problems, I see opportunities. \n\nMy determination and \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude brought me from a small city in China to the Capital of China-- Beijing, from Beijing to Denmark and from Denmark to The Netherlands where I built my career with Rabobank and settled down with a lovely family. \n\nI believe in continuous learning and improving. Becoming a better version of yourself every day and helping/encouraging people around you to do the same is my motto. \n\nSpecialties: Credit Risk Management, Operational Risk Management, Risk and Control Framework, Project Management (Prince 2 Practitioner, Agile), Process analysis and optimization, Target Operating Model, Product owner, Implementation management.",
