PHYSEE's SmartWindows are implementing and testing new functionalities. \n\nThe project conducted dealt with the improvement and updating of the value proposition of PHYSEE's products and how it is communicated to potential clients. The main results of the project are the following: \n1) a presentation about comfort and health in buildings from the Sales perspective at PHYSEE, which identified four improvement points about the communication to external parties and the internal processes; \n2) a workshop between the Sales and R&D departments to discuss the role of the PC tool at R&D for the development of smart control strategies, and \n3) the creative destruction of Sales internal processes with a presentation of the current and proposed future process at the yearly Strategy Day of the company.\n\nThe results achieved in the project made the current value proposition clearer and helped to identify were the complexity of the Sales process lies. The follow-up steps are to maintain the line of communication with R&D about the development of SmartSkin\u2019s functionalities to improve comfort in buildings, and to concretise the new Sales process and re-define the Sales team to fit well to it.",
