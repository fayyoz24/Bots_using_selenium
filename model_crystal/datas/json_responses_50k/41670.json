    "summary": "Nelson Silva (1975) studied Communication Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon (Portugal). The wish to develop himself, curiosity and international friendships brought him via London (UK) to Amsterdam (Holland). He is specialized in translating clients\u2019 needs into graphic either web design. In Amsterdam he worked both as an independent communication designer and as specialist for a variety of companies. At Sanoma magazines Nelson perfected his photo-editorial skills, while for Clearsense he specialized himself commercially in marketing optimization by search engines.  In China he worked as an Advertisement Design teacher at the Chongqing Technology and Business University. Nelson is creative, enthusing and extravert; purity of form, color and message are the trademarks in his design. Rather than going for short-term goals or personal material gain, Nelson aims for openness, honesty and long-term commitment.",
