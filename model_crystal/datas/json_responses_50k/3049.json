    "summary": "Experienced global branding specialist with a highly entrepreneurial approach. 12+ years experience in global brand marketing. \n\nPassionated about branding, global trends, consumer behaviour, content strategy, creative brand innovation, design & art.\nMy life story has taken many twists and turns - from moving to different countries (Stockholm, London, Copenhagen, Los Angeles) and starting new businesses to adapting to the ever-changing market trends and industry. Being highly connected I have a rich network. \n\n______________________________\n\nThe evolution of technology has contributed to so many advancements in digital technology and our lifestyle as a whole. It certainly shaped my career dynamically..\n\nWhen I was brand marketeer back in 2007 I first started to work with influencers. When it was 2012 I launched a highly successful blog collective, which - ( I quote the marketing girls at H&M ) was 'the first real influencer agency in The Netherlands'. \n\nIt is also the digital technology that shaped my career from fashion blog 'mama', to having an own blog, being an influencer myself. First online, later via Instagram. Being familiar with market insides from both sides - agency, in-house, and as an active influencer. Hence, I not only developed leading marketing campaigns, I also produced them. Knowledge that brands find extremely valuable. \n\nSo I influence - is what they say today. Via @anoukyve to the mass market and via B\u00fcro Yve targeted towards brands. Sharing my vision on brand management and content strategies in today's fast moving digital arena. \n\nB\u00fcro Yve is an international brand consultancy agency, focussing on brand innovation, PR,  content management, brand strategy and leadership. Together with a team of graphic designers and photographers I help CEO's and marketeers of start-ups, luxury, beauty, fashion, retail and lifestyle companies to build, sculpt or rebrand their business in household names with a digital and social focus. \n\n",
