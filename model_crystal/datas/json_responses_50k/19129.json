The growth also means that it is more difficult for participants to find a possible practical partner due to the large amount of people. The difficulty is also affected by the fact that students do not see each other during courses, and most of the time haven\u2019t met any of the participants from the course.\n\nFor this Bachelor Project we have improved upon this process by creating an application that can be used to create practical groups without the participants being required to search intensively through all the participants. Participants are able to easily access the application, fill in some relevant information about themselves and then get recommendations of possible practical partners or practical groups.",

These recommendations consisted of both artists and events.\n\nDuring this project I was responsible for the front-end and the integration of Spotify and Last.FM services. My main focus was creating a way to play the music within the application through Spotify, cross-matching the results from the two services and improving the heavy use of the API.",
