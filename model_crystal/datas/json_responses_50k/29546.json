The project is thus completely original in the world of simulations and is already extremely popular among young Europeans from diverse backgrounds, from Law, International Relations, Political Science and European Affairs to History, Media Studies, and Interpreting.\nDuring this conference two topics were discussed: the refugee crisis and biofuels.  \nMy role was Member of Parlement representing France in the Greens.  During the program I was elected by my peers as faction leader.
