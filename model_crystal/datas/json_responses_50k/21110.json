            "description": "Winners at Europan 15 with our proposal for the city of Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, in Finland. Within the topic of \"Productive Cities\" and under the theme of \u201cThird Space\u201d.\n\nThe site is really attractive due to its situation: the heart of the city of Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, the welcome area from the train station. Nevertheless, it presented many aspects to be solved from different perspectives: \"a challenging brief that required entrants to demonstrate a broad range of professional skills and aptitudes\".\n\"The team behind the proposal have succeeded in identifying the key links within the city\u2019s fabric and strengthened them through a series of interventions, including functions that drive production, working and homes in the area. The result is less a highly detailed master plan but a strategic vision for how to transform Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4\u2019s centre, currently dominated by transport infrastructure into a busy, vibrant and dynamic urban environment. Its particular strength lies in the simple and straightforward, diagrammatic approach that view both sides of the railway tracks as a single whole but which allows for further work and development without losing its essence.\"\n\n\nYou are welcome to read the complete report here: https://lnkd.in/dqQx5nA\nhttps://www.europan-europe.eu/media/default/0001/18/e15_fi_jury_report_pdf.pdf\n\nAuthors: Pablo Mag\u00e1n and Laura Huerga\nCollaborators: \u00d3scar Ruiz Nieto, Sophia Arbara, Marcello Vietti, Pavlos Ventouris, Javier L\u00f3pez-Menchero.\n",

So, at the end,  we transform an urbanized area to a natural park with restricted paths to humans. In the project, the contact with the process is the priority.\nThe performance considers time as the main design tool where the landscape is an actor in constant transformation. The actions are catalysts of a long and uncertain process. Only intentions are strengthened and the landscape itself will finish molding.",
