The building of an edge is an iterative process which consists of creating hypotheses by adding detailed rules to the equation to filter for the best plays. Finding an edge is a method of continuous trial and error until a theory is proven effective after extensive back testing. Developed theories are subject to continuous analyses and enhancements since market conditions vary over time.",
