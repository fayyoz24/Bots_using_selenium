    "summary": "As a second-year student of Medical Natural Sciences, I have been learning and acquiring both medical and physics knowledge. These have been only the last years of my life, still important but not the whole picture of myself;\n\nAfter finishing my bachelor my young 18 year old me decided to move to another country to start studying in the Netherlands. This whole adventure thought me the most important lessons, how to be live on my own. Soon I understood which of my qualities I could use the most in this world. That's how creative problem solving became one of my main focuses. Probably also influenced by my dad and his, what he likes to call, MacGyver solutions. \n\nBesides school in the summers, I worked at ANWB. Daily I received calls from people who are broken down in the middle of the road during their summer vacation in Spain. To help them required a lot of fast problems solving and string pulling. Finding a quick fixing garage in summer is not easy. Luckily most of my clients could continue with their vacation without many complications.\n\nWhat is the future going to look like? \nI hope to do a Master degree in Biomedical Engineering in the Netherlands. I would like with this knowledge to continue creating new creative designs to help people while doing something I deeply enjoy.",
