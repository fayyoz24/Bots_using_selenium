The SOLiD projects experiments with different types of technologies to explore possibilities to make the logistics system more autonomously and intelligent in order to increase efficiency. \n\nFor Prime Vision, I conducted research that would test the applicability of an Augmented Reality system to the last-mile logistics. Augmented Reality can project essential information to drivers and increase their performance because the system supports them during their activities. This could imply that training costs of new drivers decreases, the delivery time decreases and the truck can be decoupled.",
