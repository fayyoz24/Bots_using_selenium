    "summary": "If we all became farmers, we could all have that impact we strive for: on our community and the soil and nature on which we depend. \n\nIn translating the vague term 'sustainable'\u200b to what it\u2019s all about, I believe we need to get practical and realistic. Let's stop talking and create those partnerships, and let's find and tell the real story behind the product. \n\nHaving worked at large commercial companies as well as for smaller fast-growing thought leaders, you can find my contributions on both a strategic level as at the core of the business. My added value lies in accelerating change through interAction!\n\nIt fascinates me how coffee, cocoa and other agricultural products have become indispensable in our daily lives. When we learn to think more like the farmers that stand behind the bean or bar, I believe we can actually start choosing products based on quality and taste instead of solely price. Ultimately I want to transform the way AND how much we consume.\n\nThere is a world to win in Fair Chain, Direct Trade, Linking Farmers to Consumers, going Beyond Certification, and Storytelling.\n\nLet\u2019s learn, and impact, by doing.",

The goal is to find new and innovative investment and trade possibilities for these companies in Ghana. Working together, sharing knowledge and local entrepreneurship are crucial to the project. An independent jury in Ghana eventually decided which team came up with the most innovative idea.",

DHV joined a consortium with TNO and 29 companies and in total 170 employees. Together we seek to understand the complete process of creating a Green Building in the Netherlands. The first step was to analyse the current situation in NL, what kind of buildings do we have? Which of them had an ambition to be 'green' and (how) were these ambitions reached? What do we have to change in order to realize more smart buildings. How can we incorporate (IT) systems to allow buildings to adapt to our wishes, now and in the future? \n\nwww.buildingbrains.eu\n\nsee http://www.duurzaamgebouwd.nl/index.php?pageID=3946&messageID=3078",
