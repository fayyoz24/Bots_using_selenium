    "summary": "International Students Rotterdam was founded in the summer of 2011 by a group of friends, studying at the Erasmus University. There are six institutions that offer English education in Rotterdam and we didn\u2019t know anyone outside the Erasmus!  We tried to get in contact with international students from other universities, with little result. Realizing that this wasn\u2019t ideal, we set out to change that!\n\nWe started organizing events, hoping we could bring internationals from the different universities together. Now we offer a platform in which students from Erasmus University, Rotterdam Business School, Codarts, InHolland, Willem de Kooning and SAE can come together.\n\nWe then decided that we wanted to inform internationals about practical matters concerning student life in Rotterdam; this led to the birth of our student guide.  Every two weeks we upload a new page, guiding you through a certain aspect of student life. If you think we are missing a page, shoot us a message and we will write it for you!\n\nNow we are working on a platform to connect you, international students, to organizations in Rotterdam. Think of public institutions like the municipality, but also private organizations such as job providers, insurance companies, housing agencies, etc\u2026\n\nStudying in Rotterdam is a chapter in your life that you will remember forever. We will do whatever it takes to make it as enjoyable as possible. Our aim is to help you with whatever you need, may that be answering questions, connecting you to other internationals, linking you to organizations you are interested in, or simply showing you around. We exist to serve YOU, so don\u2019t ever hesitate to contact us.",
