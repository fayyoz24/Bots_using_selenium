    "summary": "I possess a broad international career background due to my work and study experience from Australia, Brazil and now The Netherlands. Through these opportunities, I have been cooperating with people from different disciplines and backgrounds, hence, exposed to ideas from completely opposing views. This has given me the advantage and ability to view matters from a much broader perspective, consequently thinking more creatively and innovatively when coming up with new ideas and solutions for improvement.\n\nFurthermore, my professional choices clearly demonstrate my interest in working in settings where I am able to work directly with customers. One of my greatest strengths is my aptitude to connect well and support customers efficiently in industries (Hospitality, Academia and Relocation) where to possess excellent customer service skills is highly desirable. \n\nCore focuses of interest include: Education/Academia, Relocation, Global Mobility & Customer Service",
