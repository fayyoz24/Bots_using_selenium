    "summary": "I am enrolled at Leiden University for the Masters of Science program in Economics and Governance. I am majoring in economic models aimed at understanding the effects of policy decisions. My research/study focus is on the interplay between public and private organizations, particularly how firms adapt and influence public policies. Furthermore, I am interested in climate change and how Governments negotiate effective policies.  \n\nI learned a lot as an international student during my Erasmus semester in Krakow and now in Den Haag. Living in several countries taught me to adapt quickly to new situations and understand broader perspectives. I like to work in international teams where various cultural backgrounds interact with each other. \nI am goal-orientated and like to work on complicated, intervolved economic, political and societal topics from different perspectives. \n\nOutside of work, I like to be outdoors, go hiking and play sports.",
