    "summary": "I am a self-motivated and independent post-doc researcher at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of TU Delft. My research interests lay in developing damage tolerance tools to ensure the structural integrity of lightweight structures based on a thorough understanding of the failure and degradation mechanisms in such structures. \n\nCurrently I am studying the failure mechanics of adhesively bonded bi-material joints. The asymmetry in the material and mechanical properties across the bondline interface makes most of the interface crack problems inherently mixed mode. My focus is to deliberately design the bonded joints in order to obtain pure mode I or mode II loading case for the interface crack, or to achieve one specific mode mixity throughout the mixed mode testing in a controllable manner.  It is imperative to develop the methods of calculating the crack driving force as well.\n\nDuring my PhD research, I was investigating fatigue crack growth behavior in Fibre Metal Laminates (FMLs) with Multiple-site Damage (MSD) scenario. Therefore I am skilled at working out fatigue problems in metals  and analyzing delamination at interfaces. I am also capable of analyzing fatigue problem in built-up structures/hybrid structures. Furthermore, I am keen to master new knowledge on composites and hybrid structures. Before I came to Delft University of Technology, I had been working on fatigue crack path in pressurized fuselage skin as a Master student at Beihang University in China using a numerical approach. A Python script was created in order to automate the analysis of a fatigue problem with the commercial FEM package ABAQUS. \n\nI am open to new research opportunities.",

DIC technique was used to obtain the strain distributions in front of crack tips during crack growth.\n\n*Developed an analytical model for predicting the fatigue growth behaviour of isolated generic crack configuration in FMLs. \n\n*Successfully analysed the effects of pin loading on the fatigue damage evolution in FMLs.\n\n*Developed analytical models for predicting MSD growth behaviour in both FML panels and mechanically fastened FML joints.\n\n*Validated the prediction models with experimental results.\n\n*All the calculation of mechanical behaviour of damaged FMLs has been implemented in MATLAB codes.",
