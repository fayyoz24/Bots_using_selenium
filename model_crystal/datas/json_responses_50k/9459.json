    "summary": "For years I have been interested in working with people, young and adults. Their behaviours, motivations, wishes and opportunities.  As an expat child I have travelled the world and lived in many different places. Therefore I have acquired extensive knowledge of many different cultures and expat backgrounds (Western, Asian and Arabic cultures) \nAfter studying Mass Communications in Canada  I continued my education in Child and Youth Therapy and Counseling, Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP Master) and I am an ILM Certified Life Coach.\nI am specialised in Counseling and Coaching of children, teenagers  and adults . I am also an excellent sales person and networker with a booming Coaching, Counseling and Training practice abroad for the last 9 years. I can support children to build up their self esteem when being bullied at school or guide them in \u201ctransition\u201d coming from a foreign place sometimes mediating in school - parent situations.  Additionally I give  STEP Training.\nWith my Systematic Training for Effective Parenting Workshops parents and caretakers enhance their Parenting skills to become even better parents. This method has been very successfully received in Jakarta, Macau and Doha Qatar. With reference to the \u201cThird Culture Kids  \u201c philosophy I also have developed special training materials to work with families in \u2018transition\u201d. As a Coach & Counselor I worked with teenagers and adults to focus on successfully reaching goals and creating emotional balance and self confidence in relevant areas of their lives.  \nMy passion is to support, counsel and coach children, teenagers  in family and/or school settings preferably in an international multi cultural setting. As a true Global Citizen with Expat children I truly understand the challenges and enrichments that comes with being in \u2018transition \u2018 or simply being in a different environment with different realities. My approach is practical with the goal  for my clients to find their own strength and balance. \n\n",
