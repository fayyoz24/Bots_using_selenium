    "summary": "Hi! I'm Sophie. I like to solve things. \n\nWhether it's a business problem or the reason why my vintage car won't start, I enjoy finding out what's the underlying cause of it all, and identify the best solution for it. \n\nI've had the good fortune to be able to apply this trait into a lot of my professional roles, especially my current job. I get to talk to passionate people, find out what drives them, and use things like design thinking, storytelling and a customer-centric mindset to work with them on their strategy and their ideal vision of the future.\n\nMy curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner - for example, I recently became an All-Star Ranger on Trailhead - Salesforces' online learning platform.\n\nIn my personal life, I love travelling around the world, going on roadtrips, and caramel cheesecake.\n\nWant to get in touch? sophie.vanpoele@salesforce.com",
