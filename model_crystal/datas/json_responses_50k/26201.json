    "summary": "I have been working as a medical data scientist for six years now in academic settings (McGill and Maastricht). Much of my research has focused on oncology (radiology and radiation oncology), but since the pandemic, the scope has increased to include COVID-19 research. I am currently funded by two COVID-related EU grants that I was instrumental in obtaining. I enjoy speaking to clinicians and understanding their needs, and am not the type of machine learning expert who seems to be speaking a foreign language. Identifying unmet clinical needs is how I choose to shape my research direction. I have a keen interest in medicine and am comfortable reading medical literature. While I love being a scientist, I am increasingly of the opinion that I want to see my work have a tangible positive effect on the lives of others. \n\nDuring my six-year career as a particle physicist (PhD from Cornell University), I analyzed data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to search for evidence of physics unexplained by the established theory. Determining whether the observations were inconsistent with accepted theory required intimate knowledge of statistical tests and methods. My PhD thesis used artificial neural networks for classifying data into signal and background, at a time when machine learning was uncommon in particle physics. My training in particle physics, e.g., through my experience in rapidly updating data analysis code and assessing its performance, has made me a master of empirical evaluation. \n\nI have ample experience working in groups of varying sizes and hierarchical structures, and in producing software solutions to be utilized by a large user base. My research projects have included individuals of diverse races and ethnicities dispersed all over the world. I am receptive to feedback and new ideas irrespective of the speaker\u2019s seniority. I have extensive experience focusing on personal efficiency, re-prioritizing tasks as needed, engaging in rigorous self-evaluation, and seeking feedback from peers. I strive to improve the functioning of my research group by identifying shortcomings, suggesting improvements, and helping set the course for future pursuits. In the last seven years, I have often played a supervisory role, and students have credited my firm but fair approach for making them a better researcher.",

Adapted the FASTION simulation code, developed at CERN to study FII at the CLIC linac, to create detailed simulation of the effects anticipated at CESR-TA. Found good agreement with initial measurements. Results presented at conference, as well as published.\n\u2022 Participated in the study of intra-beam scattering for electron and positron beams, another important effect likely to limit the performance of next generation colliders and storage rings: multiple publications and conference reports.\n\u2022 Refurbished existing codes used to simulate, analyze and fit electron trajectory in an accelerator: a vital contribution to the collaboration.",
