Rabobank has the goal of transferring the obtained services towards the line organization. With the aim of having The Rabobank Azure CCoE help increase organizational agility and support Business Innovation. Also, it will demonstrate the value of using Cloud platforms and it will increase the experience and transformation towards DevOps. The Value of the Azure CCoE services: \n\n- Demonstrate and realize the agility and innovation that Cloud potentially offers;\n- Maximize re-use and standardization on Cloud-based workloads\n- Demonstrate and realize that Rabobank is always \u2018In Control\u2019 when using Public Cloud\n\nAs Chief PO (Agile Program Manager) I\u2019m responsible for ensuring that recommended practices and development guidelines are leveraged and to continue the participation in Rabobank\u2019s CCoE. In which Microsoft provides SME\u2019s, in the form of a Core Team, a flexible team and where we will lead and drive the implementation and actively transfer knowledge to the Rabobank team. The CCoE is a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of Rabobank and Microsoft resources. Which support up to 74 (to date) teams/workloads simultaneously and is integrated within Rabobank\u2019s way of working and methodologies (Agile) Rabobank uses in order to achieve three overall EPIC\u2019s (phase 1 and 2).",

This program is responsible for ensuring that seven business units across The Netherlands are migrated to a new Microsoft Windows 7 based environment. \n\nAs project manager within this transformation project, I am responsible for coordinating the technical and functional testing of over 600 applications and getting these either streamed or sequenced. Where required by the business I help to define their test cases and use case models. \n\nI manage a team consisting of approximately 30 FTE's. Apart from the main project deliverables I have set up a process of continuous improvement that leads to an increasingly optimized approach for the Application Publication Department, together with well documented and reusable processes for providing and maintaining clear overviews on status, progress and assigned tasks. This ensures a smooth transition of 7500 users to the new environment. The project team's ability to handle large volumes of work within very aggressive timescales grew significantly during a short period.",
