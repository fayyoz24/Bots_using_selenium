    "summary": "My friends and colleagues would describe me as ambitious, observant, active and assertive. I pay attention to the things around me, so I know what is going on. My agenda is always filled up as I have my study, my sport and my job. I would also describe myself as more extraverted than introverted and I tend to plan things in my head before I take action. \n\nI chose to study the bachelor International Business Administration and the master International Management as well, because I am very interested in other cultures and countries, and especially in combining this with business. So far, I have gained quite some international experience by studying in the USA for almost a year and by going on an exchange to Canada. I also visited several countries throughout my life, together with my family as well as by myself.  \n\nSports play a big role in my life. I have been playing field hockey for more than 15 years now and I gained some very useful international experience because of my sport. Besides playing, I also really like to watch and follow any type of sport either on television or live. \nTogether with this I also love to spend time with my friends and family in my free time. I need social contacts, if I'm excited about a finding, I tend to share this with anyone who will listen.\n\nI apply my curiosity and observant behaviour together with my communication skills to any type of task assigned to me. My ambition is to get an influential, important and managing role inside a company that does business world-wide. I want to visit new places and meet new people to keep on broadening my knowledge and experiences. I want to go out and find out new things and I don\u2019t hesitate to step out of my comfort zone to do so.",
