    "summary": "Why do some technologies succeed and change our lives for the good, while others fail? I've always been interested in good technology and game-changing ideas. How can we use tech to make life nice and easy?\n\nI am figuring this out in my journey as entrepreneur. Since I was very young I\u2019ve designed and coded popular apps & websites, organised various technology events and won several (international) hackathons. As founder of a software development company I have helped various companies to develop digital products such as websites, web applications and apps.\n\nMy goal is to use technology for the good and to make a positive impact, while learning a lot in the meantime. As Steve Jobs said: we're here to put a dent in the universe.",

During the event teams of students had 24 hours to come up with the best, crazy, or most creative idea for one of the six challenges, to build a prototype around it and pitch it to a jury. It was so nice to see talented people getting inspired and having fun while learning from each other and truly making a difference.\nFrom high-tech partners to (international) participants to inspiring speakers and judges: there were a lot of parties involved. As the founder & organizer of HEX, my job was to make sure everything is lined up and the event goes well. This can only be done thanks to our awesome team and the great advice we receive from others.",

The problem is that every company provides these same, boring gifts. People won't come for you because of a pen! You should be more creative and provide a cool and customized gift.\nThen Google announced the Cardboard: a virtual reality glasses that is made from a simple carton and works with your smartphone. Thanks to the Cardboard, virtual reality becomes cheap and assessable for everyone.\nAnd that's what we offer: custom printed Cardboards, with a virtual tour through your company. The Cardboards have your logo on it. When someone puts his or her smartphone in, the tour will start automatically. The tour takes the visitor through several places in your company (made out of 360-degree photos).\nUnfortunately, this project stopped in January 2017 in order to focus on my main company. It was a hard decision since the shop was going well, but I rather do a couple of things great than many projects just sufficient.",
