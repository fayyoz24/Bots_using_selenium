    "summary": "Working in an international organisation has given me the opportunity to work with different cultures and in different countries. This challenges and develops you professionally and personally. I enjoyed working abroad. It has given me a wide and diverse perspective of business and people in the different parts of the world. I like change and trying out new ways and can define and build strategies and translate them together with others in activities to make them happen. Especially in the fast moving world around us we need to be constantly \"on the move\". I'm motivated by results and goals, and reaching them through the team and people around me. I have an inclusive leadership style and like developing people and business through supporting and empowering them. I have an eye for talent and like to get the best out of people. I like to approach each assignment with a positive view and need to have fun and deliver great work at the same time.\nMy curriculum is mostly \"blue and yellow\" and my experience is build from working with, and within the\nstrong IKEA culture and values. With all that together I have a backpack full of great experiences,\nknowledge and leadership to share within and outside IKEA.",
