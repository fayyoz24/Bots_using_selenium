This suits the film because it\u2019s a very handmade movie, with only a few posproduction special effects. Also,\u00a0this alternative intro shows\u00a0a few moments and characters presented\u00a0in the film, but from the end to the begining of it, linking the end of the intro with the start of the movie.",
