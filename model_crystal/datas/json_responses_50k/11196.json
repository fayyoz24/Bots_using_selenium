            "description": "The study for my Master's thesis was about the effect of harvesting Brazil nuts on future Brazil nut tree populations and the ecosystem in the Amazon in the South of Suriname. Below the abstract of the study is shown. \n\nThis study assesses the sustainability of Brazil nut harvesting in Alalapadu, South Suriname.\nAn area with a high harvest intensity (area 1) is compared to an area with a low to medium\nharvest intensity (area 2). As the agouti is the main disperser of the Brazil nut, agouti densities\nwere estimated for both areas (1000 x 1000 m) by distance sampling with camera traps and\nanalyzed with Distance software. Brazil nut tree population regeneration is projected for both\nareas for 100 years, based on measurements in subplots (1000 x 500 m in area 1 and 700 x 500\nm in area 2), using a matrix population model. Juvenile and adult abundance is assessed for\nboth subplots and seedlings and saplings were studied during recce walks. Annual growth rates\nof juveniles and adults are based on a comparison of DBH data of 2016 and 2019. Input for the\nremaining parameters of the matrix population model, stasis, fecundity and mortality, are\nretrieved form literature. Agouti densities of 14.7 and 9.1 individuals km-2 were obtained, based\non 340 and 281 agouti observations, respectively for area 1 and 2. 414 and 68 juveniles and\nadults and 188 and 4 seedlings and saplings were observed, respectively in area 1 and 2. Annual\npopulation growth rates equal 1.017 for area 1 and 1.037 for area 2. This, in combination with\nthe minimal effect of the intensity of harvesting on the outcomes of the model, illustrates the\nhigh probability that Brazil nut tree regeneration in South Suriname is resilient to current\nharvest intensities. Yet, it should be noted that results are only viable for the short to medium-long term. Hence, conclusions about the sustainability of Brazil nut harvesting cannot be drawn\nyet. ",
