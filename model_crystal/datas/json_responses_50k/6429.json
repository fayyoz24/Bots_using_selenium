There was a high need for a caf\u00e9 since the AUCSA did not have a place to host the activities of its 25 committees.\n\nThe task was very challenging since there was barely any budget available. My team and I came up with a very creative solution by cooperating with the municipality of Amsterdam. Nearby our college and dorms is an outdoor activities park, which is owned by the municipality. Due to government cuts it was difficult to maintain the activities\n\nWe, as a student body now provide educational science activities in the form of a science lab that we built there. Two days a week, children in Amsterdam can come and do science activities for free at \u201cYouthlab\u201d. In return our association can use the main building at the activities park, which was otherwise not used.\n\nSo eventually we highly increase student involvement in the local neighbourhood, we are educating younger children and making them enthusiastic for science, we realised a free space for the social activities of our association, and all profit made at the caf\u00e9 flows back to our own association to fund activities.\n",
