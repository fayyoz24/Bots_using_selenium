    "summary": "Currently working  as a specialist in BRACE Automotive, an organisation focused on specialised domains like functional safety, cybersecurity, automotive development processes, powertrains, chassis and interior systems. In this role, I work in projects related to both functional safety and development processes. Responsibilities include creating item definitions, performing safety and security analyses,creating functional safety concepts, creating technical safety concept, system design of automotive E/E systems and create, manage and publish processes. Our most exciting work was the creation of BRACE Process v3.0 which provided compliance to Automotive SPICE, ISO 26262 and SAE J3061 standards simultaneously. As much as it has been a challenging project it has been innovative at the same time. \n\nBefore joining BRACE professionally, I had the privilege of doing an internship and my master thesis at BRACE. During this period the basement for my knowledge on functional safety and development processes was laid. Both the projects received excellent grades from the university.\n\nMeticulousness and involvement are the things that drive me.The fun part of my job is that, I get to interact with all sorts of automotive engineering and management teams and the bi-directional transfer of knowledge resulting from such interactions. \n\nI received bachelors degree in Automobile Engineering form Anna University, Chennai in 2014. Further, I pursued my Masters in Automotive Technology in Eindhoven University of Technology from 2014 to 2016.\n\n It is always a pleasure hearing from people with same interests, industry personnel and colleagues. Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.",

The standard introduces a safety-centered risk-based lifecycle beginning\nwith the de\ufb01nition of components, possible malfunctions that might happen in the components\nand \ufb01nally designing a system which produces safe outputs in case of unexpected malfunctions.\nMany companies have started to adopt the ISO 26262 standard, but there exist many challenges\nin moving from a classical component-oriented development of a vehicle to a more vehicle-\noriented guideline-based approach of the ISO 26262 standard which reduces the development\ntime and cost .  The main aim of the project is to develop and validate a functional\nmodel of the conventional cruise control system based on the ISO standard in a passenger\nvehicle. As an outcome of the project, it is shown that the development and usage of a functional model based on the ISO\n26262 standard o\ufb00ers robust traceability during the initial development stages of a passenger\ncar. As a further step, the models are designed in such a way that they might be re-usable in other environments. The increased traceability and re-usability aid in reducing the problem of development time and cost. ",

The assessment involved analyzing the system design and risk assessment based and providing the OEM with an assessment report. The activities of the OEM were also analyzed for process, toolchain and system engineering principles.\n\nOBD advice for a major truck OEM: Provided advice on solving a fault code issue of a truck OEM. The work involved providing solutions that balanced the ARB regulations, SAE J1939 standard, SAE J2012 standard and manufacturer requirements.\n\nSharePoint redesign: Worked briefly on the SharePoint redesign of BRACE. Transformed the SharePoint environment from a file repository to a structured workspace.\n\nTechnical documentation for camera system supplier: Wrote technical documentation for camera systems providing field of vision for on-road heavy vehicles. The technical documentation covered software and programmable logic systems of the camera.\n\nFunctional safety for camera system supplier: Perform functional safety activities for a particular line of camera system as a Safety Element out of Context (SEooC) based on ISO 26262 and providing functional safety support for a special line of camera system that will replace the conventional class II and class IV mirrors.\n\nStandard experience:\nISO 26262, ISO 13849, SAE J1939, SAE J2012, ISO 15756 - 4",

Furthermore, an ISO 26262 Road Vehicles \u2013 Functional Safety standard compliant BRACE process 1.0 for systems development  should also be developed.  The knowledge gained from analysing the remote attack surfaces(Cyber-Security threats in modern vehicles) will be incorporated into the systems development process.  This is done by considering the modeled remote attack failure modes and making suitable addition to the functional architecture of E/E systems. To exhibit the capability of the developed systems process, an adaptive cruise control system will be developed and veri\ufb01ed for its robustness against random and systematic failures as a case study.  If the system is capable of distinguishing the failure modes and remote attacks and moving to a safe state, the design can be considered asfunctionally safe.",

My job is to create pure functional models on the system and perform the HARA. Safety goals derived from HARA are validated on real life vehicle and checked whether the cruise control system is capable of handling unexpected failures and achieving a certain safety level. This is done in coordination with a final year bachelors student Jos Beijer who will perform the actual testing on the vehicle for his Graduation project. Through this internship, the methodology developed by BRACE to create E/E systems was formalized and validated. Knowledge on ISO 26262 Road Vehicles - Functional Safety (Concept Phase and Product development at system level) guidelines was obtained.",
