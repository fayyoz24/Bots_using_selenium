    "summary": "Being inspired by my uncle\u2019s bright career in accounting, I have always dreamed of becoming an accountant. In order to fulfil my dream, I got admitted in Bachelor of Business Administration (Major in Accounting Information Systems) in Comilla University, Bangladesh and completed my bachelor successfully with merit position second among 120 students of the department. \n\nTo strengthen my knowledge further in Accounting, I started Pre-master program in Accounting, Auditing and Control in Erasmus University Rotterdam. This program offers various application-based courses and seminars that help me to acquire both theoretical and practical knowledge in accounting.  As a part of my study, I did various projects both independently and in a team. Being part of such an internationally renowned institution, I now experience an environment of diverse community and interesting traditions. Now I am highly motivated to pursue my career in accounting. \n",
