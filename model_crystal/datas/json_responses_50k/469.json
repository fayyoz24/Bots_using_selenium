    "summary": "A graduate of Sustainable Development with a passion for environmental governance, local development, and sustainable transitions. I am excited to turn my affinity for the natural world and societal change into a personal vocation - with particular focus on helping to building sustainable food systems and supply chains by facilitating and coordinating collaborative projects.\n\nI believe the knowledge and skills gained from my research and professional experiences, and a penchant for translating ideas and analysis into projects and writing are valuable assets in the field. In addition to confronting the bigger picture, I also like to see tangible change through focused, detailed projects. I have an analytical approach to complex problems and enjoy approaching them from a holistic and systems-thinking perspective. As a patient, enthusiastic and intuitive person, I believe I can be a key member of any team in this field.\n\nI am seeking a dynamic team made up of passionate people who share my ideals and my energy \u2013 in both work and life. I am also looking to join a forward-thinking organisation at which I can learn, develop, and apply myself to real-world issues and, ultimately, solutions. As an individual, I am focused and dedicated in the ideals that drive me; and now would love to apply my talents and my optimism towards the urgent challenges of today and tomorrow.",
