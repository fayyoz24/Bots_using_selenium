            "description": "My master thesis focused on the prevention of falls in older people. The project was set-up by the Applied Ergonomics & Design department at the Delft University of Technology, in collaboration with the Lighting Department at the Faculty of Architecture. The project consisted of three phases: research, analysis and concept design. A large qualitative research was conducted in the first phase. In-depth interviews were held with the end-user, receiving a tour of their home at the same time. This resulted in a list of circumstances of falls. These were translated in design directions. The most prominent direction was lighting design to aid elderly people in their transfer at night. The target group, scenario and design assignment were specified during the second phase. The third and final phase consisted of a set of experiments, concept designing, prototyping, testing and iterating. This phase not only resulted in a lighting system specifically adapted for seniors, but also in general guidelines for illumination at night, supplementing the already existing guidelines found in literature. Falls prevention is still a hot topic today and this project could be used as a stepping stone for further research into designing for the safety of seniors. ",

Using this data, in combination with that of an accelerometer, activity patterns can be recognised and fed back to the user. The Delta Belt provides the user with reliable information on their daily activities and allows them to set and reach their targets.\n\nMy position in this team was that of secretary, thus documenting every meeting and important decision and keeping everything organised. Besides this, conducting research with many different prototypes in the aspects ergonomics, product experience and proving the technical principle was my responsibility. ",

The project was set-up by the Applied Ergonomics & Design department at the Delft University of Technology, in collaboration with the Lighting Department at the Faculty of Architecture. The project resulted in a better understanding of the circumstances of falls in older people, a list of interesting design directions to improve their quality of life, a lighting system specifically designed for seniors and a list of guidelines for designing lighting for the elderly. Falls prevention is still a hot topic today and this project could be used as a stepping stone for further research into designing for the safety of seniors.",

Greenway identified a need for an air conditioning, both affordable for the BoP and performing efficiently in a humid environment. The company started with Peltier elements as a cheaper method of cooling. With our project group we tested the technology and designed the product and interaction to fit with the target group. My tasks were conducting user research in India, generating ideas, detailing the product and making visuals.",
