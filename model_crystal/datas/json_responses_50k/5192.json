    "summary": "Working two decades for the Municipality of Maastricht seems very long, but...never a dull moment when you are advising a local government on cultural and creative issues! I am an historian (KU Leuven), who started its career - after a Master on 18th century history -  at the European University Institute in Florence, doing research on the connection between theatre and politics...to end up a few years later advising politicians and policy makers themselves! Not right away though: I first took the 'scenic route' through a position (1994-1999) at the City Theatre of Hasselt (Limburg, Belgium) where I programmed theatre, opera and concerts, followed by a move to Brussels in 1999 to become press officer of the National Opera house La Monnaie, and moving back to the border region of Maastricht, when the City of Maastricht invited me in September 2000 to join their team of policy advisors.\n\nI've been working ever since on strenghtening the cultural infrastructure of the city, adding creative spaces such as the 'AINSI' Art house and the 'Timmerfabriek' (pop venue and art house cinema). I developed the latest culture mission and vision of the city (2019), built on a large consultation of cultural and societal stakeholders throughout the city, including the University of Maastricht and the Hogeschool ZUYD. Core to our new mission is an inclusive approach to arts and culture, nurtured by the creative potential of the artists present in our city.\n\nAfter hours, I am a passionate heritage lover and volunteer, striving to save the beautiful landscapes and historical sites of my region in the south of the province of Limburg. I have been giving advice presiding the local heritage committee for more then ten years and then accepted the challenge to create a citizens' movement to save the Castle of Heers (15th Century) which was left in oblivion. With a bunch of focussed volunteers we managed to give it a new future, with the Flemish Government stepping into the game in May 2021, starting the restoration this year!\n\nThis commitment brought me to become in 2020 member of the Board of Herita, the Flemish 'National Trust'. I am regularly invited to seminars or webinars (corona...) to explain to scholars and peer organisations the secrets of our bottom up approach. Trying out new solutions, experiencing new combinations and bringing them into practice is what I like in general. The latest 'out of the box' project is a new vineard, on the south slopes of my home town Borgloon, where me and my wife Ingrid are producing a fine red wine...",
