    "summary": "As a biokineticist (bio = life, kineticist = through movement), I am committed to providing patients with effective evaluations, interventions, and individualised exercise treatment plans to help empower them in achieving their movement goals. In my experience, empowerment is also largely attained through truly being able to tune in to and listen to one's body.\n\nAfter 5 years of human movement study, and a number of years' experience in running my own practice, I have gained fundamental experience in working with patients 16 - 95 years old struggling with a variety of orthopaedic and chronic disease issues. I have used my passion for both aqua and land therapy, as well as my empathetic, patient, and listener-mindset to connect with their goals, needs, and desires on a human level.\n\nI find it fundamental to work in a multidisciplinary team in order to assist patients struggling with physical injuries in managing their pain and improving their range of movement, strength and rehabilitative outcomes. In this way, we are able to place the patient at the very heart of everything we do.",

We relocated the program to the Bio-Dynamics Institute, Sea Point, Cape Town in 2016.\n\nThe programme catered for patients with established chronic disease including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, fibromyalgia, chronic renal disorders, myopathies, and joint degeneration. These chronic diseases of lifestyle share risk factors such as unhealthy dietary choices, smoking, lack of physical exercise, sedentary behaviour and life stress.\n\nThis medically supervised programme involved a systematic assessment followed by a lifestyle intervention that included supervised exercise to increase the functional capacity and psychological well-being of patients.\n\nUpon entering the programme, each patient was screened and risk stratified by a sport & exercise medicine physician. Patients were then further assessed by a biokineticist before commencing their supervised exercise sessions.\n\nDuring the completion of their exercise sessions, there was also an educational component where stress management and dietary guidelines were provided. This allowed us to provide patients with the necessary tools to help them realise the worth of their own active participation in the process of making lifestyle changes. The program was designed to prepare the patient to eventually progress to a medically-directed or unsupervised exercise setting.\n\nPrimary Responsilibities: co-ordinating the program alongside Prof. Wayne Derman (sports physician). Patient intake and assessments (including stress ECGs), planning and conducting exercise classes, monitoring patients and keeping the physicians up-to-date with patient medical histories and daily symptoms, training and supervising interns, and report writing.",
