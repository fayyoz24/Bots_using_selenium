    "summary": "Limitlessly curious, endlessly creative, carefully practical and rebelliously human.\nI bring deep understanding of consumers & trends into the world of product innovation & ethical data. \n\nMy love for tech started in early teenagehood, trying to make video-games in C#. In the process, I discovered just how much I love learning new things. Over the years, I've picked up dozens of interests, from Netnography, Cultural Analysis, OSint, Infosec, User Research to basics of Data Engeneering (some hardware engeneering too) and Software Development. I'm a geek through and through, both in career and personal life! Now nearing 10 000 hour rule for many of these disciplines, I have a uniquely broad yet cohesive data & research skillset.\n\nIn my carrier, I excell due to always having the right tools to execute an ambitious vision. Combining my tech skills, domain expertise and human-centric approach, I've built a strong innovation toolkit that can bring great products to market for right audiences. From discovering audiences' unmet needs with netnography and leveraging hidden web APIs for wealth of free competitor data, to ideation and rapid prototyping, to UX tests, I\u2019ve impacted key decisions across the full product lifecycle.\n\nOutside of my carrier, I keep pursuing projects that blend leveraging data, unique research methodologies and potential for high impact. I'm growing my knowledge in Human Networks Analysis (i.e. spotting paid or adversarial followers on a profile), Language Processing and Local Network Protocols (i.e. bluetooth, radio encoding). Oddly enough, I'm also a lost/obscure media fanatic, a huge nerd for moden folklore and apirational contributor to all obscure/redundant knowledge!",
