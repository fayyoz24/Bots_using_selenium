While working with the Artwise team I researched and wrote the information text for the labels that accompanied the artworks hanging in the British Airways lounges around the airport. I also contributed copy on the work of over 20 well-known artists involved in a charity project devised by Artwise for the environmental agency WWF. In addition to this I gained experience in the research and applications of grant and monetary award schemes for particular Artwise projects in their preliminary stages, and worked on the initiation and completion of several public art projects and events.",
