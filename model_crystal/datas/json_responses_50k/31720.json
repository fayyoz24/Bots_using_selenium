I was second in charge in the record maintenance department and was in charge of the department for two months while the manager was on leave.  ABSA bank offers various self-growth courses which I attended. I completed the following: Understanding Business, Understanding Management, Nguni, Client Services, various computer courses and have a certificate in marketing.  Due to the ABSA merge, I partook in branch visits with senior management to improve the system and flow of work.  I received numerous appreciation awards for hard work and good client service",
