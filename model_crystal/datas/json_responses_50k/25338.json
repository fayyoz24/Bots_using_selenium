    "summary": "I am an epidemiologist currently employed in surveillance of respiratory disease from notifiable viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, Legionella, Psittacosis, and Q-fever.\n\nMy expertise and career focus lay in infectious disease epidemiology and related research in Caribbean settings.\n\nBACKGROUND\nI am an innovative, energetic and highly motivated young professional with a diverse medical background and a passion for prevention, tropical diseases, and island-focused policy and governance.\n\nOriginally from Cura\u00e7ao, I graduated from University of Sheffield (Msc in International Public Health, merit) and from the French School of Public Health (MPH specialization in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, mention tres bien). Prior to that I achieved a Bsc in nursing summa cum laude from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, where I concentrated on Global Health, a one-year interdisciplinary excellence program, and a two-year Honours program Medicine.\n\nEXPERTISE\nAs a former nurse, I have practical & medical expertise with COVID-19; adult (advanced) oncology; gastro-enterology; NCDs; neurology, including Parkinson and cerebral hemorrhage; orthopedics; and geriatrics. Additionally, I briefly researched Dutch vs. EU laws and regulation around testing medication for children as well as early onset neonatal sepsis. My practical experience includes hospital based care and (closed) geriatric care.\n\nAs an active researcher, I have thematic experience with examining geographic, social & gender-based inequalities, as well as researching maternal/neonatal/child survival, intimate partner violence, economic dependence, and assessing the impact of health promotion activities such as a national campaign targeting the prevention of violence/abuse/victim blaming amongst Dutch adolescents.
