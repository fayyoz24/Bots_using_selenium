Matlab/Simulink was used to create a mathematical model of the supercharger, which was then implemented into IBM rhapsody by using C++. To demonstrate the performance of the supercharger a heads up display was made, also in IBM rhapsody, where one could see the engine speeds, and the boost pressure which can be achieved with and without the supercharger.",
