    "summary": "Currently I am a freelance physics teacher at IVIO@school in Lelystad. This institute provides education to children who are not able to be at ordinary schools due to physical or mental disabilities.\nin July 2021 I ended my High School Teacher Physics (eerste graads) position at the Maurick College in Vught, The Netherlands. Previous year I was a physics and math teacher at the Sondervick College in Veldhoven. Before that, for at least 10 years, I worked for Philips Healthcare in The Netherlands where I have been leading research teams which focussed on building and validating prototypes for new diagnostic and therapeutic methods, mainly in the fields of Image Guided Interventions (IGI) and Minimal Invasive Surgery. Clinical application areas include Cardio/Vascular (C/V), Oncology and Neurology. Technical expertise include a.o. software engineering of complex industrial medical scanners, image processing and the physics & construction of medical scanners (MR, XRay, CT, US, PET, SPECT) and devices (PACS). Management expertise include leading, coaching and co-ordinating (international) research and development groups ranging from small to large sized groups.\n\nI have a broad interest in all kinds of topics that concern physics, astrophysics, mathematics, computer science and also the history and philosophy of them. In the past 30 years I have maintained my knowledge and expertise about these topics by spending almost every free hour in studying them. I am an enthusiastic narrator and story-teller about these topics. \nI have a friendly and open character, good at making personal contacts and maintaining networks. I am able to make people feel at ease both individually and in teams.",
