In this project we will focus on the more complex type 2 diabetes (CT2D)  patients  that  are  treated  by  specialized  health  care  professionals  (HCP\u2019s)  in  the  GP  and hospital  setting  as  these  type  of  patients  require  more  guidance  and  more  tailoring  of  their treatment. Study 1 aims to assess among CT2D patients and HCP\u2019s how eHealth can be of added value in the process  of  current  (secondary)  care.  The  input  from  Study  1  will  be  used  to  optimize  program development of the T2D Healthy Living eCoach. Study 2 is a RCT to test the efficacy of the eCoach in comparison with usual care, in an outpatient clinic  and  GP  setting.  The  new  program  will  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  CT2D  patients  and \nHCP\u2019s.  The  RCT  has  two  conditions:  the  new  eCoach  and  standard  care,  with  measurements  at baseline, and at follow-ups at 6 and 12 months after the baseline, and a control condition receiving usual care. The primary outcomes are 1. Diabetes lifestyle score and 2. Medication adherence.  Study 3 assesses the cost effectiveness of the T2D Healthy Living eCoach, from a societal perspective at two levels, the care giver level and the patient level.  \nStudy  4  determines  facilitating  and  hindering  factors  long  term  implementation  of  the  new  the eCoach  in  in  the  Maastricht  and  other  regions,  as  implementation  is  crucial  for  obtaining  health impact.

The General Practice (GP) setting is important to reach Dutch smokers. Yet, its potential is significantly underused despite existing GP smoking cessation guidelines and protocols. Improving and facilitating the realization of these guidelines and thus reaching and assisting smokers who visit the GP with smoking related complaints is an important objective to increase the public health impact of smoking cessation interventions.\n\nPROJECT GOALS\n1. To develop a Pro Active Multicomponent Approach (PAMA) using co-creation principles in order to facilitate the realization of the Dutch smoking cessation guidelines in the General Practice by offering smoking patients with smoking related complaints evidence based interventions (EBIs) to quit smoking from four domains: 1. face to face counseling; 2.eHealth; 3. telephonic counseling; 4. group counseling;\n2. To use shared decision making principles for goal setting and cessation method selection to tailor smoking cessation treatment for smokers with smoking related complaints in primary care and specific at risk groups (e.g. lower educated smoking patients);\n3. To test the (cost) effectiveness, appreciation, feasibility and the likelihood of adoption;\n4. To develop an PAMA implementation guideline for future national implementation.",
