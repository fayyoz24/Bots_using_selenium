I am proficient in SPSS statistical analysis. My undergraduate thesis, supervised by Dr. Caroline Ishen, focused on virtual influencers for social media advertising.\nSince 2020, I have been running my own Red social media account as an influencer and have self-participated in several marketing campaigns. I also work part-time as a freelance model to fund my studies and to gain beauty sense.\nI am currently pursuing a minor in data science and artificial intelligence, drilling Python algorithms, database MySQL, R, and machine learning. As such, my interests lie at the intersection of Quantitative & Qualitative Analysis, Marketing, User Research, and SMO.",
