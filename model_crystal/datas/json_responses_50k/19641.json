The main objective was to grasp a full understanding of the control of electrical machinery, particularly in a PMSM drive. A zero-pole cancellation was used to demonstrate the vector control scheme, but not intended to show the best controller design. The system response is verified for steady-state and transient operation by circuit simulations in PLECS Blockset 4.3.6. In the next step, the possibility to develop a control scheme for shrinking the DC-link capacitance in electric drives will be developed. \n\nProject type:\n\u2022 Internship\n\nKeyword:\n\u2022 Vector control, Coordinate transformation, Cascaded control system, PI-controller.",

The precharge circuit works to assure the current during a power transfer process from the battery to the inverter-fed motor does not exceed its maximum limit. The idea is to place a charging resistor in between the battery and the inverter to limit the surge current due to potential differences. As soon as the voltage of the DC-link capacitor exceeds a certain value, the current path is switched into a resistor-free path. The discharge circuit is implemented by putting a normally closed contactor in parallel with the DC-link capacitor to remove the residual voltage after the car is being turned off.  \n\nProject type:\n\u2022 Extracurricular activities.",
