    "summary": "I am a geospatial and urban researcher, skilled in geospatial and statistical analysis, remote sensing applications, data integration, deprivation/inequality mapping, vulnerability mapping, land-use modelling, accessibility analysis, participatory planning, spatial data visualization, research design, questionnaire design & survey, semi-structured interview, and academic writing.\n\nI would like to apply my geospatial, planning, and academic skills to keeping the world sustainable and livable so that our next generations can breathe and play in a healthful globe.\n\nI have successfully completed my second MSc in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation with a specialization in Urban Planning and Management from ITC, University of Twente, the Netherlands, in July 2020. Currently, I am looking for a PhD position where I will have a chance to solve socio-environmental problems (urban environment & health, urban inequality & well-being, and climate change & disaster risk reduction-related issues).",
