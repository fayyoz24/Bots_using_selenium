    "summary": "I am a highly spirited force prompted by curiosity, learning and deep connections. And I have a dream: to revolutionize the way people and organisations learn and grow. \n\nSo... \nI nurture teams to increase their empathy and leadership impact. This to lead from an authentic and fully expressed self and collective. \nI encourage teams to learn by experimenting and improve through reflection. This to gain deep awareness of the larger whole they are part of and co-lead as a collective. \nI urge teams to push their boundaries and leverage their creative capacity. This to sense the field and co-lead from an emerging future. \n\nMy approach involves surfacing the unsaid and having the tough conversations with honesty and no judgement. Asking critical questions until we have a complete understanding of the system. Conceptualising fast and transitioning to getting it done. So that, together, we create energy and accelerate our success. \n\nMy skills comprise Collective Leadership, Coaching and Mentoring, Scaled Agile and Lean Methodologies, Change Management, Learning Design, UX UI Design.",
