We were involved in a range of activities such as craft, games and outdoor walks. Many of the clients have little or no\nlanguage, and it is unlikely that much improvement in their condition will be seen, but they are very\nfriendly and affectionate, understand a great deal, and are very appreciative of company. One of the best things of being there was the bonds that were slowly created without a lot of verbal communication at all. After a few weeks many were so happy to see you again and spend time with you."
