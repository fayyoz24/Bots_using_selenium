My vision for this event to be successful is to introduce the Indonesian community to Europe, introduce people to the beautiful city of Maastricht, and to maintain the tradition of the Indonesian Students Association Maastricht to continue this event. Above all, I believe that Maastricht Cup 2016 is more than just a tradition or an annual event. I see this event as a platform for Indonesian students in The Netherlands, especially Maastricht, to get together and feel the presence of fellow Indonesians while being away from home.",
