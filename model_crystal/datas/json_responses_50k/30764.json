    "summary": "I am a hard-working and motivated master student currently studying Globalisation and Development Studies at Maastricht University. My main interests are International Relations, Migrations and East and Southeast Asian regions. It reflects on the age I started to learn Chinese: 15 years-old. As a really curious person, I never restrict my topics of learning and found recently, for instance, highly interesting the problematic around animal commodification, exploitation and preservation. \n\nDuring my first master at the University Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, I conducted a research the Khmer National United Front (FUNK) relocated in China from 1970 until 1975. I argue that the regional multipartisan-divisions during the Cold War and the Chinese territorial dependence of the exiled organisation (FUNK) of Norodom Sihanouk participated in the transformation of the Cambodian politics into a communist dictatorship. I value this work deeply, as it was the result of two years of archival research. \n\nThe other experiences I value the most are my international experiences: starting in China where I spend six months of my high school, through a volunteering experience in a refugee camp in Athens, to studies in the Netherlands, Leiden and Maastricht. Those experiences brought me a lot: maturity and adaptability but also communicative skills as much in foreign languages as in cultural understanding. ",
