            "description": "About COST : COST funds pan-European, bottom-up networks of scientists and researchers across all science and technology fields. These networks, called 'COST Actions', promote international coordination of nationally-funded research. \nAbout the COST ES 1002 WIRE Action (see www.wire1002.ch) \nMain Objective  of the WIRE Action is to enhance the methodologies of forecasting wind and solar power production in the time domain of a few minutes up to several days ahead. This will be achieved by combining numerical weather models with suitable post-processing methods as well as real-time surface and remote sensing measurements. A further goal is to establish a common understanding between the relevant communities (wind and solar, meteorologists, energy engineers, grid managers) in order to optimise the technical and economic integration of these renewable energies into electricity grids and markets. Finally, this Action aims at transferring knowledge from advanced to less developed countries in this field.\n\nDue to climate change and shrinking fossil resources, the transition to more renewable energy shares is unavoidable. But, as wind and solar energy is strongly dependent on highly variable weather processes, increased penetration rates will also lead to strong fluctuations in the electricity grid which need to be balanced. Proper and specific forecasting of \u2018energy weather\u2019 is a key component for this. Therefore, it is timely to scientifically address the requirements to provide the best possible specific weather information for forecasting the energy production of wind and solar power plants for the next minutes up to several days ahead.\nThe final COST WIRE report can be downloaded from the COST website www.wire1002.ch or contact me for further information."

            "description": "The Global Weather Enterprise Forum is an international engagement between public, private and academic sectors, which share the common goal of providing accurate weather information and services that save lives, protect infrastructure and enhance economic output.\nWeather impacts people every day. Weather information enables them to get out of harm\u2019s way. As global population rises and climate changes, people are increasingly affected by weather and hazards  (typhoons, windstorms, flooding) This represents a huge challenge to weather science, technology and practice to produce ever more accurate and accessible weather information. The Global Weather Enterprise Forum was created to help meet this challenge.\nThe Global Weather Enterprise (GWE) is the name used to describe those organisations and individuals which contribute to scientific research, technology, observations, modelling, forecasting, and forecast products and services. These activities are aligned with the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda.\nRealizing that building trust among various players is critical to achieve this, over the last few years there have been various conferences where there has been strategic dialogue among key players involving National Meteorological & Hydrological Services (NMHSs), commercial companies and leading universities and academic centers. In Nov. 2017, the World Bank in partnership with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)convened a seminar on the Global Weather Enterprise in Washington DC, which was attended by 70 leaders from public, private and academic sectors. One of the main outcomes of the seminar was the establishment of a GWE Forum, which is jointly supported by a number of international bodies.\nThe GWE Forum serves as a consultative platform between public, private and academic sectors, to steer the dialogue between them and to consider necessary coordinated actions to address the future development of the GWE.\n"

It covers all ATM information, including aeronautical, flight, aerodrome, meteorological, air traffic flow, and surveillance. SWIM consists of standards, infrastructure and governance enabling the management of ATM information and its exchange between qualified parties via interoperable services.\nFor Telvent I actively participated in the SESAR JU developments attending European ATM Meetings and Workshops organised by Eurocontrol in which European Air Traffic Control / ATM organisations participated and where the latest SESAR ATM developments were addressed and discussed including Workpackages per ATM sector. Meteorology was the focus point for us. The Weather Information Exchange Models and Schema (WXCM-WXXM-WXXS) are designed to enable a platform independent, harmonized and interoperable meteorological information exchange covering all the needs of the air transport industry.
