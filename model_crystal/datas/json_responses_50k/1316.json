    "summary": "After completing a bachelor's in psychology, I am currently engaging in the master program Work, Health and Career at the University Maastricht. This program complements my interests in mental health from a preventative perspective and specific application of mental health promotion in the workplace. With my background in psychological research, I aspire to be able to translate research into usable interventions in the work environment. Aside from mental health, I am also highly interested in the use of psychology in the legal system. \n\nNext to my studies, I worked in the hospitality industry which taught me effective self-management, how to coordinate my duties at work and in my studies, and hands-on teamwork. Recently I had the honour to become the student ambassador of my study program, following my passion to help future students to find their academic path. \n\nIn my free time, I am a very social and creative person, who enjoys creating. Over the years I taught myself how to paint, sew, knit and how to create digital art. Besides that, I value investing time into my self-development and becoming happier with myself each day.",

Due to my central role, I had the opportunity to be involved in the planning and execution of different projects ranging from educational talks, to festivities, to fundraisers, to sports events. \n\nI learned how to mediate between different interests and the basics of event planning. In my specific role as treasurer, I took on a large responsibility and gained hands-on knowledge on keeping books. To my surprise, a major skill that improved during this time was communication. I had to interact with different student associations and representatives, where I learned the difficult skill of saying no to proposed projects if they were financially not feasible."
