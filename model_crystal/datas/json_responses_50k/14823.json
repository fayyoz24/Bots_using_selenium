I have extensive background in several key areas, and combine management skills with in-depth knowledge and technical expertise. I have strong communication skills, and am a creative thinker with an unorthodox approach.\n\nI can combine facts extremely fast into a coherent picture. I maintain very high quality standards; for myself, my work, but also for my co-workers.  I work best in an innovative environment, surrounded by other quick thinkers. I am very driven, and I always - always - deliver. \n\nBe warned that I have a wicked sense of humor; I firmly believe that good team spirits help delivering the results needed.",
