            "description": "This 8 month project was in conjunction with my Master's thesis which studied the power dynamics between state and local governments regarding protection mechanisms for peri-urban agriculture. These regions of agriculture on the edge of urban areas are shirnking in size in many parts of the world due to sustained urbanisation trends, a lack of definition about what defines a peri-urban agricultural area, and poor protective planning policy. Utilising Sydney as a case study, the project involved qualitative research techniques whereby interviewing of local and state government members occured, with this data then coded and analysed to form the thesis report. \n\nThe findings of the report highlights how a negative power dynamic between state and local government does hinder protective planning policy for peri-urban agricultural areas. A lack of accountability regarding who is responsible for maintainting these areas was showcased, as well as problems with communication and collaboration between the two levels of government. \n\nRecommendations to improve state-local dynamics include scaling up the frequency and intensity of collaboration, including the expansion of collaboration to include the broader community in peri-urban regions. Further to this, a legitimate role for local level policy is needed to enable to creation of binding rules and regulations which are locally enforceable to stop unauthorised encroachments into peri-urban regions.",

Once in Wuppertal, interviews and questionnaires were conducted with the public both planned through prior contact with relevant stakeholders, and randomly through engaging with people in the street. \n\nA final report was delivered to the Wupperverband outling the findings of the research and potential areas of recommendation. Themes of the research results highlighted the importance of enhancing community consultation regarding warning systems for flood events and the imperative role of education in the public regarding flood susceptibility and how flooding occurs so quickly in Wuppertal.",

            "description": "This project involved the creation of a community garden masterplan for the remote township of Walgett in north-western New South Wales in Australia. Following years of drought, the local river system was severely deplenished and very strict water restrictions were imposed on the town. This meant that the community garden could not be irrigated and so many of the crops perished. Not only did the community garden provide a degree of food security for the local population, it was an important cultural and social space where people of the small town could come together and care for the garden. \n\nMy role in the project was to lead younger student colleagues in the Bachelor of Lanscape Architecture program at UNSW to retrofit the community garden to save water and increase the efficiency of the irrigation system in collaboration with student engineers from another faculty of the university. Over the course of the year, design iterations were presented and meetings were held regularly to coordinate a new design for the garden. A test system was set up on the university campus, with plants selected and a mock irrigation system implemented to test the design before implementation in Walgett. \n\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 unfortunately led to the project being placed on hold, at which time I transitioned to working full time at Arcadia Landscape Architecture.",
