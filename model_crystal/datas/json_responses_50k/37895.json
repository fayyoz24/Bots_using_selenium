    "summary": "I am passionate about experiencing the unfamiliar. Having obtained a Master in Anthropology after doing a Bachelor in Business Administration illustrates an important shift in my live. Even though I am still very much interested in business modeling and accounting/finance, I have combined this with my heartfelt passion for international development cooperation, sustainability and the idea of respecting cultures and people. \n\nFor me sustainability, development cooperation and business should not be separated but integrated. I believe that each of us shares a certain global responsibility and that is to show mutual respect in all types of relationships, relationships concerning people, the environment, organisation and even nations. \n\nFurthermore I love reading, vegetarian cooking, attending international development debates and seminars, nature walks and traveling. I am interested in music, cultures, religions, anthropology, philanthropy, sustainability, micro finance, international development economics and social impact investing.",

I single-handily coordinated and executed the 2014-2015 Development Impact Report specifically focusing on 2 major topics with the Financial Institutions Department namely: 1) the development effectiveness of SME-on lending through FIs and 2) E&S performance at FIs. This research included a field visit to Bangladesh where I visited and evaluated two case banks and also experienced our E&S Sustainable Ship Recycling Initiative. Having been part of the Strategy team I have been able to witness up close the implementation process of FMO's audacious goal and strategy of: \"Doubling Impact and Halving Footprint to become leading impact investor\". In addition I was involved in the strategy development for stimulating \"inclusive investments\" within FMO. As this traineeship was apart of my AMID program, I have really dived deep into the world of development banking which I find very promising for the development spectrum in general. Other assignments included a) the assistance with the PSD government evaluation program for which I reviewed proposals and effectiveness studies, b) writing a position paper on the need for investments in post conflict and fragile states and c) assisted in organizing joint EDFI (European Development Financial Institutions) workshops.",
