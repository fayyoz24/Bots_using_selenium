    "summary": "Dear reader, great to have you on my LinkedIn profile! Here\u2019s some more information about my person.\n\nAfter having finished my bilingual school education and working in France and Austria for one year, I realized that I feel most comfortable in an international environment, such as the campus of Maastricht University, where I started a Bachelor's degree in International Business Economics with a major in Finance. \n\nWhile still being very interested in the financial field, my year in the board of SCOPE Maastricht (one of the biggest study associations in the Netherlands) inspired me to seek a Master's degree in the tech field. I used the time during the COVID pandemic to educate myself about computer science by taking introductory online classes and eventually completed my Master's degree at the Amsterdam Business School, writing my thesis on the topic of AI-CAD solutions for the detection of breast cancer. Building on that foundation, I am now doing my PhD at the Durham University Business School, conducting research in the field of human-algorithm interactions in healthcare.\n\nTo give you a small impression about me, please have a look at my profile below. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!",

Together with 12 students of my bilingual history class and a production crew, we traveled to the front of World War I in France and Belgium. The project was inspired by a diary entry of the city council Thomas Esser, who traveled to the front 100 years ago to bring presents to the soldiers on site. The premier of the movie took place in the state parliament in D\u00fcsseldorf with the french ambassador Philippe \u00c9tienne. The movie is still part of an exhibition of the outdoor museum Kommern.",
