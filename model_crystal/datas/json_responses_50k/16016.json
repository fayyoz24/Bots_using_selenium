    "summary": "In 2017, I graduated from the University of Groningen with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology, and a minor in Behavioural Neuroscience. That same year, I started a Research Master programme in Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences at the University of Groningen. Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Groningen, studying the neural mechanisms of behavioural flexibility in humans and mouse models.\n\nMy main research interests lie in reward learning in the brain, and the complex interplay of the brain structures involved when we learn to associate sensory experiences with reward. Furthermore, I am interested in how this interplay changes across the lifespan. Reward learning represents the core of my PhD project, during which I am measuring electroencephalographic (EEG) responses in both human subjects and mice to answer fundamental questions about how the brain stores reward-associated experiences, and how this changes with ageing.",
