    "summary": "TLDR - This is me in 25 words:\nKey characteristics: Creative | Analytic | Motivating | Flexible | Leader\nInterests: Tech & Innovation | Entrepreneuring | Traveling | Scuba diving & Marine life | Cooking & Dining | Sports\nProfessional background: See my profile below ;)\n\u2014----------------------------------------------------------\n\t\nIf you would\u2019ve asked me what I wanted to become when I was young, I would\u2019ve answered rich or to become an astronaut. The minimalistic answers and silly dreams of a little boy. \n\t\t\nToday I would give you a more sophisticated answer, though I would prefer to rephrase the question. It's not about \u2018what\u2019, but rather \u2018who\u2019 do you want to become.\n\nI aim to be that person who is optimistic about life, who doesn\u2019t think in problems, but instead sees chances. Someone who believes in cooperation, who listens to others and tries to understand a different perspective, someone who will always be looking for the win/win. Someone who asks for feedback and from whom you can expect honesty, because I believe this will help us grow. I want to be that ambitious guy from whom you can expect an energetic vibe and creativity in the solutions to be found.\n\nOh and that \u2018becoming an astronaut\u2019 thing? It is still my #1 bucket list item to see earth from space. I'll be first in line when space tourism picks up.\n\nThe rest of my goals are: \n-\tTo work for a brand in which I believe, in an open and ambitious environment that stimulates growth and creativity and supports people to learn from each other. \n-\tTo have a home for me and my loved ones and to make sure that friends can always count on me \n-\tTravel the world, explore, dive, enjoy (winter)sports, meet new people, see different cultures\n-      Dream and let others dream with me\n\nPlease feel free to reach out, I would love to meet you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nSteven",
