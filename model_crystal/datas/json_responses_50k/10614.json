Elite rowing environments, at least from a european standard, do not exist in Uganda. Fortunately, his transportation to these events has been covered by FISA, the World Rowing Organization.\n\nUnfortunately, the elite coaching, methodology and equipment to be competitive on a world stage is something he severely lacks. Basics such as proper nutrition and clothing are also a challenge. This is where we need your help.\n\nOlympic Solidarity, is defined as the  \u201caim is to organize assistance for all the National Olympic Committees (NOC), particularly those with the greatest needs, so that they can develop their own structures to favor the expansion of sport in their country,\u201d are noble. It's Bigger Than You feels this is a noble cause.\n\nOur commitment, though, is to ensure that athletes, especially those from NOC's with fledgling rowing federations, have the proper tools they need to be physically, psychologically and emotionally ready for these types of racing environments. Gerald's success inspires future Ugandan athletes to row, and develops Uganda's Rowing Programs for future generations. \n\nHamadou Djibo Issaka of Niger, who was invited to race in the men's single sculls in the 2012 Olympics, was quoted in a recent article :\u201cWhen asked about finishing so far behind in his races, the quietly spoken Issaka replied that he was \u201cused to it\u201d and didn't mind\u2026\u201d\n\nThe invitation of all athletes should be accompanied with a true commitment to the athlete as well.",
