    "summary": "Enthusiastic engineering student with a broad interest and strong analytic back-ground. Not afraid of a challenge, driven by curiosity and continuously looking to develop himself. I enjoy solving complex problems in a team and being in a position where I am able to make a significant and positive impact. \n\nCurrently I'm working on my Master's assignment on autonomous navigation of mobile robots. I expect to graduate in June 2020 and am open discuss opportunities. I'm interested in jobs related to system-engineering, sustainable technology and aerospace engineering.\n\nBesides studying at the University of Twente, I have been a full-time member of Solar Team Twente and fulfilled the role of chairman in the board of study association Advanced Technology Astatine. In addition I co-founded a technological consultancy firm. These and other extracurricular activities enabled me to develop a wide range of hard and soft skills. Personal interests include flying sailplanes, hiking and traveling. \n\nIf you'd like to have a coffee, please don't hesitate to contact me!\n",
