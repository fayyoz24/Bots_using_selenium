    "summary": "My mission is to catalyze transformative innovation movements to mature societal alternatives in the face of the climate emergency, through practicing, supporting and researching network leadership. So far I worked mainly with networks of student-led and community-led sustainability initiatives, including the Global Ecovillage Network, Transition Network, ECOLISE, the Green Office Movement and SOS International. \n\nI seek to work with a variety of transformative movements to help amplify their impact for fundamental, wide-spread and lasting impact, in service of a regenerative, just and thriving future for humanity.\n\nMy skills are facilitating group processes, workshops and virtual community building, strategic systems thinking, network development and evaluation.",

Bridging gaps between disciplines and faculties, as well as between the academia and society was a main orientation of my work, inspired by inter- and transdisciplinary research. \n\nSpecifically, I developed a Living Laboratory program, whereby students get the possibility to research on real-life sustainability challenges of stakeholders within and outside the university and thereby to support the change-making efforts of these actors. \n\nAdditionally, I organized symposia for researchers to develop a knowledge network that fosters inter-disciplinary research and knowledge exchange across UM faculties, addressing the grand challenges of the 21st century. \n\nFinally, I coordinated the Maastricht University Journal of Sustainability Studies, which offers students the possibility to publish their sustainability-related papers and theses in a peer-reviewed academic journal.",
