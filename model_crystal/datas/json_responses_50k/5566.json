From three days before their flight onwards, passengers can book a timeslot through the website and Schiphol app. \nPassengers with a timeslot are given priority access to security, thus skipping the waiting lines. This reduces passenger stress and raises overall passenger satisfaction for the airport. The real benefit for the airport however, is to be able to nudge passengers into a timeslot that is more favorable to the security capacity, by spreading out passenger inflow. This reduces waiting times for all passengers!",

A week before the day of operation, I handover a makeable and feasible plan to the Airport Operational Centre.

In my role as commercial developer for the real estate division, I led the team of professionals in the development stage of this project, consisting of a technical developer, property manager, location manager, retail manager and a representative of the transportation division. A five year construction period of a public area with over 200,000 passengers daily has an enormous impact. All operational services are vital to the public transport system nationwide, while the station building is being demolished and rebuilt in six stages. It was my responsibility to encorporate as much of the stakeholder's and passengers demands into the project, operating in a highly sensitive organization and surroundings. Together with the Railway Infrastructure company and the municipality, I have optimized the design for commercial use. \n\nAlso for the Dutch Railways, I worked on land area transformation project from a railway emplacement to a residential district in the city of Delft. Due to the economic crisis, prices had dropped and the old development plan was no longer viable. Together with the team we created a new, financially sound development plan, robust enough to cope with changes over time and with a high standard on residential quality and connecting two city parts that had been divided by the railway tracks. \n\nIt is very important for me to work as part of a team that share my passion, integrity and focus on service. I am known for my enthousiasm and I take pride in the projects that I work at and the team that I work with.",
