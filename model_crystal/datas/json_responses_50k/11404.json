The CUDA language natively already provides nearest neighbor and linear interpolation within 1D, 2D and 3D texture data. Many applications, however, could benefit from higher order interpolation. This especially applicable to CUDA, since it is targeted at making the processing power of the graphics processing unit (GPU) available for general purpose applications (GPGPU).",
