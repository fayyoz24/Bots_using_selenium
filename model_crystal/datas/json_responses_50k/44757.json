    "summary": "We need responsible AI. For that to happen it's crucial that we translate ethical values and principles into concrete guidelines for developers of AI and organisations deploying AI. At TU Delft I work on precisely those issues, as a researcher focussing on explainable AI and as managing director of the TU Delft Digital Ethics Centre, a world-leading centre on precisely the translation of ethical values to concrete design requirements. I lead projects across domains, with UWV on social security, Erasmus Medical Centre on healthcare, TNO on AI in the Military, and more. \n\nNext to my academic work I value always valued public engagement. I've written three popular science books and regularly contribute to science communication on mathematics and (responsible) AI.",
