    "summary": "Hi my name is Bernard de Lange. I have 15+ years of working experience as a project manager on large IT & business projects in the financial and non-profit sector. What I noticed is that many employees do not enjoy Prince2 and alike structured projects. The main reason is that they have to finalize their project tasks without having much influence on how the work is being organized. For that reason and because of the trend I specialised myself as an Agile/Scrum Product Owner from 2012 on. \n\nI am successful in project management because of my approach. I do not only manage the project result and stakeholders satisfaction, but also take into account the employee happiness on the work floor. Besides structured approaches like Prince2, IPMA and Agile I utilize all my personal senses and empathic skills in order to manage in a more holistic manner. By my approach the project members are more valuated and the overall project is more in its flow. This flow results in earlier project completion with lesser effort and with lesser costs. \n\nMy Specialties: \n*) Financial sector (banks and insurance companies, mortgage and lease firms)\n*) Business & IT Migration and Fusion of financial organizations\n*) Compliancy projects\n*) Internet projects\n*) E-Commerce / Social E-Commerce projects\n*) Agile/Scrum System Development\n\nInterested? Contact me on +31 (0)6 \u2013 4 6556 333.\n",
