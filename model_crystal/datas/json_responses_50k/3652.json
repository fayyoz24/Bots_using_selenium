    "summary": "\nAs for myself, I am a renewable energy organiser. Over the past years, I built up extensive experience as business developer and before that, as consultant, dealing with climate mitigation projects (including renewable energy such as wind, solar PV and thermal, biomass, geothermal and energy efficiency for buildings), feasibility, clean energy planning and monitoring and evaluation, in Eastern Europe and in Asia. I served utilities, investors, project developers, NGOs and financial institutions in assessing the risks for investing in CO2 emission reduction projects and develop opportunities to implement new projects leading to CO2 emission reductions.  Further, I worked for local, national and international authorities including the EBRD (clean energy credit line in Slovakia). I prepared partnerships and led EU funded projects for clean energy in Eastern Europe, in extensive collaboration with local partners. I  worked on the preparation and feasibility of wind energy and bio energy projects, both in the Netherlands and in South-East Europe. I  managed the consultancy activities for the Bulgarian office of Ecofys International and its follow up entity (2006\u20142012).\n\nSpecialties: Clean energy and finance for banks and entrepreneurs.\nDeveloping and managing consultancy assignments\nCoordinating international projects\nSourcing renewable energy and carbon projects\nBuilding stable project consortia",
