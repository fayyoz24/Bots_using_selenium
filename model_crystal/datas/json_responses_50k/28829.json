    "summary": "Having received a master's degree in Limnology and Oceanography at the University of Amsterdam in which I conducted several researches made me consider my ambitions. I choose to continue studying to step out of my comfort zone and enhance my professional skills and therefore followed the ILO course 'Biology Teacher in Secondary Education'. As I was doing this, I found out that I took great satisfaction in transferring my knowledge unto others.\n\nDuring my biology studies I did research on several topics including genetics and marine and aquatic ecology. Furthermore, since these experiments took place in both the field and the laboratory, I learned how to set up researches as well as critically analyse my data and write scientific reports of my findings. In addition, having conducted one of my experiments abroad in an international setting allowed me to come in contact with multiple cultures and I found out that I enjoyed it. This experience enhanched my feelings of having made the right desicion towards becoming a teacher. Every day I meet my classes with their mixtures of familiar and less familiar cultures and every day I learn something new from my students.\n\nHaving experience in research I quickly developed the ability to prepare and organize which was of great importance for my time in front of the class. Since teaching a class takes a lot of preparation, these skills allowed me to spent more time creating creative exercises or very varying lessons, as well as organize project-weeks or educational trips.\n\nAt the Meergronden I was given the opportunity to teach classes in English, one I grabbed with both hands. Teaching biology in another language is a fun and sometimes challenging matter since students have to grasp both new biological concepts and handle the language. Being able to succesfully transfer knowledge and see students grow under those conditions is immensely satisfying. ",
