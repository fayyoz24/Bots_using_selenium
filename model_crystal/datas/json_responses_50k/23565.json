I started with one product and extended QA to four products within a year. \n\n- Identified gaps and initiated several new projects, including the establishment of a CI/CD pipeline, which were all completed successfully. The projects increased technical output and efficiency, significantly reduced the time between build and delivery, extended coverage, and increased overall confidence in my team. \n\n- Effectively offloaded the burden on local UAT teams by increasing the test coverage, implementing the shift-left approach, implementing better processes, and reducing the QA cycle duration. This led to a significant improvement in the quality of the product delivered, which was lauded by both customers and partners.\n\n- Started with a team of three and grew to ten people within a year. I helped people reach their professional goals by generating the right opportunities in the team, and in turn helped the company reach its goals by delivering a better quality software. \n\n- Recruited and trained several new hires. I set up a training program which successfully onboarded people in the team.",
