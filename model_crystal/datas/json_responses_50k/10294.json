    "summary": "I am a people-oriented changemaker with 7 years of work experience in operations, business development, finance, and strategy in the financial industry. \n\nI have a solid track record of overperforming commercial and customer satisfaction targets and transferring those skills through coaching and education. I'm known for excellent communication skills, fostering cross-departmental collaboration, and a solutions-focused mindset.\n\nAs a growth seeker, all things development make me tick. I love coaching and developing talent and innovating and implementing new methodologies, processes, and services.\n\nSocial activism for LGBTQ+ rights, gender and racial equality, the fight against polarization, and climate change are close to my heart. I've been volunteering for human rights causes and practicing active citizenship for over 15 years (time before business school) by engaging in various activities ranging from human rights monitoring to writing political opinions, signing petitions, and participating in marches.",
