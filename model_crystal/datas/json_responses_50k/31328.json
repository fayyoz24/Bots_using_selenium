    "summary": "As a Freelance Business Manager, I leverage my hospitality management degree and sales experience to provide effective and efficient services to various clients and businesses. I enjoy connecting with people and finding solutions to their needs, whether it is as a personal assistant, a project manager, an event planner, or an account manager.\n\nPreviously, I worked as an Account Executive at Booking.com, where I managed and grew a portfolio of over 300 accommodation partners in the Netherlands. I also worked as a Business Development Representative at Virtuagym, where I generated and qualified leads for the sales team. In both roles, I used CRM tools and sales strategies to achieve and exceed my targets and to build long-term relationships with customers.\n\nI am always eager to learn new skills and looking to take on new challenges in sustainable industries. I would love to chat with you over a virtual coffee and explore how I can add value to your projects.",
