I am working on the project of development of spectral conversion foils that could convert the UV-blue and IR part of solar light into visible light. My work in these projects have helped scientific community in taking a significant leap in sustainable and environment- friendly synthesis of large quantities of nanocrystals having applications in solar cells, LEDs and spectral conversion layers. I have expertise on microscopic techniques or AFM correlated micro-PL spectroscopy and Micro-PL- Raman spectroscopy to study light-matter interaction at nanoscopic level. Besides, I have collaborations with other research groups on development of various functional alloys. During this period, I have mentored 2 Master students, 2 PhD students and 4 undergraduate students.",
