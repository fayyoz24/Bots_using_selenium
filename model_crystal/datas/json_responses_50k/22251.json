    "summary": "Energic, innovative, bottom-line impact-oriented finance professional with 17 years of experience in Business facing roles in the Energy industry (6 yrs Asset Finance, 7 yrs Projects Finance,1 yr Tax support on a project basis, 3\u00bd yr Digitalisation/CI SME). Over the years I am recognized for my contributions by business stakeholders as well as supporting functions such as Project Control, Supply Chain and IMIT. At the moment I specifically focus on a portfolio of Digitalisation & CI (Continuous Improvement) projects within and outside Finance. I get energy from making a value impact and delivering upon continuous improvement projects enabled by Digitalisation.\n\nI am enthusiastic, tenacious, a self-starter with a can-do mentality who is known to stimulate others regarding change management. A team-player searching for cross-functional collaborations to achieve the maximum joint value contributions to the business. Actively share knowledge / best practices with peers and across functions. Curious by nature I am always eager to learn about new innovations. \n\nWhen I am not working, I like to spend quality time with my wife and 2 daughters, family & friends. I love to be outside and cycle every day before the world awakes and still think windsurfing is the best sport there is. \n\nAlways interested to meet new people from different backgrounds with a positive mindset. Send me a PM if you want to connect / cross-share knowledge.",
