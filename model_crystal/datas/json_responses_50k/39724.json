    "summary": "I'm passionate about technology since my very early days as a kid. As a professional I developed really innovative systems for several applications but most of the time for the semi conductor industry. At the end of my carreer I switched from the semi conductor to the agri tech business, I'm going back to my roots in this way as a son of a farmer but still driven by my passion about technology. With Farmertronics I have planned to develop an unmanned clean tech tractor as part of a clean tech farm to make a next step in smart and sustainable farming.

A first pilot system of this high available and scalable computer platform has been introduced in the field at the end of 2011. The roll-out of this platform to all customers continues in 2012 and beyond.\n\nTwinscan project:\nI was working at the data handling host and Voyager project. With these projects ASML moved from SUN/Solaris to X86/Linux computing platforms for all scanners.\n\n450 mm project:\nAs an equipment engineer software I defined the reliability, availability, manufacturability and serviceabilty requirements for the development  of a new scanner platform for the production of 450 mm wafers. I made some design proposals for software and computer systems to get a higher availability and serviceabilty of this new scanner platform.",

During this period we started this local organisation and brought it to a profesionally organised group of volunteers to mitigate poverty by supplying food to poor people donated by super markets and other professional organisations. In fact we implemented the cradle to cradle principle in a very effective way trying to solve one of the most serious issues in our society, unhuman poverty."
