    "summary": "How can law help promote positive environmental change? This is the driving question behind my research and teaching as assistant professor in the field of Environmental Law. I work at Wageningen University & Research, a leading global university in the fields of agriculture and environment.  \n\nMy main interests as researchers lay at the intersection of agriculture, nature conservation, and climate. I enjoy carrying out field research with farmers, policy makers and other stakeholders like nature organizations to find out how laws can be made more effective in practice, with the aim of transitioning towards a sustainable future. I enjoy working in collaborative, interdisciplinary settings.",

Within the EU context, the regulatory framework governing such policies is found most prominently in the EU Birds & Habitats Directive as well as the Common Agricultural Policy. \n\nThe study takes the Netherlands as a case study, where, in 2016, a range of regulatory roles such as the distributing of agri-environmental subsidies, as well as monitoring of the results and, where necessary, enforcing set rules, were shifted from the state level to private-led \u2018environmental cooperatives\u2019. There are currently forty, region-based, environmental cooperatives in place, composed of groups of farmers and other stakeholders, such as environmental organizations and members of civil society. Overarching policy objectives are still set at the state level, but the individual cooperatives enjoy great flexibility in deciding the most effective way to realise these objectives locally, based on the preferences and capabilities of the group. \n\nWhile the potential merits of the cooperative approach for combating biodiversity loss and landscape deterioration in agricultural contexts has been recognized in the literature, little attention has been given to the benefits and risks of the move towards self-regulation from a law and governance perspective. Employing qualitative research methods, this research examines and critically evaluates the role and functioning of environmental cooperatives in the nature governance landscape, focusing particularly on their role in the implementation of agri-environmental rules and policy objectives flowing from the EU level, to the individual farmer level. \n\nMy research is part of European Research Council funded Effective Nature Laws project.",

            "description": "Climate Case Ireland was started by Friends of the Irish Environment and is the first case in Ireland to hold the government to account for its contributions to dangerous levels of climate change. On Friday, July the 31st, the Supreme Court quashed the government's 2017 National Mitigation Plan. Seven judges unanimously ruled that it did not give enough detail on the reduction of greenhouse gases.\nThe impact of the ruling is that the Government cannot make long-term commitments about climate change without showing how they would be achieved.\n\nAs a spokesperson for the case, I have spoken at several events including the Dublin Human Rights festival, Trinity College Green week, TU Dublin Activist Academy, DIT College Green week and more. I have also given a range of workshops and have organized climate awareness events for the case including 'Message to the Earth', in the Fumbally Stables, Dublin, and 'Dress to Protest' (for the climate rallies) in the Tara Building, Dublin.
