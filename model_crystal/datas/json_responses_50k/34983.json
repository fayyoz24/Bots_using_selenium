There is a lack of information regarding how the built environment influences aspects such as patient well-being, patient safety, and staff satisfaction. Presenters will propose a technique for analyzing the influence of the complex, multi-factorial healthcare environment on patient and staff outcomes in order to identify areas for improvement. They will discuss the advantages of using fuzzy logic and discuss methods that support research on the performance of a complex healthcare setting using a case study example of a Dutch Hospital.",

Yet the end result \u2013 a building, or an urban plan - should not be a sum of the personal assumptions but rather a product of design decisions based on the best available evidence, and in this case those are the needs of the users in a specific context, weather that is a mobility hub, a hospital or a city district. But to be able to obtain the \u2018best available evidence\u2019 there should also be ways to study the successful designs and to learn from them. We should be able to understand why certain environments are more successful than the others? What the secret of that success is? What are the design intentions and how successful where they? In this lecture, Sanja Durmisevic proposed the way of dealing with this topic and explain the added value of the proposed approach.",

Using the best available knowledge and a variety of methods, with a user-centered focus, I am contributing to  a realization of Healthy Urban Environments, both on a scale of a building and urban domain/neighborhoods. \n\nIn the coming years, the challenge will be to rebuild our environments and heal the domains that need the healing. Apart from what is technically possible, our perceptions, emotions and behaviors play an important role in a process of healing. When developing new areas by using best available evidence and monitoring impacts it is possible to see directly the effects of our action. By healing our environments locally, our environment will become both wealthier and healthier globally.\n\nThe societal challenges of today and tomorrow, environmental crisis and the economic development are tied together and are a result of our actions taken in the past. With a shared vision across disciplines and across borders, I believe that it is possible to pave a path to healing our environments and shape the desired reality by bringing closer together science and practice and engagement of citizens and users in shaping our common future. Only together we can contribute to successfully rebuilding our future the way we want it to be.",
