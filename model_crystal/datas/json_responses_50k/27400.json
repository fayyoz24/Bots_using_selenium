    "summary": "I am professor in Big Data Ecosystems for Business and Society at the University of Amsterdam, where I am researching how business and society can maximize the benefits of insights gained through big data analysis. Furthermore, I am partner in charge of our 100+ FTE Data & Analytics team at KPMG Advisory in the Netherlands and member of the global Data & Analytics leadership team of KPMG, responsible for our AI related risk management propositions. I founded KPMG\u2019s Big Data and Advanced Analytics team over a decade ago and our responsible AI team in 2017. In both cases, we were one of the first professional service firms in the world with such teams.\n\nI had a leading role in our restructuring efforts to integrate Data Analytics in all client offerings at KPMG in the Netherlands. We first brought all Data Analytics capabilities together in a central unit and subsequently established an agile hub & spoke model where multidisciplinary squads provide market ready solutions in a decentralized structure. I effectively acted as interim Chief Data Officer (CDO) at KPMG in 2022 and hired the current Chief Data Officer, taking on a coaching role myself.\n\nI am a senior member of the Complex Cyber Infrastructures research group at the UvA, supervising around 5 PhD students at any given time. I manage a research portfolio of about 5 million euro and have a well-recognized track record in acquiring and managing large (multi-million) and high impact multidisciplinary research projects, requiring advanced and pragmatic stakeholder management. I am a fan of modular, agile and decentralized organizational structures as described in one of my books: \u201cBuilding Trust in a Smart Society\u201d.\n\nI am an excellent communicator with the ability to explain complex topics in an understandable way. I act as board level advisor on Digital Transformations with a focus on the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related impact of data and AI. In my lectures for groups ranging from bachelor students to experienced executives typical feedback includes words like inspirational and motivational. My first book, called \u201cWe are Big Data\u201d is one of the most sold books on Big Data in the Netherlands and was runner-up in the management book of the year awards in 2015.\n\nI worked on a number of projects for CERN, world\u2019s largest physics institute in Geneva and was a member of the ATLAS team that discovered the Higgs Boson (Nobel prize 2013). I received several grants and awards related to high performance distributed computing in physics and have numerous publications in this area.",
