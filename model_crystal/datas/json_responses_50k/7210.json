In relation to the growing amount of visitors to protected areas and the influnece that humans can have on their surroundings a case study was considered in the Netherlands. The influence that the presence of humans has on the resource selection of Red deer in and around Veluwzoom national park was investigated. Visitor numbers were estimated using open source data and machine learning.  The timing of visitation was linked to the movements of red deer in the area. Using the AMT package in R the resource selection of the red deer was modelled. Subsequently it was found that red deer resource selection is influenced by the presence of people. That this influence may vary with greater numbers of people present could not be proven.",

The space time cube or STC is a 3D visualization of space and time movement where the z axis visualizes time not height. So as an object moves upwards slowly and in the xy direction quicky the object is moving fast and vice versa. The chosen medium for visualization was R the open source program. STC Visualization was already possible however the produced results were neither legible nor useful. This thesis project aimed to improve the R STC visualization by applying standardised scale and symbology so as to reduce clutter and improve legibility. \n\nSee the project URL for results",
