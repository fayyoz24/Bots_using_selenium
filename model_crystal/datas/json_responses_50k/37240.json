    "summary": "With over 15 years\u2019 professional experience in impact investing, international development, and corporate finance, I am committed to fostering sustainable and inclusive change by leveraging innovative finance to unlock funding for underserved markets and challenges.\n\nLeading GAIN\u2019s innovative finance work to increase the funds dedicated to nutrition and to consciously target them towards the high priority needs of the most vulnerable. The Nutritious Foods Financing Facility (N3F) is the first nutrition impact fund focused explicitly on improving diet quality and nutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa through financing small and medium enterprises involved in the provision of affordable, safe, and nutritious local food. The N3F goal is to transform food systems so that they deliver more nutritious foods for all people, especially the most vulnerable, including women and girls that experience poor nutrition disproportionately.\n\nPrior to nutrition, I have focused on accelerating an industry of clean, sustainable household energy solutions for cooking in the Global South, by growing the pipeline of investible businesses and mobilizing public and private sector investment towards energy access. Managing a portfolio of 10 clean cooking companies, I worked closely with entrepreneurs to support their business growth and scale their impact directly, indirectly (through 3rd party technical assistance) as well as through grants.\n\nHaving worked as a Senior Investment Manager for an impact investing direct initiative, I developed a broad range of expertise, from deal sourcing, due diligence and deal execution of debt investments in SMEs operating in the off-grid energy and agribusiness processing sectors in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. \n\nBefore impact investing, I worked in both international development and corporate finance, with responsibilities spanning the financial management of the Human Development Innovation Fund in Tanzania and the Livelihood and Food Security Programme in Zimbabwe (DFID-funded programs).\n\nFostering collaborations and building on-the-ground networks of investment partners, I have led efforts with mandates to source and screen scalable investment opportunities, and co-developed tailored approaches to impact measurement, to monitor sustainable inclusive impact on communities.",
