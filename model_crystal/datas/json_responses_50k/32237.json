Therefore, I learned that real business always needs a hands-on approach and that every second situation will be different from the other. That is what makes Marketing and Communications such interesting subjects to me; every day can and will be different!\n\nCaldic's Headquarters in Rotterdam, where I was situated, is an example corporate environment. My colleague and I were the centre of all Marketing and Communication utterances of the 43 worldwide countries that Caldic represented at that time. It was therefore very important to keep a close and strict eye on the corporate identity and to make sure that the mission statement and vision were represented in all different media types. \n\nAt Caldic I was responsible for: Communication (internal & external), Marketing, Website, Social media, Brochures, Exhibitions, Photography, Graphic design, PR and Events.",

This was the time that I finished my first bachelors and was planning on a great trip around the world.

Since I'm not the kind of person who likes to waste time, I decided to find a job that didn't only help me out on the money part, but also helped in having a very valuable new experience. Since planning and budgets weren't my favorites at that time, I decided to face those in this job at Center Parcs. \n\nAt Center Parcs I was responsible for:\n- Planning and coordination of allocations\n- Marketing campaigns in case of overstock\n- Communication with all different parties and keeping them satisfied (e.g. weekendjeweg.nl and booking.com but also the bookings department of Center Parcs)\n- Rapidly acting in case of double bookings\n\nThe thing I learned best during this period is how important planning is and how it works during day to day business.
