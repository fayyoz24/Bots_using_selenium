During my time there I provided first-hand assistance to the individuals seeking asylum. My time in Calais encouraged me to develop my knowledge of international law so that in the future I will not only be able to provide some practical volunteering aid, but also help through my knowledge of the law. \nI also volunteered in an administrative capacity with my role as a member of the 'Welcome Team'. In this role I was tasked with welcoming new volunteers and guiding them around the warehouse. I also handled incoming emails from prospective volunteers and coordinated the weekly expenses which encompassed the onsite charity shop, fuel expenses for distribution vehicles amongst many other items."
