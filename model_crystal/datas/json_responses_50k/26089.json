    "summary": "Experienced TV-commercial professional with a diverse portfolio of successful campaigns for renowned brands like KFC, Zein Telecom, Snickers, Orange Telecom, Kareem taxi, Meem Bank, and more. My work extends across multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, The United Arab Emirates, and Iraq. Notably, I portrayed a French spy in a popular Lebanese series and featured in a Dutch theater production, \"Witch-Hunt,\" performed in 6 cities across the Netherlands. My approach is characterized by open-mindedness, respectfulness, wise curiosity, and attentive listening, which fuels my constant drive for skill refinement and professional growth. Looking forward to collaborating with production companies and casting directors for exciting new projects. Connect with me to explore potential opportunities in the TV-commercial field.\nI had worked as a production manager in a Salads and chopped vegetables production line. Further more I worked as a social counselor with VluchtelingenWerk.",
