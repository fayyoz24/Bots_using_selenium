            "description": "The discussion concerning the world-wide energy transition has been surrounded by a continuously recurring problem in the Netherlands: the lack of available area due to a high population density. This project contributes to this transition by designing a system which can provide Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) with all its electricity demands by harvesting energy from renewable sources, all while operating above the clouds -- limiting the impact of the system on ground activities -- and placing a focus on the application of sustainable materials (Garcia 2019). Harvesting energy above the clouds also brings advantages regarding the amount of energy that can be captured, as wind speeds and solar intensity are higher above the lower-layer clouds, which are located 2 km above the ground.\n\nMission need statement: To provide TU Delft with its energy demands by using an environmentally-sustainable flying energy-harvesting station operating above the low-level clouds.\n\nSupervision and support from:\nDr. S.J.
