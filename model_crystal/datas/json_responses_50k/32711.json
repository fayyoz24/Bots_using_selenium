The statistical tests used in this study demonstrate that the datasets from different instruments do not sample the same underlying distribution.

Similarly, for WASP-76 b, variations in the offsets ranging from 350 to 1000 ppm were identified. This evidence casts doubt on the hypothesis that data from different space-based instruments can be combined seamlessly, without considering instrument compatibility.",

I relate the physics and the resulting detector properties to two space-based applications; detection of asteroids and detection of space debris. For the former, IR detectors in general and both QWIPs and T2SL(S) based telescopes would offer a significant and necessary addition to current capabilities. I identify the radiation hardness of QWIPs as an important aspect for the design of small scale space telescopes. For the detection of space debris, space-based IR telescopes fill the essential niche of detecting objects smaller than a few cm. The inherent ease of detecting the polarization of light with QWIPs is a significant advantage over other detector types. This would give laser systems for deorbiting space debris the ability to effectively choose targets for efficient operation. I identify the temperature increase of the targeted objects as a novel opportunity for synergy between these deorbiting systems and space-based object tracking IR telescopes.",

            "description": "In this work an overview of the current state of research into the interactions of migrating planets and disks was developed. The interactions have implications on planet formation as well as disk evolution and structure. Disks perturbed by planets migrating at a fast or intermediate rate have unambiguous features visible to ALMA and ngVLA. Furthermore, a single intermittently migrating planet can cause multiple rings and gaps. There is general agreement about the structure and dynamics of disks and migrating planets, however some smaller scale processes are not fully explored and might have implications for the larger structure. I find that implementing evolving mesh geometries, such as localized wavelet compression, will significantly improve model accuracy without increasing computational effort. These meshes are ideally suited to simulate the turbulent, multi-species and compressible flows which requires accuracy over many order of magnitude in both space and time Its disadvantages, loss of resolution at the highest frequencies, are not significant as those are resolvable by neither ALMA nor ngVLA. Further disk surveys by ALMA and ngVLA, expanding observational capabilities as well as validating model assumptions and expanding them are promising areas for future work.",

However, \u201ccity-killer\u201d asteroids, 10-100 m in size, impact much more frequently, and can still have devastating effects. These asteroids are more difficult to detect, meaning they are often not detected until shortly before a potential impact. Very few concepts have been proposed for deflecting these smaller asteroids. It is necessary to design a system that can reliably redirect small asteroids within a short time period.\n\nA preliminary mission and system design resulted in a solar concentrator system which outgasses the asteroid. Its unique optical arrangement for asteroid outgassing combined with an active cleaning mechanism is a novel solution to the largest problem of solar concentrator designs. All large structures of the spacecraft are deployable.\n\nWith a swarm of 32 spacecraft each with a 60 m radius parabolic reflector, we estimate that the system can redirect 49% of asteroids 10-100 m in diameter which are detected two years before impact. The system can easily be scaled by adding additional spacecraft. This would enable redirection of larger asteroids.",

The structural performance of the morphing leading edge design is evaluated in this article through numerical methods and experimental data, generating the structural response to actuation, as well as the work performed by the system. The findings were as follows:  Firstly, the actuator\u2019s work done is linear with increasing extension. Secondly, the strain observed in the airfoil skin during morphing is predominantly bending.  Finally, this paper concludes an overall good agreement between the finite element method (FEM) and the experimental strain data. However, the FEM significantly underpredicts the required actuation force.   Additionally to the evaluation of the performance, safety-related aspects of the mechanism were analysed.  It is recommended to review the FEM in order to increase accuracy near the stringers and improve its actuation force prediction.",
