    "summary": "Through life I've been given the opportunity to work in different fields and countries. This combination made it possible to learn a lot from many unique individuals with various backgrounds. \n\nOver time I discovered that I'm most attracted to the Hospitality Industry. The service-minded, personal approach and also the diversity in people and environment always offers a completely new experience and challenge.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to create growth through communication, teaching and coaching. On an individual, personal level or on a business level; I believe that \"together\" is the key to success. And to be able to play a part in this process allows me to achieve exactly that for myself as well.",
