The main point of the conference was to gather those voices and ensure that they're heard during the UNFCCC climate processes, and especially at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. \n\nThe project was created with the support of YOUNGO - the official children and youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nAs a project team member, my responsibilities included but were not limited to: chairing the online plenary sessions and break-out rooms, creating and supervising the application/selection process for the participants, automating the communication channels between the organising team and the general public (automating e-mailing), as well as assisting in promoting the project on social media platforms.\n\nMore information about Virtual Conference of Youth 2021 and in general, the series of Conferences of Youth (COYs) can be found under the following links:\n- https://www.facebook.com/youngovcoy\n- https://unfccc.int/topics/education-and-youth/youngo/coy",
