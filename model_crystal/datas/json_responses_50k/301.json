This involved creating a research proposal, conducing a literature review, constructing a methodological framework, creating a survey, distributing the survey, and analysing the results. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing pandemic, the results were not fully analysed. Above all, I strengthened my academic writing, learned how to set deadlines for myself, and how to accept constructive criticism.",
