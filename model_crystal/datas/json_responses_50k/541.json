During my studies in (ancient) history I developed excellent writing and speaking skills in both Dutch and English. After my studies I travelled through New Zealand and Australia. This journey as well as my extracurricular activities and work experience have lead to the discovery and developement of my passion for organisation and leadership. I would like to use my organisational and communicative skills to do research and teach history and archaeology at university level. I am also very interested in and curious about several other facets of the university.\n\nIELTS CEFR level C2 in English (native speaker level), Dutch and New Zealand car driver's license, experience with Topdesk, Blackboard Learn, Peergrade, Pitch2Peer, SRO, ActiveTickets, Ticketmatic, Google Spreadsheets, Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook and Teams.",

The part of the project that I will focus on in particular will study how the limes changed the socio-cultural and economic structures that defined everyday life in the Lower Rhine region. Material culture previously excavated and collected since the 19th century, north and south of the limes, will be central in this. Through centralizing all archaeological information from the Roman period in the study region we will investigate how the frontier system itself functioned during the Roman period, how goods and technological innovations circulated beyond the limes, how specific new societal structures were put in place, and how the limes gave rise to new cultural norms and identities. The limes is a broad concept here, running from northern France to the northern Netherlands.",
