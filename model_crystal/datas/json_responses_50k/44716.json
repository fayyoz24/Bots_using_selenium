    "summary": "By training, I am a physicist. This education has equipped me with a wide variety of mental tools like a deep understanding of processes and how to observe and solve complex problems, but my greatest fascination - for making things work - ventured beyond the boundaries of the classic curriculum: I look at the world and I think, \u2018How can I make it work?\u2019, and then I add a realistic (and self-loving) disclaimer, \u2018... work better to the extent of my abilities and best efforts.\u2019 In searching for the best way to make this contribution, I entertained many routes throughout my life, but nothing stuck with me like the wish to alleviate the consequences of animal agriculture. Its environmental impact seems vastly acknowledged but adding the possibility of sentience in animals to that would mean an incomparable atrocity. Luckily, we now have an unprecedented opportunity: Through cellular agriculture we can design and implement innovative solutions to alleviate a lot of those issues. The joy and gratitude I feel for having the right education and experience to work at the forefront of this emerging field, fuel me every day.",
