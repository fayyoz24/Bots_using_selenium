Secondly, the country currently faces a housing crisis and more specifically of affordable housing. Therefore (re)using the available stock is essential and the MOR team is proposing for a net positive renovation of vacant offices to foster sustainable urban densification. The vision of the project is to create a future proof built environment, that gives back to its surroundings more that it takes away from it. MOR aims to create a renovation proposal focused on net-positivity in five aspects: energy, air, water, biomass, and materials. Only though holisitcally adressing these five net-positivity aspects can we hope to achieve social, economic and environmental prosperity as the pillars of sustainability.",

            "description": "The project is about a mixed use complex proposed adjacent to the icon of Rotterdam, The Rotterdam Station, and in front of the historically famous, The Groot Handelsgebouw, composed of a plinth and two towers (the highest reaches 180 m and the other reaches 140 m). The plinth of the complex includes retail area, conference center, fitness area and a swimming pool while the small tower hosts office spaces and the big tower is shared by hotel and residential.\nThe heart of our design is the green terraces that form the inner curve of the entire complex, unifying the two towers with the roof of the plinth.  The urban environment in the area of the central station is lacking green spaces. Therefore the lush green terraces increases the quality of the apartments, introducing at the same time a new type of office. Also, it is proven that the productivity of people working in a green environment increases considerably.\nMoreover, this project includes the redesign of the bus station in front of the Groot Handelsgebouw as well as the connection of the new complex to the International Platform of the Central Station.\nThis project is the outcome of 10 weeks of intense and rigorous collaborative workflow among different specialists in the construction field, namely, architect, structural engineers, fa\u00e7ade designer, computational designer and climate designers, merging together to form a self-managing team.",

The aim of the course was to redesign the facade of an existing building. In this case, the redesigned facade is of La Fenetre,  building in Den Haag, designed by Rudy Uytenhaak and Hugo Boogaard. Firstly the problems that derived from the previous design analysis will be described along with the aims and strategies or the redesign process. Finally, detailed analysis of a specific fragment will be presented, regarding technical drawings, building physics aspects, maintenance and recyclability issues.",

The new bridge is located in the quarter Crooswijk in Rotterdam, in a dense urban area, where the high pedestrian and cycle traffic confirm the necessity of a bridge for the local community.\n\nThe bridge designed is not characterized only by the Y shape in the plan, but also by the design of the column in the junction of the three branches, and by the design of the railing. The column was designed as a sort of floating podium through the union of three steel branches, while the railing was designed through parametric design, in order to create the effect desired. Infact, each parapet is characterized by a specific dimension and a specific inclination.",
