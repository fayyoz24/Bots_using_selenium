    "summary": "\u2666 My PhD project \u2666\nBob and Alice go to a concert and stand too close to the speakers all night. They had a great time, but when Bob comes home, he realizes he doesn't hear certain high frequencies as well anymore. Alice also suffered some hearing loss, but she doesn't even realize because of a bothersome, constant ringing in her ears that never goes away \u2014 tinnitus. \n\nMy current mission is to shed light on the scenario I just described. Why is it that acoustic damage induces only hearing loss in some and hearing loss plus tinnitus in others? The answer seems to lie in the brain. To figure it out, I'm using spatial transcriptomics. Spatial transcriptomics allows us to see which genes are expressed in each region of the auditory system. With this technique, we can build a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms going on in the auditory system during tinnitus. If we understand how the disease works, we can start developing targeted treatments!\n\n\u2666 My career trajectory \u2666\nBefore getting here, I started my academic journey in Apeldoorn where I did VWO with the Nature and Health profile. These years prepared me for my BSc in Medicine with the Molecular Medicine profile at the University of Groningen. Although I loved medicine, I found that my passion lies in physiology, rather than the clinic. During my bachelor thesis, I got a taste of real research and realized I wanted to forfeit my plans to become a doctor and pursue a career in neuroscience. \n\nAfter a gap year during which I did a minor in quantum physics, I started my master's degree in Molecular and Clinical Neurosciences. Here, I found I had a knack for data science. Simultaneously, I followed the Honours Master program. During my master's thesis, I got the chance to combine my interests in molecular neuroscience with data science and coding. I realized this is what I wanted to do and towards the end of my master's project, I wrote a proposal for my DREAM PhD project and got the funding!",
