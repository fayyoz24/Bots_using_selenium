The program started with 260 participants (idea owners) and was ultimately narrowed down to 5 idea owners who were given the chance to build a prototype of their idea at a 4-day long bootcamp. \n\nMy idea was called Lovid, which is an Iphone/Android application that allows travellers to produce digital footprints by leaving 5-second video-moments at the locations where they have been. Users can see on a map where they made these videos and play these videos in the order of time and place, so they can produce their own original trip report in the form of a long (compilation) video. Other users can see these (geo-tagged) video moments, which gives them a better idea of a location compared to text and pictures, and they can view the (compilation) videos of other users (friends) to see what they have been up to on their travels. \n\nI participated the full 8 weeks and was chosen for the bootcamp in two voting rounds. The bootcamp was a valuable experience in which I learned a lot. I worked together with 4 other persons, of which one was an Interaction Designer and one a Visual Designer. Together with them we made a prototype of the product, which I had to present on the last day to Sanoma, KPN and other public. \n\nDuring the 8 weeks I was trained in: \nTechnological & Social Trends\nLean Product Development - Design Thinking\nLean Product Development - Validation & Minimal Viable Product\nBusiness Model Canvas\nDigital Marketing\nLean Innovation",
