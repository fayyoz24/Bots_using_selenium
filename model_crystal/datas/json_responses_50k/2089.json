It is a project which connects real businesses all over the world with students from various universities. Students are put in teams at random, which means that you have to connect with four other students from all over the world. During the two months, the team chooses a company that they want to work for and (keeping in mind the different time zones) work together to find the best market-entry strategies and promotion materials. There were over 500+ teams and various companies involved. During the session, I had to complete surveys and received a recommendation letter, diploma, and the results of my inter-cultural awareness during the project. ",
