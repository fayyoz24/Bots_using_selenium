We analyzed and visualized the energy consumption of home owners from data gathered with sub-meters to give better insight into consumption pattern to the home owners and smart home company. We built predictive models that helped the home owner to manage and decrease electricity usage. In this analysis we found the energy usage pattern for each appliance that helps us to keep the number of sub-meters limited.\n\u2022\tWiFi Positioning (IoT Analytics): In this project the goal was to find the indoor location of a WiFi user based on signal strength gathered in multiple access points. We built a predictive model to predict the building, floor, longitude and latitude. Our models\u2019 Accuracy are 100% in predicting building and more than 95% in floor. Our models\u2019 MAE to predicting latitude and longitude are near 6 that is acceptable in WiFi positioning systems.                                                                                                                                                \n\u2022\tSentiment Analysis: In this project we used natural language processing techniques to analyze the customers\u2019 reviews that comes from Booking.com and the regression predictive model is built to predict reviewers\u2019 score.",
