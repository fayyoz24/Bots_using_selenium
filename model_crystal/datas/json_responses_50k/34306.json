Together with the parents, we strive to ensure that language and reading pleasure have a permanent place in the family.\n\nI already developed an interest in volunteering with families during my time at Stichting Talentenjacht Amsterdam in the second half of 2013. There, I went to the home of a family to support their youngest daughter with homework and self esteem. I was welcomed with open arms every time, they were amazing! Unfortunately STAs subsidies were not extended and therefore I was motivated to find equally meaningful volunteer work which led me to the VoorleesExpress."
