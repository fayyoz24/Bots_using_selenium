    "summary": "Right now we are facing a man-made disaster of a global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change. If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilization and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon - David Attenborough \ud83c\udf0e\n\nCurrently on a mission with Nature house to protect local biodiversity by inviting people to\nenjoy nature! Check how we contribute to local nature preservation: https://www.nature.house/natureprojects\ud83c\udf40\n\nNext to my work I try to understand the complexity of biodiversity. I do this by following the study Urban Green Development. With this study I want to learn about the positive effect of nature on the urban landscape \ud83c\udf3f\n\nValued aspects in my life: \n\u263c  Nature: walking, hiking, bird watching. Nature and its intelligence and evolution fascinates me. I volunteer in 2 groups with a focus on improving biodiversity on a local level. \n\u266b  Music: there is no life without music. From J.J. Cale to The War on Drugs to Jack Johnson, surf to psychedellic, I feel warmth, recognition and it brings people together. \n\u2665  Mindfulness & Meditation: a resting point to see myself and relfect in relax and busy times.",
