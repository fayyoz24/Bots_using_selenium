    "summary": "Art curator, researcher, writer, art project leader\u2026 these are the career prospects I aspire to! \nCurious, eager to learn, creative, well-organised, detail-orientated, empathic, and team player are words which describe me best. My current RMA Art History research is focused on inclusion and diversity in modern and contemporary art museum collections. My internship at the Stedelijk Museum allowed me to research the field and publish some of my findings on the platform Stedelijk Studies. Here, I also worked as a Publication Coordinator optimising skills such as coordination, copy editing, proofreading, planning and budget management, podcasting, chairing meetings, and consolidating knowledge in copyright and best practices. A bachelor's in Cultural Heritage Science, advanced training at the MAXXI Museum in Rome and volunteering activities gave me the opportunity to experience the fundamentals of curating art.",
