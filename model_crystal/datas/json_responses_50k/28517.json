    "summary": "I am a young enthusiastic engineer with a great interest in technology and innovation. I was born on July 12th 1989 in Oosterhout, the Netherlands. At the age of one I moved to Bornheim, Rheinland, Germany. At the age of four I moved to Muscat, Sultanate of Oman where I finished all eight years of my primary education at a mixed Dutch / English school. In 2001, at the age of twelve, I moved back to the Netherlands to attend my secondary school, the Erasmus College in Zoetermeer.\n\nIn 2012 I graduated as bachelor of mechanical engineering at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. Besides my study I worked part-time for Inova Revalidatietechniek and UMTS Project Partners.\n\nIn my spare time I\u2019m very active, I have lots of (hobby) projects which I work on. One of these projects is my home build CNC milling machine, which is fully operational by now and used to machine parts for myself and others. Other projects contain electronics, mostly Atmel AVR microprocessors, which are programmed in Basic.",

To commercialize these machines a deticated company was founded, Unifortes, which is a joint venture between Visser Group and Ville Machinebouw. Most of my time is spend on engineering for Unifortes, supported by my Viscon colleagues.
