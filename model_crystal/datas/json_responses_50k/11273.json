My teammates and I accepted the challenge to explore the next step for the company Bluetick. We researched the possible adjacent markets and with the guidance of consultants, we delivered an advice report about the future business steps for Bluetick. This project highly increased my problem-solving, consulting, and collaboration skills and gave me new insights into the world of consulting.",

            "description": "From October 2016 until February 2017,  social entrepreneurship will be researched by multiple European countries. This research can be divided in a national assignment and in an international assignment. The first months the team of the university of applied sciences Utrecht will focus on social entrepreneurship within the Netherlands and numerous Dutch institutions will be researched. The focus of this research will be the framework for social entrepreneurs provided in the Netherlands.\n\nThe objective of this programme is that entrepreneurs' adaption of modern communication technologies and innovative customer relationship maintaining technologies opens a broad range of research opportunities. Entrepreneurs are often innovators in their domain but insufficiently trained in establishing and maintaining customer dialogues. Moreover, their levels of customer relationship management differ and they are often not familiar with the use of modern technologies in support of these processes. One practical aim of MARCIEE is to strengthen the innovativeness of European entrepreneurs and to professionalize their intercultural communication and marketing activities in order to establish competitive advantages over non-European entrepreneurs. The international cooperation of bachelor students, master students, Ph.D. students, and other interested researchers makes it not only possible for them to have access to data from different European nations, but also to learn how to cope with intercultural challenges.\n\nThis programme will be finished with an intensive programme in Trento, Italy. Teams will be formed by five international students who work on a marketing communication plan for an Italian social entrepreneur. The teams will be supported by teachers from ten universities in Europe and will be provided with feedback on the concept of social entrepreneurship. Moreover, the teams will learn how to work in an international environment.",
