    "summary": "As Service / UX Designer with 13 years experience, I advise and work within multi-disciplinary teams to plan, visualise and test new / improved services for B2B and B2C, relying on design research techniques, cognitive psychology and Design thinking. I go the extra mile for that memorable experience.\n\nBased on strategy workshops, I analyse the business-, and user challenge and validate the problem with solid user- and data research. Based on insights I create personas, customer journeys, (service) blue prints, user flows, wireframes and prototypes and validate the solution with users. I design for multiple touch points, from mobile and desktop interfaces to personal interactions for customers, employees and/or expert users, all in close collaboration with the business and developers. \n\nFacilitator & trainer\nAs a passionate facilitator of workshops and co-creation sessions, I handle projects at every stage of the lifecycle from the initial assessment and research phase to the final delivery. I develop and give training in the design approach in- and outside the Netherlands.\n\nCollaboration\nI work collaboratively across disciplines on a daily basis, i.e. users/customers, business stakeholders, copywriters, architects, developers, visual- and interaction designers to improve the design quality and user experience. I collaborate with product owners, product area leads and tribe leads to drive design strategy and the product development roadmap.\n\nMethodology\nI am familiar with SCRUM methodology, Double Diamond, Design thinking, Google Design Sprints and Lean UX. I always advocate a solid Design process so companies will evolve and increase Design maturity. I also mentor designers and help shape their skills and design perspective.\n\nSolid background\nDuring the Master in Applied Cognitive Psychology (MSc.) I learned about human's cognition, perception, needs, and emotions. I obtained my Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) in the User System Interaction Post-master at TU/e. This program allowed me to combine hands-on experience with UX and service design, prototyping and user testing.",

The Be Informed business process platform transforms administrative processes. \nCustomers I visited who needed complex business applications are: Aegon (International insurance and financial services organisation in Turkey), EPO (European Patent Office in Germany), Ministry of Defence, ABN Amro (financial bank), Bearingpoint (Curacao), CAK (Central Administration Office).\n\nThanks to Be Informed\u2019s unique semantic technology and solutions, business applications become completely model-driven, allowing organisations to instantly execute on new strategies and regulations. Organisations using Be Informed report cost savings, much higher straight-through processing rate leading to vastly improved productivity, and a reduction in time-to-change from months to days.\n\nMy main tasks were analysing business and user requirements through sessions with product owners and users, designing high level proces overview, business scenario's, low and high fidelity prototypes for interaction design, developing the front-end of Be Informed-implementations, SCRUM meetings with development teams, agile processes, conducting user tests and making visual design for processes and marketing goals.\n\nI also facilitate national and internationally different workshops together with a business analyst, CEO and (business) users to detect the desired business process. The main job was achieving a good experience in complex web-based applications for business users and customers. Within the 4,5 years at Beinformed I became responsible for the project approach in which UX played an important role. I have given workshops, together with the principal architect, in Turkey and Curacao in order to teach about the importance of UX in the project approach. I also traveled to Schotland, Germany and USA to consult about the best User Experience.",
