Also, I have been engaged in the monitoring, review and evaluation of water and sanitation projects. I taught professional and postgraduate courses in water services management. I researched and published on water utility management models, performance assessment and capacity building for water utilities and on benchmarking for pro-poor water services provision.\n\nI have a Master Degree in Civil Engineering from the Technical University of Delft and have worked in the water supply and sanitation sector since 1975. My work took me to more than 40 developing and newly industrialized countries. I was Associate Professor in Water Services Management at UNESCO-IHE until my retirement in 2014. I also served in several management functions including those of Head of Department, Vice-Rector Education, Deputy Director and Acting Director.

In my role as WFF's Lead Consultant Utility and Project Development, I lead a team of experts that are responsible for co-developing bankable capital investment projects with pre-selected, creditworthy Kenyan water utilities (WSPs). Fourteen WSPs indicated an interest to develop US$ 60 million worth of projects. The first portfolio of US$ 30 million includes water, sanitation and efficiency improvement projects for 6 water services providers reaching out to about 750,000 people of which 25% in urban Low-income areas. These projects went through phases of conceptualisation, feasibility and detailed design. In 2021, the plan to issue a green bond in the local capital market for financing the portfolio of investments did not materialize and activities came to a standstill. Two follow-up activities are now ongoing, i.e., an activity to assist WSPs to access commercial financing for the investment projects, and a study to investigate how if and how capital market financing of WSP investments can be taken up.",

The program is targeted at water utilities in developing countries, through Water Operators Partnerships (WOPs) that these utilities have with their Dutch counterparts. The programme now covers 26 WOPs in 18 countries.\nThe End of Term Review covers the period 2017-2020 (Phase I) and is tasked to review and analyse progress to date and formulate recommendations for Phase II. The review covers all WOPs/countries, with field level investigations in 6 countries. The assignment was contracted to MDF consultants by MFA.
