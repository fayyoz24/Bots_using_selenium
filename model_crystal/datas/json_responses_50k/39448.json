I also utilised highly-effective research methods, including interviews, focus group discussions, surveys, action research tools and collaborative research tools.\n\nUncovering new insights and performing data analysis, I employed my expertise in NVivo and Microsoft Excel then wrote scientific articles as well as impact and evaluation reports. Here, I furthered the project\u2019s profile and knowledge by organising events, and making presentations at various forums.\n\nBuilding and strengthening win-win relationships with a highly-trusted network of external contacts, I facilitated effective knowledge sharing and drive future collaboration. I also performed lectures for Bachelor and Masters students at Ghent University as well as supporting and troubleshooting student/researcher issues and needs.",
