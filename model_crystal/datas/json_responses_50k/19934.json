    "summary": "Growing up, I would create quizzes for my friends on general and world knowledge in an attempt to make them more interested in studying. Some of them became more eager to learn more, but some others lost interest in learning. That is when I realised the importance of appreciation, words of encouragement, and giving an opportunity to all members of the class to have a voice in the classroom. Besides knowledge sharing, I am passionate about empowering students to reach their goals. It gives me the utmost joy whenever I can help my student to succeed, not only academically but also in life, and I will go out of my way to ensure that.\n\nBefore I started my career as a university lecturer in business administration, I worked as a marketing and research officer in a company. The experience made me realise how fun and interesting conducting research can be. To this date, I have published my research on several reputable outlets in the fields of Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Human Resources, and Tourism. On top of that, some of my research is supported by government grants.\n\nI care for my adorable daughter at home while I'm not working. My daughter is my anchor and has helped me recognise my purpose. The fact that I am a mother at my very core is all that matters. I support everyone's endeavours\u00a0as if they were my own children. I will go above and beyond to make others' goals come true, but I also recognise the value of maintaining your own and establishing your ground.\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating together with me, please feel free to reach out!",
