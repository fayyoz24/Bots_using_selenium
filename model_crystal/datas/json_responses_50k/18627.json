My findings showed that SMM could influence brand loyalty in the chosen sector through advertising campaigns and community benefits. Furthermore, the results advise companies operating in the Dutch market to focus their efforts on creating content for Facebook and Instagram, as these are the platforms with the most engagement. Lastly, content should be made based on customers' interests. It should be focused on showing the human side of the brand and on creative, interactive content that provides relevant and valuable information for customers.

My task was to lead the team, plan the meetings and the project, organise the tasks, give feedback, and ensure that deadlines were met and the reports were professionally written. At the same time, I had to do my fair share of research, where I mainly focused on the internal analysis of the client's company in the research proposal phase and Austria in the research phase. Further, I was the contact person for both the tutor and the client and gave them periodical updates.",
