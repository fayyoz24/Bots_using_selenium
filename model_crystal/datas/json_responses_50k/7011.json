    "summary": "I am a multilingual Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning (MEAL) specialist with experience in Project Management and Human Rights.\n\nThroughout my professional career, I have focused on managing projects related to human rights, conflict transformation and peacebuilding. I currently work as a MEAL Assistant at Save the Children Poland. \n\nAs an Intern for Justice and Peace Netherlands, I worked closely with at-risk activists from countries with fragile human rights situation, including Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. During this time, I developed contacts with other human rights NGOs both in the Netherlands and in the human rights defenders\u2019 countries, which I regularly monitored to ensure the safety of the activists. While I worked for the United Nations, I gained hands-on experience in organizing capacity building projects and advocating for IDP and refugee rights while advancing my research skills through drafting reports. The multilingual environment I was put in required me to translate various documents between Russian, English and Azerbaijani, as well as take minutes in three languages during meetings between the UN and the authorities. Moreover, various positions I have held in the past have given me rich experience in administrative support such as planning agenda, scheduling appointments, arranging meetings, and overseeing projects. My project management skills have been further refined through my active participation in the EU Neighbours East's Young European Ambassadors initiative, which allowed me to develop multiple projects on diverse topics such as human rights, environment, and sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, I held the title of Youth Delegate from Azerbaijan to the Council of Europe's Congress of Local and Regional Authorities from 2018 to 2019. During the Congress sessions, I was able to present my ideas on a pan-European platform and expressed the inability of vulnerable populations, such as IDPs and LGBTQ individuals, to exercise their guaranteed rights due to structural discrimination.",
