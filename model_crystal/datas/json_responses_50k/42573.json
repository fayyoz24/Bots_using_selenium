It is a cascade of enzymatic reactions. Recently, it has become a prominent pathway to find drug targets. Tripartite Motif (TRIM) proteins participate in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications and form a large family of over 70 RING-type ubiquitin in humans. Current researches and hypotheses indicate its role in cancer development, tumor progression, viral infection, and many other deleterious effects. My work is focused upon developing appropriate high-throughput assays for Tri-Partite Motif (TRIM) proteins. My work encompasses developing recombinant E2 and E3 proteins. Following this, the focus will be put on assay development and validation and assay translation for high throughput assays. This effort will also include the generation of assay reagents and/or synthetic peptide substrates by total synthesis.",

The attachment of SUMO family members SUMO1-3 to substrate proteins is reversed by specific isopeptidases called SENPs (sentrin-specific protease). Whereas SENPs are SUMO-isoform or linkage type specific, comprehensive analysis is missing. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of SENP linkage specificity remains unclear. We present a high-throughput synthesis of 83\u2005isopeptide-linked SUMO-based fluorescence polarization reagents to study enzyme preferences. The assay reagents were synthesized via a native chemical ligation-desulfurization protocol between 11-mer peptides containing a \u03b3-thiolysine and a SUMO3 thioester. Subsequently, five recombinantly expressed SENPs were screened using these assay reagents to reveal their deconjugation activity and substrate preferences. In general, we observed that SENP1 is the most active and nonselective SENP while SENP6 and SENP7 show the least activity. Furthermore, SENPs differentially process peptides derived from SUMO1-3, who form a minimalistic representation of diSUMO chains. To validate our findings, five distinct isopeptide-linked diSUMO chains were chemically synthesized and proteolysis was monitored using a gel-based read-out.",

It plays a role in regulating transcription by controlling the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. 7SK is found in a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP) with a number of other proteins that regulate the stability and function of the complex. Here we wanted to see the effect of Dicer cleavage on 7SK in presence and absence of protein co-factors like TRBP and HIV-1 Gag. This might help us determine the quaternary structure of these associated proteins with the Dicer or the RNA. This, in turn, would help in understanding the mechanism of regulation of 7SK and also might give us a different understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1, leading to a Structure-based drug design approach in the future.",

In humans, they play crucial roles in development and homeostasis, and altered miRNA expression profiles have been associated with numerous diseases. Although it is now well recognized that the levels of several miRNAs are regulated by protein cofactors at key steps of their maturation, the regulation mechanisms are not yet fully understood. At this time, one of the best example of a protein cofactor that regulates miRNA maturation comes from the discovery that the Lin28 and TRBP protein regulates processing of the let-7 family of miRNAs (12 members in human) through direct interactions with their immature forms, namely primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Although the Lin28/let-7 interaction is important in regulating mammalian development and tumorigenesis, the detailed mechanism by which Lin28 regulates miRNA maturation remains to be elucidated.",

The project was based on analyzing and justifying whether the device SoeMac, which produces activated oxygen is a pharmaceutical product or a medical device. The company claimed it to be a class II medical device under MHRA regulation but was rejected. So my work was to establish that fact based on the critical reference of MHRA and FDA acts on medical devices and pharmaceutical agents. This project gave me a lot of experience in regulatory affairs and we were successful at the end to a great extent.",
