    "summary": "My personal value proposition includes: my diverse background & experiences,  business focus rather than only accounting, leveraging information value chain to lead business decision making, bringing together both rational and emotional sides to decision making, shaping organisation context, framing issues, building fit for purpose teams to deliver on agreed agenda with improved quality and influencing and advising senior stakeholders.\n\nMy leadership role is to: create clarity of direction, foster cross functional cooperation, build commitment to delivery, create opportunities and space for my team to deliver. And to celebrate success and deliverables for which people can feel proud of.\n\nI expect my team to: understand purpose of what they do, set high standards, have a passion for quality of what they deliver and feel increasing confidence in exercising business judgement.\n\nAs a person I am focused on: understanding business context, model(s) and value creating levers, cooperating with people with humility and respect, balancing discipline with humour and taking responsibility for actions and people.\n\nMy experience: 20+ years Senior Finance. International environments in Blue Chip listed and smaller privately owned organisations. FMCG, Food & Beverages, Retail, Apparel, Sporting Goods. Majority of career to date in full time and permanent roles, the last few years on more interim assignments. Permanent versus Interim is not a relevant distinction for me - my approach is independent to the impact I can have on the challenges of the role and what I can learn from a new organisation, its culture and its people.\n\nMy expertise areas: Strategic Finance, Performance Management, Business & Financial Planning (FP&A), Business Control, Investment Analysis and Modelling, Budgeting & Forecasting, Accounting & Reporting, Strategy, Decision Analysis, Building Finance Teams, Risk Assessment, Internal Controls, Treasury and Cashflow management, Tax, Transformation & Change Management, Programme & Project Management, Information Systems implementations including ERP and BI tools (SAP, BPC, Cognos, Tableau).\n\nI am passionate about: organisation culture, change management, organisation transformation, team effectiveness, decision making, organisation learning and raising financial literacy.",
