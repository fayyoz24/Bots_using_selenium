    "summary": "Experience in several IT-jobs since 1996, since 2008 I am employed by the Dutch Ministery of Defence in several roles with several IT related rolls where I'm currently working as a Project Leader organizing the IT-Infrastructure for events and exercises. \n\nDue to Covid-19 we decided to jump in to the new kind of activities of hosting events via Video Conference platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex and now we mostly work with Microsoft Teams.\nIn Microsoft Teams Me and our team takes care of hosting online live-events with >200 viewers and we organize advance setups for auditoriums.\n\nBeside my job I always had an ambition for traveling & cultures via Couchsurfing (i'm volunteering there as well) and in 2016 I got to try Acroyoga and that has became my favorite sports now. Since these activities currently aren't possible with the social distancing in mind I now spend most my time swimming and love to drive around and exploring food-cultures as me and my fianc\u00e9 are real foodies. \n\nAs the roots of my wife are from India with lots of things my focus are on Food, culture and technology in Indian style.\nAs I already speak Dutch, English, German, some Swedish I am considering starting to learn the basics of Tamil so that I in the future will be able to follow a Tamil conversation.\n",
