    "summary": "David Dieteren Ribeiro was born in Sittard, Netherlands, in 1980.\n\nMost children grow up thinking they want to be a soccer player or a firefighter. David always had other ambitions: he wanted to be a professional underwater welder. Yet, faith had a different path in mind.\n\nAt a very young age he took an electrician course. Seeing how LEDs could be switched on and off by using a transistor was the first impulse he needed to fall in love with electronics. An old Commodore 64 he received on Christmas of '92 did the rest. \n\nAfter turning 18 years old, David went to Leeuwenborgh college in Sittard, where he studied Electronics and Telecommunications. Later, he obtained his degree in Electronics Engineering from Zuyd University, in Heerlen. In 2007, David went to Portugal and started his career as a researcher in University of Aveiro. As a result of his work, he authored and co-authored several papers and owns two patents in the area of engineering. Furthermore, he won several awards confirming his talent for creating innovative devices and products. \n\nIn 2012, after leaving research behind, David was invited to be one of the co-founders of Sword Health a startup located on the campus of the University of Aveiro. The company develops SWORD, a wearable ambulatory system that stimulates a more intensive and efficient rehabilitation using the latest motion technology. More importantly, the system allows stroke patients to receive that rehabilitation from the comfort of their homes. \n\nIn addition, David was one of the great minds behind Findster, an innovative tracking system designed to children and pets, a project launched in 2014 and funded with more than $80k on Indiegogo.\n\nIn 2015 David moved back to the Netherlands starting as a process control engineer for Sitech. His focus lies on Instrumentation, IOT and Industry 4.0.\n\nHis colleagues describe him as an \u201centhusiastic engineer\u201d who \u201cloves a challenge and finds \nnothing impossible\u201d. \n\nFurthermore, besides his work at Sitech and family life, David is currently pursuing a Master degree in Innovation and change management,  ",
