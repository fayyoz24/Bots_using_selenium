    "summary": "Bishawjit Mallick is an associate professor climate change and international development studies at the faculty of Geosciences of Utrecht University. Before joining at UU, he worked as a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Global Fellow at the Institute of Behavioral Science (IBS) at University of Colorado Boulder, USA and a researcher position at Chair of Environmental Development and Risk Management at TU Dresden, Germany.\nHe has obtained a PhD in Regional Planning from the Graduate School of Climate and Environment (GRACE) of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a master's degree in Regional Planning from the Institute of Regional Science (IfR) of KIT, and a bachelor degree from Urban and Rural Planning Discipline of Khulna University, Bangladesh.\nHis background includes research into the field of environmental (non-)migration, refugee and rehabilitation, disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate culture, vulnerability and resilience, good governance, COVID and Public health planning, and social science research methodology.\nHis current research focuses on the historical grounding of non-migration: why people voluntarily remain in place; how the social, environmental and political regime contributes to staying put; why and when do people perceive (non-)migration as an individual or family strategy to better their livelihoods?\nHe has published over 20 peer-reviewed manuscripts and book chapters. His recent research has appeared in Applied Geography; Environment, Development and Sustainability; Ecological Economics; Sustainability; Journal of Computational Social Science, and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\nDr. Mallick is an associate editor of the academic journal SN Social Sciences and SN Business and Economics, and scientific coordinator of \u2018Environmental Non-Migration Network (EnNoMig Network)\u2019, and founding chairperson of Coastal Research Center (CRC), Bangladesh.\nHis leisure time priorities are playing and watching cricket, reading books, and writing poem/drama.",

It is assumed, the settlement history of a community influences non-migration. For the first time, this project will develop an analytical framework using Ostrom\u2019s socio-ecological system framework for examining the historical grounding of migration decisions. Second, it will model how changes of the social, political and environmental conditions over time influence migration decisions using agent-based modelling. Third, the model will be used to explore possible future migration decisions based on alternative scenarios of changing societal and environmental conditions in the future making use of the findings from the influence of the historical grounding. Results will provide a major contribution to global adaptation policy frameworks, including the SDGs and the EU\u2019s Agenda on Migration. It is hosted by two excellent, highly experienced and internationally renowned institutes: University of Colorado Boulder (outbound) and Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (inbound).",

For the first time, this project will develop an analytical framework using Ostrom\u2019s socio-ecological system framework for examining the historical grounding of migration decisions. Second, it will model how changes of the social, political and environmental conditions over time influence migration decisions using agent-based modelling. Third, the model will be used to explore possible future migration decisions based on alternative scenarios of changing societal and environmental conditions in the future making use of the findings from the influence of the historical grounding.
