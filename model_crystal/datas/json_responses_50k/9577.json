    "summary": "I am the CTO at Saia and furthermore an inventor and engineer. I am an INTJ type of personality (Architect) and for over 20 years I have designed robotic systems for horticulture. In 2019 I co-founded Saia-Agrobotics, a spin off from Wageningen University & Research. I am proficient in designing tooling or end-effectors for horticultural robots and have developed a new design method for end-effectors during my Masters at Wageningen University. \nI lead the engineering team at Saia and try my best to inspire them to come up with the best and imaginative ideas to fulfill our dream to build the first automated greenhouse of the future. Furthermore, I have a great interest in (production) technology, classical physics and philosophy.",

            "description": "In modern greenhouses there is a high demand to automate labour. The resulting increase in labour costs and reduced capacity puts major pressure on the competitiveness of the European greenhouse sector. Present robotization of this labour has entered a high level of technological readiness.  In the EUFP7-project CROPS, extensive research has been performed on agricultural robotics. One of the applications was a sweet pepper harvesting robot. It was shown that such a robot is economically and technically viable. The proven hardware and software modules (TRL: 6) developed in CROPS will be used as the groundwork. The successful CROPS software modules based on the Robotic-Operating-System (ROS) will be maintained and expanded in SWEEPER. Also the gripper end-effector will be retained. This patent pending module is able to grasp the sweet pepper without the need of an accurate measurement of the position and orientation of the fruit. In several experiments, it turned out that different growers use different cropping systems ranging in crop density. In SWEEPER, the cropping system itself will be optimized to facilitate robotic harvesting. In CROPS it was concluded that instead of a 9DOF, a 4DOF robot arm is sufficient, greatly reducing costs. To improve the level of robotic cognitive abilities, plant models will be applied to approximate location of sweet peppers. This \u201cmodel-based vision\u201d will increase and speed up fruit detection. Based on the insights of CROPS, sensors will be placed onto the gripper only. Also a LightField sensor will be introduced, which is able to record both colour and 3D information simultaneously.\nPARTNERS:\nSTICHTING DIENST LANDBOUWKUNDIG ONDERZOEK DLO, NL\nUMEA UNIVERSITET UMEA UNIVERSITET, SE\nPROEFSTATION VOOR DE GROENTETEELT, BE\nBEN-GURION UNIVERSITY OF THE NEGEV BGU, ISL\nIRMATO INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS VEGHEL B.V., NL\nIRMATO ORIENTED HANDLING SYSTEMSVEGHEL BV, NL\nIRMATO ENGINEERING WEERT BV, NL\nDE TUINDERSHOEK BV, NL",

I have worked abroad (Israel, Demark, Belgium, UK) at Universities and engineering companies to solve engineering problems and design new solutions for robotics especially in large EU projects. I am happy to say that during those EU projects I have gathered new friends and colleagues all over Europe.\nIn agriculture and horticulture and in engineering in general, many fields of expertise are combined to build up a design. That is why I am an advocate for using structured design to cope with complex design processes. I try continuously to improve my skills in structured design and teach others to use it as well. \nOver the years I have worked on many different technical designs and made myself at home in different fields of expertise. This includes: greenhouse structures, mechanics, automation, vision, lighting systems for vision applications, basic electronics, and agricultural robotics. Solidworks is the tool of my trade, a 3D CAD environment including various simulation tools. I use this to calculate loads and stresses and the dynamical behaviour of parts of robotic systems.\nMy main speciality is the design of end-effectors for horticultural robots. Over the years I have designed, build and field tested end-effectors for tomato, sweet-pepper, buxus wood, roses, cucumber and cucumber leaf harvesting robots. Some of which have resulted into a patent.",
