    "summary": "As an American living in Italy and around Europe for almost 20 years, I bring my love for languages, getting to know cultures, people and lifestyles to my passion for writing, editing, translating and teaching.\n\nI currently work as international editor, writer, and foreign communications correspondent for the Italian lifestyle web magazine Cucine d\u2019Italia where I have the opportunity to delve into producing content around travel, design, food, wine and events. My role allows me to contribute to generating story ideas, writing, developing the editorial calendar, conducting interviews and translating. I also enjoy my work doing various editorial tasks such as structural, content, stylistic, line, and comparative editing. My work here also includes designing the layout of the homepage, formatting articles, choosing visuals, and aiding with social media and foreign communications.\n\nBefore beginning my work with the web magazine, I worked as a certified teacher in the United States and also in Italy, teaching English Language Arts and English as a Foreign Language. During my years in this field I taught at secondary schools as well as in various companies as a corporate trainer where my instruction centered on EFL and business English communications. My time as a teacher brought me a multitude of skills beyond classroom instruction, student assessment, lesson planning and curriculum design. It also garnered me the opportunity to work as a team player and as a teacher of people from many different cultures and of many different ages. Through my over 20 years in teaching I also sharpened strong time management, communication, decision making, interpersonal, and critical thinking skills. I developed a keen social awareness in regard to cultures and working in various settings while learning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, and approaches to problems.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not creating content for the magazine, I enjoy traveling, painting, sketching, taking photographs, learning about wine (especially reds!), studying foreign languages, reading, and cooking. I hold dual citizenship in both the U.S. and Italy and currently split my time living between Italy and the Netherlands and often spend time in the Finnish archipelago.\n\nSkills: writing, editing, translation, instructional design and delivery, native English speaker, fluent in Italian",
