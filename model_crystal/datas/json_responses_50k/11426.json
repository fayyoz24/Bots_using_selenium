    "summary": "Closing a deal is great. Keeping a customer happy, informed and empowered over its lifecycle, increases our odds of growing brand loyalty.  \nCustomers are becoming more imposing and want to be served anywhere at any time. It is therefore important for companies to be customer obsessed, clearly understand the (digital) user experience and ensure this is seamlessly adapted. Moreover, speed to market, IT capabilities and limitations and compliance aspects such as privacy and security issues that go along with each other in a tension. In addition, there is also a gap between the language and priorities of business and IT, which often work at cross-purposes. With my passion for digital and marketing and my experience as a Product Manager MyPhilips for Professionals at Philips, I have a perfect view on the end-to-end design of the digital organization. Because of the structuring and implementation of MyPhilips for Professionals globally, I can perfectly support optimize organizations digitally, shorten the time to market and ensure agility and flexibility, without compromising on compliance aspects.",

Besides the crocheting beanies by ourselves and together with grannies, Poederbaas setup the Poederbaas Freeride team, organizes Freeride competitions and creates content like the first Dutch Freeride movie. \n\nWithin Poederbaas, the main responsibilities of Bart were finance and operations. Examples of work Bart did: running the company management, entire administration including budgeting, forecasting and taxes, organizing freeride ski and snowboard competitions, prepare and coordinate shootings for both photoshoots and the Dutch freeride movie, developing inventory systems, optimizing processes, coordinating and visiting grannies who crochets beanies, developing new product collections, etc.",
