This EUV radiation creates a plasma in the low pressure background gas of the system. \nIt is important to get a physical insight on ions inside the EUV-induced plasma, as they can influence the lifetime of the system. \n\nThe goal of this study is to experimentally investigate Ion Energy Distribution Functions in EUV-induced plasmas. The amount of research conducted on these kind of plasmas is scarce and up to now, industry mostly relies on numerical simulations. Therefore, experimental investigation is of utmost importance. \n\nIn order to measure ion energy distributions, an Electrostatic Quadrupole Plasma analyzer (EQP) is used, which is a mass spectrometer containing an energy filter. \nThe EUV-induced plasma is created by photoionization by an EUV beam, produced by a pulsed xenon pinch discharge. \n\nBoth time averaged and time resolved measurements are performed succesfully in hydrogen and nitrogen plasmas, giving new insights in investigating the optics lifetime in next generation lithography tools. \nRating: 8/10 \n\n",

If a\nsimple model is made which can describe the scattering behavior in a medium, it is often not\nnecessary to make use of complex models and experiments.\nIt is important to have knowledge about the scattering behavior in media, as it has a contribution\nin the intensity profiles. Intensity profiles are of great use making LED's or other light sources,\nbecause they play a major role in the brightness of a light source, or the fact that it emits soft\nor hard light.\n\nIn order to conduct the experiments, a CCD camera and an optical \ffiber are used to measure\nthe intensity profile of a laser beam. This laser beam is going through a medium where the\nincident light is partly scattered and where a small part is absorbed. The medium used in the\nexperiments is silicone with titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is the scattering material.\nThe mixture of silicone and TiO2 results in intensity profiles, which are compared with a simplified Mie model. Mie theory is the theory used in this study for describing scattering phenomena.\n\n",
