These perspectives are important, as they provide a critical position from which to interrogate the range of scales and sites from which austerity has emerged, as well as the modes and means to examine how the population have perceived and negotiated these impacts on their lifeworld. Drawing upon these concepts, this research use a participatory methodology to investigate how young people that came of age since 2008 have adapted to the withering of the welfare state and the precarization of opportunity and employment. Specifically, this research will explore how young adults from 18 to 25 years old in disadvantaged urban areas in Dublin and Cork negotiate the hegemony of neoliberalism and the impacts austerity and precarization have upon them and their relationship to their neighbourhoods, city and state.",
