    "summary": "I want to contribute to the science of brain\ud83e\udde0 , behavior\ud83d\udc63 and other complex systems\ud83c\udf0a by the means of artificial intelligence\ud83e\udd16 and good research design\ud83d\udcd1 . Therefore I work as a research assistant for FearLess: a study that investigates fear extinction in adolescents with behavioral tasks, fMRI and skin conductance measurements. I also just finished helping with the redesign of the Cognitive Neuroscience course as a student assistant (adaptation of the experimental design to VR and GUI, programming behavioral tasks, writing manuals etc.). Before that I did research internships in a cognitive neuropsychology lab (EEG) and a cognitive neuroscience lab (programming a behavioral task with Bayesian updating) and followed extra courses about brain and development, biology, algorithms.\n\nYou could view my GitHub profile here: https://github.com/khna89",

Scikit-learn library was used to train and test machine learning models, Numpy and Pandas were used to work with the datastructures, Matplotlib and Mglearn were used to visualize the results.\n\nThe selection of the models and the hyperparameters to test is the result of the group work with Maxymillian Martys and Marijn Vroegh within the course Jung, M., Saygili, G., Stowell, D., Zamberlan, F. & Schmalzried, D. (Feb. - Jul. 2022). Research Workshop CSAI [university course]. Bachelor program Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, Tilburg University, The Netherlands.\n\nThe dataset used contains single cell RNA sequencing data. I\u2019ve chosen this data because I find molecular biology fascinating and I\u2019m actually taking a number of biology courses just for fun.

I used R (shiny, flexdashboard, basic graphics) for this project.\n\nDuring my Christmas break I decided to use the knowledge I gained at the university so far. I think practice is important, and it's one thing to score at exams and another thing to realize an idea from scratch. In order to practice project-oriented thinking I combined what I've learned at the uni with some googling and that's where it led me. \n\nHere is the app: https://lnkd.in/eS54u-zu . Here is the git repository of the app:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eEsEgk3y . In order to retrieve your data from Netflix follow their guide here: https://lnkd.in/ekDe6e_e . It's quite simple, but you'd have to wait for a couple of hours after you've asked them for the data.\n \nIn the readme file of the repository you could find more information on the project, in particular how to use your data safely or how to anonymize it if you want to. The data as it's provided by Netflix contains your user names and countries from which you were watching, and also the type of the device you were using. You could also use my anonymized data to test the app (also in the repository).\n \nThe idea to do something with our Netflix consumption data belongs to Soldado Koval \ud83d\ude42\n\nThe project is quite simple, but I think it served its purpose. And now the new semester starts. Let's see what I manage to create after it :-)",

Students learn to interpret this complexity from various methodological viewpoints and produce artistic representations of their embodied experience of space during the program. Multimedia portfolios are prepared containing daily diary entries, photographic, and musical materials, and creative writing. The two weeks-long IP terminates with a final multimedia storytelling performance. The programme includes Modules on \u201cRepresentations of Venice: Literature, Theatre, Cinema\u201d, \u201cPsychogeography and Individual Perceptions of Space\u201d, \u201cTravel and Its Inscription on the Urban Landscape: from the Spice Route to Virtual Tourism\u201d. It offers \u2018peripatetic lessons\u2019, walking tours where international academic scholars, local experts, and practitioners of traditional skills lead students through landscapes with multiple significance, from \u201cDisneyland Venice\u201d to lesser known areas of the city and the lagoon. Workshop activites focus on Creative Writing, Dramaturgy and Storytelling Skills, Commedia dell\u2019Arte\u2019s multilinguism and body language, as well as ICT Exploitations for the Humanities. Demonstrations by local craftspeople and artists encourage students to use their Five Senses to explore past and present histories and philosophies of Venetian cuisine, the art of glass, and the tactics of living with/on water.\n\nI created a dance movie 'aLtteRnAtive trip dancing d\u00e9rive' created as a result of participation.",
