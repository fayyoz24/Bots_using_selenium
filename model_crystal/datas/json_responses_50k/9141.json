    "summary": "I strive to live a sustainable and earth-friendly life, whilst respecting those around me. As a student at Wageningen University of Research (WUR), I aim to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 and see this world become a better place for all.\n\nIn 2018, I have gotten the opportunity to visit Laos and together with a local partner work on a WASH project for the children of two local primary schools in Ban Houakhoua. This experience made me realize the impact and importance of a single toothbrush and bar of soap. \n\nEver since I have been interested and focused on global WASH and SDG 6: Access to Clean Water and Sanitation. During my studies at Windesheim, I have worked on many projects and research papers in this area and during my internship at the GIZ - Fit for School Program (2021) I have researched the effects of Climate Change on Wash in Schools. Recently (2022), I have done a research internship for The Healthy Teeth Foundation and focused on the impact of Climate Change on Oral Health & WASH projects in Kenya. During my Master Program I aim to deepen my knowledge even further and expand my network in the field of sustainable development, climate resilience, and WASH. \n\nLooking forward to connect and share knowledge! Feel free to reach out.",

During the first 6 months, me and Hannah Venderbos developed a 'Welcome Guide' for newcomers in Zwolle with everything that they need to know about their new city. This guide has been translated into Dutch, English, and Arabic and can be requested upon request. During the second 6 months, I and my team helped Present with designing a Participation training for 17 newcomers in Zwolle. This training is a mandatory part of their integration process and includes among others the norms and values of the Dutch society, the democracy, and the laws, and regulations of the Netherlands. It has been a gift working on this project and I am very happy we were able to execute this training even though there were some covid-19 measurements. An after-movie of this training can be found in one of my previous posts.",
