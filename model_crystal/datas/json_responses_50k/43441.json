My career started in IT Strategy and Transformation consulting at Accenture and evolved into consumer research and insights reporting (at Forrester Research in Amsterdam) and ultimately into data-driven insights reporting roles at Accenture, BSG South Africa, and Cyberlogic. I am a keen learner, strategic problem solver and relationship builder and have a love for storytelling with data.",
