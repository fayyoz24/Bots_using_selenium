A striking example of this is the collection presentation 'Dwarsverbanden' ('Delinking & Relinking'), which openend on 18 September 2021. The museum project team (curators, depot, archive, technical department, marcom, fundraising, etc.) has been joined by a large group of partners and professionals. Their perspectives made our blind spots visible and the cooperation made it possible to overcome these blind spots. This requires an open attitude and broad involvement from the museum organisation. Guiding often challenging processes and keeping all parties involved connected is of great importance in this new way of working. Streamlining these processes is one of my strengths and I get a lot of energy from it. \nThis all let to a multi-sensory collection presentation which incorporates touch, smell and sound. Next to this you will find different perspectives on the artworks on show via de Smartify multimedia tours. An innovative and intuitive way of experiencing the exhibition. \n\nMORE INFO: \n> Introduction video (temporary version): youtube.com/watch?v=oVpyNaOpw-c  \n> Information on the multimedia tours: \n- about.smartify.org/case-studies/the-van-abbemuseum \n- https://smartify.org/venues/van-abbemuseum \n> Press review: https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/dwarsverbanden-in-het-van-abbe-nodigt-je-uit-om-steeds-opnieuw-te-kijken-voelen-en-ruiken~be0accbd/",

In the program, participants and visitors are invited to reflect on the role that complex histories such as slavery and colonialism play in our lives. This project is on display in the Van Abbemuseum, in the form of a small-scale exhibition. The program was developed in collaboration with Vivian Heyms, Silvan Vasilda and a network of people from the province of Brabant, who all relate to colonial history from a matter of personal interest and/or family history. Who are we? offers everyone the opportunity to become acquainted with this complex history and to reflect on it in their own way.\n\nPERSONAL RESEARCH\nCentral to this program are the personal quests of our core group: a group of 30 people from the larger Eindhoven area (and other cities in the province of Brabant) who reflect on their own experiences with traces of the colonial past. During a visit to the exhibition, you can get to know the participants through photos and personal stories and objects. It\u2019s a joint process: from the recalibration and questioning of our past to the reflections on the present and imaginations of the future. This process will continue to develop until the summer of 2021. \n\nPartners: Huizen van Aankomst, Erfgoed Brabant.",

            "description": "The Van Abbemuseum is for everyone. It tells and collects stories that connect art to the world around us. But those who look closely, see that these stories are usually told by one group of people: the staff of the museum. This population is often white, well-educated and over forty years old. Therefore, they are not a good reflection of society. Yet this small group creates programs that are supposed to be for the whole society. Is the museum really for everyone? And are the stories that the museum tells and collects actually about the world around us?\n\nAt the Van Abbemuseum, we believe that a larger, multifaceted group of people should be given the space to tell stories. That is why we started the Werksalon in 2017. The Werksalon is a three-year program in which we, together with a number of groups from the city of Eindhoven, investigate how the stories and perspectives that are not yet shared, can get a place in the museum. This makes the museum more fun, interesting and recognizable for more people.\n\nMETHOD\nEvery season we invite a number of Eindhoven groups to the museum. Together with them we work towards an intervention within a year; each group develops its story and adds it to the collection presentation. \n\nNEWS\nMarch 2019 we won Transformative Museum Grant together with The Whitworth in Manchester. This grant gives us the oppurtunity to develop the constiuent museum even further.\nFor more information: https://bit.ly/2THjVIT \n",

For this reason we invited people from outside the museum with different sorts of knowledge and backgrounds, to supplement the exhibition of the collection, 'The Collection Now', with their own stories and interpretations. This resulted in a broader range of stories and memories related to the collection, told by many different voices. Five tools were provided in the museum. These could be found in the Toolshop on the ground floor at the start of the exhibition.\nMore information: https://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/research/highlighted-projects/toolshop/ \n\n** The Viewing Depot >  developed into the DIY Archive\nThe archive was a combination of a storage facility, a workplace and an exhibition space. Visitors were invited to start work themselves, related to the real works of art in the collection dating from between 1965 and 1985, such as works by Andy Warhol, Richard Long, Gilbert and George, Richard Hamilton and Barry Flanagan.\nThe real works of art could be taken from the racks and placed in a temporary exhibition made by the visitors themselves, together with our own employees. Visitors were given the opportunity to look in the crates in storage containing small art objects and art books, and were permitted to root around in the video archives.\nMore information: https://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/research/highlighted-projects/diy-archive/ \n(More information Viewing Depot: https://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/research/highlighted-projects/kijkdepot/\n",
