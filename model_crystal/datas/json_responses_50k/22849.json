    "summary": "Dr. Hongyang Cheng is Assistant Professor of Geomechanics at the University of Twente. He has worked extensively on the multi-scale and constitutive modeling of heterogeneous soils (e.g., GRS), Bayesian parameter estimation, and 3D micro-CT image analysis. His research aims to understand the physical processes where the micro-mechanics is important and relevant length/time scales are not well defined. To this end, he develops multi-scale modeling and Bayesian inference tools to bridge geomechanical models at micro and macro scales. His most recent work involves developing a computational framework for concurrent multi-model simulations of granular matter, in all physical states. \n\nDr. Cheng obtained his PhD on \"multi-scale characterization of geosynthetic-reinforced soils\" at Hiroshima University in 2016. He subsequently joined the Multi-Scale Mechanics group of the University of Twente and worked on \"wave propagation in granular media\" and \"concurrent multi-scale modeling\" until 2020.  For his PhD work, he received the best student paper award at the DEM7 conference and a top downloaded paper award from \u201cGranular Matter\u201d.  Dr. Cheng has been giving invited lectures at the University of Pisa, Okayama University and the Japanese Geotechnical Society, and was the organizer\u202fand\u202fchair of the symposium \u201cOpen-Source Development\u201d of the DEM8 conference in 2019.  Dr. Cheng is currently guest-editing a special issue of Computers and Geotechnics \"DEM for Geotechnics\".\n\nDr. Cheng has developed and coupled several open-source software packages, including YADE, MercuryDPM, OomphLib, and LB3D, for solving geotechnics and geophysics problems, such as soil-geosynthetics interaction (FEM-DEM) and wave propagation in granular media (LBM-DEM). He has developed a Bayesian calibration software \"GrainLearning\" which has many users in the industry and academia. Dr. Cheng is the main developer of the coupled MercuryDPM-OomphLib code, with a vision to implement a unified multi-scale framework for modeling solid/fluid-like behavior of granular materials, incorporating state-of-the-art\u200b open-source codes from soil mechanics, fluid mechanics, and beyond.",
