    "summary": "Contrary to some others, I knew really young ''I was made for sales'' and I realized that when I found my first sales job at the age of 19 in Per\u00fa. \n\nI was born in Per\u00fa, in the province of Ica, district Chincha. But I grew up in Lima with my two brothers. When I finished high school at age 17, I started working in call centres, supermarkets and finally sales. At the age of 19, I got my first sales job at Nestle- Purina (Dog food) First as a brand promoter and then as direct sales to markets and stores. oh, what a great time!  I loved to have direct contact with customers, support and understand any questions related to my product. \n\nAfter 4 years of great experience, earn some money to support my parents. I decided to stop my work life and applied to a Public University, here was the most frustrating time in my life, I was rejected 3 times. But now, I understand it was not meant for me to stay and study in Per\u00fa. Turning that page, I decided to study English for 2 years and got a job in a call centre again selling TV+ Internet plans to Canada. To make the story short, I found through a high school friend a cultural exchange programme for young girls to travel to another country called AUPAIR. That was the golden moment I was waiting for! \n\nI moved to the Netherlands in 2008, I live with a great, lovely Dutch family and took care of 3 kids. I had a wonderful experience and in that year I knew I was meant to be here! After living with them for 1 year I moved to Amsterdam to work as Nanny and cleaning lady. Saving some money, I decided to try and apply to the University. In 2012, I started my 4 years programme at the University of Utrecht, International Marketing. \n\nAfter finalizing my career with a specialization in International Advertising, I worked in an advertising company based in Amsterdam where I learned so much from top creative people. Then, to build up my experience in other areas, I worked in one of the most important retailers worldwide in the e-commerce department as a customer support agent. \n\nIn 2018, I came back to my roots and started a sales support job in an IT company, selling hardware from different brands. For me, it was the first time I faced the IT industry and I can say till now is a challenging and complex market. Since 2020, I am part of Rojo Consultancy, here I am a real advisor (which aligns with my SERVE personality) for organizations in the area of Integration and Data Analytics. \nif you work in any of these areas just send me a message and let's connect! Love to exchange knowledge :)",
