                    "description": "With the energetic and creative team of The Spindle I connected innovators within sustainable, international development. I got to acquaint myself with the development sector, (upcoming) trends, practical innovation initiatives, and Design Thinking. I was involved in organising events, setting up platform meetings and writing minutes and website content. Furthermore, I contributed to The Spindle on a strategic level by thinking about what this platform could be. Lastly, I conducted a feasibility study amongst NGO employees and other stakeholders, for a proposed Global Social Inclusion Index.",
