Base ingredient was the blossom of the elderberry (vlierbes bloesem). It was a success (although the wine was slightly sweeter than expected) and I served this wine at the second birthday-party of my son Okko on oct 4 2014. \n\nMy first red wine-project started in august 2013. Goal was to create a dry red wine. Base ingredients: elderberry, grapes and blackberries. These fruits contain the correct mix of sugar and moisture to produce a good wine. This fruit also contains enough tannin and nutrients required for fermentation and preservation. And the grapes even carry their own yeast... Goal is to drink the wine in the summer of 2014. \n\nMy first rosehip-wine-project started in autumn 2013 I started to create a rosehip wine (wijn van rozenbottel). I bottled 7 liters on february 1st 2014. Goal is to drink this wine at the birthday of my wife Wendy on March 6 2014.\n\nMany thanks to...\nI would like to thank my father-in-law for his knowledge, experience and craftsmanship in winemaking.",
