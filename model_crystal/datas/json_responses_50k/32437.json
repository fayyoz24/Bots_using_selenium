    "summary": "IT professional (PSM I, PSM II, PSPO I and PSPO II) with a technical background who believes in:\n- being and living Agile rather than doing Agile.\n- focusing upon \"how to make it better\".\n- bringing it to the team. Helping them find a solution rather than providing a solution.\n\nCourageous to call the big elephant in the room. We may not have an immediate solution all the time but it helps the management and teams to look at the challenges transparently and take necessary actions if needed. The best compliment that I ever received from one of my line managers is: \u201cVipul, sometimes you are more direct than even Dutch people.\u201d\n\nProficient with Atlassian tools (JIRA and confluence) as well as Microsoft Azure Devops (formerly VSTS / TFS)\nFast to adapt with an international mindset having worked in the Netherlands, Belgium, India and USA with colleagues from 40+ nationalities.",
