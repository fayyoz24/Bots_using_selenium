    "summary": "\"Light is the eyes of the audience. And each performance requires its own, unique way of seeing.\"\n\nThe collaborative, multi-disciplinary nature of Dutch mime shaped Vinny\u2019s approach to design, using light as both an aesthetic and dramaturgical tool of theatre making. A major influence on her work was the theatre collective Dogtroep, creating image-based, site-specific theatre. In 2008 Vinny was supported by The Dutch Foundation for Visual Arts and Design to develop a 2-year plan of research with the Institute of Lighting Design. In 2009 she received an \u2018honourable mention\u2019 at the World Stage Design for the Dogtroep performance \u2018To be to not be\u2019. In 2013 she graduated cum laude from the MFA Scenography at the Frank Mohr Institute. Recently Vinny was awarded the New Makers grant from the Dutch Fund for Performing Arts to develop installations based on her methodology of sensory scenography, which uses sensory stimulus to immerse the audience in atmospheric and perceptual phenomena. \n\nVinny has worked in a wide range of genres including installations, dance, opera, mime and theatre. \n\"I try to create light that is necessary. By engaging in the making process- through the discovery and development of a piece, I discover the form of the lights. I search for clarity; what is it that the light needs to do in this performance? To illuminate the journey of a piece, as opposed to illustrate it; to give light a formative role in the performance, rather than a decorative one.\"\n\n\"I am seek to use light to communicate, to deepen the relationship between a performance and its audience. As well light's  visual and dramaturgical qualities, I use light to create a physical and emotional space to bring the audience closer to the world of a performance.  It is a step beyond watching to experiencing that is the foundation of my work. Light is more than a purely visual medium and my designs explore its ability to resonate viscerally with an audience. To touch an audience with light.\"",

Like an intimate ceremony to summon what has been buried, it tells a story about other possible worlds. It is a performance, an experience, a gathering of sensual impressions, which, through constantly changing our perceptions of body and space, invites us to re-imagine how \u2013 and with what or whom \u2013 we come together.\nThe lights design aimed to create a space that is not stable but is always in a state of becoming. I focused on activating the peripheral vision of the audience, enfolding them in the movement of the space. Peripheral vision evokes the visceral level of perception, referring to unconscious or emotional reactions that are more instinctive in nature. I created a series of loops based on movements in nature, breathing, rolling clouds, a storm approaching\u2026  running these loops and letting them interact, creating a overall curve for the performance, but also opening the space to unexpected moments of coincidence, expanding perception to the moments that happen in between things, to other kinds of presence.",

IN.here is a series of seemingly identical rooms, directly following one another. The audience passes from room to room, using a key they are given when entering the installation. The audience is alone. As they progress through the spaces, small shifts occur, the rooms start to break down, become unfamiliar or uncanny. Audiences are required to execute repeated domestic actions to activate and move through the spaces. These connect to their lived experiences, evoking muscle memories and creating a sense of familiarity, attachment and responsibility for the space.\n\nProgressively the audience's control is questioned, interrupted or undermined. The lights and doors work differently, the configuration of the rooms change, the music they choose in one space returns in another. They must navigate through different systems, in which the rules reveal themselves at different times, or not at all, or change during the journey. Through this physical journey, IN.here explores how we reconcile the position of the individual within the larger systems within which we live. How much control we can exercise as individuals? How do we reconcile ourselves when the rules change, or are not revealed to us? How do we continue to use and take responsibility for systems over which we have no control? By approaching these questions through the realm of the body and the senses, I hope the work will transform a complex, mental idea into an intimate personal experience.IN.here uses the methodology of sensory scenography, and is work created for and by the experience of the audience. The work is being developed through a series of live labs where we test the work with audiences and use their responses to immediately feedback into the work and develop it.",

The work is inspired by what I experience as disappearing atmospheres; slow or complicated moods such as melancholy or whimsy that requires time or time spent alone. It seems there is hardly any time or space for these atmospheres in today\u2019s society with its constant busy-ness and distractions. The work seeks to create the experience of these fading moods and preserve them in a growing \u2018archive of atmospheres\u2019.\n\nI was very curious to place the work on location in public space, where people can encounter it outside of a theatre or gallery context. The first installment found its place in the 2017-18 edition of the Amsterdam Light Festival. This installation creates three atmospheres- Intoxication, Comfort and Melancholy. They were housed in a translucent space, which emphasised the movement from watching the light changes from outside, to experiencing their effects inside the space. The public could move between the different compositions, creating their own atmospheric journey.",

A continuous process of appearing and disappearing, looming and dissolving, results in an elastic experience of time and space. \n\nThe aim of the light design was to disrupt the perception of the movement. The lights were constantly in motion, from imperceptible vibrations, to rolling and breathing in the space, to using multiple strobes, each moving at different frequencies to disorientate the viewer and create perceptual illusions. \n\n\"Brilliant work again, with transformations that are rather tangible than obvious.\" - **** Francine van der Wiel, NRC Handelsblad\n\"In this liberating dance performance everything falls in its place (....)

Arida takes the qualities of arid landscapes; vastness, wind, extremes of heat and light and uses them to create an immersive landscape into which the dancer and audience are emerged. Surrounded by unpredictable and at times  extreme conditions, the dancer seeks to find a space for herself within these elements.",

The public can move in, out and in-between these atmospheric bubbles, creating an engaging experience of the installation as a whole, where an associative narrative of the space can emerge.",

The performance moves behind the shiny, serene fa\u00e7ade of the Geisha to explore a strange, imaginative and absurd reality. The light design searched for the unique visual language of the piece, merging the precise simplicity of traditional Japanese design with the shiny, bright colours of Cantopop. Strong colour elements emerged from and submerge into bright, diffuse lighting, continually transforming the landscape of the piece. The general light had its own timing, fading between different angles, creating slightly skewed perspectives on the stage image.\n\n\"Vinny Jones is responsible for a stunning lighting design of surfaces in soft pastel shades. Her light design gives Geishas Miracle a specific and surreal atmosphere.\" Joanna Fox, Dans Magazine.",
