It covers the full spectrum of threats, both intentional and accidental, and works for any device, network and protocol, detecting integrity risks that systems working above ISA-95 level 1 would miss. It works on real-time data and provides a system health indicator that can be integrated into SCADA/DCS asset management systems and cyber security systems.",

The class is designed around the innovation process and takes students through five stages. We start with the concept of an innovation and show where innovations come from (1), then move towards creativity (2) before we cover innovation processes (3), and then cover the value capturing aspects of innovation management by examining business models (4), marketing, and intellectual property protection (5).",
