    "summary": "As someone with a passion for research and data, I have dedicated my career to building in-house insights capabilities for organizations and driving growth through thought leadership initiatives. Throughout my career, I have had the pleasure of working with top-tier brands and executing global research projects that have contributed to substantial year-over-year growth.\n\nI am particularly fascinated by the intersection of probability, economics, and regenerative development, drawing inspiration from thought leaders like Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Milton Friedman, Ole Peters, and Steven Ritchie. Additionally, I am interested in property law and have gained valuable insights from legal scholars like Nick Szabo and Bryan Caplan.\n\nIn addition to my professional pursuits, I am passionate about startups and have been inspired by visionary entrepreneurs like Naval Ravikant and Paul Graham. Their ideas continue to inform my thinking and inspire my work.\n\nOutside of work, I am a lifelong learner who is deeply fascinated by history, culture, and religion. Writers like Tom Holland have influenced my thinking in these areas, and I enjoy exploring new perspectives and ideas.\n\nI am also interested in the field of longevity and have been inspired by medical experts such as Peter Attia, who have dedicated their careers to understanding the science of aging.\n\nAs an Insights & Research Leader, I have played a key role in laying the foundation of a data-driven insights culture within organizations, generating meaningful content for thought leadership initiatives, and recruiting and developing talent.\n\nPrior to my current role, I gained extensive experience in product development, business intelligence, and project management, working with companies such as Veylinx and Avery Dennison. During my time at Veylinx, I focused on scaling the company through end-to-end consumer research, resulting in substantial year-over-year growth. At Avery Dennison, I managed European portfolios and led the company's DCX digitization change management initiatives.\n\nOverall, I believe that a successful and fulfilling career is built on a foundation of curiosity, open-mindedness, and a passion for learning and growth. I am excited to continue exploring new ideas and perspectives in my work and look forward to connecting with others who share these values.",

To transform data into an easily-analyzed format, I implemented an ETL framework from scratch and performed small data engineering tasks like cleaning and preprocessing data. I also developed and implemented data science models and algorithms to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.\n\nUsing Azure tools, Qlik, and Power BI, I generated meaningful insights from the data. During the BI system migration from Qlik to Power BI, I collaborated with the IT team to ensure a smooth transition. I designed the architecture to fit the enterprise ecosystem, created business architectural drawings, and integrated it with other enterprise systems.\n\nAs a product development leader, I managed communication, roadmap planning, and idea generation. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure that the app met the needs of all stakeholders, from co-workers to management.\n\nOverall, my role at IKEA required a diverse range of skills, from ETL framework design to data science model implementation, and product development. I utilized this broad skillset to drive data-driven insights and help the organization achieve its goals.",
