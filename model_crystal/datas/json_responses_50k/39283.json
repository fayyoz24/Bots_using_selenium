    "summary": "While trekking to Everest Base Camp in 2016, I had to deal with mental and physical fatigue, high altitude and heaps of Dal Bhat. I don\u2019t like quitting so I pushed myself and boundaries to reach Base Camp. This ethos has helped me over the years.\n\nThe path to earning my bachelors degree in business administration (BBA) went via IT system administration and Banking & Insurance. This would help me land that dream role I was looking for. While doing an internship at Thales I realised I did not want to leave the company and I didn\u2019t have to. During my graduation period \u2013 writing my thesis on HR Technology (and the impact on the role of the HR professional) \u2013 I landed that dream job as HRIS Specialist. \n\nAt Thales I am working with brilliant and passionate people that innovate with their customers to create a safer world. For me this is another way to contribute to a better world. \n\nIn my current role I am responsible for the upkeep and deployment of new HR technology and optimisation of (HR) processes. I push and challenge people, but also help them understand and go through changes. It is important to me to help HR become more than \u2018just being good with people\u2019.\n\nBecause of my varied educational background, I have a different perspective and approach on HR. I am not just good with people, but I am data-driven, a strong process thinker and the linking pin between IT, business, HR and other stakeholders.\n\nMy biggest passion outside work is traveling (and travel photography). I enjoy immersing myself in foreign cultures and try to apply lessons learned during my travels in daily life.\nI like to brush up my language skills over drinks and during my travels. I am fluent in English and my German is adequate. I am learning to speak French and once took on a course Japanese, which I hope to continue one day.\n\nIf you are interested in talking about work or traveling, please send an email my way.",
