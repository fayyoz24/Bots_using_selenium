Whether it's planning on going to the movies, having dinner together, etc. every single activity requires switching back and forth between multiple apps. Now, using Homer, when you type something like \"Lets go out for dinner\" and press on the Homer button within the keyboard, you will get many recommendations in the shape of cards, once you choose the place, you choose the time, and voil\u00e0! You get a Homer events card through which your friends can take actions such as calling the restaurant, ordering an Uber, seeing directions on Google Maps, and of course adding it to your calendar. You get all this through one keyboard that works across any messaging app (SMSs, iMessages, Whatsapp, FB Messenger, etc.)\n\nHomer Keyboard had the chance to be presented in The Next Web and Startup Grind one of the biggest startup boosting conferences.\n\n\nHomer was the only Egyptian competitor among the 100 startup. Moreover, We were voted among the first 24 which made us have the chance to get 3 minutes on stage.\n\nHomer Keyboard was also selected from the top 50 who could be able to participate in Global Startup Grind out of 11,000 company that applied.",
