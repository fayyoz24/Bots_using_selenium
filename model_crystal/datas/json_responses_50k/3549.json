Your efforts were really appreciated across the team and the office. Your exceptional design and creative skills brought images and events to life throughout the year. Thanks to you for each InDay and milestone event we had amazing posters and slides for our screens. You were always so accommodating with last minute changes and updates and stayed late if needed to get images finished. I had lots of extra request for BIYP signage etc and you helped created a number of welcoming signs for our parents. We look forward to having you continue with your passion and enthusiasm for 2016!!\n\nFrom: Aoife Conroy",

From the first day I joined LinkedIn you have lived by this value. You demand excellence from yourself and others around you. Each task you take on you commit to fully and always complete to an excellent level of detail and consideration. You work incredibly hard, always seeking to improve and succeed beyond exoectations. I see this in the creation of InDay posters, in the way you interact with clients (no question is too big to ask you), and in the way you support your colleagues inside and outside your organisation. Working on the Boolean project with you was hugely impactful for LinkedIn clients and colleagues in GSO - another tool they can leverage. It is great to work alongside a person with so much passion for innovation and excellence!\n\nFrom: \nMartien Hogerzeil",
