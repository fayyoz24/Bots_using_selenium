    "summary": "I am uniquely situated due to my diverse fields of study from undergraduate through graduate terms, which include Comparative History (MA), International Human Rights Law (LLM) , Psychology (BA), Art Practices BA), and Space Studies (Minor). Together these solidify my perceptions and understanding of the interconnected nature of our social and natural worlds.  Perceiving the world through these lenses and honoring intersectionality, I seek to utilize my knowledge and strengths, to be prepared to confront the global issues of today and tomorrow. Key issues of interest range from the individual and collective restoration of rights and dignity, to international factors of magnitude such as radicalization, terrorism, and political violence.",
