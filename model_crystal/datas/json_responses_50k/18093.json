The core product is a physical model of a city (part) that is dynamically adjustable. Every physical adjustment serves as an input for the underlying model that is able to calculate different parameters such as, but not limited to, the walkability of the city. The core value of the product is the innovative user experience: tangible interaction and direct visual response.\n\nA video explaining the concept:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tuedcmt/videos/212177785968711/\n\nAppeared in the media:\nhttps://www.cursor.tue.nl/nieuwsartikel/artikel/honors-team-helpt-campusplanning-inzichtelijker-maken/",
