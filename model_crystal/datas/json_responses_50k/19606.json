    "summary": "The motto for myself has always been \"Do all the things that thrill you, that involve you, that help you and others, and do it as long as you want and can\". \n\nFor all my life I've been passionated about many things and right now, after years of experience, I'm finally bringing many of those passions together and creating my own, 'personalised', career. \n\nThe areas in which I'm currently working are mainly two: Performing Arts and Body Movement.\n\nI love theatre in all its forms and I'm intrigued by the work behind the building of a show. I want to collaborate with performance makers, artistic directors, dance companies and theatre productions, helping them to find solutions, facilitating the production and the dissemination of the product. \nI think my skills and experiences could perfectly fit such environments.\n\nI love movement and body wellness: I believe humans are made to move and that moving makes us feel better, healthier and younger. Movement can produce positive effects in our lives, physically and mentally and with my work as body and movement coach I want to help people to bring constructive changes in their bodies and lives. \n\n\nLooking forwards to connect with you!",
