Collecting the needs of the communities by directly involving them, abandoned or misused buildings are identified based on opportunities foreseen for interested investors. A net zero energy design is then proposed to municipalities, citizens and investors, bringing functions which that particular area needs and wants. The conversion of the area is designed to be a learning process for inhabitants, who are given the function they asked for with high standards of sustainability and are educated about a sustainable lifestyle in the process.

This invites the spectator to look at the light posts, instead of merely their gleam.

Subsequently, the design interventions needed to refurbish a Dutch office building and meeting the net zero energy target were evaluated using a software complying with the Dutch standards NEN 7120 (ENORM). A risk and sensitivity analysis, with Monte Carlo simulations, showed the influence that some design aspects, energy price and landlord-tenant agreements have on the business case. Finally a number of strategies are suggested in order to increase financial benefits for the building owners who invest in zero energy refurbishment. \nThis research also provides developers with a checklist assessing the potentials for existing buildings to procure an attractive business case. \n",

After the design of the pavilion, we performed the casting, deforming and demoulding of the double curved elements which were part of our facade design.\nThe panels were manufactured using the improved version of the flexible mould designed by Ir.
