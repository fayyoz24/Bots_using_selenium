    "summary": "The name Werner means 'reconnaissance man'. I like to gather all kinds of information and use it to build something beautiful. Currently I am trying to do so at Alliander by designing tomorrow's power grid.\n\nWhile I like to solve difficult technical problems, I also like to share my knowledge with people without a technical background. I have experience in the field of writing, presenting and teaching.\n\nMy ambition is to find the place where I can contribute most to a better society. This may be by creating technical solutions, but can also be something totally different!\n\nSpecialties: Advanced Analytics, High Performance Computing, Control Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electricity and Gas Network Simulation, Data Science, Electric Vehicles (modelling, design and political implementation).",

This model simulates trillions of data points and already major impact on the company, both on a strategic and operational level.\n\n- Developing a model (together with masters student Michiel van der Meulen) which calculates the optimal operational configuration of an electricity network, resulting in a theoretical reduction of 20% of power transportation losses. Once implemented, this model will save approximately 5-10 million euros per year.\n\n- Inventing a model which calculates the optimal operating pressure of a gas network, resulting in a theoretical reduction of 20% of gas leakage. Once implemented, this model will save approximately 1-3 million euros per year.\n\nThese projects are also the main publication subjects of my PhD at the TU Delft.",
