    "summary": "Pavlo is a postdoctoral researcher at TU Delft focusing on the communication between automated cars and vulnerable road users. He was a director of data research at SD-insights. He received his PhD degree from TU Delft in December 2018. He worked on the HFAuto project as a Marie Curie Fellow. Pavlo\u2019s focus was to develop a human-machine interface for highly automated driving, focusing on the auditory modality.\n\nPavlo concluded Erasmus Mundus Double MSc in Dependable Software Systems with double distinction at the University of St Andrews (Scotland) and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (Ireland) in 2014. He wrote two dissertations within this degree where he evaluated implications of porting a strongly-encapsulated programming language Insense to multi-core systems and the impact of the cache on multi-threaded data-sharing applications. He completed his BEng studies in Information Technology at Mikkeli University of Technology (Finland) in 2012, specialising in Software Engineering, in his thesis he focused on development of a customisable multitenant web form for the bioenergy sector.\n\nPavlo is also active in MCAA and EMA. He is the chair of the Bridging science and business working group of MCAA. Outside of his desk he likes running long distances, travelling and meeting kind people.",

Social TV is a television which supports communication and social interaction in either the context of watching television or related to TV content. Social TV enables people to communicate with friends while watching TV shows. Moreover, a wide variety of information related to TV content is accessible synchronously and asynchronously. For instance, while watching a football match, viewers are able to see old scores of specific teams, background information about teams, and links to buy uniforms of certain teams. Furthermore, they can share these types of information easily through social networks such as Facebook, twitter, etc., via their mobile and tablet devices.",

This work investigates a common base-case scenario in the telecommunication industry, where a programme has one thread that writes data and one thread that reads data. A taxonomy of inter-thread communication is defined. Furthermore, a mathematical model that describes inter-thread communication is presented. Two cycle-level experiments were designed to measure latency of CPU registers, cache and main memory. Three application-level experiments were used to verify the model by comparing predictions of the model and data received in the real-life setting. Initiated by Openet, this project extends the author's previous work, which investigated cache interference.",

            "description": "This project set out to investigate the benefits of using private heaps for memory management and static thread placement for optimising performance and cache usage. For this study, Insense, which is a component-based programming language developed in the University of St Andrews that abstracts over complications of memory management, concurrency control and synchronisation, was used. Two memory management schemes are under investigation: use of a single shared heap and use of multiple private heaps. Further, three thread placement schemes are designed and implemented: 1) even distribution among cores; 2) placing all components on a single core; 3) locating Insense components based on frequency of inter-component communication.\n\nFurthermore, several elements of this investigation are worth emphasizing. With regard to allocation and deallocation of memory taking place in component instances running on different cores, the efficiency of using a private heap for each component resulted in speedup by a factor of 16. Then, utilising private heaps reduces a number of L1 cache misses by ~30%. Distributing components over cores according to communication pattern, for the most part performed similar to allowing the OS to perform thread placement dynamically according to load balance. In cases where no exchange of data between components takes place, static placement outperformed because there is no computation which may make load balancing dynamic placement of threads under control of the OS difficult. In this case, the static placement scheme was faster than dynamic balancing by a factor of 2.4.",
