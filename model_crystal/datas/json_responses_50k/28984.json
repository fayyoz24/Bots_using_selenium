            "description": "A large part of the Netherlands between Amsterdam and Utrecht were peatlands, submerged and marshy, until anthropogenic activities of land drainage for agriculture and settlement brought thousands of years of carbonaceous peat to the surface.  This peat is now oxidizing and contributing to almost 4.25Mton of CO2 every year.  The answer cannot be to depopulate these regions and risk affecting the livelihoods of thousands, especially given the reliance of the Dutch dairy industry on these regions.  The answer lies in improving water quality and quantity, so as to provide and maintain the moisture that preserves the peat.  This design case employs Reflexive Interactive Design (RID) to identify requirements, assess them, identify key functions, create design scenarios from these functions, and finally to assess and grade these scenarios to find a solution that ultimately leads to an optimal scenario which is as close to the ideal score as possible.  Done under the aegis of Dr. Bert van't Ooster, Dr. Arni Jannsen, and Dr. Marjolein Derks, under the commission of Dr. Henk van Hardeveld, Team Leader at Waternet.",

These proteins can compete with conventional protein supplements, or serve as standalone nutraceuticals to countries fighting malnourishment.  Algal oils thus obtained can be used in edible oils and in other chemical processes, while Phycocyanin can be used in cancer therapy, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and food colouring too.

            "description": "This project deals with bioremediation of soils and aquifers which have been contaminated through the solvation of underground pools of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), specifically chloroethenes, through bioaugmentation with species such as Dehaloccoides spp. and Geobacter spp., along with two-pronged biostimulation using lactate (also used for pre-treatment) and possibly butyrate.  This is done so as to remediate groundwater, which is essential for both drinking water and for usage in Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES).  This was done under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Tim Grotenhuis, and Dr. Jan Weijma.",
