I have experienced film production here and on the other side of the world and I keep learning more and more every day.\n\nRight now I focus on my own company (360 Publishing B.V.) with the goal of creating one of the biggest professional blogging networks about consumer electronics. The websites in the network currently have about two million unique visitors every month.\n\nBy the way, I have lived in many countries but right now I live in Landgraaf. Don't hesitate to contact me for work related stuff in other places. I love to travel and have more than one home base.",
