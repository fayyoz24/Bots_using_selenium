This project was partially funded by the National Science Foundation, and partially by a larger Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP). The main objectives of the study was to identify any groundwater recharge temporal or spatial patterns, and any geochemical relationships between phreatic waters (fresh and brackish wells), vadose waters (collected in caves), and recent precipitation (collected in rain funnels). \n\u2022 Assisted USGS Hawaii field technician in collecting Conductivity-Temperature-Depth measurements, and water level measurements on groundwater monitoring wells across northern Guam to monitor sea-water intrusion and water quality of the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer.\n\u2022 Facilitated conference calls between Guam, USGS Hawaii, USGS Virginia, American University, and the Univeristy of Texas at Austin to maintain working collaborative relationships on groundwater research in Guam.",
