    "summary": "I am a Global Commercial Executive with over 20 years\u2019 proven track record of delivering growth of global brands, both in developed and emerging markets. My experience ranges from leading the local, regional and global Brand strategy to managing diverse field and back-office sales teams, from setting up Digital Marketing to building organizational capabilities, from contract negotiations to leading growth and diversification strategies. \n\nAfter Sara Lee, I followed my passion to build and grow brands in the FMCG business at Philip Morris International, where I have worked in many different non-restricted markets (affiliate size 45 to 300 employees) and in HQ, across 7 countries in Europe and Africa. For 13 years, I have successfully developed people, build and led multicultural teams up to 96 FTE\u2019s, 8 years in the capacity of Head of Function. After moving back to the Netherlands, I have advised multiple businesses with their commercial and strategic challenges. Since mid-2021, I am driving at the Global leading handmade cigar company Scandinavian Tobacco Group, all new business developments and innovations that are outside the tobacco category and recently taken the responsibility to lead the dynamic and fast-growing Next Gen Oral, also called Modern Oral category. \n\nBy developing and driving innovative, winning strategies, with a consumer centric, creative, digital mind-set, I consistently achieved, together with the team, strong results over the years and turned around longer-term declines into solid, double-digit growth. \n\nI enjoy the empowerment and hands-on coaching of the people around me. I am energetic and pragmatic. This coupled with my high drive for result, my ability to build, leverage effective teams and my strategic agility have shaped my personality as a professional. \n\nDiving into diverse, stretching, and challenging business opportunities that include ongoing personal development, learning and growth is what I really enjoy doing. \n\n#General Management #C-level #Marketing #Sales #Digital #Commercial #Online #OmniChannel #Communication #Campaign #Marcom #Engagement #Insights #BusinessStrategy #Negotiation #BusinessDevelopment #Innovation #Account #PeopleManagement #DigitalTransformation #ConsumerCentric #Creative #PeopleActivator #FMCG #ConsumerGoods #ConsumerServices #WhitePouches #Tobacco #Scale-up #Entrepreneurship #Management #Leadership #International #B2B #B2B2C #EMEA #Europe #Global",
