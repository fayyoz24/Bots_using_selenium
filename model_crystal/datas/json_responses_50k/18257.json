The trip's goal was to get a clearer picture of the organization of mental health care and to experience first hand how Moroccans with mental health problems seek help. We visited psychologists and psychiatrists, but also various alternative healers who used religious healing methods.\nAmong other duties on this trip, I acted as treasurer and as an interpreter (Dutch-French).\n\nIn 2009, I was invited back to Morocco with my colleagues Samrad Ghane and Gerly de Boo by the board of the Rabat-Sale hospital, and taught a series of workshops on diagnostic instruments. We organized classes on building diagnostic instruments and translating existing instruments. On this trip I also acted as an interpreter (Dutch-French).",
