    "summary": "Experienced manager, coach and mentor. After working for 35 years in research and material innovation, I have now moved into a new role, doing what I love doing most: I am using my experience and wisdom to help others to find their talents, build their careers and develop their leadership skills. Through my own business: WiNcoaching. \n\nPeople I have worked with say I am empathic, provide well-grounded advice, help them to create clarity, build self confidence and set a direction for the future. They appreciate that I am also a sounding board about how to navigate in complex multinational organizations. \n\nI understand what business leaders are looking for both in young and seasoned talent. I have been part of several business teams and have worked with other disciplines such at marketing and sales and operations. \n\nI started as a technical specialist and developed to a project lead at Shell Global Solutions. In 2000 I switched to DSM and moved up into various management positions, including RT&D manager, manager global application development and department manager within the DSM Material Science  Center (90+ people). I have always worked in multinational, global teams and have had the opportunity to build teams in The Netherlands, the US and Singapore. I love working in a diverse setting, working with different cultures, connecting and helping people develop. \n\nI am there for you:\n\ud83d\udd39If you are a young academic and trying to find a job in industry \n\ud83d\udd39If you would like to better understand what drives you and what natural talents you can build on\n\ud83d\udd39If you feel you are not in the right job and do not know where to go next\n\ud83d\udd39If you have lost your job and could use support and help finding your next job\n\ud83d\udd39If you want to change from a technical role into another discipline \n\ud83d\udd39If you want to create more impact, but do not know how \n\ud83d\udd39If you just started as a manager and would like to develop your leadership skills",
