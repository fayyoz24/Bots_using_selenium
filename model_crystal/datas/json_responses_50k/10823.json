Montani Institute of applied science and Team 122 NASA knights of Hampton, VA.\n \n\nGoals:\n The system consists in a machine that is able in a given environment to climb over a metallic pyramid. The system is also able to recognize a disc through camera vision technology and pick it up from the floor. The disk after has been charged is going to be launched on a wall where some openings are placed in several positions. The system is able to work in autonomous mode and with the active intervention of a human operator. \n\nMy position: \nProject Leader, I\u2019m looking after the aspects related with:\n - Creation and execution project work plans and revises as appropriate to meet changing needs and requirements. \n- Managing day-to-day of operational aspects of the project and its scope. \n- Ensure that project documents are complete, current, and stored appropriately.\n - Identification of resources needed and assigns individual responsibilities.\n During the extra time I use to spend my time programming the microcontroller and studying the protocol for the system data transmission to improve aspects of remote control.\n\n Achievements: \nThe project has completed the mechanical design and also the programming development, both of them have been tested through simulations that can make sure their implementation.\n \nPlatform used: ARDUINO UNO",
