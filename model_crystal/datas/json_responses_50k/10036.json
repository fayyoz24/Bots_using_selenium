    "summary": "Currently I'm a third year BSc Biology student at Wageningen University and Research. I'm following a major in Cell and Molecular Biology. My interest mostly lies in the relation of genes to brain functionality. Other interest of me regard overall brain anatomy, the influence of internal stimuli on behaviour and psychology in general.\n\nI'm participating in the Netherlands-Asia Honours Summer School 2023 (NAHSS). During the preparatory part of the programme I'll be extensively informed about the ASEAN region from a academic, business and cultural point of view. I will have the opportunity to attend inspiring lectures about Asia and visit renowned companies, such as HUAWEI, McKinsey and A.S. Watson. The NAHSS programme also involves a consultancy programme for Global Sustainable Enterprise Systems, where I investigate, together with 6 other participants, how GSES could best enroll itself in the ASEAN market. In August I'll travel to Singapore and Malaysia to experience the Asian culture in real life. In addition, we will be visiting the National University of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur as well as some partners of the NAHSS.\n\nThe NAHSS is an excellent preparation for my exchange to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in the first half year of 2024. In Hong Kong I'll mainly be following courses regarding different aspects of the brain. I'm looking forward to meet people from all around the world!\n\nIn my free time, I have a variety of small projects that I work on. A few weeks back, for example, I learned the basics behind poker and practiced my knowledge in an online casino. Recently, I also learned some basic programming skills in Python. If you have any interesting projects or ideas you would like to take up with me, don't hesitate and just let me know! :)",
