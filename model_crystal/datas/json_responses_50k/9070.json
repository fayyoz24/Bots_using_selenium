    "summary": "I hold a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management from the Lebanese University. I have further expanded my expertise with a Master's in International Service Management from London Metropolitan University and NHL-Stenden University of Applied Sciences. I am an external Ph.D. candidate at the Faculty of Spatial Sciences at the University of Groningen.\n\nHaving worked in various international settings, I bring extensive hands-on experience in HRM. I have managed HR in the hospitality industry across Lebanon, the Netherlands, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq. Additionally, I have contributed to HR in the service industry in Qatar, Lebanon, and Syria, as well as the humanitarian sector in Geneva, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Mauritania, and the Philippines. These experiences have equipped me with invaluable insights into different sectors and cultures.\n\nWithin academia, I actively engage as a member of the Academy of International Hospitality Research (AIHR) and a research group member of the Professorship of Hospitality Studies at NHL Stenden. Alongside my research pursuits, I enjoy coaching students and teaching HRM and strategic HRM at NHL Stenden Hotel Management School's bachelor's and master's programs, aligning my expertise with my research interests.\n\nMy Ph.D. research revolves around formulating a conceptual framework for developing a talent attraction and retention strategy for the hospitality industry in the Dutch province of Friesland. This research is tailored to the region's specific needs, aiming to create an adaptable model and framework. Moreover, I am focused on providing a supportive approach for the industry to embrace the future of hospitality jobs and empower the current workforce with the necessary skills for upcoming challenges.\n\nI am passionate about contributing to the advancement of the hospitality industry through academic research and teaching.",
