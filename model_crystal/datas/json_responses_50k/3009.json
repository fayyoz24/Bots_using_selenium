Focused on the creation of original turntable slipmats, A Nice Set asked artists to create a slipmat using their unique style.\n\nThe first show featured 33 \u2153 artists, the number being a reference to the speed at which records can play. Simultaneous with the first exhibition, a book featuring the artists\u2019 work was launched online and into bookstores globally.\n\nThe slipmats were exhibited in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Madrid, Melbourne, Singapore, Shanghai, Los Angeles and New York and featured more than 60 artists. At each location, local artists were invited to create and show a piece. The result was a rich tapestry of imagination, design, color and conception.",

Using QR code technology, participants \u2018collected\u2019 the products on posters, t-shirts, stickers and postcards, keeping track of their progress via social leaderboards.\n\nThe execution was a great success, amplifying a street level retail stunt into a social media and PR-relevant story with over 35 million earned media impressions and a 45% increase in retail sales compared to the previous year.",
