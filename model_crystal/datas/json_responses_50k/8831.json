Moreover, I also contributed to parts of the creation of the festival and played a big role during the event itself by acting as a contact person between the organisation and artists from different projects in order to create a harmonised flow between different parties. On top of that, I also acted as a translator (Thai - English) and a housekeeping MC during the talk panels. Apart from working in the performing arts market which I cherish this kind of art dearly in my heart, it also allowed me to improve all of the skills that I possessed, such as event management, public speaking, communication, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills, into greater use.",
