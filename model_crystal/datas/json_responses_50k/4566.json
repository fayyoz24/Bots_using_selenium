    "summary": "Optimizing organisations by streamlining their business through CRM and related sales and marketing technologies, I operate at the junction where business meets technology.\n\nI have been responsible for the vision, strategy, architecture, and development of a complex Salesforce centric ecosystem, which supports the Sales and Marketing teams of 35 different institutions. Managing tight deadlines with even tighter budgets, we have expanded the functionality of Salesforce with various custom solutions and integrations of third-party marketing and IT platforms using an agile development approach. Currently \n\nI am overseeing more than 25 simultaneous projects across Sales, Marketing, Finance and Web/Mobile development, that will change the way customers interact with our company and help the business increase conversion rates and its related revenue.\n\nManaging remote support and distributed development teams located in India, Belarus, Spain and the United Kingdom, together with my team I have integrated several third party tools including CTI / Dialler solutions, SIS systems, Facebook, Whatsapp and several custom solutions, that enhance the user experience of prospective customers. \n\nSpeaking 5 European languages, I worked in several larger multinationals and smaller start-up companies in various service-oriented industries. With experience in Financial Services, Leisure Management, Publishing and Education, I thrive best in customer centric organisations that have a dynamic and agile approach to keep up with new technologies in rapidly changing environments.",
