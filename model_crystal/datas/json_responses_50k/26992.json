    "summary": "Isn't it fascinating that we can use mathematics to save lives?! At Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, I aim to do so by applying my background in econometrics (MSc Quantitative Logistics) and natural sciences (BSc Applied Mathematics/Applied Physics) in the field of Public Health.\n\nMy research focuses on how decision models can be used to optimise personalised screening policies, particularly for colorectal cancer. For example, we aim to use an individual's screening results obtained in the past to tailor the next screening interval. This way, we are able to target the screening programme to individuals with a higher risk, reducing the burdens and costs of the programme at population-level on the one hand and increasing the life-years gained due to the programme on the other hand.",

Met 11 leiders en 45 kinderen kamperen we een week lang in een tentenkamp de bossen van Leusden, waar we veel bos- en waterspellen doen en reflectieve momenten hebben. Als leider bedenk ik spellen, begeleid ik een van de tenten en werk ik samen met de andere leiders. Een fantastische en uitdagende week vol creativiteit en teamwork."
