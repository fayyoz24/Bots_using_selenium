    "summary": "Hey you! \ud83c\udf1f My name is Elsa Havas \ud83c\udf38 \n\nI grew up in a tiny town in Finland \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee and my dream until I was 18 years-old was to follow my mother's steps and become a Physical Education teacher in my town. Once I turned 20 years-old, I realised: I don't speak English, I don't have global experience, and most importantly - I am not the person who I want to be. I felt like there must be something more for me. \n\nI put my studies on a pause, worked in a fast food restaurant, saved money and left Finland for 3 months.\n\nIt's been 10 years now, and I never really went back.\n\nI've lived in 6 countries (\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9) and I've worked with people from every continent. I have European Master's in Sports Psychology, managed Special Olympics youth programs in 58 countries, volunteered in Himalaya's, led a sports program for hundreds of women in a Greek refugee camp...\n\nI'm turning 30 this year but I feel like I've Iived at least 100 years.\n\nI'm on this planet to serve. To create something magical with people around me. I have stories to tell. Knowledge + Failures to share, and most importantly; lessons to learn.\n\nWho are you? \ud83c\udf1f I would love to hear \ud83d\udc9c\n\n\u2709\ufe0f elsainkerihavas@gmail.com\n\ud83d\udcde +31638205578",
