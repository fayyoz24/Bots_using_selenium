    "summary": "I'm a technical expert with advanced knowledge in nanomaterials innovation and the physical chemistry of their surfaces. I also have proven expertise in project management as well as in leading multinational teams to accomplish small to medium-scale technical projects.\n\nMy passion and curiosity towards science have led me to develop strong technical expertise that allowed me to overcome challenging problems. Such problems can range from designing nanostructured thin films active materials to designing MEMS fluidic reactors for online analysis of chemical and physical processes. \n\nMy approach to successful project management is mainly based on efficient communication between all the project stakeholders and on keeping a continuous stream of new ideas coming from team members. For this creative work model to be successful, I align all potential ideas in the context of achieving project goals and the company\u2019s strategic views while keeping an eye for crucial details during the execution phase.\n\nIf you are interested in my profile or if you would like to discuss technical ideas, challenges or opportunities with me please feel free to get in touch.\n\nMy main assets: creative and analytical thinking, flexibility, motivation, adaptability, excellent communication skills, attention to detail, and a strive for encyclopedic knowledge\n",
