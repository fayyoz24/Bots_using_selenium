In a short time, I've acquired many skills related to both the technical and human aspects of moderating a server, such as:\n- technical maintenance, such as designing rules and using bots\n- organising activities such as video calls on weekends, reading scripts together during the week, movie nights and other (seasonal) activities\n- acting as a person that members can approach in case of conflict, and playing a mediating role between the parties involved.\nI've found this work to be incredibly fulfilling, especially during the lockdown. We became a really tightknit community during those tough times, and it's what made me consider project management."

This included assigning tasks to the volunteers, checking in on their progress, making sure they had the means to fulfil those tasks (think tools, paint, etc), answering their questions, making decisions on the spot about the execution of said tasks, and helping with said tasks myself.\nIn addition to that, I also functioned as a co-project manager together with another member, providing transparency to the other members about our goals, a timeline of said goals, and an overview of the tools and supplies needed. This included managing a kanban board."
