    "summary": "(Socio)linguist specialised in creative multilingual practices and multilingualism in education (Research Masters of Linguistics and Communications at the University of Amsterdam).\n\nCurrently a part of Stichting Taal naar Keuze, a foundation in Amsterdam that aims to diversify language education in Dutch primary and secondary schools. By offering language education to (near-)native speakers of ANY language, we reaffirm what we already know: that language knowledge and multilingualism are a strength and not a disadvantage. And by making sure they complete final examinations in these languages we empower these students and increase their chances of academic success. \n\nNext to working for more equal opportunities in Dutch Education, I own a photography business based in Amsterdam: https://www.vogue.com/photovogue/photographers/274158. The Essence Collective allows me to co-create with other artists and capture stories of people and places that make this world special.",

            "description": "Timor-Leste, a country with an incredibly rich linguistic ecology, is the perfect case study for young underdeveloped countries\u2019 relationship to globalisation. In countries where a long struggle for independence has led to the creation of environments with a rich linguistic ecology, their speakers are often faced with the issue of \u201clanguage preference\u201d. Are there languages used for specific purposes? How do speakers make these choices? These questions are all made under the traditional assumption that languages are bound systems. However, a newfound sociolinguistic understanding of language regards individual languages as social constructions. Furthermore, it views language, as a whole, as an abstract tool composed of a set linguistic features. This paper utilises this theory, Polylingualism, as a tool to analyse real-life language use on Social Media Platforms. In combination with a traditional approach to language, this paper researched (1) which linguistic features were present on young Timorese Social Media Platforms, (2) what goals were these languages used for, and lastly (3) what social meanings were attached to said languages. The results of this paper showed that young Timorese speakers are mainly using linguistic features from Tetum, Portuguese, English, and Indonesian, in addition to the non-standard variants of these languages. Moreover, in addition to the default goal of communication, these speakers use these languages for the purpose of identity construction and the improvement of their linguistic skills. Lastly, participants were able to attach social meanings to each of these languages, which shone light on some underlying ideologies held by the participants.",
