This proposed first step towards the definitive pooling of access to financial markets by the euro area governments combines incentives for fiscal discipline with a mechanism of solidarity. The group submitted a further amended proposal as a response to the  public consultation on the issue of EMU 'Stability bonds' which the European Commission opened on 23 November 2011. For the text of the proposal of 27 January 2012, the press release and the legal chapter on the issue of eurobonds of 4 November 2011, please visit the website of the European League for Economic Cooperation (ELEC; http://www.elec-lece.eu/) and of Graham Bisshop (http://www.grahambishop.com/).\r\n",

Since the beginning of the Master Law & Finance, I teach institutional aspects of monetary policy and banking supervision, i.e. the independence and the (political and judicial) accountability of the European Central Bank under its dual mandates of maintaining price stability and contributing to financial stability (the safety and soundness of credit institutions) in the Euro Area. The role of central banks and supervisors in combating climate change and in contributing to sustainable finance are another central theme in my course.",
