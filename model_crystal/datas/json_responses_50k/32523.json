The GLSSR has more 675,000 members and is the largest Lean Six Sigma Certification Registry in the world\n\nSignificant Updates\nThe GLSSR Board made significant updates to the Registry in 2020 by creating four levels of Membership:\n\nLearner Level where members receive the GLSSR Newsletter and are kept up to date on Lean Six Sigma activities.\n\nDeclared Level where Belt Certificate holders can create a digital archive of their Lean Six Sigma Belt Certificates distribute a \u201cshare code\u201d which allows them to share their profile with current and potential employers, and others whom they wish to share their information.\n\nAuthorized Level where Belt Holders can validate and update their understanding of the Lean Six Sigma Body of Knowledge through examination and updated Lean Six Sigma Philosophy training.\n\nPractitioner Level where Belt Holders can archive their experience by providing an executive summary of their projects and complete a questionnaire which will score their project using the GLSSR proprietary scoring system.\n\nGLSSR Board Members serve a three-year term that may be renewed. Board Members remain anonymous during the time they are actively serving on the board.\n\nE-mail me for any questions or feedback: info@glssregistry.com"
