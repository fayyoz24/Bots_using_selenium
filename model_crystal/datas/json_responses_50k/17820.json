During downtime when there are few customers to assist, sales associates are expected to restock merchandise and keep the sales floor clean and organized. When customers are ready to make a purchase, the sales associate assists them at the checkout counter by ringing up purchases, process cash and credit card payments, and issue receipts.\n\nCommunication skills \u2013 Sales associates help customers see the value and benefit by assuring their shopping experience is pleasant and enjoyable. This involves answering questions, helping customers identify the products they want, and suggesting products the customer may not know they need. Being knowledgeable about a store\u2019s merchandise is key to providing customers the information they need to make purchasing decisions. The sales associate is also required to communicate with employers and other employees in a clear and effective manner.\n\nInterpersonal skills \u2013 The best sales associates are able to do little things that make a customer\u2019s shopping experience memorable.
