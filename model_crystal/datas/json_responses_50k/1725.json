    "summary": "My life is full of different schools and experiences. All of them are connected by one aim: learn to make life better, more convenient and easier to understand. \n\nIf you want to influence a civilization \u2014 grow people. I think, there may be less problems around the world if there could be someone, one day able to answer someone's question \"why\" on time. I am experienced in a wide variety of childcare projects and programs created for people of different age groups, as well as having spent time working all around the world. Cultures are different, questions are the same. \n\nI truly believe that there have to be a good preparation for life and not every school completes it. I'm standing up for individual keys for heart for every kid, every person, everyone needs a unique way for them only to be found. I want to focus on soft skills development by creative expressiveness, self emotional cognition and communication. \n\nI remember myself in early teens, feeling a need of someone who can lead me through life, inspire and motivate. Therefore, my aim is to become a source of inspiration for someone similar to who I was many years ago. I believe that people are the greatest investment we can make in order to grow wise civilization. \n\nMy lifelong goal is to follow the quote: \"be the one, who you needed when you were younger\". \nI want to plan, solve and manage. I tend to sacrifice my work for people of different ages, nationalities and preferences to make life better all around.",
