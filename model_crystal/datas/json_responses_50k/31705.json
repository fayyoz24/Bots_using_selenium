    "summary": "I am a diverse, adaptable, efficient, and driven person who holds 4 first class degrees across universities in South Africa and the Netherlands covering Law, Economics, Philosophy and Politics \u2013 all of which were awarded with the highest possible academic distinctions and with both Masters Degrees fully funded through multiple scholarships. Namely, I hold an LLM (Summa Cum Laude), an MSc (Cum Laude), an LLB (Magna Cum Laude), and a BCom (awarded with Distinction in Economics). In addition, I have also completed a series of self-funded international courses in Economics, Psychology, Politics, Philosophy, Marketing, Business, and French in universities across The Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Portugal, and France. \n\nResultingly, I offer an enormous pool of interdisciplinary knowledge, high-level analytical and strategic thinking abilities, a unique level of diversity, adaptability, and malleability, as well as a guarantee of extremely high-quality output as evidenced in how I have been a top student in every degree I have studied, regardless of the discipline. In addition, I have worked for a year in Cape Town as a Legal Consultant specializing in strategic commercial litigation and was involved in numerous multi-jurisdictional, large-scale international arbitrations across South Africa and the Seychelles. I have also spent 6 months working for a Climate Change Law Clinic in Amsterdam where I conducted legal and policy research on behalf of NGO\u2019s aimed at finding innovative pathways to stop fossil fuel projects. As such, I thrive in intellectual diversity and revel in the solving of complex, multidisciplinary problems that require the use of various lenses and perspectives. \n\nDuring both my MSc and LLM Degrees I have been developing a passion for the Climate Change field which culminated in me writing my MSc Thesis in Climate Policy, and my LLM Thesis on a topic related to Climate Change Litigation \u2013 both of which received the highest grade in the class. Thus, I have specialised in Climate Change from both a policy and legal perspective and I am now equipped with knowledge ranging across environmental economics, climate science, sustainable psychology, and climate policy, as well as experience in International, EU and Dutch Climate Change Law covering legislation such as the CSDDD, CSRD, SFDR, EU Taxonomy and EU ETS, to name a few.\n\nIn the future I aim to combine my multi-disciplinary academic knowledge, consulting experience, research skills, policy fluency and Climate Change specializiations into making a tangible difference to the world.",

GRESB assesses the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance of real estate and infrastructure portfolios and assets worldwide, and uses this information to provide standardized and validated ESG data to the capital markets. As such, the organization is a key facilitating nexus in the transition to creating more sustainable real assets and it comprises the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. \n\nI am particularly excited about this opportunity because it allows me to enter into an arena that has gradually piqued my interest during my studies over the last few years. Namely, during my LLM in Climate Change Law I realized how 'ESG' has become a recurring thread that is increasingly influencing corporate behavior and which is rapidly weaving its way through policy, law, and finance, with it automatically accompanying every conversation I heard about sustainability. Moreover, I saw how the disclosure of ESG information has become the glue that binds the new wave of EU legislation, such as the CSRD and SFDR, that is seeking to catalyze a recalibration of the economy down more sustainable avenues. Accordingly, working at GRESB will allow me to dive deep into the world of ESG data, sustainability consulting, environmental analysis, sustainable finance and EU regulation on various matters related to climate change\n\nTime to hit the ground running!",

Our team conducted detailed analysis of EU Legislation such as the CSDDD, SFDR, CSRD, UCPD and EU Taxonomy as well as Dutch Legislation such as the NCR and CDR. Moreover, I was responsible for conducting research into Dutch Environmental Policy, Consumer Law, Greenwashing, and Climate Change Litigation. \n\nThe outcome of the project was a 100 page report that will now be used for building future legal claims pertaining to shutting down fossil fuel projects. \n\nI received the highest grade in the Law Clinic of a 9.5/10 for my efforts and was recognised as the key strategist and guiding nexus for the project.\n\nI also designed a poster and presented our research at the Conference on the Future of Experiential Legal Education hosted by the Amsterdam Law School at the University of Amsterdam.",
