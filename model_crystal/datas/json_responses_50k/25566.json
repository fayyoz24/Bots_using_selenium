    "summary": "Hi! I'm Anuj.\nI'm a Senior Recruiter for Global KPO, \n\n\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc08 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc23\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b?\n\nI love putting people at ease, listening to their stories, and helping them achieve professional success. \nI didn't become a Recruiter by accident, it was a dream inspired by my own challenges as a candidate.\n...If you can't beat them, join them, and prove that it's possible to make recruiting a better experience for everyone!\n\nI don't care about your flaws, the gaps in your resume say nothing about you (life happens), and I don't believe in sending 200 inMails to random people without even opening their profiles.\n\nI believe in your cultural add, not simply your cultural fit. I believe in your motivation, in the examples of challenges and successes you share with me. And if I am your Recruiter you can count on my support. \n\nI won't hide the fact that my Inbox on LinkedIn is about to self-destruct (is it just me or is the Mission Impossible tone starting?), so if you find an interesting position on Atlassian's career page, the fastest way to be contacted is by applying directly. \n\nWhen I contact you, you'll see that my first email already contains lots of advice on how to prepare for our first interview, and all the most useful links to help you understand if Atlassian is the right place for you. \n\nGood luck and see you soon!\n\nRoby.\n\n\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc13 \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc04\n\n3 years of experience in Talent Acquisition (as a Recruiter and IT Recruiter), with the main focus on  roles. I worked in start-ups, scale-ups, and international big corporations across Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. \n\nAmong my core competencies:\n\nsourcing, full life-cycle recruiting, negotiating, hiring manager training, project management, mentoring, referral events, talent acquisition events, networking, employer branding, candidate experience, innovating, structuring the hiring process, using data to shape my recruitment strategy, managing multiple searches across multiple countries, hiring for new markets",
