    "summary": "A former Sales Executive, I have become a marketeer and strategist connecting marketing efforts and the commercial organization. Marketing has always triggered me and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve re-discovered it professionally.\n\nIn my current role, I have the privilege of leading a global lead management and strategic enablement marketing team as Marketing Director of Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY) an 11,000-colleague strong global organizational consulting firm with total annual revenue close to $3B USD. A professional services firm, Korn Ferry works with clients to design optimal organizational structures and helps them place the right people, in the right roles with the right rewards and skills to deliver.\n\nIn my journey as a trilingual (fluent in Polish, English and Dutch) I got the chance to learn different cultures and better understand how people from different backgrounds work. It has brought me lots of insights and enlightened me how to manage international teams across the different time zones and be mindful of cultural contexts in current workplace. I believe that to be able to thrive in a global world, our (remote) world requires from us skills to be able to navigate through the daily cultural differences.\n\nIntrigued by the #fourdayworkweek topic in terms of efficiency, happier employees, and health benefits - gladly sharing my opinion and findings about it.\n\nPowered by surprising others with confetti on different occasions, I am part of the internal fun committee here at Korn Ferry, co-organizing (virtual) team building activities which brings my passion to live. I practice ice cold water immersion regularly and I just started learning Italian. \n\nIf you read this and feel I can help you, feel free to \ud83d\udd17 connect with me.\nIf you like the posts I'm sharing and want to see more? \ud83d\udd14 ring the bell on my profile or @ send me a message so we can start a conversation.",
