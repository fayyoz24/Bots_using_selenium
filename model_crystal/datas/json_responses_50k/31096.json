    "summary": "Psychotherapist (Gestalt trained) and psychologist, mediator, lawyer and artist. My working life has been varied. In my early career I studied law and worked in the investment banking and insurance industries as a lawyer based in both London and The Netherlands. Later on in my career I retrained. I have a degrees in Psychology, Psychotherapy (Gestalt) and Mediation (Dispute Resolution). I have worked in those areas since 2004. I specialized in a number of fields including relationship therapy, ecotherapy (relating to climate change) loss and grief, menopause, anxiety and working with lawyers. \n\nAt heart I am also an artist and I like working with a variety of media including textile, lino-cutting , mosaics and etching. I can use my art skills in the psychotherapy setting as well if the client wishes to do that. \n\nMy life's experiences and training enable me to offer you a multifaceted approach to issues, what ever they may be. \n\nwww.milestherapie.com",

Earthquake protection in New Zealand needs to be about more than \u2018stop, drop, cover and hold\u2019.\n\nThe aftermath of the 2010-2014 Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand offered me a rare opportunity to examine the national policies and effectiveness of Government funding and management of catastrophe on a national scale. My findings are both surprising and disturbing. The slow and confused recovery phase led me to examine the insurance industry, locally and globally. This is not a book about idealistic sociological concepts, but a revelation of actual Government administrative failure and financial risk-taking, in concert with corporate malfeasance. ",

Gestalt psychotherapy is an experiential and humanistic form of therapy. I specialize in relationship/couple therapy using Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT). Therapy sessions focus on helping couples learn to better communicate, become more self-aware and to accept and trust in their feelings and experiences. I deal with a variety of issues including communication problems, cultural differences, emotional infidelity, closed or open relationships, intimacy issues, jealousy, midlife crises, uncertainty in relationship, decisions around whether to divorce or stay, and adultery.
