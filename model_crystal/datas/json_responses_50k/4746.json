    "summary": "Alway curious and never tired to learn with others. I believe education is key to face our sustainability challenges, to create positive connections and build together a better world. Environmental engineer by training, I strecth my work across different disciplines in the water and environmental sector.\n\nCurrently working as Scientific Project Manager at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, for the EU-funded Marie Curie Innovative Training Network 'NEWAVE' (Next Water Governance). I have been previously working with the International Water Association (IWA) in the members engagement team, crossing multiple units: Water Policy and Regulation; Young Water Professionals; and Strategic Programmes. I have gained experience in projects coordination, implementation and evaluation; networks management and partners engagement; developing and running capacity and professional development programs, conferences and other events, and related communication campaigns. At TU Delft, I worked in numerous research projects focusing on: agriculture and rural development; urban planning; flood risk assessment; water scarcity and drought management; water, environmental, climate policies and governance. \n\nI am experienced in multidisciplinary team working, collaborating with partners from public, private and non-for-profit sectors. I have been mainly working in Europe (NL, Italy, Spain), with long and short term missions abroad, including Africa (Ghana and Ethiopia), Canada, and China. \n\nMSc Degree in Civil Engineer, Water Resources Management, from Delft University of Technology (The NL) - complemented by master studies in Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University as student guest; BSc in Environmental Engineering from University of Rome La Sapienza (Italy) with one year abroad at Granada University (Spain).",
