It introduce to\nartistic methodologies and technologies that are informed by science; conducting\nfieldwork, deep mapping, use of AI in text writing, use of opensource datasets and\nsoftware, using earth observation data, sensory technologies, storytelling through\nscience fiction writing, artistic journalism, material research and microbiology.\n\nStudents are invited to explore alternative realities from a position rooted in the knowledge of layers of complexity, avoiding oversimplification of facts and one-sided approaches. The pathway supports interdisciplinary art and design practice-led research, interconnected with science, technology and philosophy. If ecology is the science of all relationships that make up the environment of organisms and living creatures in general, then Ecology Futures is proposing art and design in as a way of examining the relationships that construct an environment. Our students are educated in a professional interdisciplinary context. The pathway promotes a tactic based on DIY/DIT principles, supporting students to become independent professionals who are inventive and able to develop novel approaches between disciplines.",

During this project, kids ages 4-12 listen actively for one minute a day. The sounds differ greatly from day to day; from frogs at daybreak to Chopin to electronic sounds from the 50\u2032s.\nThrough this activity, a discussion is started and the fantasies of the students stimulated. It has been proven that active listening has a positive effect on the attention span and social skills.\n\n\u201cLuisterminuut\u201d is inspired by the UK project \u201cMinute of Listening\u201d.\n\n\u201cLuisterminuut\u201d is a project initiated by Soundlings, in collaboration with HKU and MCO Educatie.",
