The ultimate goal here was to provide research that prepares our client (Omrop Frysl\u00e2n) for the initiation of a communal farm. This farm shall have four main objectives: 1. Connecting farmers and citizens, 2. making consumers aware of where their food comes from, 3. exploring ecologial crop farming in Friesland, and 4. experimenting with the role of the journalist as a social activist mediating between groups of society. \nOur contribution to this larger project was to investigate the gap between farmers and citizens, as well as the distinctive soil problem in Friesland that makes crop farming more difficult. This was necessary to lay the foundation of project relevance and to provide argumentative power. Additionally, we provided inspiration for the design of the project by drawing from literature on forms of engaged journalism and civic engagement, alongside lessons we learnt from existing initiatives of a similar kind, potential partners and stakeholders. \nUltimately, we complimented this report with a toolkit for 2022, containing an advice on the next steps and relevant resources.",
