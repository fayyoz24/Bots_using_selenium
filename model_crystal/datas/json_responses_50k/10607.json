The purpose of TechEngage was to take these workers and provide them with market relevant skills in database design, web application development, Java and .NET programming and other skills.  We hosted 3 conferences and provided technical training and career guidance to over 600 unemployed workers in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill area.  Overall it was a very successful venture.
