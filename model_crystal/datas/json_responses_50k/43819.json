    "summary": "Having traversed a path as a postdoctoral researcher and having made substantial contributions within various companies like D-Tails/CrestOptics and SensoPlus+, where my focus remained steadfastly on optics and photonics products, I have seamlessly transitioned into a pivotal role at SMART Photonics Semiconductor Foundry. My prior proficiencies encompass chip and process design, fabrication, and characterization, endowing me with invaluable insights to bolster elevated process quality paradigms within the organization. In light of my adeptness in project management garnered from recent professional engagements, I have been entrusted with the mantle of Quality Project Lead. Here, my resolute dedication finds expression in advancing technology readiness levels (TRLs) and immersing myself in the tenets of methodologies such as 6 Sigma, 8D, and 5S, underscoring my commitment to propelling the vanguard of pioneering photonics technology.\n\nDuring my PhD and internship, I focused on VIS-NIR open-optic spectroscopic setup to record the optical response of my sensing chip in contact with biological samples (e.g. cell and tissue) as well as microscopy-based measurements to reveal their neural activity under electrical, chemical or optical stimulations. Besides my main project, I was working on several projects like the characterization of the chips with nanoscale patterns for sensing biomolecule binding of AG/IgG bilayer proteins, circular dichroism in gold/PMMA (RB) complex and magneto-optical effects in micro-patterned Au/Co/Au structures. I designed the sensors using Lumerical, RSoft and CST softwares, and I optimized various parameters according to the fabrication process flow or in case possible, upgraded the system in an innovative fashion to satisfy the requirements.  After optimizing multiple parameters, highly-resolved signals could be achieved using integrated spectroscopy techniques. During simulation and experimental endeavors, I took the opportunity to learn advanced data analysis to extract conclusive results from experimental spectroscopic data. besides, I obtained skills in microfluidics targeted for lab-on-a-chip application as well as fabrication techniques (i.e. soft lithography, e-beam lithography, photolithography, dry and wet etch platforms) mainly trained in the Center of MicroNanotechnology at EPFL.  \nI have worked as a part of a close-knit team of researchers and engineers from different disciplines and nationalities strengthening my intercultural and communicative skills besides making me fluent in several languages.",
