    "summary": "I am convinced that you can be a positive influence on others with even the smallest things: a friendly smile, a good conversation, a compliment. This creates a virtuous circle for me personally and motivates me to make a positive impact as big as possible. \n\nAs a starting professional, I am learning how to make this impact in my job and future career. Last year I achieved this as Talent Acquisition Advisor at ASML and as HR Trainee at Yacht. At ASML I was growing as a recruiter and a professional in general. It was a great experience working at this interesting company. Currently I am searching for a new interim challenge in HR and curious about every opportunity that comes by.\n\nDuring my Bachelor in Entrepreneurship and Retail Management and my minor Your Future Work I was educated in various subjects, which suited my versatile interests. What became clear was that I liked people-minded subjects the most, which led me to the HR Traineeship of Yacht. This traineeship of three years helps me to develop myself as a professional and to achieve my career goals.",

We started with market research, created an idea for a product and founded a company in sustainable, modular waste systems. We sold fifty SepperU's (parts of the waste system) in total, which was the total inventory. \n\nWithin the company I had the role of general manager, which made me responsible for managing the other managers (HR, Marketing & Sales, Logistics & Procurement, and Finance). As general manager I had to work closely with everybody, motivate the team, guide meetings, be in contact with various stakeholders if needed, and create a good working environment. Next to that I built (most of) the website of SepperU and created and performed (most of) the pitches we had to do as assignments.\n\nDuring the national Pitch Event contest of Jong Ondernemen SepperU won first place of South-East NL with our pitch about the company.",
