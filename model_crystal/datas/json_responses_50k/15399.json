            "description": "The wholesalers' market field is changing drastically and constantly evolving due to technological developments, changing demands and customers' wishes. In addition, the position of wholesale companies in the current market field is becoming more challenging. For this reason, many companies test their pricing strategy continuously for relevance and accuracy to compete with others. There are many ways of determining pricing such as on pricing tools (Omnia), but these tools are not smart and easily understandable for many of the price decision managers. Therefore, introducing artificial intelligence models and designing dashboards, the situation of price decision making can be improved. This increases the company\u2019s profit margin. \n\nPurpose: The goal of this study is to do empirical research on the requirements for a smart dashboard to improve the decision process of dynamic pricing of wholesale companies.

In this organization, I worked as a graduate research intern for my master thesis project which was titled \"Designing a dashboard to support the decision process of dynamic pricing\".\n\nThe main goal of the research was to provide advice to wholesale companies for improving their price decision making, which in turn would increase company's profit margin with better determination of optimal price. For this purpose, current practices, the strategies and the methodologies in Dynamic Pricing are identified in contemporary literature. Next, based on these identified strategies and methods, a series of interviews are conducted with the relevant pricing managers to understand their requirements on the pricing dashboard. Based on the results and findings of the interviews, the design rules and dashboard were designed and developed in order to evaluate and validate with the same interviewed managers.",
