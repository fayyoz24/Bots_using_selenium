    "summary": "I am deeply fascinated by cities, their complexity and the diversity of their components, but also their potential in addressing the most pressing social, ecological and economic challenges of our time. Passionate for sustainable transitions, I took it upon me to understand as good as possible the interactions between the built and physical environment, sociotechnical systems and the behavior of people and resources, which as a whole cause the emergence of more or less desirable outcomes. I believe that urban and regional sciences and development is an exciting field to work in, considering all the new technological possibilities and the creativity that can be used to find solutions to highly salient problems.\n\nI am currently doing my PhD in Agent-based Modeling of Urban Health Interventions to prevent cardio-metabolic pulmonary diseases at the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and the Department of Geosciences at Utrecht University as well as UMC Utrecht. For that, I am integrating GIS and ABM simulation modeling to understand exposure dynamics in cities (air pollution, noise, physical exercise, active transport) and how urban interventions can help addressing them. Moreover, I am attempting to quantify all social costs and benefits of the analysed intervention scenarios.\n\nFor the long run, I decided for myself that I want to work in two fields simultaneously: Research and Development. Interfering in such a complex system as a city, I think one cannot go without the other. \n\n I have gathered substantial experience and skills to conduct robust science\n- I completing my Research Master of Science in Urban and Economic Geography with summa cum laude (GPA 8.75) at Utrecht University\n- I was a research assistant at the Center for Science and Technology Studies in Leiden\n- I was a visiting student and research Assistant at the MIT Sustainable Urbanization Lab, Cambridge, USA\n- I am capable of doing: Regression modelling, Agent-based Modeling, Network Science, advanced GIS, Cluster Analysis, simple Neural Nets and more\n- Experience organizing physical and online conferences and events\n\nNext I also collected experience in urban development\n- internship within a city development department in M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany\n- intership in a regional development NGO in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka\n- started a software development project for urban resource and favor matching to help communities deal with the new challenges of Covid-19 (we participated in the Covid19 Global Hack and EUvsVirus Hackathon)\n\n\n",

While this problem is decentralized, communication barriers and the competitiveness of marketplaces hinder the ability of local groups and individuals to generate context-specific solutions from the bottom up and find the adequat human and physical resources to implement them. We need a plattform on which needs can be expressed, project ideas discussed and solutions matched to enabling resources people or organizations can be offer.\n\nTo fill that gap, Provision aims to improve the use of existing value: To help realizing ideas and foster collaboration, users can offer resources and skills, which are then matched to local project proposals or favor requests. \n\nIn conclusion, Provision is empowering solidarity with regenerative collaboration within local and global communities. We intent to engage members in a sandbox-mode where we can not just provide resources, skills and implement ideas, but also test laws, norms, transform markets into Commons. We make a stand together against the threat that is COVID-19 and go beyond.",

The latter are caused by urban environmental exposures such as Air Pollution and Noise but also behavioral exposures such as physical activity, diet or smoking behavior. With a wide spectrum of intervention possibilities in the transport system, land use, architecture, commercial and housing market regulation, cities have many ways to influence these environmental and behavioral factors. My goal is to find a way to build robust simulation models to reliably estimate the impact of interventions on health and social outcomes before implementation.",
