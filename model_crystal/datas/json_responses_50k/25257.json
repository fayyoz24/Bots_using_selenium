I thrive in high-pressure situations that require quick thinking, creativity, teamwork, and composure.\n\nI graduated from UCLA with a degree in Globalization Studies in 2019 and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Urban and Economic Geography at Utrecht University. I am interested in urbanism, economic inequality, gentrification, and migration. I am particularly intrigued by finding simple, entertaining, and accessible ways to convey complex information. I see myself in a career that combines valuable research with creative communication.",

This study was based on qualitative research as well as a number of comprehensive interviews with individuals from the international community.\n\nIn 2019 I joined a project to bring WiFi to Atutur General Hospital in Uganda. My group and I worked with the non-profit Love A Community to plan and execute this project. Funding for the project was secured through UCLA's Global Citizens Grant, the Global Development Lab Grant and a generous donation from previous Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. We hope to have the network up and running by August 2019.",
