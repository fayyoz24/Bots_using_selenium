    "summary": "Since October 2021, I am working as a scientific researcher with Prof. dr. Christian Nijhuis at the University of Twente on discovering new materials for Neuromorphic computing architectures. From 2017, I was a PhD student at the University of Groningen, working under the supervision of prof. dr. Ryan C. Chiechi in the field of Molecular Electronics. I graduated in August 2017 as a master student of the top master program in nanoscience, organised by the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials of the University of Groningen (Netherlands). I have taken various courses in the field of nanoscience and projects in the fields of spintronics and molecular electronics. My master thesis titled 'Correlating Simulations and Experiments in Molecular Electronics'. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, with Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Science & Technology (Department of Chemistry), with a Minor degree in Chemical Engineering. My Bachelor Thesis Project was based on \"Synthesizing and discussing applications of highly fluorescent conductive Carbon Quantum dots\".\n\nI also worked as the Public Relations Secretary of the Groningen Indian Students Association. I have worked as a Marketing trainee at Hangrr.com, focusing on creating a new internet business and using Affiliate Marketing & Internet Marketing. I have also worked with Mebelkart Technologies, in which the project broadly involved Vendor Acquisition and Operations Management. I have been a member of the Corporate Relations & Marketing team and Photography Head of Alcheringa, the Annual Cultural festival of IIT Guwahati. I have been a part of the Students' Gymkhana Council at IIT Guwahati, the highest decision-making body of the institute as the secretary of Photography Club. I have also been involved in various other activities at the hostel and institute level which involved public speaking, team management, etc.",

These C-Dots have\ncome forth as potential competitors for inorganic quantum dots (QDs) and other\ntoxic, heavy-metal based materials, because of their characteristics like low toxicity,\nelemental abundance and biocompatibilty. In the last decade, numerous C-Dots synthesis\nroutes have been developed, and it has been observed that different synthesis\nmethods lead to different carbogenic core and surface structure, along with different\ncharacteristic properties related to their composition, luminescence, functionalization,\nbio-compatibility, surface passivation, etc. In this review, it is discussed how these\ndifferent synthesis routes and properties of C-Dots can be advantageous in their use in\napplications in the fields of bioimaging and medicine, optoelectronic devices, chemical\nand bio-sensing, etc. The report mainly focuses on the luminescence behaviour of these\nC-dots, discussing their tunable optical behaviour and excitation dependent emission,\ngood electron donor and acceptor tendencies, appreciable quantum yield (QY), electron\nand charge transfer property, etc., and how can these be used efficiently over the\nexisting materials and techniques for the aforementioned applications.",

Angular and field dependent voltage measurements (longitudinal and transverse) were conducted, while in-plane and out-of-plane external magnetic fields were applied. A modulated electrical current in combination with a lock-in amplifier was used to separate the different spin current based effects.",

The ink showed high fluorescence, durability with time, was made compatible with commercially available printing inkjet cartridges and could be easily printed on a non-fluorescent paper for detection under UV radiation. A novel method for preparation of carbon NPs by microwave-synthesis of polyethylene glycol with water was presented. Microwave radiation synthesis method was applied to synthesize various other derivatives of these Cdots, in order to increase their conductivity. We report here nano ampere current detection in the Cdots, which has not been reported earlier. In order to increase the conductivity of out carbon nanoparticles, we have tried various different precursors and measured the conductivity difference.",
