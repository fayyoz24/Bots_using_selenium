    "summary": "I am a legal professional with an interest in the fundamentals of our law, society and politics. I like working in an interdisciplinary environment where I am challenged to develop & learn. Furthermore, I enjoy sharing my knowledge as a teacher and advisor. \n\nMy research is focused on the constitutional landscape in the United Kingdom Post-Brexit and the re-establishing of parliamentary sovereignty. The main question in my thesis is whether a theory of militant constitutionalism can help courts in protecting the structures of constitutionalism against attacks from parliament. This question is studied through the current developments in the UK and a broad literature study. This literature study will include both theoretical writings on militant democracy, militant constitutionalism and theories related to unconstitutional constitutional amendments, and empirical legal studies on constitutional design. \n\nBesides my work at the University, I am the owner of Manenschijn Consulting. The aim of Manenschijn Consulting is to offer affordable legal advice that not only focuses on what is legally possible, but also takes a more practical approach. This way, I can help small business owners and freelancers who are not able to spend a fortune on legal advice but do want to know about the legal risks they might take or need assistance with drafting contracts.",
