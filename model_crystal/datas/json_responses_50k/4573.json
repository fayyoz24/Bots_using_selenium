In 1999 TAG Heuer joined the LVMH Group, the world leader in luxury goods. Thanks to the infinite creativity and expertise of its teams, TAG Heuer is still pushing back the boundaries of watchmaking. Its achievements have been widely recognised by both watchmaking and industry innovation experts, and in the last ten years TAG Heuer is one of the only Swiss watchmakers to have regularly won awards. \nWhile resolutely forward-looking, heritage and tradition are still at the heart of what TAG Heuer does. Handed down through the generations, its values and watchmaking expertise have made TAG Heuer the timeless and audacious brand that it is. These values have resulted in its unique style which showcases its watchmaking expertise while embodying excellence, leadership, accuracy and passion. L\u00e9onardo DiCaprio, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Maria Sharapova and Cameron Diaz have all joined TAG Heuer and all share a steadfast determination to be the very best at what they do...just like our employees.\n",

Inspired by his travels to the States, where he discovered a relaxed attitude to dress, Diego Della Valle realised that people needed a beautiful, well-made shoe that could be worn in a professional, elegant or casual environment. He developed a design concept and this evolved into the now internationally renowned Tod\u2019s luxury moccasin, with its trademark 133 rubber pebbles on the sole. A new wardrobe \u201cmust have\u201d was born. It was named the Gommino.\n \nIn 1997, Tod\u2019s expanded its collection, introducing a classic, modern yet chic bag collection with the iconic  D \u2013 Bag, which perfectly reflected the spirit, quality and design of the Tod\u2019s shoe collection.\n \nEach step in the construction of every individual piece in the Tod\u2019s collection \u2013 shoe or bag \u2013 is a marvel of craftsmanship, from the cutting of the leather to the hand sewing of the parts, and it is this hand-made quality that contributes to the beauty and durability of the styles. \n \nAll Tod\u2019s products are entirely Made in Italy. This strategy has proven to be one of the greatest strengths of the company: a peculiarity that distinguishes the brand and attracts customers who truly appreciate Italian craftsmanship.   \n  \nThe philosophy behind the iconic  shoes and bags is what drives Tod\u2019s to ensure that every piece receives the same level of research in its development, and attention to detail in its manufacture. From its inception to the point at which a customer first wears it, each Tod\u2019s product is created, produced and handled with care. Because when you have customers that love what you do, you need to consistently meet their expectations.",

The winner of numerous design awards, his rise in fashion began in 1994, when he became creative director of Gucci. Not only did he dramatically change the image of the legendary fashion house, he also led the company to unprecedented success with his visionary insight into what the modern consumer desires. His innovative and provocative designs set the tone for an entirely new direction in the world of luxury goods. In 2000, Ford also took creative control of Yves Saint Laurent, a Gucci Group brand, reviving it with his trademark combination of sensuality and mystique.\nIn April 2005, one year after leaving Gucci Group, he announced the creation of the TOM FORD brand. A beauty and eyewear collection launched in 2005 and 2006. In April 2007, his first directly operated retail store opened in New York at 845 Madison Avenue to coincide with the debut of the signature TOM FORD Menswear and Accessory Collection. Several landmark fragrances were launched in succession, including TOM FORD BLACK ORCHID and TOM FORD GREY VETIVER, as well as a scent collection for perfume connoisseurs called PRIVATE BLEND.\nIn February 2011, the TOM FORD Womenswear Collection was introduced to clients worldwide. A potent vision of modern, feminine glamour, its exquisitely constructed and beautifully finished suiting, daywear, and eveningwear allow women of all ages to amplify their individuality and present their most glamorous selves to the world.\nIn September 2011, TOM FORD introduced his first Cosmetics Collection, a complete range of Color and Skin Treatments.\nPresently, there are 64 freestanding stores and shop-in-shops in locations such as Beverly Hills, London, Milan, Tokyo, Las Vegas, Sydney, Dubai, Beirut, Zurich and Russia.\nTom Fordeyewearsunglasses\n",
