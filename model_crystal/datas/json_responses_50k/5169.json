    "summary": "!Please, always make sure to add a personal message if you want to connect, especially if you are not entirely sure whether I will recognize you!\n\nI am a pioneer and changemaker with vision. Striving for a resilient and connected society, I use my creativity to create beautiful projects and to inspire people. For example by organizing events, giving workshops or helping people further as a (walking) coach. \n\nMy strength is to listen to the specific context and needs of people, to work with them and to deliver inspiring customization with a positive attitude and a touch of magic. This makes complex subjects manageable and even great fun. Where others see chaos, I bring structure by depicting the complexity in images, text or a workshop. Due to my interdisciplinary background and open-minded attitude this depiction catches on for most people.",

Also, we worked on making a green guide including sustainable initiatives in Maastricht and advice on how to have a more sustainable lifestyle. Furthermore, we organised a big event at the 21st of September 2014, when over the whole world people came in action to bring sustainability at the agenda of the United Nations. We organised an information market, made a delicious dinner, there was music and we had a very interesting workshop on degrowth"
