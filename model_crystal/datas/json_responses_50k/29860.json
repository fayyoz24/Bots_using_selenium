    "summary": "An alumni of TU Delft, I am on a journey to understand the business challenges of the 21st centuries shaped by various prime forces like Industry 4.0, the role of high-tech innovations and the demand for sustainability. I am looking forward to learn, network and collaborate from peers around to investigate the scope of innovations in creating a robust economy. \n\nAn avid follower of Steve Siebold, Robin Sharma and Jack Welch, I believe learning is a never ending process and I find happiness in spending most of my time in self-development and working on myself at various levels right from physical to skill development. As a consequence, I devote a significant amount of time everyday to reading books, networking online or offline with the endeavour of learning from like minded individuals about long term goal achievement, connecting with individuals with an unconventional mindset, sports and athletic fitness, meditation. I always believe that as individuals we have a bigger purpose by giving back to the society and economy, my educational goals therefore are aligned with this particular mission in my mind.\n\nHaving travelled to 20+ countries, I have had the pleasure of interacting with individuals from more than 50 countries, which has given me today the confidence to break the ice with strangers and effectively lead in a multi-cultural environment. I am indebted to have been a part of a multitude of networking and development forums including Toastmasters International to Beehive, Rotaract wherein I had the opportunity to learn from and create a world class network of individuals ranging from entrepreneurs, CEOs to life coaches.\n\n An ENTJ-A as per the Myers Briggs personality test, I believe it is my self- actualisation goal to serve the economy / industry by leading and directing change in the areas of business strategy, technology and management.",

            "description": "It proposes a logistics solution which can be incorporated in smart cities to save time and reduce pollution, thus promoting sustainable development.a total of two situations were considered: First, usage of electric vehicles in the place of conventional vehicles for urban freight transport: Second, usage of effective GPS and route mapping for garbage collection trucks, so that they reach the bins located near them as soon as they are full. Priorities were assigned: For instance, the bins in major commercial areas were given higher priority compared to less occupied areas. The shortest possible time and the least possible fuel consumption were taken as the major constraints. Factors like terrain, traffic and load condition of the vehicle, which may affect time and costs were also considered. Two linear programs were developed, one for each case, and solved in MATLAB, for a township named Ukkunagaram, in India. The results were stunning, as this new model was capable of cutting down carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by 40%. Since the given model shows the most economical possible route, the cost of operation was higher than the conventional model by just a small factor, despite using route mapping GPS technology and renewable energy.",
