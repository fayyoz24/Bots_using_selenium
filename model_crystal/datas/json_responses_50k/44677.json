    "summary": "Hi! A bit about me, in a nutshell: \n\nI am an engineering professional, offering over 15 years of experience in the field of project engineering and certified project management. I am naturally driven towards a parallel focus on both technical performance and business goals. Working in projects, to create, together, energizes me!\n\nMy curiosity led me to a colourful range of industries and companies. I am thankful for the opportunities given and surely yet to come, to continue my explorations through the world of technology and innovation.\n\n'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.' | Albert Einstein\n\n---\n\nToday, I am looking for a new sustainable challenge. This can be either a permanent job or a freelance assignment.",
