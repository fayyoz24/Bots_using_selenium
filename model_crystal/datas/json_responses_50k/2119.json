    "summary": "I am very curious about other languages and cultures. Interreligious and intercultural exchange are my main areas of interest. Furthermore, human rights and feminism are causes that I care for. This is reflected in my professional and educational background, my volunteer experience and my extra-curricular courses and activities. Through these, I learned in depth about different cultures and religion, and the problems that arise when society and people themselves have to deal with interreligiousness and interculturality. My experiences through my studies and extra-curricular activities also taught me even more the importance of knowledge of languages, cultures and religion for developing your own critical opinions on issues dealing with this. This in turn helped me develop a great intercultural competence. This is my main drive, to help people to understand each other and their problems better through interreligious and intercultural exchange. I aim to achieve that, wether it is through a job related to Islam specifically or through a job related to interreligious and/or intercultural exchange in general. For me, that also includes a job that does not necessarily deal itself with these issues, but which makes me deal with them personally. A great example is my previous position as a double degree program manager in Lisbon, Portugal. I would love to use my experiences and competences, especially my great intercultural competence, for a new position!",

This entails doing preparatory research via studying online sources and interviewing staff but also taking care of the operational side. I coordinate and organise the Diversity Week's events, catering, participants, volunteers, guests and communication. Thus I am the main point of contact about the diversity week, I coordinate with the necessary stakeholders for this event, make sure all events and necessary support are organised and write texts and take care of social media so the communication regarding this event is up to par. Naturally, during the Diversity Week itself I make sure all events go smoothly and host them together with the Student Wellbeing and Diversity Officer.",
