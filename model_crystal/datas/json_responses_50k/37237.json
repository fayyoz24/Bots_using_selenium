    "summary": "Over 8 years of work experience in project management, budgeting and pricing in international development, combined with my academic grounding in European Studies, allowed me to develop a diverse set of skills. I have extensive experience in working with international donors, such as the \u2018European Commission\u2019 (EC), the \u2018Department for International Development\u2019 UK (DFID), the \u2018Foreign & Commonwealth Office\u2019 (FCO) and the \u2018World Bank\u2019. Specifically, my experience as a project manager allowed me to work on a diverse set of projects such as the \u2018Nepal Climate Change support programme (NCCSP) Tranche 2\u2019, the \u2018Provide Technical Assistance and Support to ClimateSmart project in South Africa\u2019, the \u2018Mid Term Review for the DFID Climate Change Institutional Strengthening Programme in Tanzania\u2019 and the \u2018Developing a Roadmap to Finance Climate Change Resilience in Tanzania\u2019, amongst others. As a project manager I remain highly result focussed by always being mindful of the desired outcomes of the projects. Furthermore, the requirements of my role as a pricing analyst were met by demonstrating the ability to pay strong attention to detail and to work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment across international and multi-disciplinary teams. Meeting competing internal and external deadlines was one of the daily challenges and I always delivered quality on time. Additionally, my 8 years of work experience in the customer service industry enabled me to develop excellent communication skills, that I have continued to hone in my subsequent jobs.",

Here I learned the ins and outs of project development, preparing expressions of interest and proposals for donors (DFID, World Bank, DFAT and EC), sourcing experts, recruiting and preparing CVs, and writing up relevant experience and capability. In November 2013, as my internship ended and I successfully completed my degree, I moved within the company to the Project Management Unit. I currently manage projects under the DFID-funded Climate, Environment Infrastructure and Livelihoods (CEIL) Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services (PEAKS) framework agreement (Evidence on Demand), a rapid-response service through which DFID advisers can commission small pieces of work related to climate, environment, infrastructure or livelihoods. On this particular project my duties include, but are not limited to:\n- Contractual administration and coordination of project teams and logistics (visas, travel);\n- Financial monitoring, including invoicing and tracking expenditure against budget;\n- Coordination of the production, review and editing of reports and outputs for submission;\n- Donor/client liaison and negotiation;\n- Preparation of project summary sheets and updates;\n- Management of call-down contracts under the CEIL PEAKS programme;\n- Provision of research inputs to CEIL PEAKS, such as annotated bibliographies that contribute to DFID Evidence Papers. \nMore general responsibilities include:\n- Ad hoc support to technical coordinators, project directors, team leaders and donors;\n- Issuing of contracts and consultant mobilisation;\n- Negotiations/liaising with clients, e.g. to issue contract amendments;\n- Budget monitoring and the administration of monthly timesheets;\n- Reviews of reports before submission to the client;\n- Provision of assistance in the preparation of short proposals and the sourcing consultants for call-down requests for short-term projects.",
