    "summary": "In my educational experience, I obtained my first bachelor's degree in French and Romance languages and literature, during which I participated in an ERASMUS exchange program in Spain for six months. Thanks to these studies I acquired a professional level of French as well as Spanish and English thanks to the option in this branch that I had chosen. Moreover, I have considerably increased my knowledge of the literature of these three major languages in Europe and in the world.\n\nAfter obtaining this first degree, I decided to change my path in order to be able to practice the profession of my dreams. So it was at ESA Saint Luc Brussels that I did a second bachelor's degree in interior design, which I graduated with distinction in 2022. I learned a lot and was able to develop my skills in interior design, hand drawing and 3D, but I also acquired a good cultural foundation in design and architecture. Passionate about my studies, I graduated first in my class both in Belgium and in my Erasmus school.\n\nDuring my studies in interior design I had the opportunity to do an Erasmus at the Nantes School of Design. In addition to discovering a new teaching method, I had the opportunity to be part of an international class where I was able to work with students from other horizons. This allowed me to open up to new cultures, to become more open-minded and to improve my English skills. I learned a lot both professionally and personally during this year and I was able to develop my skills as an interior designer.\n\nPassionate about travel, I took a trip for a few months before settling in Amsterdam. I am currently a NaughtOne Brand Ambassador  in the A&D Community in the Netherlands, a British company of design office furniture. .  I have the opportunity to promote our portfolio of sleek and comfortable office furniture to architects and designers and build my network while learning Dutch.",
