    "summary": "Consecutively to finishing my BSc in Archaeology and Forensic Science course with a distinction, I am currently pursuing my LLM course in Criminology, Forensics and Law at the Maastricht University in the Netherlands.\n\nAs a part of my Bachelor's degree, I had an amazing opportunity to spend a year studying at the University of Malta where I focused on the studies of archaeology and criminology. During my studies of criminology, I discovered my strong interest in the area of organised crime. \n\nMy last research was conducted in my final year dissertation, with the main aim of comparing and contrasting policing strategies used to tackle cross-border human and drug trafficking activities in the United Kingdom and in Slovakia. By analysing two different systems that work on their own conditions, the study was aiming towards creating strategies on how to improve investigations of organised criminal groups by offering solutions that might lead to early disruptions of their networks.\n\nMy experience in foreign countries helped me to become very independent and driven. I am constantly trying to pursue volunteering and internship opportunities both in my home country as well as abroad in order to broaden my horizons and to help me gain new experience. For instance, during one of my internships for a leading security oriented think-tank in central Europe, I worked for a gender equality division where I helped with research and subsequent writing of a report. \n\nOverall, I am flexible, innovative and good at learning new skills. I speak several languages which can only be an advantage when working with a diverse range of people. I am very active and never fail to fullfil any task whether as an individual or as a part of a team.\n\nIn my free time, traveling and spending time with my friends is the ultimate relax for me. I enjoy getting to know new places and cultures as I believe the more you see and experience in life, the more knowledge you gain.",
