    "summary": "I love to create products that matter. The most exciting part is to see how the team I've built makes magic happen. To some extent, I can do a large share of the project work myself, but orchestrating the team of specialists who do this job even better, delivering high-class mobile or web apps, loved by users, gives me a lot more satisfaction. \n\nI've successfully completed more than 40 mobile and web projects in such areas as e-commerce, classifieds, online travel agencies (OTAs), OTT media streaming, e-learning, ride-hailing & micromobility, IoT, KYC, e-payments etc. Some of them required small teams to accomplish, while others a collection of agile teams of up to 20 people in total. \n\nThe solutions we made together not only delivered value to users and customers but also received awards including the prestigious Webby Award by IADAS (International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences).  \nApart from focusing on value I always concentrate on quality as some of the apps have a significant audience up to 800K downloads and 300K+ MAU (monthly active users). \n\nBeing a certified project manager (PMP by PMI) I have great experience in predictive approach and over the last few years, I worked as a technical product manager with agile teams on products that need better velocity and adaptability. \n\nI have management experience on different levels: classical project management as a PM, scaled agile development as a PO and a TPM, and business process management as a COO. So I use different ways to consistently achieve great results: better products, better processes, company and teammates growth along with user and customer satisfaction.",
