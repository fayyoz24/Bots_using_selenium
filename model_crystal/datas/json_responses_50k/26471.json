The objective was to make the eye tracker algorithm run on a power efficient and low-cost embedded system Jetson Tx2 with at least 60 FPS to have smooth tracking. However, the algorithm without acceleration can only run at 18 FPS which cannot track a person smoothly at all. In this project, I firstly found a CPU accelerating strategy and increased the frame rate from 18 FPS to 28 FPS. Then I made GPU acceleration with own designed CUDA kernel, which increased the frame rate from 28 to around 68 FPS. With this kernel, the GPU processing time was 20 times faster compared to the CPU processing time for detecting 68 face landmarks. \n\n- Solved camera light problem for an eye algorithm. Under each light condition, the camera needs a specific shutter time, and the original eye tracker algorithm only worked under one specific light condition and failed at all other light conditions. I designed an algorithm to automatically find the shutter time for each light condition.\n\n- Solved challenges of extracting eye data from all eye trackers via UDP and made different eye Tracker coordinate systems consistent and calibrated them from camera to display. Thus all the performance of the eye Tracker algorithms could be compared, and the best eye tracker could be selected and improved. This was used in a 3D game application without glasses, which was shown at CES 2017 with great success.\n\n- Made an AR demo, where the virtual objects can pop out or go behind of the Display up to 1.5 - 2 meters and users feel they are holding the virtual object in their hands, and can look at it from all perspective views. This demo  was shown at SID in May 2017.\n\n- Solved 2-view and multiple view challenges through Unity, and enabled 3D for an automotive application, which brought to a business success with the automotive company Valeo.\n\nProgramming Languages: C (CUDA GPU), C++, C#.",

Thus an automatic Gleason scoring system is wished, but the main challenge lies in distinguishing between the Gleason scores 3 + 4 and 4 + 3. We hereby propose a four-module approach for automated Gleason scoring, i.e. (i) nuclei extraction via PCA color deconvolution and Laplacian Gaussian filtering, (ii) lumen segmentation with Gabor filter, (iii) glands segmentation with Fuzzy C-means classification and heuristic optimization, and (iv) feature extraction and Gleason scoring. The results show that the nuclei pixels could be extracted, and lumina and glands were well segmented (the median sensitivity, precision and Dice score for gland segmentation were 0.87, 0.89 and 0.87 respectively). Thereafter, we could identify combinations of texture and morphological features for each type of gland patterns (i.e. normal, 3, 4 and 5) and perform pattern recognition. Our results show that 30 images out of 33 were correctly graded (91%). More importantly, our algorithm could correctly distinguish patterns 3 + 4 from 4 + 3 in 14 out of 16 images. Finally, our method could provide a correct final diagnosis for 10 patients on 12. Within the limits of this work, the results show that our method is promising for histopathological examination of the prostate for Gleason scoring. \n\nProgramming Language: Matlab.",

The pipeline includes various image processing steps and watershed-based segmentation. In particular, key parameters (e.g. Filter size, Structure element size, Regional maximum) were optimized in order to extract cells of any shape and position from images having any level of lighting artifacts and noise. An analysis on the effects of such image artifacts on the quality of the optimized segmentation was performed as well. \n\nProgramming Language: Matlab",
