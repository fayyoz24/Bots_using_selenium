I have cumulated experience in pharmaceutical sciences, polymer chemistry, 3D printing, tissue engineering, microfluidics and biofabrication. The possibilities within regenerative medicine to tackle disease and quality of life excite me and it is my goal to contribute to achieving these goals during a career as a scientist.",
