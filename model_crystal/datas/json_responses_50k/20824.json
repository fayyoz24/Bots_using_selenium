    "summary": "Creative Graphic Designer with 3+years experience in B2B market. I help companies like Procter & Gamble, PWC, SAP, Danone, Schlumberger translate ideas into visual solutions for business.\n\nYou may not believe it, but during my career I have developed more than 2000 presentations and about 100 templates from scratch for 100 largest companies in Russia. My visual and structural solutions help clients promote their brands, attract new customers and hold events.\nMy other area of expertise is the development of a full cycle of design identities from determining the client's business needs to a ready-made brandbook. I'm always on the run to improve my skills, the last program I started learning was Blender.\nI'm not afraid of a good test. I had complex projects during which I learned how to edit videos, create a 3D model of an object, or delve into motion design in the process.\nCurrently, I am not only focusing on creating something visually appealing, exciting and easy to use, but also strive to educate others by sharing my experience with colleagues and clients.\n\nIn addition to creating presentations and designing, my experience includes:\n- Reduced project time by 50% through the introduction of new products in the ppt department\n- An educational course has been developed to improve the quality of presentations decrease PPTX department workload\n- Conducted more than 20 online training webinars on business presentations creation (design, storyline, structure) with more than 1000 participants\n\nI'm excited about the opportunities where I can apply my design experience to help companies competently visualizing their ideas that affect their positioning in the global market.\n\nI'm a big fan of Formula 1. I've been rooting for the Ferrari team for the last three seasons. And my dream remains to watch the race live.\n\nI love connecting with new people, give me a shout at kakovleva23@gmail.com, in telegram @KsKoz or here on LinkedIn!\n\nWeb-design | Landing design | Typography Calligraphy| Concept creation | Graphic Designer | Presentation | PowerPoint | Figma | Photoshop | Illustrator | Movavi Video | Blander | After Effects | 3D-Max | SketchBook",
