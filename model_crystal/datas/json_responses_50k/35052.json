    "summary": "I love being around people and provide them with the support they need to be great at what they do, getting out of my comfort zone to gain experience to face unplanned circumstances. I fully embrace the concept of a growth mindset and I am driven by curiosity. \n\nIn my latest roles, as Operations Supervisor in Amazon and as Team Leader in American Express, I have learned how to switch from Leadership to Project tasks. Coaching is how I help people express their full potential. I facilitate tailored development plans and career aspiration talks. I am proud to have seen promotions and career changes within my team during the years: their accomplishments are what make me feel successful.\n\nThanks to my previous experience as a Procedural and Compliance Analyst, I have developed the ability to analyze data, find patterns and root causes, and create remediation plans. I have been involved in different phases of projects\u2019 life cycles and business report analysis with the aim to add value and bring efficiency.\n\nAccording to the feedback I have received throughout my career, people consider me calm, clear, and concise when leading projects, presenting face-to-face, virtually, in front of a large audience, or approaching tight deadlines. \n\nWhen I am not at work, I like to keep myself busy with a variety of activities such as solving jigsaw puzzles, reading newspapers, cooking, practicing foreign languages, and hiking in the countryside with my husband and collie-cross dog. \n\nSkills / Interests: Team Work | Conflict Resolution | Process Improvement | Emotional Intelligence | Adaptability to Change | Resilience | Accountability | Lean Management Principles | Excel & Pivot Tables | Data Reporting | Leading Projects | Remote Working | Agility | Compliance | Procedural Testing | Business Self-Testing | Audit | Logistics | Customer Service | Freight Management\n\nI love to meet new people and get new perspectives. Please feel free to drop me a message whether you\u2019d like to talk about Leadership, Project Management, or dogs.",
