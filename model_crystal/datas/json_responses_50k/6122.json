    "summary": "Passionate about User research, Business Modeling, Market Validation, Idea generation, UX for products, Information flows and Design Thinking. Alternatively have interests in Blockchain, Cyrpto/Digital currencies, Trading  & Finance.\n\nI believe in the power of doing and achieving goals. I consider myself to be an optimist about every opportunity given to me and highly motivated when it comes to delivering results either for individuals or as a part of a team.\n\nGenerally, I keep my peers motivated around me and I believe that motivating someone to do something is one of the biggest achievement one can get. I am at times a bit crazy, as I see myself as a \"Hustler\" to get things done. \n\nI am constantly working on becoming a highly skilled professional in the field of Design (Human Computer Interaction, Design Thinking, and User Experience Design). My skills and experiences have taken me places and have made me successful in academia and extra co-curricular events that I have participated in. Being passionate about \"Innovation and Design\", I can also handle cross domains like content generation, writing, consulting (IT), marketing. \n\nI constantly think of ways to improve my skills as a person, build trust with people, organizations and grow them towards success!\n\nCheers!\nThe Optimist",
