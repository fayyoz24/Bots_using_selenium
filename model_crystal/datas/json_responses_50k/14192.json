    "summary": "My names Conor, I'm a tech enthusiast and enjoy learning new skills and about new technologies.\n\nI'm currently in Rotterdam, The Netherlands and working for Mizuno Corporation EMEA.  As an IT Support Engineer of almost 9 years of experience, I am the only local site IT Support working on the helpdesk with the rest of my Team who are based in the Mizuno UK Office and together support all staff across several countries remotely. \nWorking on site by myself I have to take the task of managing up to 70+ staff locally with their IT Issues, including Account Creations, Password resets, Hardware Faults, Software Licensing and contacting external supports for various tasks. I have always preferred hands on troubleshooting but if I can resolve an issue successfully for a staff member over teams, calls, and or via GoToAssist then I know I'm doing my job right. \nJob satisfaction is my aim, to go in, work hard, close calls and go home with a smile.\n\nIn the near future, I aim to progress from my MTA certifications to a MSCA in Windows Server. Administration. Current extra skills I'm teaching myself outside of work, are learning Dutch language and how to play Ukulele.",
