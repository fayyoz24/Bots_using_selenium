They inspire me, I inspire them on their journey.\n\nWorking in the sports industry\nI profile and train athletes, trainers, coaches physically! and mentally. I help them to understand why they are unique in what they do IN ACTION and how to upgrade their performance. I help talented student-athletes find balance in dealing with their dual career struggles.\n\nMy base\nThe south of the Netherlands. A Euregion close to Belgium and Germany.\n\nLearning courses\nI offer full service very personal, very practical learning courses with possibility to stay overnight in the hotel! Courses are either half (5 hours) - or full day courses (10 hours) - One and half day or two day courses are options as well.\n\nActionTypes.com Approach\nThe approach starts with researching and validating physical preferences, your natural way of moving, which leads to a very solid personal career profiles.

            "description": "Paul Smit is (sport)agoog en sinds 1996 geregistreerd studie- en loopbaanadviseur. Hij is werkzaam voor topsporttalentschool Trevianum Sittard en gespecialiseerd in het samenstellen van studiebegeleidingsprogramma\u2019s voor talenten, bijvoorbeeld topsporters. Om inzicht te krijgen in en het ontwikkelen van typische voorkeuren bij het identificeren van talent en de persoonlijke leerstrategie maakt hij gebruik van testmethodiek. E\u00e9n van deze methodes is de typeleer, in bijzonder de 'Action Type Benadering'. Een deel uit het gesprek met hem over zijn aanpak en visie.\n\n\u201cIn het onderwijs maar ook daarvoor toen ik nog werkzaam was als HR-consultant, miste ik inzichten in de relatie tussen het fysieke gedrag (de motorische voorkeuren) en de mentale eigenschappen van de mens. Mijns inziens noodzakelijke informatie binnen coachtrajecten.\u201d Voor Paul is de Zwitser Bertrand Th\u00e9raulaz, die in de jaren tachtig met Ralph Hippolyte startte met de zoektocht naar de achtergronden van de individuele verschillen in motoriek voorkeur, een inspirator geweest. \u201cIk heb meerdere leergangen rondom Action Type gevolgd.\n\n\u201cEen deel van de jongeren die ik als loopbaanadviseur begeleid is ook topsporter. Je kunt je voorstellen dat het voor zowel de sporter als zijn trainer prettig is om over specifieke informatie te beschikken. Dat kan heel specifiek door videobeelden van trainingen en wedstrijden te analyseren en een beeld te krijgen van hoe de sporter denkt en handelt, dus welke acties hij bij voorkeur maakt en wat zijn motieven zijn.\u201d Volgens Smit is de opbrengst hiervan: persoonlijke aandacht, minder blessures, heldere communicatie, meer zelfvertrouwen, beter begrip van tactiek en bevordering van samenwerking met staf en teamgenoten.\n\nVoor meer informatie over deze loopbaanbegeleiding kan contact worden opgenomen met Paul Smit: paulsmitlob@hotmail.com. Hij is op afspraak werkzaam op de vestiging in Geleen (Norbertijnenstraat 77a) van Medi-Sport.",
