This study was focused on the development\nof perfectly sharp silicon (Si) pits at the wafer scale, for the mass production of ultra-sharp molded AFM tips. Typically, the anisotropic etching of Si using square or circular mask openings results in wedge shape apexes of the order of a few tens of nanometers. This eff\u000bect is due to errors inherent in the writing of a photomask and in the photolithography process. The rotation of an etching mask opening with respect to the crystal orientation of the Si substrates has a direct eff\u000bect on the sharpness of etched Si pits. Employing wet and dry etching techniques this sharpening eff\u000bect, has been extensively explored. Photomask openings of dif\u000bferent shapes and sizes have been used, along with an advanced technique for the development of a perfectly square etching mask. \fSignificantly improved sharpness of the Si pits has been obtained and wedge shape apexes of\nthe order of \u001820 nm on average, were successfully reported.",
