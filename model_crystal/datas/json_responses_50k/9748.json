The emerging trend of Onboard Carbon Capturing, aimed at reducing emissions in the maritime sector, has captured my attention in discussion with my thesis sponsor company, Port Rotterdam Cosultants B.V. Anticipating its regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in July, my thesis project aims to explore the significant challenges and opportunities related to port integration within the onboard carbon capture value chain.\nThe primary objective of my study is two-fold. Firstly, I seek to identify and analyze the major challenges and opportunities that arise when integrating ports into the onboard carbon capture value chain. Secondly, my study aims to devise strategies that can overcome these challenges and optimize the potential advantages of utilizing onboard carbon capturing technology from the perspective of ports.",
