We also helped in various deprived schools, and down syndrome centres taking crafts and fun learning materials and games to use with the children. We also assisted with painting murals around the schools to help make the school environment more fun for the children. The second week that I was there it was the first week of Ramadan. This was a really good experience for me as it was valuable insight into other cultures, I participated in the fasting each day I learned how much I take for granted and more about my own personal strengths. Every night of that week we had the option to assist to prepare and serve food to the homeless, refugees and other less fortunate people in an empty hotel dining room so that they could come and eat together for the breaking of the fast each day.",
