            "description": "In 2016, I went to South Africa and joined the Elundini Disabled project in Dunoon, a township in Cape Town, with SAVE volunteering. I assisted teachers at a school for children with special needs and my assigned classroom consisted of children with severe mental as well as physical disabilities. I helped with feeding the children, taking the children outside, and stimulating the children\u2019s senses. Additionally, I was involved with extracurricular activities for children at other schools in the township and I attended community events."
