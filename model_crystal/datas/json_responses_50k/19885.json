    "summary": "Driven | Creative | Genuine\n\nI am a Human Resources and education professional with experience in multinational and entrepreneurial-minded midsized companies. I enjoy collaborating with colleagues and internal/external clients to define success, and working together to achieve it. I\u2019m able to establish credibility and rapport with diverse (multicultural) groups, quickly identify important topics and translate them into actions. I am comfortable navigating ambiguity because I believe that innate to those situations is the opportunity to create and innovate.\n\nExperience: international recruitment, performance management, compensation, training, HRIS/ATS/LMS (SAP, ADP, Workday, Jobvite, Blackboard), curriculum design and development, facilitation, developing evaluations and assessments",
