    "summary": "My biggest passion is understanding human beings; both collectively and individually. How can we work together better to create and partake in a culture leading us towards a more balanced humanity? \n\nWhen working as a sales executive at perhaps the most well-respected hospitality company in Finland, I learned to understand and read what guests wanted and needed. Due to the five star quality that both the guests and the company expected, I became a skilful communicator and learned the ability to resolve conflicts respectfully. Because of managing the details and customer base of nine properties at once, I discovered that being organised and understanding the big picture are a strong suit of mine. \n\nAfter travelling in South East Asia for six months, I decided to work for a start-up in order to understand how organisations function. I got to take on more responsibility than just my title as customer success manager which gave me the ability to perfect my skills in multitasking. I became increasingly interested in understanding patterns that I saw in larger entities. I wanted to understand what were the root causes of conflict in groups of people. Therefore I started my studies of cultural anthropology and development sociology at the University of Amsterdam. My studies have taught me tremendously on how to understand conflict, how to ask the right questions and how to take the perspective of 'the other'.\n\nVolunteering for an NGO, I have also created a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students and professionals from Africa and the Nordics.",
