The motivation within the team is extremely high, which pushes the students to get to their absolute best. Within this year I was responsible for all financial matters and for all organisation and logistics around the events we organized ourselves. I personally see this year as most valuable within my student time so far. I really learned how to organize myself within a high stress and high demanding working environment, how to manage groups, how to handle arguments and disagreements within the team and realizing the importance of communication in work situations.",
