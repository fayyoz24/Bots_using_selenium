The resulting power and temperature distribution is controlled by the individual antenna settings (i.e. phases and amplitudes). These settings are adapted during treatment based on continuous temperature measurements in the tumor and the patient\u2019s feedback when normal tissue temperatures get too high (i.e. treatment limiting hot spots). The large number of degrees of freedom in power steering makes establishing optimal settings very difficult; tumor temperatures thus often remain suboptimal. \n\nSolution: We have developed a treatment planning(TP) module for on-line adaptive hyperthermia treatment planning, which is used during treatment to visualize results of adapting antenna settings and support more effective power steering. We demonstrated its effectiveness in suppressing hot spots. \n\nAim: To determine whether treatment planning-based power steering is more effective than experience-based power steering. This will be done by double blind randomization between experience-based and planning-based interventions in patients.\n\nPlan of investigation: HT is usually applied in 5 weekly sessions combined with RT or CH. During each 60min session, hot spots occur that require intervention to adapt power steering. We randomize during each session between experience-based and planning-based interventions for each hot spot complaint. The first 1.5 years is dedicated to development of a graphical user interface(GUI) to perform the clinical evaluation. The actual study and analysis are performed in the last 2.5 years. ",

Recently, promising results were obtained by combining MMC with intracavitary hyperthermia (HT). However, intracavitary HT techniques are associated with large temperature differences, locoregional HT is expected to yield a more uniform tumor temperature. A pilot study at AMC showed locoregional HT and MMC for intermediate/high risk NMIBC is feasible with excellent bladder temperatures of 42\u00b0C and minimal toxicity. Thermometry during bladder HT was limited to intraluminal measurements along the central axis of the bladder and absent at the bladder wall. The latter is more representative for residual tumor sites.\r\n  \r\n4 Purpose\r\nThe purpose is to optimize the temperature distribution during locoregional bladder HT treatment by using three dimensional (3D) steering of the temperature rise, guided by high resolution Hyperthermia Treatment Planning (HTP) and guided by improved 3D temperature data, obtained by developing a new probe to monitor the bladder wall temperature distribution.\r\n",

Randomised trials have demonstrated a significant improvement in tumor control and patient survival for cervical and other cancer sites by combining radiotherapy and HT. The results of clinical trials were positive in spite of the fact that goal temperatures rarely achieved in the tumor due to the incidence of unwanted hot spots in normal tissue. Clinical results can improve further when these treatment limiting hot spots could be suppressed. The 3-D power control of the latest generation phased array antenna systems for locoregional HT is capable of preventing hot spots. However, manual optimization of system settings is very difficult due to the large number of degrees of freedom of these systems, and pre treatment planning is presently not yet sufficiently reliable due to uncertainty in input data. \r\nTo develop treatment planning guided active hot spot suppression to improve tumor temperatures. The method should be applicable for all locoregional HT patients.\r\nDevelopment and implementation of active hot spot suppression involves three steps: \r\ni.\tDevelopment of algorithms capable of adapting phase and amplitude settings to suppress hot spots occurring at any possible location.\r\nii.\tPre-clinical tests: Computer simulations will be used to predict the performance of the developed algorithms under realistic clinical conditions, with emphasis on performance with limited temperature and E-field data, and uncertainty in tissue properties.\r\niii.\tClinical validation: The performance of the algorithm will be validated in 20 cervical cancer patients treated with hyperthermia using the 70 MHz AMC-8 regional HT system. Each patient will receive five HT sessions, and each HT session will start with standard experience based phase and amplitude settings. \r\n",

Regional hyperthermia for pelvic tumors, including cervical, rectal, bladder and prostate carcinoma, is applied using phased arrays of multiple Microwave (MW) or Radiofrequent (RF) antennas. A challenge in achieving high tumor temperatures is avoiding excessive normal tissue heating, or so-called hot spots. Hot spots are related to anatomical structures, specifically interfaces of tissues with different power absorption rates (SAR). Establishing optimal antenna settings preventing hot spots is complex due to tissue and perfusion heterogeneity and the large number of antennas. This task is performed using Hyperthermia Treatment Planning (HTP), but the accuracy of present tissue input data is limited and the computed system settings are thus not optimal, leading to treatment limiting hot spots and suboptimal tumor temperatures. \r\n\r\n4 Purpose \r\nWe will improve the reliability of HTP by replacing the presently used generic literature values for dielectric tissue properties by patient specific data based on MR imaging as input for HTP. This will yield a more reliable prediction of hot spot location and amplitude, and thus yield system settings resulting in higher tumor temperatures and less toxicity.\r\n",
