Focus on humanitarian value is crucial to successful ship management.\nWe start with an assessment: collect security related potential disruptive events, analyse them, reflect on them. Based on a matrix with action parameters such as awareness, resources, information sharing, crisis management and insurance, a policy is set up and tools are developed based on a continuum of care. Training and coaching to put the policy into daily practice is the logical final step.\nBetter crisis preparedness results in more safety, less downtime, better performance and no extra expenses on rerouting and repatriation.\nYour company will be rewarded with more profit, a better reputation and a stronger corporate image. Good care is profitable: 1 + 1 = 3.\nEveryone wins.",
