This includes melt temperature, raster angle, layer thickness. Discussions were made and data was compared to obtain the optimum values.\n\nImportant learning: the ambient temperature and relative humidity had an important role to play in the quality of parts obtained. Surface finish can be improved by techniques like Acetone Smoothing.",

The project objective was to deduce a methodology to quickly generate custom 2D rotor templates for electromagnetic simulations. \n\nThe expected outcome was reduced simulation times, as the starting point of the optimization is improved.\n\nTopology optimization (using OptiStruct) was used to generate 2D rotor geometries, using heat flux to mimic the magnetic flux lines. \n\nThe optimized geometries were used to run simulations in a no-load condition (using JMAG). A performance improvement was observed when compared to standard template geometries used by the team.",
