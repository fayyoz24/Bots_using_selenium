    "summary": "I am a consultant Sustainability Governance & Leaning currently based in the Netherlands with an advanced degree in tropical agriculture, development economics and forest policy. \n\nSustainable and responsible ways in which people relate with one another, nature and society have driven my education and career. I am fortunate to be part of a global network of professionals and activists on social and environmental sustainability, as well to have made part of the world of women, men, girls and boys at the very local levels.\n\nI have over 25 years experience in grass roots action and in development & research in predominantly rural, agricultural and forest contexts focusing on adult & stakeholder social learning and adaptive collaborative management and governance. Since more recently, I have put my efforts in contexts of resilient and equitable food systems, the SDGs, climate change, youth inter-generational learning, and Greater Jakarta flooding.\n\nI have been engaged with international NGOs (Plan International, Save the Children US), CGIAR (ICRAF and CIFOR) and started in 2013 my consultancy providing services to e.g. FAO-RAP, RECOFTC, Samdhana Institute, EUROTAFE, and the Indonesian Embassy in The Hague. I've partnered with IDN, IPB, KRKP, WUR, RCCC-UI, Indonesian Min. of Environment & Forestry, Indonesian resp. Dutch Climate Envoys, INYS, NJR, SDSN Youth, Energy Academy Indonesia, SDSN Indonesia/SEA & Youth, PPI, Plennid Rotterdam, WRI Indonesia, La Galigo, UU, TUD, and Technotrend.\n\nMy experience is in (multi-country) project management, institutional development, NGO network coordination, (participatory action) research, stakeholder & youth workshops, conference moderation, and (multilateral) grant management with as outcomes workshops, webinars, manuals, policy briefs, newsletters, reports, proposals & (semi) scientific writings. \n\nI have been involved in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and the Netherlands; reached out to Cameroon, China, India, South-Africa, and US., and work-visited Bangladesh, Kenya, Nepal, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me at yanti@tykusumanto.nl or by dropping me a LinkedIn message.",

We researched the preconditions, strategies and outcomes of fostering collaboration among stakeholders in a complex and uncertain social and natural environment. The research focused on creating opportunities for shared learning through participatory action research (PAR) carried out by the stakeholders, facilitated by our team. The PAR was focused on the attainment of village forest rights and customary rights. It considered women as an explicit stakeholder group. Along the way and in a learning-by-doing mode, we developed stakeholder facilitation methods, tools, and how-to guides. As Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) monitoring & evaluation tool we used CIFOR's SFM Criteria & Indicators. As necessary, I coached CIFOR and NGO partner field staff. Besides, as part of a global research group on Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) I contributed with aspects of stakeholder collaboration and adaptive management. I wrote implementation manuals, progress and scientific reports, and (scientific) publications. I was based at Headquarters (Bogor) and the Jambi research site (Central Sumatra).",
