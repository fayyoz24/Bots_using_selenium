In addition, three of the world\u2019s five busiest airports are in Asia.  \n\nWe are interested to explore how two different airline companies are competing for the growing market share in Asia, given the industries inhospitable treatment to new entrants.   The airline industry is certainly inhospitable to new entrants and airlines without considerable focus on cash flow.  ",

With help of the global survey we could compare the perception between the different countries.\n\nThe reason we choose Apple: Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world with the best brand value, largest market cap, significant sales profits and assets among the technology companies. The iPhone played a big part in the success of Apple since its launch in 2007.\n\n",
