It covered how and to what extent emoticons and emojis affect accuracy of classification in different subject areas and how the different tools perform against each other. The contents included:\n\n\u2022\tA parameterised web application to create test sets taken from the live Twitter stream (with or without emoticons and emojis), to test them against different sentiment analysis web services and present the results. \n\u2022\tA survey design and twelve test sets of sample Twitter data labelled by anonymous volunteers that were used to demonstrate how the tools compared.\n\n    Distinct differences were found in how the web services used emoticons and emojis in assigning a positive or negative sentiment value to a tweet, with some services seeming to ignore their presence. Among other findings, it was discovered that web services classified polarity sensitive tweets significantly less accurately than tweets where the sentiment of the emoji/emoticon supported the sentiment of the text.\n\n    The web application was implemented as a three-layer architecture, written using CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript (with libraries JQuery and Chartjs) and PHP. The user interface was based on the Bootstrap framework. \n",
