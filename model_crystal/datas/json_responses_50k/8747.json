An international network of several hundred sensors sends gigabytes of data each day to Vienna. \n\nI was project manager and software engineer on several seismoacoustic data processing software projects. In this role I developed software, managed private contractors in Austria and South Korea, wrote contractor Terms of Reference (TORs) and performed bid evaluation. I supervised activities and ensured tasks were completed efficiently, in accordance with priorities, to deadline and within quality criteria. I provided project management and technical guidance to other less-experienced project managers. \n\nCTBTO was a relatively new organisation when I joined with immature processes. I initiated a more formal approach and developed documentation templates and development processes based on ISO and industry standards.",
