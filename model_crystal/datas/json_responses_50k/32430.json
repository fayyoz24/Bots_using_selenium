    "summary": "Having over 20 years of experience in Migrations & Centralizations as well as Change Management, Outsourcing and System Implementation, from contract to SLA development and implementation and compliance. I come from a finance operational background, and learned my trade the hard way by working on all levels of the Finance operational ladder on both a BPO and Business side which had given me a wealth of knowledge on people management, leading teams and installing harmony and efficiency within a time of change and restructure. I like to work on a very personal level with all concerned, and being able to relate on all levels as well as my international upbringing and live I have a strong understanding of culture, attitudes and people within these transitions. My knowledge in system, process, compliance as well as my operational experience brings, I have been told, a different dimension to my Analytics as I believe all change, process structure and system. I am very comfortable in the role of driving the change and like to motivate, team build by sharing my knowledge creating trust and an efficient work flow within. Achieving this gives me personally great satisfaction in the work that I do.",
