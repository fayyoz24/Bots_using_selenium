The focus here is to be the backbone of the department and support the advisors on several problems that they have, and also make sure that all the necessary secretarial duties are done. One of the prime tasks I have done was the event management of a course called \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d which was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After the arrangements were done I was privileged to work alongside the advisors in Ethiopia and play both a communicational and secretarial role.\n\nThe second part is a marketing communication role in the main building of KIT, I was part of the process to create new communication materials e.g. brochures, one pagers and posters.  Being part of the communication team we developed a new website from the ground up and update the current website both intranet and internet using CMS. Other tasks I have are to publish publications, make news messages, preparing/coordinating events and monitor all communication towards our Corporate Communication department.",
