This journey gives them the means to be free to make heartwarming connections with our guests. This is the HEARTIST journey: HEART + ARTIST. It is centered around the passion and uniqueness of each person, and the idea that building a great employee experience is necessary to build great guest experience and boost results. \n\nAfter this, I started working on the Transformation of Learning at Accor. The aim is that learning becomes a way of life. We designed and gave them the tools to transform and learn - where all 250000 employees could grow. \n\nWithin more than 35 brands of Accor, the HEARTIST journey gives us a shared identity, principles and values on how we deliver our guest experiences while keeping the uniqueness of each brand intact.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, more than 2000 of our hotels across 5 continents already implemented the HEARTIST journey.",
