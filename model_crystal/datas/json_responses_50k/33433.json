    "summary": "Hi, my name is Ariel Gaston Gener, I was born and raised in Argentina. After high school, I had a dream to be part of the IDF.\u00a0 But I decided to start my degree and then come to Israel. I stopped\u00a0in the middle of my degree because something inside of me told me that now is the time. ( I finished it remotely from Israel). Therefore, I did aliyah\u00a0to Israel in February 2013 to Maagan Michael, a kibbutz\u00a0in the north of the country. I spent there 5 months, and then I enrolled in the army.\u00a0 After my service,\u00a0I was convinced that Israel is my place in the world. I studied in different places and meet different people. Today, almost 10 years ago after my aliyah, I'm really glad about my decision. I'm going to get married\u00a0in a few months and I live in a good city, Hod Hasharon. I speak three languages almost\u00a0every day. Hebrew in college or with Israeli friends, Spanish with my family in Argentina, and English with some friends that I made in Amsterdam, after nine months when\u00a0I did an exchange student a month ago. It was a beautiful experience I learned there a lot, and\u00a0today I'm here again in Israel with a focus to stay and building something strong as a good own family and maybe my own business too. I'm looking\u00a0for a good job, where I could grow up and achieve the company's goals.",
