    "summary": "People describe me as enthusiastic and efficient. In February 2020, I graduated for a Master of Science in International Management. During my studies, I have always been working, which has resulted in experience in various industries. I like to keep myself busy with organising and pushing myself to do this as efficient as possible. I am able to work independently, however I also like to be part of a team to create team spirit and achieve goals together. I like to learn new skills and develop the ones that I already possess to help myself and/or a team grow to the next level.",
