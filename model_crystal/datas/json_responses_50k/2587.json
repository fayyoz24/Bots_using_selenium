    "summary": "As a business consultant, I help companies to translate their business strategy into effective implementation.  Using tools for process optimization and redesign, I help companies throughout the entire change process by defining the case for change, indicating the goals on the basis of the business strategy, mapping current processes and designing new or improved processes. I can also assist with the development of a business case and coaching during the implementation. Techniques such as Six Sigma, Business Performance Improvement and Lean management workshops are utilized. As a result, throughput time is reduced (up to 75%), efficiency is increased (up to 50%) and a higher customer satisfaction is achieved. In addition, an increased sustainability level or better employee satisfaction can be realized.\n\nI like to challenge management and operations to reconsider what they perceive to be obvious. While changing the processes, the main challenge is to always bear in mind the entire system, think about the consequences for IT, relations with other processes and organization culture.\n\nYou can contact me about the following subjects\n- Six Sigma\n- Lean management\n- Operational Excellence and Continuous Improvement\n- Business Process Improvement and Redesign\n- Lean in strategic partnerships\n- Scenario Planning\n- Innovation\n- Sustainability",
