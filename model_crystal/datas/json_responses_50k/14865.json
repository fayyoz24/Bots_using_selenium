My research looked into which estate facilities and type of customers should be located to boost revenue and growth in the harbour. The Strategy plan described how to attract new businesses in the port area of HoogTij. This project involved a multiple million Euro investment since 2015. Now a unique plug and play warehouse concept is realized including a port-side and seaport wharf next to the North Sea Channel. \n\nThis was my first major project in a consulting role. Being in the middle of many people and organizations was fun & challenging. \n\nThe Port of Amsterdam is Western Europe\u2019s fourth largest port and plays a large role in the transshipment and processing of energy products",
