After gaining the approval and budget from CEO and top managers, together with Sabrina and Irene, we organized 5 events (from november15 to may16) on 5 relevant topics for working women (leadership, networking, courage, multitasking, femininity) in which 5 successful women* talk about their personal experience. The objective of the project is to inspire but also to train. During the events we engage with a coach that helps absorb key concepts passed by the speakers and apply them to everyday situations. We use the concept of a tree to guide us: the roots (input) are the 5 events and the leaves (output) grow based on the use we make of the lessons learned. In parallel to the 5 events we are conducting a scientific study with the company's therapist to understand the effects of the project on a selected samole of participants through self-evalutation tests. The objective is to find meaningful evidence of the benefits of the project and present them at the next TEDxMilanoWomen conference.\n\n*Speakers: Maria Letizia Mariani - Head of Philips Lighting Europe, Chiara Bisconti - Council member of Milan municipality responsible for Quality of Life, Novella Calligaris - first italian swimmer to win Olympic medal, Raffaella Visigalli - psychologist and psychotherapist of DYMA, Claudia Parzani - president of Valore D (biggest italian network supporting female leadership).",

The concept of serious games is to apply game dynamics to educational or training programs. For example, serious games simulate real-life situations to train nurses and firefighters in cases of emergency. My activity was to research on state-of-the-art technology of serious games applied to smart cities for the participation in the EU Smart Society Project (link below). Also, I worked with the developer team on an idea for a serious game applied to smart cities in order to write a consistent business plan.",
