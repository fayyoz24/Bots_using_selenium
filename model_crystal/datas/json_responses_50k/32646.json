    "summary": "As a kid, I have tried more sports than my parents could keep track off, while as a student not a year went by without being part of a committee or board. Having an educational background in Chemical Engineering, Political Philosophy and Industrial Engineering, next to my own company in web- motion- and graphic design, I feel comfortable in saying that I am passionately curious and easy to motivate. I'm a generalist.\nHowever, having studied in Spain and worked for nearly a year in India and Indonesia at the age of 25, I do not like to stay in my comfort zone and rather broaden my horizon. I'm an adventurer.\nWhile I was in a cast for some months after an accident, I taught myself how to develop websites from coding basics. I started my own company to develop websites for a.o. TU Delft and managed the online presence and performance of an Indonesian startup. I have been described as goal-oriented and determined. I'm an entrepreneur.\n\nCurrently, I am a trainee at an impact investment fund, where I gain firsthand experience in project finance, VC, M&A and crowd funding as a means to a positive impact on people and planet next to competitive financial returns. \n\nIn the long run, my goal is to combine my study background, my professional experience and my traits to provide a contribution to the energy transition.\n\nDo you find my profile interesting? Please don't hesitate to send me a message.",

The main focus of this paper is to suppress the polysulfide shuttle by inspecting the charge- and discharge behaviour, as well as the specific capacity and cycle life duration of the room-temperature sodium sulfur battery with the application of various cathode compositions, electrolytes and -additives. This is done by constructing sodium sulfur batteries with carbonate based- and ether based electrolytes, phosphorus pentasulfide based electrolyte-additives and different carbon hosts for the sulfur cathode. The use of carbonate based electrolytes resulted\nin a charge- and discharge behavior of a primary battery, while the use of ether based electrolytes resulted in properly cycling batteries. The use of the electrolyte additives reduced the shuttling effect by forming an SEI, and caused a shift in the charge- and discharge voltage plateaus.\nGraphene applied as the carbon host had a better affinity with the formed soluble (high order-) polysulfides, and thus reduced the shuttling effect further, leading to better coulombic efficiencies and a better cycle life duration. Using the optimized battery composition, the shuttling effect has been reduced to nearly 40%.\n\nResearch group: Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage, TU Delft\n\nGrade: 8,5 / 10",
