    "summary": "This MSc. Chemical Engineering graduate wants to relive her childhood memories in a professional matter for society\u2019s greater good. From a very young age, I was always curious about my noticeable surroundings and the world, and often wanted to challenge my own ideas as well as others\u2019. Having no idea what chemistry was then, I always examined ingredient lists of the food that I was eating at that moment, and played with mom\u2019s skin care and make up products by mixing them and ultimately testing these new formulations on myself. To reenact these recollections, I want to be a researcher, an innovator, a chemist, with the goal to help boost the well-being of others by contributing to the development of FMCG products, with preference to the cosmetics industry.\n\nMy internship experiences at TNO, The Netherlands, and UNHAS, Indonesia, as well as my MSc. thesis at TU Delft have taught me some of the most important skills that are essential as a researcher, such as being critical, analytical and a creative problem-solver. Additionally, I have worked on my management, leadership and marketing skills by partaking in various (student) organizations in TU Delft, such as being an event organizer with PPI Delft (Indonesian student association) and a board member of MSA \u2018Ibn Firnas\u2019 (Islamic student association) as the secretary and the head of PR. I have further implemented these new skills to set up my own business \u2018Eazy Straps\u2019 where I sell extension straps to make wearing masks easier and more comfortable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, my multicultural and international upbringing empowers me to work in a dynamic and diverse environment, both independently and within a team.\n\nFrom all these different learning experiences, I dare myself now to take on the next challenge: To use all what I have learned so far in the professional world. As said before, I want to contribute to the greater good of society\u2019s basic essentials by formulating, developing and producing consumer goods. As my passion lies in the cosmetics industry, I, therefore, wish to get a job as a cosmetic scientist.\n\nContact me by sliding into my Linkedin DM, or mail me at munifa_amira@hotmail.com.\n\nPS: Call me by my 2nd name Amira, please! \ud83d\ude0a",

This cycle exist because of the little know-how in using the local resources efficiently and economically, which made us initiate this project aiming to produce dental impression material from local Indonesian algae. In collaboration with 11 local dentistry students following individual research themes, my research focused on the whole processing line from raw material (the seaweed) to end product (the dental impression material).\n\nWhile data from the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) revealed successful extraction of alginate from local Sargassum algae, qualitative tests indicated that the extracted yield was insufficient to produce proper dental impression material due to limited access to several chemicals and experimental equipment within the limited time-frame. From this, I learned that patience, creativity and critical analytical skills are important qualities in research as I had to attempt different approaches using finite resources in the most efficient manner, ultimately leaving a strong foundation for the following researchers to successfully create dental impression material from the same seaweed.",

To find the most industrial-feasible process for recycling CO2 into fine chemicals, several routes were investigated, including my internship project on the electrochemical method to produce intermediate products, i.e. ethylene, utilizing a catalyst electrode and only water and CO2 as input materials.\n\nWhile the initial 6 results showed no expected (by-) products in the Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis, increasing the voltage for the 7th and final trial resulted in a clear expected byproduct of 0.74 Vol%. Despite the large presence of CO2 and the absence of ethylene in this sample after operating the experiment continuously for 10 days, the presence of the expected by-product indicated the success of the experimental set-up, which resulted in at least 12 publications and has also contributed to further scientific advances involving CO2 capture.",
