    "summary": "Throughout my career I have overseen hospitality organizations in the position of general manager/ director and founder. I have worked in several leading hotel chains as Holiday Inn, Crest Hotels, Bilderberg Hotels, Queens Moat houses and Best Western Hotels. I have had the chance to develop the hotels and invest in them, which gave way to my creative talents. The hotel business has no secrets for me anymore but still fascinates me. \nA wonderful turn in my career has been the moment I was asked to take on a house for sheltering homeless youngsters. It was supposed to be an interim job but became one for 20 years. Based on true hospitality I have been able to build an organization with shelters in Rotterdam and Utrecht hosting average over 100 boys and girls aged 18-22 and helping several thousands of them towards a positive future. The concept consisted of 5 B\u2019s: \u2018Bed, Bad, Brood, Begeleiding, Buitenzorg\u2019 and was put into practice by a dedicated team of professionals. \n\nThe success was not unnoticed and resulted in the assignment by housing corporations in Rotterdam and Eindhoven to come up with a facility for the older homeless citizens of the two municipalities. For that I developed the \u2018Home and Art Hotels\u2019. The homeless could stay in fully furnished \u2018Home\u2019 apartments for a maximum of six months and paid a rent based on their minimum income. This caused a social loss, which was compensated by the commercial profit of the Art hotel operation. Both hotels from scratch were co-designed, developed, operated, and managed by me. In all of this it was the human factor that played the key organizational role. \nDedicated talents of all organizations formed a great emotional factory for producing happiness for others. I am proud to have been able to empower and lead them. The teams were able to help thousands of homeless citizens of Rotterdam and Eindhoven.",

The entrepreneur receives the honorary title because he has been working for the homeless youth for years.\n\nIn the Woonhotel Rotterdam (106 rooms), Rotterdammers without a home will find a temporary home to get their lives back on track. They receive professional hospitality at four-star level, just like the guests of the nearby Art Hotel (104 rooms).  Each guest goes through the same door, has the same reception service and uses the same elevators. The shortages in the operation of the Woonhotel are compensated by Rol's business company. There is no government subsidy involved.  Rol also operates Pension Maaszicht in Rotterdam and Pension Singelzicht in Utrecht. These guesthouses form a 'parental' home for the stray youngsters. By welcoming them and service-oriented, the young people feel valued again. In the Rotterdam restaurant Millers, the young people receive an extensive education and training program.  'Being socially active for people in this way and at the same time doing business in hospitality has given me enormous satisfaction', says Rol. The Hotellotop in Maastricht that was held on Wednesday was visited by more than 500 visitors. It is the largest networking event in the Netherlands for graduates of Hotel Schools",
