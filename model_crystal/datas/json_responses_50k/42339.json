    "summary": "Being trained as both a theatre teacher and a performer, I'm combining my love for people with my love for art. Multidisciplinary skilled, I use dance, physical theatre, mask theatre and vocal work to connect with people who don't get access to the arts that easily. Groups I've worked with are older people, teenagers, children and disabled people. \n\nWorking as a performer as well as teaching and creating or directing enables me to view projects and problems within them from many perspectives.\n\nMy main goal in every project is to help the participants or the audience discover the richness of creativity that's inside each of us. I strongly believe our creativity can give us the wings we are longing for in order to fly anywhere we want to go...\n\nSpecialties: Instant Composition (dance and vocals), Contact Improvisation, Mask theatre, improvisation in general, leading creative processes within groups.",
