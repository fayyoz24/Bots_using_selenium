    "summary": "Senior ethics and compliance manager with over a decade of experience in diverse culture environments. Over two decades of experience in governance. Before moving into compliance, I held a number of roles in finance and strategy.\n\nMy passion is supporting organisations creating an ethical culture and implementing compliance frameworks. In this, I combine my experience with my personal interest in ethical issues. My colleagues refer to me as a team player, pragmatic and someone who gets things done. Strengths: strong stakeholder management and able to shape the agenda, a drive to realise change, strong analytical skills and combining the strategic lens with attention for details.\n\nAway from work, I like to spend time with the family. I am on the supervisory board of the \u201cLenten Campaign\u201d (\u201cVastenactie\u201d), an NGO raising funds to support individuals and communities in other countries developing themselves. This is an activity that really energises me.",
