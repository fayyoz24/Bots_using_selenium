For millennia, cultural property has been\nconsidered an acceptable target by invading forces dating back to the early\ndays of civilization. However, the growing presence of the Islamic State (ISIS)\nin Iraq and Syria marks the beginning of a movement referred to as \u201ccultural\ncleansing\u201d. Cultural cleansing is defined as the persecution of people on the\nbasis of their ethnicity or religion, by destroying their monuments, their\ntemples, depriving them of their intangible heritage, attacking their identities\nand eradicating their collective cultural memory by reducing it to the level of\noral tradition. This thesis will discuss the legal development of international\ncustomary law on cultural property, the threats the Islamic State poses to\ncultural property, and which new strategies can be employed to maximize the\neffective protection of cultural property in ISIS territory.",

According to the 2016 Women for Media Report published by the Women\u2019s Leadership Institute Australia, the largest disparity of the use of male vs. female experts in Australian news stories are in foreign affairs, business and finance, where men make up almost nine out of ten expert contributors.  Despite the many media campaigns calling for more equal representation over the past few years, these figures haven\u2019t noticeably shifted in nearly a decade. \n\nTo combat this issue, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) launched a project in January of 2019 with the aim to integrate more female experts on their television news broadcast and create more gender and diversity orientated content for their online platform.",

We serve women in 8 countries offering support, tools, and access to life-changing skills to move from crisis and poverty to stability and economic self-sufficiency.\n\nWe bring women together in a safe space to learn life, business, and vocational skills.  Once enrolled, each receives a monthly stipend \u2013 a vital support that enables her to participate.\n\nWomen increase their ability to earn an income with new skills that are in-demand. They learn about their legal rights, and they become knowledgeable about health and nutrition. The result: stronger women, stronger families, and stronger communities. This ripple effect is profound.\n\nWomen for Women International delivers our programs through the generous support of individual, corporate and foundation donors, partners, and governments. Our work is regularly featured in international media, including BBC, CNN, MSNBC, The Guardian, The New York Times, 60 Minutes, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Recognized for our global impact Women for Women International was honored with the prestigious Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize in 2006, and receives favorable ratings from independent charity groups.",
