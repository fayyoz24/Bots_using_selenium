    "summary": "My passion for study abroad started by more than 10 years ago when going abroad to Mongolia. Nowadays, I really enjoy seeing how students grow and develop them selves when being abroad.\n\nAll started with following my dream, backpacking in Australia and New Zealand when I was 20 years old. After seeing four different continents and being back in the Netherlands, with a backpack full of new experiences, I decided to start a study in which my hobbies of travelling and events where combined. In 2007, I successfully completed the Bachelor Tourism & Event management which focussed on different aspects of tourism and events\nEver since I truly enjoy working in an international environment and learning from other cultures to make use of other best practices. The best learning experiences are still studying abroad in Mongolia and living abroad in Madrid as it made me grow in many different ways, but it also make it easier for me to understand people from abroad when they come to the Netherlands to either study or work.\n\n\nSpecialties: Programme Coordination - Event Support - Contract Negotiation \u2013 Flexible -  Accurate - Positive mentality - Open minded \n\nKim Willems\nTEL: +31-650524619",
