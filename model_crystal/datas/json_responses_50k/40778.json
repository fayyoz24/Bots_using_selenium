    "summary": "I was a self-proclaimed \u201cGolden Retriever\u201d. At first, the catch-all title was meant to simplify and justify the multitude of roles I filled: engineer, business analyst, writer, coder, advisor, and educator. Just one word, encompassing my many interests. It also captured the essence of what I deeply enjoy \u2013 following my curiosity. Changing minds. Empowering people. \n \nMy career path came about serendipitously. I started studying Applied Physics because I dreamed of designing the technologies of the future. Even though I am still enthusiastic about physics to this day, I discovered another passion: Business and Entrepreneurship. Blending both into a double degree, I learned to look at the current business environment with much more understanding and from a very di\ufb00erent perspective. It made me aware of the complex logistics of operating a business and would eventually assist me in bridging the gap between business and engineering, which is my ultimate passion. But that\u2019s only half of the story. \n \nThe other half reveals: a basic nerd. Ever since I was young, I have tried to understand the underlying principles of technologies and made a hobby of experimenting with them. This sense of curiosity and exploration instilled a love for lifelong learning. In fact, I developed such a deep love of learning during academics that my long-term dream is to become a part-time lecturer. This dream now manifests into a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship, for business and strategy, and for leadership and psychology. In particular, a desire to assist the new generation of start-ups, businesses, and technologies and to foster a love and culture of responsible innovation. \n \nWalking the halls of Stanford, I wondered how I could ever fit all my passions into a single profession. Today, I no longer feel the need to simplify my identity or describe myself with one word. Personally, the time for career linearity is over - I now make it my life mission to keep growing and try out different shoes until I find a combination that fits just right. \n \nIf you want to chat about start-ups, business strategies, or technology & entrepreneurship in Amsterdam or Silicon Valley, please reach out!",
