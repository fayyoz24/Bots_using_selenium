Simulations were performed on a two dimensional model of stator using commercially available CFD software FLUENT. Appropriate choices of numerical schemes to be used in computations were made based on literature survey and understanding of physics underlying the flow regimes. Effects of non-ideality, compressibility of the working fluid were taken into account in turbulent regime. Initially air is used as the working fluid, when satisfactory flow characteristics were obtained, use of R245fa as the working fluid was attempted. The flow performance was measured in terms of changes in velocity, pressure, temperature across inlet and outlet sections. Regions of flow separation were analyzed.",

Literature study on existing correlations to model the thermo-hydrodynamic performance.\n\n2. Developing a validated code to predict Equilibrium mass flow, pressure drops, exit flow quality and two-phase heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator section applicable to wide range of working fluids and geometric/boundary conditions.\n\n3. Analyzing the effect of porous nanoparticle deposition on thermal performance of evaporator by a unified correlation incorporating the effects of surface wettability and Active Nucleation Site Density. \n\n4. Based on this, recommendations for nanoparticles have been made with respect to average surface roughness of evaporator and nature of wettability.",
