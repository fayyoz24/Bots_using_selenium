    "summary": "I\u2019ve been working with or on software, gadgets and everything else I can tinker with since I was a teenager. To me, tinkering means continuously challenging and improving the status quo. I believe I get better at it by exploring both engineering (action) and management (words). I also love to inspire people to do the same.\n\nMy career is the best witness to that: I\u2019m now a proven all-rounder with extensive experience in technical product & project management, consultancy, but most of all software and systems engineering and architecture.",
