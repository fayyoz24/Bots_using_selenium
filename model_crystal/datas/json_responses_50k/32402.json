    "summary": "I am a Masters graduate with a background in Mechanical Engineering, Automotive Engineering and Control Systems. I enjoy problem solving and am able to learn and grasp concepts quickly that enables me to adapt to fast-paced environments. Moreover, I am capable of working independently while I also enjoy communicating and collaborating with like-minded individuals in a dynamic and multi-cultural team environment. I wish to bring my knowledge and experience gained through academics, extra-curricular activities and internships on to the table in order to realize the goal of sustainable and smart mobility.\n\nMy Masters program in Automotive Technology at TU Eindhoven as part of the Control Systems Technology Research Group was largely focused on Control Engineering, Optimization, Optimal Control, Systems Engineering & Modelling, Simulation and Control for Electric Vehicles (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles(HEV) Powertrain. \n\nIn my second year in the Netherlands, I had the opportunity to complete my Internship and Master Thesis as a Research Intern at TNO Automotive at the Automotive Campus in Helmond, Netherlands. I developed a system level optimization framework using MATLAB and Simulink in order to determine the optimal size of the various powertrain components (EM, Battery, Transmission) for an N1 category Electric Vehicle (EV).\n \nMy Master Thesis focused on Battery Thermal and Energy Management using a Learning-based using Reinforcement Learning with the aim of controlling the active thermal management system for a Li-ion Battery by minimizing the capacity loss of the battery due to temperature with minimal energy consumption. \n\nApart from academics and internships, I have an experience of 2.5 years in Formula Student (FSAE). I had the opportunity to design and manufacture Formula style Racecars along with talented and dedicated engineers and competed at University Level Formula Student Design Competitions in India and Germany.\n\nTechnical Skills \ud83d\udcbb: MATLAB & Simulink, Python (Basic), C++ (Basic), Solidworks, Star CCM+, Siemens NX , MS Office, Siemens TIA Portal\n\nVersion Control: JIRA, Sourcetree, Bitbucket, Git",
