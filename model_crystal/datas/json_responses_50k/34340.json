That Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, tongue, gender or religion are ready to work hard and are able and willing to fend for themselves giving the right opportunities and enabling environment.\n\nWe were able to communicate the oneness in spirit of the nation and the benefit of working in unity, peace and harmony. Kaduna becomes the launch pad for healing a nation in dire need of a common national identity.\n\n\n"
