    "summary": "Hi! My name is Lamia, I am a Software Engineer, currently working as a Full-Stack Developer at Lenox Park Solutions, a FinTech company that services the Asset Management Industry. I have done my bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nI gained knowledge in Laravel, Vue.js, and Docker working alongside senior colleagues in my current role. I have also worked with C#, vanilla Javascript, and HTML in my previous job as a Software Developer.\n\nFrom my childhood, I loved math, and solving puzzles, and have developed analytical skills to solve logical problems, which were the main reasons why I opted for a career in software Engineering. During my university, I participated in various programming contests and math Olympics where I achieved great results.\n\nI have the capability and experience to work in remote pair-programming using GitHub,industry-standard git-flow, and daily standups to communicate and collaborate with international remote developers.\n\nGet in touch with me: \n+31617936991\nlamiasristy@gmail.com",
