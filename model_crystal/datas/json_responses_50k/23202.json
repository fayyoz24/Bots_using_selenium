    "summary": "An architect by profession, a researcher by practice and an aspiring urbanist. I am passionate about reading cities in several ways rather than one. Cities are intermingled contrasting networks of social and asocial, political and apolitical advocacies, direct and absurd, rigour and negligence and natural and interfered geographies.\n\nMy professional experiences include studying and working in different landscapes of towns and cities through the worm's eye view of interior layouts, objects and buildings and a bird's eye view of a planner. \n\nI love learning from brilliant minds about their perception of 'the city' and observing brilliant people on their ways of navigating 'the city'.",
