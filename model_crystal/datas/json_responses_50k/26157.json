After completing the general course at Hochiminh City University of Technology within Programme de Formation d'Ing\u00e9nieurs d'Excellence au Vietnam (PFIEV), a program in cooperation between Vietnam and France for training high-quality engineers, he continued the specialized course within the same PFIEV program and obtained the B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hanoi University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2004. \nHe received the M.Sc. degree in Advanced Materials Science and Engineering from SungKyunKwan University, South of Korea, in 2007. \nSince September 2007, he has started his four-year doctorate research at the Integrated Optical MicroSystems group, MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, the Netherlands. \nDuring his doctoral study, he won two Best Poster Awards at the 13th Annual Symposium of the IEEE/LEOS Benelux Chapter, Enschede \u2013 the Netherlands in 2008, and the Annual Workshop on Semiconductor Advances for Future Electronics and Sensors (SAFE), Veldhoven \u2013 the Netherlands in 2009, respectively. He also won a Marie-Curie scholarship for a two-week summer school on \u201cHighlights in Microtechnology\u201d organized by F.S.R.M., Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland in June 2008. The work of his PhD project has been producing 4 journal papers: two of them published in Photonics Technology Letters and Optics Letters, one submitted and one to be submitted. His PhD dissertation entitled \u201cIntegrated Optical Sensors utilizing Slow-light Propagation in Grated-waveguide Cavities\u201d has publicly been defended and approved by an international Graduation Committee organized by the University of Twente on the 1st of June 2012. \nSince October 2011, he has started working for ASML, one of the world's leading providers of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.",
