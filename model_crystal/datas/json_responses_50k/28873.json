    "summary": "As a global finance executive, I have strong and broad experience driving business value, transforming finance organisations, growing people and building teams.\n\nI have a proven track record with complex, blue-chip, multi-national corporations in the Logistics Services (Supply Chain Management), Logistics Infrastructure, Manufacturing and FMCG sectors. \n\nWith a structured and analytical approach, I quickly clarify complex issues, identify root causes and bring focus, prioritization, action and results. As Regional CFO, I combine my strong technical foundation in reporting, control and acquisition integration, with planning and analysis experience as global head of FP&A to lead the finance functions across EMEA.\n\nAs a strategic business partner, I work closely with regional CEOs and management teams in sales, operations, and procurement to drive growth, margins and cash flow. My ability to combine a strategic outlook with hands-on execution has contributed to successful business turnarounds, and delivered top-line growth whilst improving results through cost controls and restructuring. I\u2019ve driven improved productivity and margins by close collaboration with operational management and sales/commercial functions, as well as directing $100M+ working capital improvement programmes.\n\nI have driven finance transformation by offshoring, centralisation and standardisation of processes, and the development of value-added business-partnering.  By redesigning and improving the reporting and internal control processes, I ensured reliable, on-time and quality deliverables within a no-surprises culture.\n\nI have a strong track record of people development, having built and motivated large direct and indirect distributed teams across Europe and Asia, including a shared service centre. I rate my own success as a manager on the development of my direct reports; I\u2019m proud to see many former reports now operating as CFOs and finance directors.",
