    "summary": "Nicole Uniquole is the driving force behind Uniquole. With an extensive, international network Uniquole merges the worlds of design and business and in doing so opens up new possibilities for both. She has made a name for herself in recent years as curator and international independent exhibition creator. As art director she also stands on the cutting edge of historic and contemporary dutch design. She offers strategic advice to businesses, governmental institutions and museums on branding and collection policy. She is the founder of Masterly the Dutch Pavilion in Milan and Masterly The Hague.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n> HEDY D'ANCONA, FORMER MINISTER OF WELFARE, HEALTH AND CULTURE:\n'I met her as president of Via Milano. She was the inspiring project leader. Back then i was already impressed by her discernment, her vision, her strive for perfection and her organisational talent. Through the years i have followed her with increasing admiration. Annually, i would discuss all her upcoming projects or those she hoped to realise soon. Nicole also has great social skills; she always surrounds herself with exactly the right people. I have also deepened my own discernment, as i learned to look through Nicole\u2019s eyes at the essence of her passion.\u2019\n\n> DR. WOLFGANG SAVELSBERG, HEAD DEPARTMENT OF PALACES ORANIENBAUM: \n\u2018Thinking of Nicole Uniquole brings back the best memories. In 2012 she developed what was undoubtedly the most exciting and successful exhibition for the Kulturstiftung Dessau-W\u00f6rlitz: \u201cDutch Design,\u201d Huis van Oranje \u2013 excellent handcraft at the court \u201c. Her fascinating concept was based on the previously rich interior design of the palace built by princess Henriette Catharina van Oranje -Nassau. Each component was absolutely done justice, in the reliable and capable hands of Nicole Uniquole.'\n\n> JOOST FLAMAND, DUTCH AMBASSADOR IN ITALY:\n'Nicole Uniquole plays a unique role in the internationalisation of designers from the netherlands. In 2019, immediately on arrival in Italy, i had the pleasure of meeting Nicole in Milan. This was in relation to Masterly, the design presentation where dozens of designers, creators and artists are given a place during the most important international design week, under Nicole\u2019s expert guidance. Masterly draws thousands of visitors and her selection comes highly recommended by all trade publications. Nicole Uniquole represents a talent for organisation, passion for quality and an eye for detail. Not to mention resilience and persistence, as i have been able to experience during the recent covid-pandemic. Forza Nicole!'\n\n\n\n\n",
