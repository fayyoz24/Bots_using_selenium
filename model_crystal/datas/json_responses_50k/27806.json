    "summary": "I exist to understand how different systems (human bodies and brains, economies, companies, countries, information systems, platforms\u2026and my mind) work, where they connect and how they affect each other.  \n\nI love to share and flesh out these thoughts with people across the globe, whether it\u2019s within companies I founded or other organizations, to try and solve difficult problems, like:  \"How do we improve human health and prevent disease?\u201d and \"How do we build sustainable technology platforms that grow exponentially?\"  \n\nTo this end, I partook in about 50 flights (unfortunately not interstellar\u2026yet), 100 Uber rides, 20 Airbnb stays (and way too many hotel rooms) over the last 9 months.  I continuously seek out new wholesome and mind expanding experiences. I wish I had more patience, was a better listener and had time to write.  I love to journey with other futurists, philanthropists, technologists, scientists, entrepreneurs, executives and loved ones towards a common goal.  I somehow managed to obtain a PhD in Biochemistry, focusing on Computational Systems Biology.  Probably because of my passion for this field and for the fact that I had a difficult problem to solve.  \n\nHaving lost my eye during my first year of life due to retinoblastoma, I've developed a keen appreciation for the powerful solutions that can be found in the combination of science and technology and this is also where I focus my professional pursuits!\n\nI've started three technology businesses in health/healthcare/wellness - HealthQ Technologies, LifeQ and Vertica Health - and I have successfully helped to raise funds in all three businesses.\n\nI understand the challenges faced in corporate environments, and I like to work with people within large organizations to find paths towards achieving incremental success towards satisfying business needs without introducing unnecessary risk.  It's always great to be focused towards showing measurable outcomes and to work towards ensuring projects can achieve this goal!",
