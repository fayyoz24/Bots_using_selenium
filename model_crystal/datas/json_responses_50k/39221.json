    "summary": "Shortly after I started studying computer science, I started working at Fuijtsu. It was a great place to develop my skills and learn how the IT world works. At the beginning I wanted to develop myself as a full stack developer to have more comprehensive knowledge about process of creating apps. Later on I acknowledge that frontend is my thing. Starting from that moment I decided to focus on React.js. I was working with this library since 2018 and thanks to that I have deep knowledge of it. After completing my engineering degree, I moved to Wroclaw to find more exciting challenges. There I had opportunity to work in projects where I had a chance to be the leading developer. During this time, I also completed a master's degree. Now I decided that it's a good moment for me to move forward and move abroad. I want to be a part of demanding and exciting projects. Thanks to my experience and knowledge I'm also ready to be a leading person that can help and teach others. Moreover I like challenges because I strongly believe that facing them leads to self-development.",
