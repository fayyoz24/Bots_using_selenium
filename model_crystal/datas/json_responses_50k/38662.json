More specifically, I helped set up a CRISPR-SAM activation technique in the laboratory, which can be used to endogenously overexpress long non-coding RNAs that are implicated in the developmental stages of oligoendrocytes. \nResults were presented in the form of both an oral and poster presentation, at the Amgen Scholars Conference in Karolinksa Institutet and at the Amgen Scholars Symposium in University of Cambridge, respectively.",
