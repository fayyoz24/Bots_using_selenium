    "summary": "As a highly motivated and goal-driven professional, I have a background in computer science, engineering, business growth, sustainability and entrepreneurship. I am currently transitioning into software development, specifically into Front-end development. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & React, I have a proven ability to quickly learn new technologies and programming languages.\n\nIn addition to my technical skills, I excel at driving growth and building partnerships through excellent communication and project management skills. My experience includes founding and leading refill.life, a social venture fighting the single-use plastics packaging crisis generated during the consumption of lifestyle products.\n\nI pursued my Master's in Sustainable Development at Utrecht University, The Netherlands, which is currently on pause. I have previously worked at udaan, an Amazon-like B2B marketplace for businesses. There, I built partnerships with Hotel & Restaurant outlets, leading and supervising a team of Business Development Executives.\n\nI hold a Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering and a Master's in Business Administration from Gautam Buddha University, India. My diverse background and passion for sustainable development make me a valuable asset to any team.",
