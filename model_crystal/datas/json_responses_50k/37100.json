A knowledge base of multimodal data (health records, clinical studies and real-world data) together with predictive modelling through privacy-preserving AI, will increase the understanding of CCCs. This knowledge is incorporated in a virtual companionship programme that facilitates shared decision-making and is implemented in three hospitals around Europe. Overall, RE-SAMPLE works towards a diversified, personalised care method that reduces the societal and economic burden of CCCs.",

Information is being constantly sent and received from one smart device to another. Based on cutting-edge technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), multiple-access edge computing, and virtualisation for next-generation IoT, the EU-funded TERMINET project will develop a novel next-generation reference architecture. Its main aim is to simplify the connection of a vast number of different devices through a flexible SDN-enabled middleware layer. To improve supply chain processes, the project will design an IoT-driven decentralised and distributed blockchain framework within manufacturing. TERMINET\u2019s approach will be tested in real-life situations such as energy, smart buildings, smart farming, healthcare and manufacturing.",

While most older adults successfully process this loss and will return to a normal life, a significant proportion is unable to do this. They end up with prolonged grief (PG), a condition where grief symptoms occur longer than 6 months after the loss, and which can result in many mental and physical problems, like poor sleep, cardiovascular problems, depression, loneliness and suicidal tendencies.\n\nIn order to prevent PG or to treat it, so that older mourners can lead an active, meaningful and dignified life, we will develop an online grief program: Leaves. Leaves will cater to secondary end-users (family, informal caregivers) by reducing stress. Older adults, informal caregivers and relevant care professionals will, together with the project team, develop the Leaves service model, and, through iterative design and development, will optimize its usability and user experience.",
