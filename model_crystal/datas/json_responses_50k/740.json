You will be guided through the different stages of carrying out a research project, from conducting a literature review, developing a research design, to collecting and analysing data, and writing the findings and discussion section.\n\nTeaching the following course in the Bachelor Information Sciences:\n\nXB_40003 Bachelor Project Information Sciences \nIn this final course of the Bachelor Information Sciences, students work individually on a scientific research project on a topic of their choice in the IS domain.\nStudents design and complete a research project from beginning to end. This includes both theoretical and empirical work. They define a research question, and develop a research design. After collecting the\ndata, they analyze them in order to answer their research question. They describe their findings in a research paper and present their work in a poster presentation and an oral presentation.\n\nTeaching the following course in the Honours Programme of the Department of Computer Science:\n\nX_HP010 HP Research Community and Practice\nThe VU BSc Honours Programme promises to provide students with a deeper understanding and experience in the curricular aspects of their Bachelor. One of the most important topics, which currently is included only implicitly in the study programme, is the research process---the philosophy, theories, methods, and body of knowledge associated with the scientific method of our field. This course aims to introduce the principles and practice of the research process in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.",

Topics vary and include interdisciplinary offerings in the humanities, arts, and sciences. Classes are small and require substantial student participation. Emphasis is on developing and improving fundamental academic skills, including critical thinking and communications (the ability to write, read, listen, and speak effectively). \n\nANTH 2300 Culture and Communication \nBegins with the concept of culture as a means of communicating with others; not only through language but with manners, etiquette, dress, rituals and ceremonials, gesture and movement - the entire system of symbols and signs that provide meaning for human behavior. Explores a variety of issues in cross-cultural communication, language use, and symbolic systems. \n\nILC 1090 Elementary Language: Level I (Italian)\nDevelops listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing skills. The goal is fluency in basic linguistic structures needed for expression in everyday situations and the recognition of challenges in intercultural communication. \n\nILC 2150 Topics in Culture(s): Contemporary Italian Culture\nAn introduction to the culture; including customs, history, literature, and arts of a particular region or country, taught by faculty trained and experienced in the target culture or language. Through single or multiple themes, students will learn about the historical and sociopolitical contexts for areas where the target culture differs significantly from U.S. culture and develop their intercultural competence skills. Students may also learn linguistic tools, such as greetings, polite and ceremonial formulas, and culturally specific terms that do not exist in English.",
