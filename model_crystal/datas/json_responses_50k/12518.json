    "summary": "I am an Academy Fellow at The Clingendael Institute and a Cum Laude MA graduate from the College of Europe.\n\nI benefit from years of experience in training hundreds of high level professionals (diplomats, civil servants, military personnel) from dozens of countries in European Affairs, where I equip them with the insights and skills required to operate effectively in sensitive, demanding and intercultural political environments. My specialisation is EU foreign and security policy, EU enlargement and Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nMy education and training contacts have led to an advanced and interconnected understanding of the decision making, political trends and behind the scenes dynamics of the European Union across legislative files while being able to apply these to daily working practices for different organisations and professionals.\n\nI believe that storytelling, play and interaction in a safe, diverse and inclusive environment are the building blocks of healthy societies. Bringing Europe closer to citizens by empowering them to understand and shape their shared and unfinished historical project together is my biggest passion",

As Chair specifically, I acquired an ability for time management, team work, concept creation, event and project management and group coaching and mediation and was required to write over 50 academic papers as background material for the various councils, including simulations of the European Council, United Nations Security Council, North Atlantic Council and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Also participated in and chaired a variety of specific ''Historical Crisis'' councils, in which historical scenario's are simulated and the usual simulation of a legislative setting found in conventional MUN's is substituted for a more executive environment in which decisionmaking, time management, contextualisation and creativity are key.\n\nList of Conferences:\nGrunnMUN 2016 (Delegate)\nTEIMUN 2016 (Delegate) Distinguished Delegate\nKULMUN 2017 (Chair)\nURUMUN 2017 (Delegate)\nDAMMUN 2017 (Delegate) Best Delegate\nTEIMUN 2017 (Chair)\nGOTMUN 2017 (Delegate) Best Delegate\nLSEMUN 2018 (Chair) DIMUN 2018 (Chair)\nGrunnMUN 2018 (Chair)\nDAMMUN 2018 (Chair)\nEUROMUN 2018 (Backroom)\nTEIMUN 2018 (Director)\nOXIMUN 2018 (Delegate) Commendation/Best Delegate\nLIMUN-HS 2018 (Chair)\nHAMMUN 2018 (Chair)\nHNMUN 2019 (Delegate)"
