We moved on to develop workshops to inform students on their resources, and raise awareness of the issues. Following on from my internship at the CSG, we expanded to working with them on sessions with first years to discuss alcohol and consent among other things. At present we are running a PR campaign to raise awareness,which involves writing articles, developing a series of posters, and pitching a TedX talk. We further aim to create an internship position within the university with an official mandate in the field.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/asap.auc/",
