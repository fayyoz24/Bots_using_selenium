    "summary": "I am an imaginative and analytical change manager with a knack for product development.\n\nSince 1999 I am active in the international information industry. Throughout these years innovation, development and change have been the central themes. Whether as product manager, business process consultant, head of marketing, or program manager for online strategy - introducing new digital products or new ways of working is key. I operate on business as well as IT side, and am able to translate between these areas and to see different perspectives, while focusing on the user needs. \n\nAs industrial design engineer (MSc, 1997) I have an analytical yet creative background, with a strong focus on business processes. In 2011 I completed a post-grad trainer/coach course and I worked as freelancer with main focus on innovation and change management for six years. \n\nIn 2017 I joined the public library industry to drive the change that is taken place there. As part of several management teams, responsible for education & cultural programs, I drive the transition towards a library where people can develop themselves, get inspired and inspire others, and learn new skills. \n\nCulture, especially theatre and literature, has always been a source of inspiration in my personal life. In this role, innovation and change management intersect with culture in my professional life as well.",
