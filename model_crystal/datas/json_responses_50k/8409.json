    "summary": "My vision for AchieV is to bring as well the technical implementation of the perfect tool as the organizational implementation of the perfect coaching. \nI am convinced that there are many managers out there who have worked with Lean Tools before, created some first successes but also know that they could be doing better. They just struggle to get it done. With the support of AchieV we can make managers the leaders they always wanted to be and utilize the maximum potential of their organizations. It helps leaders to be in the driver seat of continuous improvement.\nFind out more about AchieV?\nWatch the movies here on LinkedIn (just scroll down), visit our website www.achiev.com or just call +31 6 520 54 635\n",
