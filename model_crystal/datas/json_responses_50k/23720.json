As part of this project, developed a Mainframe Message Queue (MQ) series gateway to simplify business processes and their recovery. As a part of a two member team, interacted with clients and represented TCS team on various occasions. Prepared test scripts for mainframe regression testing and performed the testing through mainframes. Through programs and codes identified the business services and their functionalities, after identifying, developed a gateway (job in mainframes) that allowed these services to pass through by inserting a token so that they can be identified easily in case they fail for recovery. This made it easier for the application recovery team to identify and correct the failed jobs and services, thereby minimizing the loss to the client\n\nb) Worked as a Business Analyst for Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance. As, part of Nationwide, extracted business rules from old legacy systems to simplify clients' business processes. A number of programs were being used by the client and each time a new functionality or scheme was to be added in Property or Casualty insurance the clients' IT team just added new programs and did not make changes to the existing programs, this created piles of COBOL programs which hindered a proper analytical understanding of business services. So, we extracted business logic from the existing codes and identified the programs which are being used currently, the ones which are obsolete and the ones which are modified. This increased the understanding of the current business process at clients' side. The existing, new business rules were then used whenever a new modification was to be made, hence reducing the time to market for a specific insurance product",
