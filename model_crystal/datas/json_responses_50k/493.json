The first stage of the project revolved around eliciting process knowledge about the manner in which the number of required employees is generally determined within the operations of the restaurant. This respective knowledge was elicited during a series of interviews with knowledge experts within the restaurant, and was used to compose a number of formal deliverables on the \u2018as-is\u2019 current state operations that are performed to determine how many employees are required to be scheduled. These deliverables were used as input in the second stage of the project, which revolved around the actual development and implementation of the knowledge system. The respective system was constructed using Prolog, a programming language that can be instructed to retrieve specific output using logical expressions and corresponding input data. The main variables that were considered in our knowledge system were (1) the specific day of interest (i.e. a regular weekday or during the weekend), (2) the weather forecast, (3) the number of reservations at the restaurant, (4) hosted events (e.g. weddings, business meetings, etc.), (5) nearby events (e.g. externally hosted local events), and (6) contemporary COVID-19 regulations. Furthermore, in determining the required number of scheduled employees, our system was able to differentiate between four different types of employees: (1) supervisors, (2) bartenders, (3) \u2018wijklopers\u2019, and (4) \u2018runners\u2019.",

Such systemic algorithmic bias typically originates from underlying systemic bias in training data, and could lead to deficient recruitment of personnel. It could even lead to substantial public backlash whenever  such systemic bias is deemed sensitive by the community. Recognizing the social delicacy that surrounds the employment of AI applications in corporate recruitment, our team introduced a prototype dashboard\u2014dubbed \u2018FairSight\u2019\u2014which aims to assist recruiters in making (more) unbiased and non-discriminatory decisions. The main strength of the dashboard is that it can detect and subsequently neutralize the effects of demographic characteristics in application documents, but FairSight also adheres to the principles of explainable AI (XAI) by graphically disclosing the manner in which the most suitable applicants are identified (in contrast to the conventional \u2018black box\u2019 metaphor that is generally used to describe algorithmic operations). Given the ever increasing public attention surrounding AI ethics\u2014specifically, algorithmic fairness\u2014we are opinionated that the foundational principles of FairSight can serve as cornerstone for future AI applications in corporate recruitment.",

We subsequently used a regex query to identify the tweets that were of interest to us within the context of our research (around 5,000 units).

In this problem, an agent is repeatedly dropped at random locations in the (virtual) environment at hand (a 15x15 maze), and it subsequently tries to find the exit by repeatedly moving around the maze (and thus learning about its environment). Not only were we able to train the agents to constantly successfully find the exit, but we were also able to reach a local optimum in performance by tweaking the model parameters according to the performance data of our agents. This was a fun project, but I believe that, when adopting a perspective that exceeds the boundaries of this project, reinforcement learning algorithms are showing very much potential within the field of automized decision-making.",

Our team was invited to develop and introduce a conceptual software design which encompassed the interaction between the various hardware and (third-party) software components that comprised the new machine. Transcripts of various interviews with a broad range of NS personnel (including the project manager, software architects, and system maintenance employees) were made available, from which we were able to derive a fully-dressed use case, including requirements concerning (1) functionality, (2) usability, (3) reliability metrics, (4) performance metrics, and (5) future supportability. We constructed a UML class diagram in order to graphically communicate our software design, since it enabled us to clearly display the abstract responsibilities, attributes, and the supported methods of the software components. Our design was focused on adhering to the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion, which greatly enhanced the reusability of the components in the design. Additionally, our aim was to develop a design which was robust to future changes in both functional and nonfunctional requirements. The main challenge that we encountered during the development of the design was the integration with the legacy price computation system and the corresponding data from the MySQL Oracle Enterprise server.",

The cosine distance is subsequently used as the metric of comparison in ranking the documents according to their relevance to the query at hand. We used articles from various online news portals (e.g. The New York Times, The Guardian, BBC, etc.), which were converted into CSV files and manually uploaded to the directory which was used by the search engine during its operations. The search engine was made accessible by using an external CSS design which, among other elements, contained (1) a search box for querying and (2) a ranked search output consisting of the top-10 documents and their corresponding cosine distance metrics.",

A total of 45 teams were invited to submit and present a strategic proposal on how AEGON would be able to capitalize on legislative changes in the German corporate pension scheme market. In short, these respective legislative changes led to corporate pension schemes becoming more accessible to SMEs, and the people at AEGON\u2019s Workplace Solutions were interested in our outlook on whether entering this market would be viable or not. Our proposal consisted of a thorough host country analysis, which was subdivided into individual analyses regarding (1) resource and competency requirements, (2) market conditions and corresponding level of competition, and (3) a cultural analysis concerning German consumer behavior in terms of obtaining pension plans. Using the findings of our analyses, we were able to develop a multi-faceted, quantitative analysis of the expected effectiveness of various foreign direct investment (FDI) strategies. The (partial) acquisition of an established German (native) pension scheme provider was determined to be the expected most effective FDI strategy. Additionally, we composed a shortlist of acquisition target companies based on (1) availability of desired resources and capabilities, (2) transferability of these respective resources, and (3) acquisition and integration feasibility. Our team made it into the final, and we eventually won the competition with our strategic proposal.",

Our team observed that the key players in the market for semipro surfing gear considered the respective market as inferior, and that they were rather devoted to their endeavors in other clothing industries. This observation went hand in hand with the assertion that the market for semipro surfing gear showed little levels of fierce competition, leading us to believe that this was the blue ocean that Crocs had been looking for. Our perspective was amplified by the observation that Crocs\u2019 current international operations were largely in coastal countries, which harmonizes with the target audience in the semipro surfing gear market. In order to lower the entry barrier as much as possible, we proposed a product portfolio that reaped the advantage of Crocs\u2019 \u2018Croslite\u2019 propriety material. The products in the proposed portfolio were predominantly manufactured with the Croslite material, which implied that the company did not have to spend outrageous amounts of financial resources on R&D in order to produce the products that would allow them to enter the target market. Our proposal received broad support during the final presentation of the project.",
