    "summary": "Architecture is my main passion and profession. I always look for new opportunities to improve myself within the architectural practice.\n\nCurrently I am a self-employed architect, working on various projects ranging from architectural competitions to work for clients. Mainly I design dwellings/additions to dwelling, public buildings and redevelopment projects. I am very passionate about architecture and continuously want to improve myself as professional and as an architect in the field.\n\nI am a thinker and I love to analyse and improve my knowledge and solutions of everything I engage. I thrive on efficiency and with every assignment, task or goal; I try to be the person I want to be. Sensibility and order in the design process are also always on my mind. One of the best traits of the profession is the ability to make models, along the process an analytical tool. When the project is finished, the perfect tool to see your work come to life the first time and a perfect way to convince your clients of the design and the high working level of precision and quality you pursue. My goal is and always will be quality over quantity.\n\nMy education has been diverse but always focused on one goal; to become an architect. The diversity has been in the way the institutions engaged in educating, from a more practical and technical role to purely academic. Through this I have gathered much additional knowledge of the building process and with structural design for example. But as architect you never stop learning; therefore I still continuously engage in activities to improve my knowledge.\n\nArchitecture is an ever-changing profession. New technologies and application are becoming more important. In this vast web of possibilities I see it as my job to always put the clients\u2019 needs up front. As architect I can work for a client doing exactly what I love.\n\nLooking for an architect for your design?\nContact me at:\n\u25cf naxaatlantis@yahoo.com\n\u25cf +31 633788311",

By designing with sustainability rather than being dictated by the vast amount of solutions there are, I try to avoid diminishing the essence of the architecture. By designing many architectural competitions I can also try different strategies and approaches, which later can be translated to the designs for clients when proven successful.",

My internship was at \u2018\u2018t Lindeke\u2019 in Halsteren (near Bergen op Zoom) at a dwelling complex of 24 apartments.\n\u25cf During these six months I have seen the progress of construction from the basement layer, to the placement of the roof and installing Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing Rough-in.\n\u25cf My activities were partly practical in nature, with routine activities in assisting with the shell construction. The other activities were monitoring, calculation and supervision of the process.",

The work was diverse from simple procedures to actually rebuild parts from scratch when necessary. This was done between hours spread out over several months. By taking on these tasks no-one has the time for, the lifespan and presentation value of the models can be extended.\n\u25cf More knowledge about professional model making, searching for new methods to recreate specific elements for the models and knowledge of a laser cutter have added value to my professional career."
