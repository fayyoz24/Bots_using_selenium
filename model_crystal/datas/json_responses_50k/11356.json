    "summary": "I\u2019m a designer, researcher and educator who\u2019s currently exploring the intersection between user experience design and data science.\n\nAt the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences I train students to become the next generation of user experience designers.  I'm proud to say and see that many of them work on exciting and innovative products and services, both on a national as well as an international level.\n\nI enjoy working on the design and development of design education. I think of what I do as \u2018designing designers\u2019. \n\nAs a member of ACED I help fostering new, exciting impactful collaborations between Designers and Journalists.\n\nBefore my career as an educator I worked as a user experience designer at various European designstudios.",

How do different world views, and more importantly, different human values influence how we experience technology?\n\nthe first prototype for this game was developed for the New Media & New Technologies course of the Media Technology MSc. programme. It was presented during the 2016 NMNT Exhibition on June 3 & 4 at De Vrijplaats in Leiden.",

To understand their impact, I took on the perspective and role of a data scientist. By executing a case study in collabo- ration with a third party organisation that provides a file exchange service, we were able to use network analysis, data mining and machine learning in order to gain a new understanding of usage of the service. \n\nIn our report we describe in detail the approach taken and how this approach provided new insights into user behaviour. We report on how the effects of sharing the research results with the participating organisation, and finally how data driven methods, findings and predictions can become a powerful contribution to the arsenal of research techniques that are available to anyone studying the usage of digital products and services.",

With this course students are trained in these three activities. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we launched the first efforts in this course, a 9 hour online tutorial series delivered through YouTube. Forthcoming are a visual vocabulary for designers and a book for students.",

New guidelines and policies of the Dutch Higher Education System demanded a more transparent procedure, ensuring that all students are graded in a fair and consistent manner. I developed a methodology that ensures the assessment board makes their reasoning behind their judgements explicit, while ensuring that every student is graded on the same criteria, making the determination of the final grade consistent and transparent.\n\nThe results of this improved assessment procedure was documented in the paper\n\u2018From Gut Feeling to a Structured Summative Assessment of Design Competencies\u2019, which I presented at the 14th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (E&PDE2012), in Antwerp, where it was awarded a \u2018Best Paper Award\u2019 for the paper with the highest review score.",

I co-operate with both digital design agencies as well as digital design departments of various organisations, to provide design problems and opportunities for our students to work on. The theoretical part of the program is focused on the grasp of user centred design methodologies, the formulation of design guidelines based on insights into recent scientific developments and HCI research, and the emerging development of smart objects.\n\nEach course year I\u2019ve been part of the assessment committee of multiple graduating students, supervising their theses as well as their design projects.",
