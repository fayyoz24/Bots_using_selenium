One is through providing corporate research to groups/litigators with a view to preparing a legal case against a company or a state actor. Secondly, SOMO sees and seizes an opportunity to advance a new, networked approach to strategic litigation, that will draw on, and share, the expertise gained in the past decade amongst CSOs, lawyers and other experts. I worked on supporting the mapping of cases and legal precedents that can be useful to civil society coalitions. This legal research ranged from human rights and international criminal legal research to multinational enterprise and corporate governance research as well as climate research. The main areas of focus were a just energy transition, dismantling corporate power, foreign investment, and the garment sector supply chains. This research was conducted using existing databases and the preliminary mapping included in the background papers. Thus, I developed a skill in legal research and assessment, legal drafting, policy analysis, and strategic litigation.",
