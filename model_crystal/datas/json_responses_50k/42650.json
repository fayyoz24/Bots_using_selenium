    "summary": "I am a Medical Student at Radboud University, the Netherlands. I earned my Master of Public Health at Northwestern University, USA. I have experience doing qualitative and quantitative research in public health, and in developing public health curriculum. I am also experienced in public speaking as well as interviewing. My particular interests are in public health leadership and in global child- and maternal health. I aspire to combine my public health skills with my medical skills in order to improve global health equity. \n\nI was an all-region D1 student-athlete in Cross Country, and I competed at several National Championships in Cross Country and Track and Field. My experiences as an athlete taught me skills such as adaptability, and resilience. I learned to be adaptable after having changed my training environment completely by moving from the Netherlands to the United States as a student-athlete. Upon arrival, a foot surgery sidelined me for over a year, which taught me to be resilient. From moving across the world, I also learned a lot about the importance of cultural humility, which lessons I aim to apply in my public health practice.",

My injury did not only teach me resilience and persistence: it also led me to develop my identity outside of my athletic identity. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my values and identifying my aspirations. I was determined to also achieve athletic success after my injury, but after this achievement I preferred to prioritize my career in global health and medicine. \n\nhttps://evenementen.uitslagen.nl/2021/warandeloop/",
