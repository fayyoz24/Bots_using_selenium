Zo leren ze elkaar en de stad (nog) beter kennen. Met de avonturen steunt SPAAK projecten en ondernemers in Rotterdam met een filosofie waar we achter staan. Uit onderzoek is trouwens ook gebleken dat ervaringen mensen gelukkiger maken. Dus SPAAK stimuleert geluk! Daar word ik dan weer gelukkig van. Lees meer over SPAAK op de website of neem contact op.",
