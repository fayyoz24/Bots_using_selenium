    "summary": "\nI am currently a PhD researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), with 7+ years of research experience in FE/CAE analysis,  numerical algorithms and writing code in C++/python for inhouse simulation tool development. I am actively seeking a position in the industry that involves developing predictive solutions for challenging engineering and scientific problems.\n\nAs a research professional in computational mechanics, I have undertaken and finished projects involving virtual experimentation of different types of composite materials with application in automotive, ballistics, biomechanics and aerospace. In the process, I have garnered strong skill sets in constitutive modelling, material fitting, failure analysis, numerical optimisation & experimental validation using commercial CAE software, writing user-defined subroutines to add new features and development of FE simulation codes from scratch.\n\nIn addition,  my masters coursework gave me an opportunity to learn the theoretical background behind different simulation methodologies. Working on interdisciplinary problems, as a research assistant, have not only helped me to develop my analytical skills, but has also presented opportunities to symbiotically collaborate with experts from different fields - aiding in completing projects as a team.\n\nI am looking for challenging opportunities in the simulation industry, where I can contribute meaningfully while further broadening my skill sets by  learning new technologies in the field. I would be more than happy to connect and I can be contacted at :  varun.nimbus@gmail.com\n",
