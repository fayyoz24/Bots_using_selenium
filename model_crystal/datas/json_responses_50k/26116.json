The final part of the application pre-lab competition was to present our idea to a panel of 3 Judges consisting of Lord Robert Winston, Professor Sir John Pendry and Professor Lesley Yellowlees.\n\nWe are currently contacting potential manufacturers for our pipette.\n",

As a trial design project, my colleague drew and 3D printed a mushroom shaped keyring with a smiling face and I drew and 3D printed a model of the Queen's Tower, which stands at the centre of the campus.\n\nWe are currently looking for potential manufacturers of our new pipette, of which we have made a working prototype with a level of accuracy which is competitive to commercial pipettes. \nIt consists largely of 3D printed and metal-machined parts and panels.",
