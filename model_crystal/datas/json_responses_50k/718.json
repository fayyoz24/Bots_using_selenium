    "summary": "South African PhD candidate, currently in the Netherlands. My doctoral research looks at possible obligations on states to regulate religiously motivated 'hate speech' which targets queer people (in light of international human rights law). My research is funded as part of the EU's Horizon 2020 program, in the ITN 'NETHATE'. \n\nI did my Bachelors of Law and Masters of Law degrees at the University of Stellenbosch. In my master's thesis, I analysed the Maputo Protocol (and the definition of 'women') to show how the African human rights system is continuously failing to recognise and protect African transgender women, and thus failing to uphold the values and rights as set out in the Protocol. In 2022, I co-published an article looking at this issue in the Maputo Protocol as well as the SADC's GBV Model Law. After my masters, I interned at the OHCHR in their Treaty Capacity Building Program. \n\nBeyond my research, I am always available to give talks/lead discussions on an arrangement of topics including but not limited to: human rights, gender and sexual diversity, consent as well as allyship (just a few examples). I've done so in various capacities and for diverse audiences including university residences, student organisations as well as companies.",

My function included that I assisted with research regarding states\u2019 engagement with the UN\u2019s human rights mechanisms (HRMs), updated state profiles, conducted desk research regarding the state of domestication of ratified treaties and the withdrawal of reservations as well as provided thematic analyses and compilation of recommendations. I was also responsible for assisting in the planning and execution of capacity building trainings for Government officials as well as members of relevant Civil Society Organisations and I assisted in conducting research and data collection on women\u2019s rights and gender equality in the Southern African region. Other responsibilities included general research and analysis of human rights violations coupled with the identification of vulnerable populations and the protection thereof. During the time of Covid-19, this required me to particularly focus on an analysis of GBV prevalence and possible interventions in South Africa. Administratively, I was responsible for preparing data and documents for presentation, communicating with relevant stakeholders, regularly participating and minute-taking within meetings as well as providing any other support when needs arose.",
