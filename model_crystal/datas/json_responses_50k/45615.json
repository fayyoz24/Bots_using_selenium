The new system is an event based system utilizing Lambda functions with nodejs, kinesis streams and dynamodb. IaC with the help of Serverless framework and various plugin for it. Using AVA for testing.\nTools: NodeJs, AWS (Lambda, Kinesis, Cloudformation, Serverless, DynamoDB), AVA, Git\n\nClient: An energy provider\nKey responsibility: Solo development of a SOLR service for their eZ Platform based website.\nDetails: Had to dockerize SOLR so it could be deployed on Elastic Beanstalk which could scale the solr instances up and down and using zookeeper to synchronize the search data. I've used docker compose to be able to test it locally. It was a difficult job to do, as SOLR is designed to be used in a different way, and had overcome a lot of limitations and hurdles of SOLR and zookeeper. Deployed with serverless and CircleCi.\nTools: SOLR, apache, nginx, AWS (EB), Docker, Serverless, CircleCi, Git\n\nClient: Book publisher.\nKey responsibility: Solo development of their Book Editing and publishing platform for 3 years.\nDetails: They used Pressbooks plugin for Wordpress but it didn't suit all their needs. I had to transform it for Elastic Beanstalk with Docker, so it can scale up and down on demand. Had to separate out its book exporting functionality to Elastic Beanstalk Worker with Docker and SQS, because the pdf and mobi generation process was so resource hungry, it dramatically slowed down the editor platform. For local development I used docker compose to emulate a similar network and phpunit for testing and CircleCI for Continuous Deployment.\nTools: Wordpress, PHP7, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, phpunit, MySQL, CircleCI, Docker, AWS (EB, SQS, CW), Nginx, Apache, varnish, Git",
