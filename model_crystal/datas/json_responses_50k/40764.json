At risk is the world\u2019s food security, water security, and the livelihoods of billions of people linked to the agrarian economy \u2013 especially so in the tropical world that is home to 4.7 billion people. India is one of the worst affected regions \u2013 with a 40% or more decline in its rivers in just two generations, due to more than 70% loss in green cover in the river basin areas. As a result, soil fertility is declining, there are more droughts and floods, and there is acute agrarian distress with a rising tide of farmer suicides. Not surprisingly, 24% of the world, and 32% of India, is turning into a desert.\n\nGiven this backdrop, the Cauvery River, which has been a life-line of South India for many millennia, is now dying. At stake is 83000 square kilometers of the river\u2019s basin, which until recent years had been one of the most fertile lands in India, and is home today to 84 million people.\n\nWhy Cauvery Calling\nThe name \u201cCauvery\u201d literally means \u201cone who brings abundance.\u201d But this once mighty river is mighty no more.\n\nIn the last few years, the suffering of farmers and their suicides in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the Cauvery basin, have made national headlines. The depletion of Cauvery and the distress of farmers are two manifestations of the same problem.\n\nTo reverse this dire situation, revitalize Cauvery, rejuvenate the soil, and improve farmers' income, Cauvery Calling will support farmers to plant 242 crore trees. It is estimated that these 242 crore trees will increase water retention in Cauvery basin by about 40%.\n\nhttps://isha.sadhguru.org/uk/en/isha-covid-action\n\nhttps://consciousplanet.org/"
