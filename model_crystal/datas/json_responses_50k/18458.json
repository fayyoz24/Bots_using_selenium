    "summary": "In a world where computer interfaces have become the middle man of most communication, good interface design has become imperative to any part of society. \n\nIn my pursuit of a degree in communication and multimedia, I developed a passion for User Interface and User Experience research within Digital healthcare. As software is an integral part of storing and processing medical information, computer interfaces have become the most frequently used means of interaction. Making these interfaces intuitive to use could benefit everyone involved in healthcare, be that worker or patient. There is a challenge in building a good interface for a healthcare environment and I am ready to take part in tackling it. \n\nThe position that I am looking for considers both creating a design in its early stages and improving it, by involving users, stakeholders, and researchers throughout the entire process.",
