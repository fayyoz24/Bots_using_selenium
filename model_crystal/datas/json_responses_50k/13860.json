    "summary": "As a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Twente with a minor in Data Science & Business Analytics, I possess a unique combination of skills. I have a strong ability to approach problems logically and systematically, which complements my understanding of data-driven decision-making and the skills necessary to manipulate and analyze large datasets. In addition to my technical skills, I have valuable leadership and managerial experience from my work as a restaurant manager in Amsterdam and as a Commisionner of External Affairs in my study association. Furthermore, I'm proficient in multiple languages, which has allowed me to work as a linguist/translator since 2017.",
