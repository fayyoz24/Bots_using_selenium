    "summary": "Over the years, I developed my main competences in organising large, high-level events and meetings, coordinating and monitoring advisory processes, setting up (new) projects and writing policy notes and reports. \n\nI thrive in a dynamic working environment and enjoy being the 'spill in the organization'. I am used to wearing different hats and swiftly switching between topics. I enjoy thinking along and/or shaping (new) projects and processes. I would describe my work method as careful, systemetic and pragmatic. My workethic, organizational talent, ingenuity and pragmatic attitude result in an efficient completion of my assigned tasks. \n\nI am known for my healthy dose of humor, with which I create a pleasant working environment, can quickly build contacts and that offers my colleagues a moment of relief in busy times. I am very team oriented and do not hesitate to jump in or think along if necessary.",
