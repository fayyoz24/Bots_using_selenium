    "summary": "I have had the good fortune to enjoy a full, interesting, educational and varied working career.  The most recent positions with BC Hydro in Canada provided me with the opportunity to apply my background as a labour and employment lawyer, combined with human resources management and training and development.  A personal interest in human rights and health services was always in the background as I also served for 12 years as a lawyer member of Mental Heath Act review panels for the Ministry of Health in the Province of British Columbia.  Currently, I have the luxury of living in the Netherlands and being able to work on writing projects with my husband, and for others who need a practiced eye with translation from Dutch to English.  Learning Dutch at Leiden University is my newest educational endeavour.",
