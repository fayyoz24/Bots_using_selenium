    "summary": "\ud83d\ude80 As a Ph.D. candidate at Eindhoven University of Technology, I'm on an exciting journey exploring Event Knowledge Graphs for multi-dimensional process mining. My research centers around the fascinating world of understanding complex processes through the lens of Event Knowledge Graphs and Digital Twins. \ud83d\udcca\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Before this, I was a graduate student at TU/e, where I combined the realms of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with Operation Management and Logistics (OML). My focus in both fields revolved around information systems, particularly in the context of creating and optimizing processes. I graduated in September 2022 Cum Laude. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\ud83e\uddee During my studies, I had the privilege of serving as a board member of Study Association GEWIS in the 2018-2019 academic year. In this role, I had a unique opportunity to delve into the branding of GEWIS and explore the myriad benefits it offers to our students. Since the position was largely self-designed, I became adept at crafting my own plans and diligently following through on them. \n\n\ud83e\udd1d My time with the GEWIS board wasn't just about hard work; it was also about forging strong bonds with my fellow board members. Together, we played a pivotal role in keeping the association running smoothly, and I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable experience. It was undoubtedly a lot of effort, but it was an effort well worth it, as I had the privilege of giving back to an incredible community. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Let's connect and share our enthusiasm for technology, process improvement, and all things innovative! Feel free to reach out\u2014I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals. \ud83c\udf10",

This digital shadow captures persistent data like the different locations of the equipment. The shadow also captures sensor data of the equipment containing events of multiple entities into a single structure. Generic rules were proposed and applied to infer missing relations within the manufacturing process. The obtained digital shadow is improved using Conformance Checking by identifying some common data quality issues. We showed that the inference engine and the use of conformance checking significantly improved the digital shadow through evaluation of the digital shadow at different stages of construction. Finally, we demonstrated how the graph-based data model can be used for analysis and performance calculations. \nThis project was very challenging, but it also gave me a lot of insight. I gained knowledge about graph databases and digital twins and shadows. I did not only learn about the engineering aspects, but also about me. Researching and developing solutions really motivated me throughout this project and I also got a lot of energy from this.  So much so that I have decided to continue my academic career by starting a PhD in the same field as my master thesis.",
