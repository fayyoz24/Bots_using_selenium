Curbing the rising health care costs has proven to be a very sensitive and complex societal issue. An important driver of rising costs is the availability and use of new and expensive medical technologies, causing a greater number of patients to be treated with more expensive interventions. These interventions typically contribute to population health and well-being in The Netherlands. Economic evaluations are performed to identify the ratio between the cost of an intervention and the health benefit it yields. Information derived from these economic evaluations is used to advise the Dutch government on the content of the basic benefit package of the Health Care Insurance act.\n\nOne important form of economic evaluation is the cost-utility analysis (CUA). In CUA, health benefit is expressed in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The \u2018quality adjustment\u2019 part of the QALY is a number, which reflects the quality of life related to a certain health state.In his thesis, Matthijs sought to improve the measurement of Quality of life in terms of \u2018utility\u2019, for applications in economic evaluations of health.\n\nKey words: Stated preferences, Cost-utility analysis, Time Trade-off, Condition-specific measures, Mapping to EQ-5D.  \n\nh-index (2021): 18\ni10-index (2021): 21",
