At Virtual Ambiance, we manage two websites, virtualambiance.com and virtual-fireplace.net, and showcase our diverse range of content on two popular YouTube channels, Virtual Ambiance and Virtual Fireplace.\n\nIn addition, I have extensive experience with automation in this role. For example, I developed a shell script that utilize FFmpeg software to stream video and audio separately to YouTube on a Raspberry Pi. I also created several small shell scripts to automate the process of merging video fragments and audio, as well as applying various sound effects.\n\nRelated to this, I have further expanded my knowledge of Java, Python, and Object-Oriented Programming using Design Patterns. I took this step because I am determined to further develop myself in this field.",
