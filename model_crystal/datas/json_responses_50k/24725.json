    "summary": "\u2705  WHAT I DO:\n\nI help nonprofit leaders and students transform conflict into collaboration, develop empathy and communication skills, and nurture self-compassion and mindfulness.\n\n\u2705  AS A RESULT, MY CLIENTS:\n\n- Increase ability to engage co-workers and supervisors to achieve the mission of the organization\n- Strengthen relationships with key stakeholders to share resources\n- Deepen ability to set boundaries and set aside focused time for long-term planning\n- Higher sense of purpose, contribution and work satisfaction\n- Better understanding of how to utilize qualities of team members\n\n\u2705  WHAT CLIENTS SAY:\n\n\u275dWhen I stopped trying to get them into my boat and decided to just go ahead and get in their boat, that was where we had a breakthrough. As a result, on a systemic level, we can affect change that will be beneficial.\u275e\nMegan Elkins | Director Talent PipeLine Success, Workforce Solutions, Capital Area Austin\n\n\u275dI think a real benefit was a different way of thinking about conflict: more as an opportunity to figure out how to collaborate. Once I started seeing conversations with people through the lens of needs and strategies, it changed those conversations into more collaborative ones. I had more empathy and was able to not even problem-solve, but just kind of solution-find together.\u275e\nSofia Barbato | Director Supportive Services, Foundation Communities, Austin\n\n\u2705  MY CLIENTS ARE:\n\n- driven by integrity and purpose\n- willing to reflect on themselves\n- compassionate\n- honest and appreciative\n\n\u2705  HOW I WORK:\n\nI work with leaders to deepen their understanding of the values, needs, and assumptions of themselves and others. I use a four-step approach to help them create a culture of trust, authenticity, honesty, and mutual contribution.\n\n\u2705  WHY IT MATTERS:\n\nAmerican employees spend 2.8 hours per week on conflict, which means $359 billion in paid hours. Other costs are accusations of racial bias, wasted time, employee turnover, grievances and lawsuits, absenteeism and health costs, poor decision-making, poisoned workplace.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 NEXT STEPS:\n\n*elly@ellyvanlaar.com\n*06-4842-9347",

These conflicts persist until they are resolved. When ignored, a pattern of hurt feelings turns into enemy images that undermine trust and collaboration and create discord. As a leader, you can untangle the conflict culture.\n\nYou don\u2019t need someone to criticize your leadership style. You need an objective person to talk through your challenges and ask the right questions. Hit the pause button and reflect on your own priorities, boundaries, and leadership style, so you can decide how to move ahead.",
