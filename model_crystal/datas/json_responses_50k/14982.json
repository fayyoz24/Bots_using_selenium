In addition to making infographics, icons, flyers, posters, banners, ads, newsletters, websites, visuals and presentations, I immersed myself into the world of community, survey and panel layouts for clients such as: Disney, Bijenkorf, DAS, Footlocker, KPN and many more. I also made many infographics for brands such as: Unicef, Albert Heijn, ABN AMRO, MediaMarkt, NS, Tata Steel and more. As time went on I became an all-round designer not only for MWM2 but also for their labels Crowdtech, Hibou and InnerVoice. I took care of the branding of all four companies and enrolled in a photography course at the Fotoacademie in order to create more company related visuals.",
