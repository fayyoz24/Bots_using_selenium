They are an extremely talented bunch who are kicking ass scaling the tech teams of Backbase all over the world. As a TL I make sure my team is happy, efficient and can think outside of the box. The results typically are our satisfied candidates and stakeholders.\n\nAs a Senior Recruiter I enjoy driving the end to end recruitment process for several departments like Business Support, Customer Success (leadership, tech and core teams), Strategy and Propositions (Product Marketing, Digital strategy Consultancy, Sales Enablement and AR), Academy (technical trainers and instructional designers) and Products (tech teams and HYF interns). \n\nI get the most fun out of building new teams almost from scratch. Joining forces with hiring managers and teams in creating new profiles and hunting for the purple squirrels hidden all over the world is my bread and butter.",
