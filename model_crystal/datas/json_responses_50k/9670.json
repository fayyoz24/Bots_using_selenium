    "summary": "I love writing copy for consumers because I am a consumer myself. Whether it's a user manual for a shaver or an inspirational article about making bread in an Airfryer, the tone, style and quality of written content really matters. \n\nI'm passionate about writing the kind of copy that cuts through corporate jargon and makes it a joy to connect with the companies and causes I care about. We're all confronted by copy every day, so we better make it good.\n\nSince being employed as a Technical Writer at Philips in March 2019, my networking skills and enthusiasm for writing have led me to become involved with a wide variety of content types. I currently work on printed, web and app content on a routine basis, using my subject knowledge and flexible writing style to meet the expectations of diverse group of users and consumers. \n\nA native English speaker, experienced and confident working on UX and inspirational copy as part of cross-functional Agile teams.",
