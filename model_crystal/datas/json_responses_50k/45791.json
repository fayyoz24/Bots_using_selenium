In the next 50 years the rain intensity is going to rapidly increase and in addition there are going to be more heat waves due to global warming. The problem we are focusing on is that current solutions are not able to hold the water with the heavy rain intensity. If it's happening more often systems are not managing. That causes excess rainfall water to enter the combined sewage system instead of the ground. \n\nOur goal is to design a solution that is nature based and incorporates elements of biomimicry to transform the current water management systems in order to deal with the overload that is caused by heavy rainfalls, allowing the water to be absorbed and redistributed in a way to minimize the risk of surface flooding and create a circular economy of water within the urban areas.",

The design challenge focused on innovations in sustainability, health, use of urban greenery and the local use of energy at the micro level. The THUMUSH was meant to illuminate the footpaths of Delftse Hout. Now it is going to be placed in front of the sustainability center in Delftse Hout, The Papaver. They believe that THUMUSH wouldn\u2019t satisfy all of their needs in terms of production cost, off grid power supply and main concern was that it didn't fit into their vision and visual style of their headquarters. We have been supplied with transfer documents by the previous design team. Main focus of the project: - Simplification of the previous design, - Visual Integrity with De Papaver and Delftse hout, - Daytime perception of the lamp, - Renewable materials and energy source Our project ended with fully off grid functioning prototype. Considering very limited time frame of the project there is a lot more to explore. We are hoping to further develop this design so it can be implemented in front of the sustainability center.",

I helped to design an outdoors furniture for employees which had to encourage social interactions. The design team started with researching and analyzing. After that we went through conceptualizing and materializing phase. Everything was kept in line with clients requirements and adjusted as we got feedback. During the project time apart of technical aspects of design, we also developed manufacturing process and business aspects of the design.",
