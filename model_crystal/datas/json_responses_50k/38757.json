The initiative which is spearheaded by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), is geared towards mainstreaming climate change into development planning, providing information on novel approaches including climate financing to overcome the challenges of climate change and disseminating lessons learned from adaptation interventions.  \n\nIn order, to strengthen the implementation of the Investment Projects under Jamaica\u2019s SPCR, PIOJ has requested the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) through IDB to support a 3-day workshop to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the implementation of all investment projects; review investment project implementation progress against the PPCR results framework, learn from the implementation experiences (challenges, successes and adaptive measures taken), and identify areas where better coordination is required to maximize synergies and implementation pace. \n\nThe four projects that will be discussed in the context of the proposed activities are:\n1.\tImproving Climate Data and Information Management \n2.\tAdaptation Programme and Financing Mechanism \n3.\tPromoting Community-based Resilience in the Fisheries Sector \n4.\tFinancing Water Adaptation in Jamaica\u2019s New Urban Housing Sector\n\nMenno supported the PIOJ in formulating the structure of a 3-day Stakeholder Engagement Workshop, for which he specifically facilitated the SPCR Project Management 4 Results session.\n\nBlended virtual/in-person sessions using Zoom and Basecamp as virtual support tools.\n",
