    "summary": "The cooperation with asylum seekers with mutual respect and, based on my role/function, ensuring that these people receive the right attention and care gives me a lot of energy. Collaboration with security, catering, GZA, JGZ, GGD, COA, municipality and other organizations is my field of work. All this in collaboration with the location/region manager and housing supervisors and volunteers. In October 2022, as a Location Coordinator, I participated in the start-up of an unaccompanied minor and did the initial reception of 41 unaccompanied minor refugees. Currently working as CNO Day Coordinator in Utrecht. But also services in Veenendaal, IJsselstein and Lexmond. Helping asylum seekers integrate is an important goal for me. That is why I regularly give presentations on topics such as the Dutch constitution, the role of the police, the Netherlands and water management, the EU and what we remember on 4 and 5 May.\n\nI hope to be able to work for another 2 years.",
