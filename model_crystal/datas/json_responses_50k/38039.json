    "summary": "After I suffered a stroke I am no longer able to work as Head of finance, risk & compliance at Clifford Chance LLP. The reason I suffered stroke at such a young age, while I am otherwise very healthy, is that I have a hereditary disease of brain blood vessels called CADASIL. \nCADASIL leads to a reduced blood flow to the brain and therefore strokes resulting in progressive disability. After I had to stop working, I decided to write a book about CADASIL and this terrible disease has affected me, my wife and our young family. My book 'Shouldn't I be dead already?' has been published in May 2023. If you are interested to read about how we have coped with all the challenges that have come our way due to CADASIL, you can order the book via my website www.levenmetcadasil.com/boek\n\nTerwijl ik in Amsterdam werkte als Head of finance, risk & compliance bij Clifford Chance LLP kreeg ik een herseninfarct. Dit herseninfarct was het gevolg van een ziekte met de naam Cadasil. Cadasil is een ziekte die leidt tot een verminderde bloedtoevoer naar de hersenen, en die hoogstwaarschijnlijk zal leiden tot de dood. Toen ik noodgedwongen moest stoppen met werken, ben ik begonnen met het schrijven van een ervaringsverhaal over deze ziekte en de impact die dit heeft op een jong gezin. \nBegin mei is mijn boek met de titel \u2018Ik had toch al dood moeten zijn?\u2019 uitgebracht. Het boek is onder andere te bestellen via mijn website www.levenmetcadasil.com/boek",

That is why the Foundation coordinates the municipality, police, the fire department and the industrial lobby, who are all working in close cooperation to improve the safety of the business park.",

Together with a team of  12 Financial Professionals from the Netherlands, I have spent a week building two houses for Indian families near Pondicherry in Eastern India. \n\nThe homes we helped to build are now homes to Dalit mothers and their children. Dalit is the name for people who are at the lowest level of India's Hindu-based caste system.  Nearly 25% of India's population are Dalit and a large majority live in extreme poverty and in dire conditions. I have spent my time doing groundwork, concrete casting, carpeting and painting. The houses are an enormous step up from current living conditions where many families live together in just one room. These homes offer some of India's poorest families ample living space including a 3-by-4 meter living room, separate kitchen, one or more bedrooms and storage. \n\nThe project was funded by an online campaign of public and private donations and the Amsterdam office of Clifford Chance helped to fund the houses that we helped to build.  \n\nIt is almost impossible to put into words the feeling of satisfaction that comes with helping these families, having experienced the conditions they have lived in and what our support does for their future lives.\n\nPlease see short video here: https://youtu.be/Lf3khGBaWbQ"
