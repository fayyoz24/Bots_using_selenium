I combine this attitude with an open mind seeking alternatives and solid solutions.\n\nBy having a solution oriented focus:\nIt is all about moving in the right direction in our ever changing businesses. Today\u2019s solutions can be tomorrow\u2019s burdens. In getting to where we need to be I employ a strong motivation and persistence as change can be hard to achieve. I bring the energy that helps inspire the spark of change.\n\nBy complementing structured communication with active progress tracking:\nKnowing where you are relative to where you need to be is the key to success. I like to take the Lead in the change as I work from a clear focus.

Students were required to execute a local development project.  Cattle is running loose in the whole of The Gambia but the soil is fertile. Local villages cannot grow vegetables for themselves as those will be eaten by their cattle before these vegetables can be harvested. As a result their diet does not contain enough vegetables as purchasing these on the local markets is too expensive. \n\nA zero technology footprint concept was defined in close cooperation with representatives of the local village of Jakaba. Fencing a plot of land fitted with sufficient wells would solve the loose cattle problem. Agricultural training to villagers taught them to effectively and efficiently grow their vegetables on their properties. Good quality seeds in combination with agricultural knowledge and fenced-in land delivered the solution these villagers required. \n\nSince that time I continued the initiative by raising the required funds for an additional 6 villages in the Kuntaur area. I still worked with the same local Dutch woman who was working with the villages who wanted to participate. We met with representatives, discussed their needs, assessed their willingness to invest as well (one-third of total budget to be furnished by the villagers) and defined the required budget. I then worked in The Netherlands to raised the required funds and, once done, transferred the money to my local Dutch contact. My next visit to The Gambia would restart the cycle.\n\nThe vegetable gardens impact people's lives in two distinct ways. First the local diets improved through the increased level of vegetable consumption. At the same time the surplus of vegetables grown was sold off on the local markets. The funds so generated were used to send village children to school who would otherwise have been deprived of education."
