The simple question we want to answer is: does how you play show who you truly are? Or, put more academically: does the statistically trackable play style of a player significantly correlate to his personality? To find the answer we had over 13,000 Battlefield 3 players complete a personality test. We combined the results of this test with their Battlefield 3 play statistics. We found that play style does indeed say something about someone\u2019s personality. Surprisingly, age also seems to be very closely tied to play style.",

The first data set describes the play style and personality data of over 13,000 Battlefield 3 players (psyopsresearch.com). The second data set describes the personality, motivations, and brain type of over 3,000 players of World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Battlefield (projectgamr.com). Both data sets were collected through online promotional campaigns. The campaigns were set up by two mixed teams consisting of programmers and designers.

MECA is a software tool to assist astronauts during long-duration missions in space (see www.crewassistant.com for more information). MECA Phase 2 was part of the MARS520 experiment performed in Moscow. My activities and responsibilities included communications with other researchers in the consortium, software testing, documentation writing and preparation, training the research MD prior to the experiment, and more. \n\n2) Performing my own graduate research at TNO to earn my Computer Science Master degree in Technical Artificial Intelligence. The project involved creating an innovative AI extension of the existing MECA software. I devised and tested a method to predict a person's reaction times based on his physiological data by using an artificial neural network.\n\nFinal Grade: 9.0",
