    "summary": "Although I studied sport and performance psychology, it is not weird at all I also gained experience in the 'normal' business life. Every area in which people need to perform optimally and feel pressure to do so, understanding of sport psychologist matters is of great relevance. I use all the knowledge I gained during my studies while I work with different team members whom all have different needs and interests. Besides this, I always use my understanding of group dynamics when I try to establish a new working method with different stakeholders or try to create the most optimal group environment to perform optimally. \n\nIn my opinion the sports world and the normal business world could learn so much more of each other. Not only employees have burn-outs and not only athletes choke under pressure. Not only substitutes feel irrelevant and although not so specifically as in sports, every team has a captain, a co captain and several other informal types of leadership, also in business life. In every single situation it is usefull to know what kind of person you are speaking with and what his/her needs or whishes are. What is demanded by the situation, whished for by the person and what is your personality. The combination of these factors can create the optimal environment, to get the best team performance. In a meeting room or on a soccer field, the situations can be very similar. These 2 worlds have major similarities which are often overlooked.",
