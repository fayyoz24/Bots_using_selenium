After a brand image was created, my task involved organising and creating workshops, as well as BOPs (Business Opportunity Presentation) as a way to attract new recruits. The prior is through different value added sessions such as personality and career analysis, stock trading know-how, property investment talks. Regarding the latter, BOPs are predominantly for potential candidates who will come in to listen to sharing made by successful agents in the agency.",
