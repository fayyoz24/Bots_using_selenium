    "summary": "With over 7 years of experience in various roles ranging from customer service to business systems and process improvement, I bring a diverse skillset to the table. In my current role as a Business System & Process Specialist at Merck Group, I am responsible for the implementation of new Salesforce.com features and managing the Salesforce Champion network, while also enhancing existing processes and providing training to new joiners.\n\nPrior to this, I worked as a freelance web designer, creating well-structured and user-friendly websites, and providing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and website traffic analysis services. I also worked as a Lead Retail Support Representative at BP, where I handled business-critical escalations, monitored calls and emails, resolved operational issues, and participated in projects with high-level stakeholders.\n\nI also have experience as a Siebel (CRM) Super User, where I was the single point of contact for in-depth process knowledge and system expertise, and participated in user acceptance testing and design verification testing. As a Retail Support Representative, I worked with B2C and B2B customers, ensuring customer service consistency with set KPIs and SLAs, managing customer requests and queries, and coordinating top customers' portfolios.\n\nMy passion for process improvement, project management, and customer service has allowed me to excel in my roles and achieve great results. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.",
