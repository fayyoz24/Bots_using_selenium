    "summary": "\"If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the costs of bad design\" - Ralf Speth, CEO Jaguar\n\nHello \ud83d\udc4b nice to meet you. Let me introduce myself. \n\nIN A NUTSHELL\nI\u2019m a creative generalist experienced in running large scale digital productions and campaigns for global brands with cross-functional teams to make ideas and projects come to life. I'm a naturally curious person who likes to go out and be inspired by people, culture and nature. I have lived in the U.S., Spain and Brazil and now reside in Amsterdam.\n\nCURRENT ROLE\nAfter having gained 4 years of marketing experience in various roles at HEINEKEN, I decided to expand my creative horizon and move to the agency side. As a Digital Producer at Media.Monks, I worked with global brands and advertising agencies to craft stellar digital work. It\u2019s been an amazing journey to be part of a team that has grown from 500 to almost 10,000 employees. In my current role as Director of Operations, I\u2019m able to leverage my experience in creative production, project management, data analysis and team leadership to drive operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nBELIEFS\nI'm intrigued by the power of storytelling to make an impact. I believe in making things beautiful, but never at the expense of making things work. My goal is to always connect the right dots between usability and creativity to create beautiful yet effective products and experiences.\n\nI\u2019m interested in building brands and the evolution of digital and design to humanize technology. I believe design is not just about visual design. It goes far beyond a collection of pixels, a sequence of words or a combination of materials. It's about the entire experience the user has.\n\nINTERESTS\nMusic Junkie: DJ, playlist curator, concerts\nWater Sports Fan: diving, surfing, boating\nTech Nerd: interested in Web3 and AI\nSustainability Advocate\nCulture & Design Enthusiast\n\nWant to know more? Let\u2019s get in touch. \u270c\ufe0f",
