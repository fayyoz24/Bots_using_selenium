My Challenge Records Awarded CD\u2019s \u2018Sailing\u2019 and \u2018New York Straight Ahead\u2019 got ****critics in Down Beat magazine.\nMy project \u2018The Burning of the Midnight Lamp: Dick de Graaf plays Jimi Hendrix\u2019 appeared to be very succesful.  With this Septet project drew  full houses in Holland, Germany, Austria, Ireland and Finland. \nIn june 2003 the CD SCHUBERT IMPRESSIONS FOR JAZZ QUINTET was presented at the Northsea Jazz Festival followed by an international concert tour. Following these Schubert Impressions I presented another jazz-meets-classic project A TOUCH OF BELA in Hungary during the Esztergom Bela Bartok Festival in july 2005. June 2007 I was commissioned to write and play my Bach Reflections at the famous Bach Feste in Leipzig.\nAn immense series of projects followed: Trio Nuevo: Jazz Meets Tango (2006), my acoustic Dick de Graaf Quartet (2007), my powerjazz quartet CRY BABY! (2009), my solo improvisations with Bach\u2019s cello suites (2010), and  trio  Out Of The Blues with its 2012 CD CELEBRATING THE MUSIC OF OLIVER NELSON. \nBeside I was the musical director of the  Clazz Ensemble from 2007 until 2016, and of Italian pianist Andrea Pozza\u2019s European Quintet (I, GB,NL).\nMost recently, with my Dick de Graaf Quartet I released the CD BIRD BUZZ (2017) with pieces inspired by the (ordinary) birds around my house, created in the context of the doctoral research project I finished in november 2017.\nAugust 2021 will be my 40th anniversary as a professional performer, more about that will follow shortly.\nI am an endorser and international clinician for D'Addario reeds",
