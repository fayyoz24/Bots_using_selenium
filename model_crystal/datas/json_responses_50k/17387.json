    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b Hello! I'm Yamil, a driven Sales Development Representative specializing in the Benelux market at Sensorfact. With a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Big Data Analytics, I'm passionate about finding relationships between Data and Sales.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 I graduated in 2019 with a Full IB Diploma and continued my educational journey to earn my degree in 2023. Bilingual in English and a native Spanish speaker, I'm also enthusiastic about expanding my language skills, currently venturing into Italian. I proudly hold dual nationalities, both Peruvian and Italian, adding a multicultural perspective to my work.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Beyond my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working in the recruitment industry and co-founding an Events Management Startup. Our startup saw tremendous success, amassing over 1000 recurring 3-month memberships and scaling from 50 to 800 attendees per party in just under six months. Notably, all our parties were consistently sold out, a testament to our team's dedication and growth.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 In my spare time, I pursue my passion for music as a DJ. What started as a hobby has taken me to different corners of the world, playing for audiences of up to 4,000+ people in Peru, Chile, and various cities in the Netherlands (And soon around Europe).\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Making a positive impact on the world is essential to me. I co-founded an NGO called \"The Life Project\" in Peru, where we raised funds to provide clean water to families in need. I firmly believe that small actions can lead to significant change.\n\n\ud83d\udcaa I consider myself an extroverted introvert, driven by a passion for sales and an analytical mindset. My approach is simple: With resilience, a positive attitude, a growth mindset, and the willingness to work hard, there are no limits to what one can achieve.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Let's connect and explore new opportunities; I'm always open to meaningful conversations and connections!",
