I'm Annika (she/her), I am a Communications, Media and Culture graduate with Class 2:1 degree from Oxford Brookes University in England. \n\n\ud83c\udf0d   I am a global citizen. \nDuring my secondary education, due to my father\u2019s job, I have moved country 5 times living in the UK, Germany, Turkey, UAE and now the Netherlands. With each international move I have had to learn how to adapt to new cultures, languages, meet new people and make new friends. I believe this adaptability I have developed over the last 15 years has helped nurture my interpersonal and communication skills.",
