    "summary": "I am an Associate Professor for Good Research Practices at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the University of Amsterdam. I hold a PhD in Political Science (University of Southern Denmark, 2014) and previously I was an assistant professor at at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research. I have also been a Visiting Research Fellow at the Behavioural Foundations Laboratory at Temple University and the Paul Lazarsfeld Professor at the Faculty of Social Science at the University of Vienna. \n\nMy research focuses upon the question how citizens make up their mind about politics. I focus upon psychological processes and personality and emotions in particular. I rely upon large cross-cultural surveys, survey-experiments and laboratory experiments to answer my questions. My research appeared in journal such as Nature Human Behaviour, the American Politcal Science Review, the Journal of Politics, European Journal of Political Research and  Political Psychology and received funding from the European Commission, the NWO and Royal Academy of Sciences in the Netherlands. \n\nNext to my research, I also teach at the Department of Communication Science. I teach courses in statistics and research methods as well as more substantive courses in the psychology of political communication.",
