    "summary": "I am an undergraduate  student enrolled in  International Business Administration in Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), Erasmus University, and I aspire to put my skills to the test and experience Business Management fields such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Consulting. \n\nThe IBDP followed on a high-school level, has sufficiently prepared me to embark on the challenging journey of the professional world. Through my extended research project on Nike\u2019s marketing campaigns and their impact on the company\u2019s profitability, I have improved my research skills, set the basis for economic analysis, and made me more confident when interpreting financial matters. Choosing to enroll in Duke University\u2019s  Behavioral Finance Course has satisfied my appetite for learning outside my academic curriculum by learning and applying multiple theories to actual organisational change cases. \n \nBeing a goal-oriented person, work experience is crucial. My current position as Member of the U25 Board of The Social Hub has allowed me to aid in the planning, internal and external promotion and execution events, towards the vision of The Social Hub. Interning at Douvis Jewelry Company as a business administration intern, I explored the business departments of marketing, sales, and HR, familiarising myself with each department, undertaking tasks such as conducting competitive market research and participating in hiring processes. \n\nAdditionally, I became part of the accounting and logistics team, to improve my communication and teamwork skills, while at my rotation-role internship at PIK NIK Bar and Restaurant, I gained an insight on how quality must be upheld, in order to be successful, as well as the importance of building and maintaining customer relations and loyalty, respectively.\n\nI consider leadership skills to be one of the most essential requirements in business, thus being the activity coordinator of the Trekking Hellas camp, I have not only been responsible for organising extra-curricular activities for campers, but I have also been in charge of their well-being. Volunteering has also helped to develop my character; from beach clean-ups, raising awareness and acceptance about autism through \u201cRace for Autism\u201d virtual races, to participating in Dionysos Association of Stray Animals, instilling me with responsibility in all aspects of life.",
