    "summary": "Otto Kroesen has worked on the correlation of the spiritual realm and the reality of doing business. This correlation is often overlooked or denied but nevertheless: nothing works if it is not done with conviction. Quite often machine bureaucracies turn their employees into spiritual dwarfs, working as cogs in the machine. That makes people smaller than they are.\n\nA professional attitude is required to keep big enterprises on track and functioning. The word \u201cprofession\u201d has a background in theology: one was supposed to profess one\u2019s religion in the quality of his and her work. Nowadays the word responsibility functions in a similar way: it implies that people should work with a broader look, beyond their own little worlds. The word responsibility has roots in theology as well. It implies that people have to respond to a historical imperative that is bigger than their individual lives. It evokes a longer biographical line in one\u2019s course of action as part of the course of history. It requires a sensitivity for the crucial question where we are coming from and where we are going to.\n\nTeaching cross-cultural entrepreneurship for development was an opportunity to sensitize students for the practical consequences of such a broader vision of history and biography. In development projects and entrepreneurial activities people are continuing the historical debate and struggle on questions like: which values should be adopted to be successful on the longer-term? What are the trade-offs required between the hierarchical command structure and individual professionalism? What are the trade-offs between group and individual? How should criticism and loyalty be combined in crucial attempts for innovation? What kind of institutional environment is required to secure successful cooperation in corporations and enterprises? Institutions as well, like rule of law, freedom of expression, etc. are themselves the embodiment of values and inspirations.\n\nThe consultancy company Planetary Service provides a number of opportunities to be involved in (www.planetaryservice.nl): training and coaching, internships and sabbaticals. They are channels for reflection and learning by doing. More information on the website.",
