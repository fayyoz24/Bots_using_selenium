    "summary": "Sander is Project Manager and research Funding Advisor at the Virology division of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University. I support the lead scientists in their research on (corona)viruses so that they can focus on what they do best: their science. My main responsibilities include: i) maintaining an overview of scientific and financial progress of ongoing projects, ii) coordinating communication with our partners and funding agencies, and iii) co-development of new projects and project proposals to acquire new funds. This is a great place to combine my academic and commercial experience. Follow our twitter to stay up to date about the groups' work: https://twitter.com/UtrechtVirology\n\nBefore joining the Virology division at UU, I was Consultant at ttopstart, a science and business consulting company that serves the fields of life sciences, medical technology and healthcare. At ttopstart, I supported leading researchers and innovative companies to shape wild ideas into executable and funded projects with the best consortia.\n\nSander performed his PhD research in laboratories at both the Hubrecht Institute, Utrecht and the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam. For this, he investigated how tumor cells can exchange extracellular vesicles, which enables cancer cells to take advantage of each other\u2019s divergent properties, influencing tumor growth and metastasis. He received his education from Utrecht University, where he acquired a Bachelor\u2019s in Biology and a Master (cum laude) in Biomedical Sciences, for which he also worked at the University of California, San Francisco.",
