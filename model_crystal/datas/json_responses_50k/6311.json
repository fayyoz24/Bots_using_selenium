For example, we are responsible for selling tickets in the app, but also for booking a taxi or travel assistance. In my role as product/UX designer I have the space to work on both 'discovery' and 'delivery'. This means that I spend part of my time on UX research and sparring with stakeholders about a new concept or desired improvements. But, in addition, I also work on the realisation of these concepts, so I design a solution and ensure that it is developed by the developers in my team.",

One of the projects I worked at was the digital logistics of audio books. For this project publishers of audiobooks need to be able to register their book at CB. Subsequently they need to be able to choose which resellers are allowed to sell or lend the book and for what price. On the other side of the supply chain, the resellers, like webshops and platforms as storytell, need to be able to receive the audiobooks from CB and sell or lend them. \nIn my team I worked together with a problem owner, a information analyst and three developers in weekly sprints. The users are centered in my work so a big part of my job consisted of doing user research and interviews. Thereafter, I collected all the data in user journeys and designed screen interfaces that were later developed in collaboration with the developers from my team.",

The concept focused on displaying real experiences by real people through an easily accessible platform that gives its visitors an overview of all leisure activities in Noord-Brabant. The novelty of the concept lied with the fact that the database was user created and based on emotional feedback from social media.
