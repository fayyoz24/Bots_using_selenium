    "summary": "As a Senior Optical Sensing Engineer I am responsible for the design and development of the optical module - along with dedicated algorithms - that is the metrology cornerstone of the EUV Scanner: the machine producing microchips with EUV technology.\n\nSpecifically, my mission is to obtain a complete understanding of the system behavior in a real life environment. This is achieved by combining a rigorous data analysis through the creation of specific algorithms, together with an accurate physical description of the systems in question.\n\nI'm fascinated by the challenge of solving complex problems to enable the creation of the latest generation of microchips. This is a an extremely fast paced and growing sector, therefore having the right \"time to market\" raises the bar for the challenges I face daily.\n\nThis involves a continuous and constant feedback with many teams and colleagues with different cultures and backgrounds. I value team work very much and I am dedicated to do my best to improve group results; I am able to adapt myself to different kind of situations and problems and find the best way to overcome obstacles.\n\nMy goal is to use my scientific expertise to solve challenges within the R&D department of a company operating in the field of optics or related topics.",
