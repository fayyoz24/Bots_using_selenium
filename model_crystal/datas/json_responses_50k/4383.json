In each country, a team has been set up to carry out fieldwork and deliver output. The output consists of written reports based on life histories, interviews and focus group discussions and summary blogs including visual material and short videos.\n\nThe project is a mix between academic research and consultancy and brings together anthropologists, young (African) research talent and key players in the industry.",

The project has as one of its mayor qualitative methodologies the biographical method. This method is combined in an amalgam of ethnographic methodologies.\n\nThe V4T project takes biographies of engaged people as its starting point. The portraits of these persons are an entrance point into their lives, their environment, and the problematics as the research CTD puts central, but this time through the eyes of the V4T. The Voice and Thoughts of the V4T are often multiple, and an interesting reflection on his or her society. These voices make us rethink our premises and ideas about Africa.\n\nThe project enables researchers of the CTD project (and outside the project, in the future also outside of Africa) to disseminate their knowledge in an alternative way and accessible for a large audience. The combination of academic work and the presentation in an artistic way is at the core of this project.\n\nThe V4T come from different domains of governance in society: politics, government, arts, religion, academics, Journalism, the social; fields that are often blurred in one person. These alternative government fields are the moving forces of which the V4T are part.\n",

I investigated the pathways and agency of individual traders and discovered interesting conditions for succesfull trade in the region of Douentza. \n\n",
