    "summary": "My name is Melissa Kraai and I am currently an analist in Meander Amersfoort.\n\nDuring my education, I found the subjects cell biology and immunology very interesting and would like to know a lot more about these subjects. My main interest lies in the combination of immunology and cancer. I have always found the theory and research into cancer very interesting and would love to enrich my knowledge and experience with it. When you lose a loved one to cancer, cancer still makes a bigger impact on you and makes you feel what the disease really is like. This makes me very interested in cancer research and would like to participate for more discoveries in the effect and treatments against cancer during my internship period.\n\nI also find studies into the auto-immune disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS) very interesting. I find it very interesting how the damage to the myelin sheath affects the signal conduction in the human body. I would like to know more about MS and it would be a unique opportunity to participate in MS studies for more discoveries in the functioning and treatments of MS during my internship period.\n\nThen briefly about me as a person. Like any person, I have my qualities and my \"pitfalls\".\nI am a highly structured, disciplined, dedicated and motivated student. I am very good at planning, have always mapped out my plans and know exactly what I have to/want to do. If something has to be changed in my planning, I can also anticipate to it. I am always very motivated. I do what is asked of me and I always try to get the most out of myself. My \"pitfall\" is my perfectionism. If something interests me very much, I can keep my attention for a long time and stay focused.\n\nYou could reach me by phone or by email:\n06-42809326\nmelissa3@live.nl\n\n",
