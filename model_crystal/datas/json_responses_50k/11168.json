    "summary": "As a result of my many experiences in academic education, my study association and my student association, I have gained various key skills which are applicable in numerous ways, such as my analytical thinking skills and my strong writing skills. I am also very flexible in most work environments, being able to work both well as a team-player or independently. Due to my experiences abroad, where I have lived for ten years, I would consider myself to be broad-minded and optimistic. This summer I succesfully completed my bachelor of science International Business Administration (IBA) at the Rotterdam School of Management of the Erasmus University, allowing me to continue with my master of science Accounting & Financial Management at the same faculty.",
