    "summary": "I am a data analysis and visualization enthusiast who loves data & wine tasting. \n\nI started my career in data analysis in 2015, when I moved to London to join the Data School of The Information Lab, a 2-years program including training and three 6-months consulting assignments. \nI joined Exasol as a Business Analyst and then Natoora as BI Manager, being responsible for setting up their BI practice from scratch. I was part of the Partner Solution Engineering team at Tableau, a Salesforce company, first in London and then in Amsterdam, where I moved at beginning of 2023. Now I rejoined The Information Lab in the Netherlands.\n\nBefore moving to London, I worked in Management Consulting for 2 years and a half and I had a 6-months internship experience in Risk Management. \n\nI hold a Master degree in Mathematics, I have a blog about data & wine and I love creating new visualizations in Tableau Public.",
