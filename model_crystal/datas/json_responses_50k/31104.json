The competition is open to top business schools worldwide, and is recognized as the largest case competition of its kind. Its main purpose is to bridge the gap between the corporate and academic world, which ultimately enriches both students and executives alike.\n\nThe competition lasted a week and existed out of multiple rounds. With three hours to prepare, we had to analyse and evaluate unpublished business cases using the skills, knowledge and experience acquired from our curriculum. We completely relied on our own abilities, as we had limited access to Microsoft Office software and no access to the internet. The final products were presentations in PowerPoint format where we had to demonstrate our ability to dig into a problem and develop a feasible solution.\n\nTogether with Lisanne Fijnheer, Jasper Kroon and Alexandros Visser, I represented Nyenrode in this competition. Working together with 36 universities from all over the world was an amazing experiences; the competitive, collaborative and triggering environment ensured that I was able to get the best out of myself.\n ",

This is a project organised by the KHN (Royal Dutch Hospitality Association) and is aimed at solving current \u2018hot issues\u2019 in the industry. The other participants are representing the other top Hotel Management schools in The Netherlands.

Customers can order products from nearby local shopkeepers/farmers and we make sure that they are collected, sorted and delivered. \nWorking at a start-up means working like a jack of all trades. In the past months I have had a wide variety of responsibilities. I would like to highlight a few:\n\nBuild\n\n\u2714Together with our website developer(s) I helped in setting up the platform. I consider myself as a hybrid between Business Analyst and product owner. Finding the right balance between an easy-to-work with back office (for the local entrepreneurs) and a customer friendly front end was (and is) key. Being the linking pin between business and development was both educational and fun.\n\u2714Part of the above was setting up and maintaining the database with products and shops. Currently, we have about 25.000 products in our database with over 100 shops.\n\u2714I have also set up our digital marketing tool (Active Campaign) and was responsible for working with Voucherify which generates and distributes our coupons and discount codes.\n\nMeasure\n\n\u2714 Part of a start-up is measuring whether you are doing the right thing. I followed various PowerBI and SQL trainings in the last year I have built many different dashboards for various colleagues and provided key insights and analyses on a regular base with regard to how we are performing.\n\nLearn \n\n\u2714As a team we are working on making the Lokalist happen. This means understanding our customers via design thinking and journey mapping, creating value for them through our concept and making sure that we are doing the right thing.",
