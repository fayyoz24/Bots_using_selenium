    "summary": "I am a developmental psychologist specialized in adolescents' and students' well-being. I currently work as a lecturer, researcher, and psychological coach at the Department of Psychology at the University of Groningen. My\u00a0research interest lies in understanding the processes that underline\u00a0changes and promote psychological flexibility;  my research focuses on conceptualizing well-being within academia and developing interventions that promote a healthy student environment.\nIn addition to doing research, I teach courses that focus on learning academic and professional skills, such as academic writing and thinking, personal development, and leadership.\n\nFurthermore, after  2.5 years of study, practical training, and personal growth, I recently became a certified  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy  (ACT) therapist. As an ACT therapist, I aim to provide empathetic support, compassionate listening, and evidence-based interventions to individuals navigating various life challenges. I specialize in identity development coaching and trauma therapy.\n\nSpecifically, in the academic context, my goal is to provide students with ACT tools that can help them transition into academic life by normalizing their stress and anxiety and experiencing that, despite some uncertainty and discomfort, they can still have a rich and meaningful student life.\n\nExpertise:\n-Teaching (bachelor and master psychology courses, e.g., academic skills, research practicum, bachelor and master thesis)\n-Research (mental health, positive psychology, students' well-being, coaching, qualitative methods, dynamic systems theory and methods, longitudinal research)\n- ACT therapy (individual sessions and group therapy)\n- Coordination (coordinator of the BSS Buddy Project and the BSS Honors Master Program)",

By using computer simulations, the model explicates the complex process of friendship formation and behavior transformation on different developmental time scales (e.g., here-and-now versus months and years). In the first part of the thesis, we propose a dynamic systems theory of friendship interactions and risk behaviors during adolescence. In the second part, we translate the theoretical framework into mathematical equations and present the results of the model\u2019s simulations, aimed at testing our hypotheses.  In the last part of the thesis, the results of the empirical study were presented. The empirical study had two aims: First investigating whether similarity changes over time and second to differentiate between influence and reinforcement.",
