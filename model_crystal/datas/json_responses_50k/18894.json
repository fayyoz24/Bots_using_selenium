    "summary": "Working as Functional Design Engineer in DUV Expose Metrology at ASML.\nBackground in Applied Mathematics (and Applied Physics), predominantly in functional analysis.\n\nEducation:\nGraduated Cum Laude at Mill-Hill College Goirle in 2016.\nDid a double Bachelor Program at Eindhoven University of Technology, received bachelor degrees in Applied Mathematics as well as in Applied Physics in 2019.\nDid a master in Industrial and Applied Mathematics at Eindhoven University, graduated in February 2022. Master thesis studied a model on edge dislocations using a stochastic differential equation with singular drift. It concerned formal existence of such a system, as well as difficulties in simulating it, completed with a grade 9 under the supervision of prof. dr. Mark Peletier.\n\nWork Experience:\nWhilst studying at this university, I did several student assistantships, mostly as calculus tutor (2017-2018-2019). As of June 2022, working at ASML as Functional Design Engineer.",
