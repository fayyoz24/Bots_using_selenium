    "summary": "For 15 years I gained International and commercial experience in various management and leadership roles in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods in Europe, Asia and the Middle East/North Africa. \n\nSince 2006, I apply my knowledge about global commercial businesses in my training, coaching and consultancy. I develop and facilitate commercial, interpersonal and management/ leadership programmes in different countries and cultures (https://enhance-facilitation.eu).\n\nHaving lived in Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Austria, and the Netherlands, I have experienced the importance of global diversity, inclusiveness and equal opportunities. For me personally, these are recurring themes, both in my professional and family life. That\u2019s why I dedicate time and energy to conduct research on the equity and inclusiveness of training and learning. The ground-breaking insights of my research enable training organizers and corporate clients to ensure their training and learning is equitable and inclusive \n\nIf you want to find out more about my research, or you want to ensure your training programme is equitable and inclusive, feel free to contact me.
