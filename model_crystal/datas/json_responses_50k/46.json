    "summary": "My interests in disaster-related fieldwork and research take me to Japan, and the University of Osaka, where I\u2019m glad to be spending a semester completing a short-term academic exchange, as well as a research internship with the Sustainable Engineering laboratory, specializing in understanding the benefits of various stakeholders in risk communication of NaTech flooding disasters in Japan and the Netherlands.\n\nLiving and working in Africa (South Africa) and Europe (Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) has given me perspective, a need to work hands-on, with people and an idling sense that much more can and must be achieved. I value responsibility, sustainability and humility while being adaptable and willing to work harder. \n\nIn the past, I have been highly engaged with NGOs as a project assistant and PR relationship officer which plays on my strengths as an outgoing, disciplined, and driven character. My abilities as a leader are proven by my engagement in running an apprentice firm at a competitive industry player in Germany, leading a team of 10+ international policy data researchers for an NYU Abu Dhabi and TUM research project supporting WHO data on the COVID-19 pandemic and chairing the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at the MUN conference MainMUN in Frankfurt am Main. \n\nAs a trained Technical Product Designer, I gained technical skills that add to the multidisciplinary set of tools at my disposal, which I am currently expanding academically as a student of BSc in Global Responsibility and Leadership course at Campus Frysl\u00e2n and the University of Groningen. My practical training has made me detail-orientated and resilient in managing multiple projects and tasks in a structured manner. \n\nIn the past year operated part-time in three roles: \nAs the managing chairperson of the board and the 150-person Study Association at the heart of UG's Campus Frysl\u00e2n's student community is orientated around our values of altruism and sustainability. Further, in tune with my work at NCF, I worked to spread our mission towards better knowledge and more resilience amongst youth through planning our first conference at CRIsim. Finally, as a qualitative researcher for Campus Frysl\u00e2n Living Lab of the University of Groningen and Deloitte, discovered ways non-execs guide companies to address climate change.\n\nLooking toward the future, I am interested in diving deeper into the fields of Disaster Response and Risk Management, Education and Vocational Training Program Management, Ecological Restoration, and Sustainable Tourism.",
