    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn Profile! \ud83d\ude01\n\nMy name is Christos, I am passionate, multi-disciplinary professional, aiming at bridging the realms of chemical engineering, and machine learning. With a solid foundation of a Master's in Process Engineering, and a specialisation in Machine Learning, I'm driven by the endless possibilities that arise at the intersection of two fields. \n\n\ud83d\udd2c With a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering and a focus on Machine Learning, I'm fascinated by the integration of science, technology, and art. My expertise lies in process optimisation and scheduling. During my master thesis, I had the privilege of collaborating with Bayer AG, where I explored model-based reinforcement learning as a means of revolutionising process scheduling.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 As an artist as well as an engineer, I bring a  a keen eye for aesthetics to every project, a novel outlook on traditional problems. My journey as a fashion designer did not only hone my artistic skills, but also being able to manage the request of different stakeholders, from suppliers, to photographer, to consumer, I always aimed at creating meaningful relationships with each chain-link.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Born and raised in Athens, Greece, I made the bold decision to embark on a journey in 2018 by pursuing my higher education in the Netherlands, at the University of Twente. This experience has enriched me both personally and professionally, broadening my horizons and nurturing my adaptability in multicultural environments. Through my time in the Netherlands and Germany, I have gained a basic level in each language, all added on my fluency in Greek, English and French. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 I am now seeking new opportunities where I can leverage my technical expertise in Chemical Engineering and Machine Learning. My unique blend of skills positions me as a versatile professional, capable of bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and compelling design. Whether it's solving complex problems in the chemical industry, I am dedicated to making a meaningful and lasting impact.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can collaborate to drive innovation, optimise processes, and ignite the imagination!\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or at c.ampatzis99@gmail.com \u2709\ufe0f",

Combining my passion for machine learning, and process engineering, I am aimed at maximising the process efficiency and productivity, by leveraging model based reinforcement learning. \nWorking under the supervision of great Bayer engineers, Dr. Stefan Hubert and MSc. Roderich Wallrath, I gained valuable insight into working within an industrial setting, as well as gained a great amount of knowledge on the fields of process scheduling optimisation and machine learning. The environment at Bayer, allowed me to innovate and provide novel solutions to traditional problems, which was also the essence of my master thesis. \nThis experience prepared me to embark on a career of further innovation in the topics of machine learning, and chemical engineering, through their combination, focusing on maximising efficiency, and the sustainability of each process.",

Additionally, I implement visualization capabilities, allowing for better data interpolation. Furthermore, I also led the development of a user-friendly GUI for the library under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Mennitto. I am rather proud of the adsorption simulation app since it greatly enhanced the accessibility of the software to members of the department.
