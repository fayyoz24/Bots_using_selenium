During my time at the TBB group, I obtained new skills and knowledge on working with cross-sectional, medical data and the use of statistical and mathematical models in the field of immunology. I was rewarded with a 9.5/10 for my literature review on CD4+ T-cell dynamics in children living with HIV and a 8.5/10 for my research paper on CD4+ T-cell dynamics upon ART interruption.",

Als groepsbegeleider had ik samen met een mede-student gedurende twee weken de verantwoordelijk over een groepje kinderen tijdens SSJ. Samen zorgden we er voor dat de sfeer goed was, de kinderen op tijd bij hun programma's waren en begeleidden wij de pauzes.\n\n\nDuring Summer School Junior (SSJ), organized by the Science Hub of the UU, primary school students between the ages of 8 and 12 get the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific research and the university. As a group supervisor, a fellow student and I were responsible for a group of children. Together we ensured that the atmosphere was pleasant, that the children were at their Summer School programs on time and we supervised and played games with our group during breaks."
