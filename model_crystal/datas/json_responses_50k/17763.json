    "summary": "I work in several areas: language coaching and scientific writing support for students and professionals, teaching social theory and social scientific research methods to students in higher education, and exploring the relationship between language and society with a particular emphasis on the subject of children and linguistic diversity in European urban areas.\n  \nLanguage Coaching and Writing Support: I provide language coaching for groups and individuals seeking  improvement and greater confidence in their use of academic English. I also offer support services for professionals and students working on specific scientific writing and/or formal academic English language texts, e.g. scientific articles, dissertations, theses, lectures and presentations, reports, proposals and etcetera. Additionally, I offer translation of reports, white papers or other documents for education and research.\n \nE-learning, Sociology, and Higher Education: I possess more than twelve years of experience in online instruction. This experience includes teaching sociology at a college level to a wide variety of students for universities and colleges in the American Midwest, and the development of original online courses covering a wide range of topics relevant to the social sciences. Presently my course design efforts focus on enhancing the accessibility of course content. Making sure content is accessible not only to people with different learning styles, but also to people with impairments.   \n\nResearcher and Social Scientist: I have specialized education and experience in the use of ethnographic and discourse analytic research methods. In the past I applied these skills to a social scientific research  on the subject of community based services for people with intellectual disabilities, and to the cultural politics of autism and autistic rights. Presently I am designing a framework for a comparative analysis of experiences raising multilingual children in the Netherlands and Germany.   \n",

At UNO I have a reputation for consistently developing, delivering, and improving upon high quality courses which attract, engage and retain students, while at the same time challenging students to make mistakes, work through mistakes, reflect, think critically and grow. \n\nI joined UNO as a part-time instructor at a time when the university was growing its online course offerings. The aim was to create an entirely online Bachelor\u2019s degree in General Studies. My work facilitated this expansion. Facilitated it not only through quality delivery of foundational courses like Introduction to Sociology (SOC 1010) and Social Problems (SOC 2100), but also the design and delivery of new, topical and senior level courses such as Sociology of the Body (SOC 4200) and Disability & Society (SOC 4210). Drawing from my research experience on human service systems and a broad interest in concepts like normality and human development, I succeeded in introducing these to the university\u2019s course catalogue and developing them into challenging and popular courses.\n\nFor UNO I have had the privilege to teach a variety of courses: Introduction to Sociology (SOC 1010); Social Problems (SOC 2100); Sociology  of the Body (SOC 4200); Disability & Society (SOC 4210), and a series of courses  on Major Social Issues (SOC 2800) where each course offering focused  in-depth on a specific social issue. These included, economic Inequality; employment, poverty  and neoliberalism; the war on drugs; capitalism versus socialism, and the question \u201cwho rules America\u201d?\n \nAs a set of tools for thinking about and looking at the world, sociology can have a transformative impact. I look forward to further developing these courses and inspiring students to pursue sociology as a field of study or to take a smore sociological imagination with them into whatever other fields of study they pursue.",

The course and workshops range from two to ten sessions; the focus goes well beyond matters of grammar, punctuation, spelling and syntax (all important and included) to matters of learning and practicing the structure of different kinds of academic texts such as scientific articles and research proposals. Because my approach involves learning through doing, the feedback I offer and which is offered by others in a workshop context, not only teaches better scientific writing but helps students to clarify and more concisely and strategically communicate their research for an academic audience. While most of the participants in my courses and workshops are non-native English speakers/writers at the Bachelor and Master's level, native speakers of English have also found participation in my workshops to be of help in the improvement of their scientific and academic writing as a craft. I aim in the coming period to expand the range of customers and services I offer as a language specialist and trainer in scientific and academic English writing.",

They needed a reliable instructor on short-notice to teach a course  section of Social Problems which they had not expected to be offering. And ever since I have been teaching for them such fundamental courses as Social Problems (SOC 115) and Introduction to Sociology (SOC 110). \n\nOver the years I have maintained a reputation for consistently developing, delivering, and improving upon these  courses so that they increasingly engage and retain students, while at the same time challenging them to make mistakes, work through mistakes, reflect on experiences, think critically and grow. To that end, I am presently in the initial writing stages of a series of video lectures which uses mundane objects, relations and occurrences \u2013 such as a broken bathroom scale \u2013 as vehicles for teaching sociological theories and concepts.    \n\nAs a set of tools for thinking about and looking at the world, sociology can have a transformative impact, and as a flexible, far-reaching and accessible platform for teaching, online courses can reach many kinds of people. Thus, I look forward to further developing these online courses for  Southeastern Community College while and inspiring students to pursue sociology as a field of study or to take a smore sociological imagination with them into whatever other fields of study they pursue.",
