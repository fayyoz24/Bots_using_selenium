    "summary": "My specialization is in education, particularly in the European private sector for creative education and language teaching.  I have had roles from lecturing and teaching to management of educational systems on an international level.  I also have experience in programme development and delivery methods, compliance (both local and international), academic recruitment and management systems.\nI have taught English to secondary school pupils in the UK and also to non-native speaking adult students in Italy, Malaysia and the Netherlands.  I have also lectured in Audio Engineering at SAE Institute Amsterdam and taught bachelor programmes in Academic Writing, Cultural Perspectives, Presentation skills and Recording History in Amsterdam, Brussels and Rotterdam.  Although I still find time for lecturing, I have also moved into a management role as an Academic Coordinator and most recently as Academic Manager for campuses in Europe North.\n\nI have experience in copy editing with a good eye for detail and precision in written and online materials.\n\nI thrive in an international environment and enjoy working with colleagues from different backgrounds and experiences.  I adapt well to change and can learn new things quickly and efficiently.\n\nAlongside my career, my passions have always been music, performance and creative writing.  I regularly take part in international song-writing collaborations and play live music whenever possible. I am also involved in creative writing, taking part in online group projects as well as individual writing.  I have had articles published both online and in print media.\n",
