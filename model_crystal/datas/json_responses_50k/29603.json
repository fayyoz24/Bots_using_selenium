    "summary": "A MSc. Financial Risk Management graduate from Trinity Business School, currently working as a Business Analyst BI. In addition to my academic training, I have five years of rich experience working in Financial Services, Banking, Equity, Derivatives, and Capital Markets areas. As someone passionate about helping others, I like to analyze data, crunch numbers, solve problems, and improve processes. By combining the above with my entrepreneurial mindset and becoming FRM-certificate, I hope to pursue my long-term goal, which is being self-employed and advice SME concerning their risk framework. \n\nIn my spare time, I like to participate in multiple sports of which soccer and swimming are my favourites. Reading books, taking courses, listening to podcasts, and visiting museums are activities, which I do to challenge my intellectual capacity. In addition, I teach elementary and high school students economics, mathematics, and English on a voluntary basis. Finally, I like to invest in my personal relationships, which contains my family and friends.\n\nIn case you have any question please contact me directly via InMail or f.ozturk_@live.nl",
