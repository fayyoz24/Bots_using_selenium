The setup was suffering from data center failover problems, causing traffic loss and require manual intervention to recover from a failure. The redesign of the overall connections is designed to overcome these issues. It included a simplification of the physical setup, as well as a create a uniform logical setup. Furthermore it undid administrative entanglement within the organization and allow for a clear boundary of responsibilities. This project was finalized early 2017.\n \nAfter the initial project I was part of several KPN internal migration projects and a lifecycle renewal project of the DCI MPLS backbone. The latter entailed not only the replacement but also a merger of two KPN MPLS networks.\n \nMy last project (the MPLS merger project) initiated a new program called Connectivity Exchange, which had the sole purpose of providing full IP connectivity between all KPN services and customers as well as services provided by KPN acquisitions over the past few years. Overlapping IP spaces, inconsistent or incomplete administration and little to no organizational integration, meant no synergy of products and assets could be achieved. Whenever a new service was to be offered via existing KPN infrastructure to a customer, this resulted in tailored solutions with expensive leased lines and workarounds to get things working. Long implementation times and difficulties servicing them was the obvious result. The Connectivity Exchange project provided a new pre-provisioned IP backbone setup, with a specific set of regulations, rules and assurance processes to allow for quick, predictable and reliable delivery of any service to any customer. As part of a team of eight, we were responsible for the design, structure and implementation of this program over the past year.",

This innovative platform has given me a different outlook on datacenter networking and service delivery and is very challenging to say the least. The addition of the new transparent virtual firewall solution from Cisco in the ICS called the Virtual Security Gateway means I was able to utilize my security and firewalling skills as well for this project. \n\nThe new data center firewall design and implementation project that fell under my responsibility has allowed me to further deepen my knowledge on several of the current enterprise class firewall systems and management tooling. The challenges in this design has given me an even more in-depth perspective in the various possibilities for data center firewalling. \n\nDuring the last 6 months I an important role in the integration of the Cymer IT environments with ASML as well as the Data Center integration in San Diego. As with most network mergers private IP usage still remains a challenge which at least temporarily require complex NAT and global WAN strategies.",

(All ASR systems are in place, and we are waiting on the connections between some of the locations to be delivered) to finish it completely. It is now time to shift our focus to the services on the Network 2.0.\n\nCurrently I am working closely with Patrick Lammers on the Firewall (virtualization) and management of the new DCLAN services design. Site redundancy and automatic failovers are some of the more challenging but fun parts of this design and both are well accommodated by the MPLS design using MP-BGP and OSPF redistribution solutions. The high-bandwidth demands, flexibility in management and need for virtualization and resource allocation for customers are our main focus right now. All in All, still a good challenge but even more so a lot of fun!\n\nOn a side track, I am supporting Erik Vanaubel since he has now taken on both the Load balancing design and extension of the MPLS network with ME switches, changing the BGP design to now include route reflectors for local ME rings and support MPLS to the access-layer solutions to create maximum flexibility for all customers and services available on the network without creating any new restrictions.\n\nIt is nice to see our previous design at work and accommodating every need we have encountered so far in any of these designs and customer requests without limitations.",

They wanted help to migrate their core network to new equipment, incorporate QoS for VoIP, review their security policies and set up a new template for their access-switches. \n\nAll systems have been migrated successfully and their new Core is operational. The Access-switches are now being implemented by the use of the new template by Lu employees.",
