    "summary": "I am an internationally experienced PMP, SAFe Scrum Master, SAFe Agilist, and Prince2 Practitioner certified program/project manager with extensive background in IT, instructional design & technology, and HR (employee learning & development, divestitures, restructurings, organizational change, compensation, system/tool development & implementation). Throughout my career, I have made a difference to thousands of people as well as many organisations across all continents. I have helped them become more cost-effective, impactful and successful in reaching their personal and organisational goals.\n\nInteresting fact: early on in my career (see my job experience below) I successfully completed a training program in air traffic control. \n\nGetting problems solved and work accomplished as effectively as possible in close collaboration with other people from various professional and cultural backgrounds energises me. To me, there is nothing like a true team effort. Work is done on teams and cannot be successful without involving the right people with the right skills and the right team spirit.\n\nThe many different organisations that I have worked for, the people from various professional and cultural backgrounds that I have worked with, and the many types of jobs and projects that I have been responsible for have all helped me increase my cultural awareness, people knowledge, and expertise of a wide variety of professional areas.\n\nI am practical, flexible, organised, reliable, persistent, accurate, tactful, respectful, professional, accommodating, probing, and client- and results-oriented. I also have a good sense of humour. Others conceive me as an advisor, teacher, organiser, creator, facilitator, collaborator, communicator, team player and listener.\n\nI own MSc degrees in Technology Management and Software Engineering. \n\nWhen I am not at work, I love coaching one of the teams of the local field hockey club, as well as growing my professional skills by reading articles and books and attending courses.",
