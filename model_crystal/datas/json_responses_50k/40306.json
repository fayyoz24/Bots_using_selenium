Cosmetic packaging often includes small cap sizes, tubes and mechanisms that require high force to open, and are making it difficult for people with rheumatoid arthritis to use. The designs made for people with arthritis often aim to enlarge the product as much as possible in order to make it more comfortable for them to hold. These designs often include grips made of foam, silicone, rubber or other material that creates more friction when holding or opening products. When creating \u201cPepe\u201d, all of these aspects were considered. \"Pepe\" is more than 3 times bigger in diameter than a norma-sized mascara, it has an easy twist off cap and a silicone grip for better grip and friction.\n\n",

The design project was undertaken under the Design Project 3 course.\nThe \u201cAeroZen\u201d project targets pre-menopausal, menopausal and post-menopausal women. The climacteric affects the mental and physical condition of the woman\u2019s body. AeroZen is created to relieve some of the symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. 40% of regularly menstruating women over 40 years of age experience hot flashes, and over 80% of women in menopause. Thus, we aim to reach women at the age of 39 to 55 years. Our vision is to create a comfortable night rest for women who face these hot flashes. \u201cAeroZen\u201d is a cooling mattress that provides ventilation though 8 computer fans. The concept is unique in the sense that it allows the functional aspect of the system to be embedded within the mattress. The mechanism is quite yet it helps to refresh and cool down, and it is below the average decibel volume for sleeping.\nAll materials used for the mattress are taken into consideration and they help to strengthen the cooling effect.",
