    "summary": "As the Project Manager of Formula Student Team Delft, I oversee the development and delivery of the DUT24, a high-performance electric race car. I lead a multidisciplinary team of more than 80 engineers, ensuring effective collaboration, communication, and project accounting across 10 departments.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from TU Delft in 2023, where I also completed a minor in Offshore Wind Energy. This minor introduced me to the industry that I am passionate about and want to make an impact in. I have gained valuable skills and experience in aerodynamics and systems engineering through multiple internships, including designing a winglet system for a vertical axis wind turbine at Deveci Tech and working on functional requirement generation for the GE F110 engine at TEI. I plan to pursue a master's program in Sustainable Energy Technologies at TU Delft after taking a gap year to challenge myself and further develop my professional character.",
