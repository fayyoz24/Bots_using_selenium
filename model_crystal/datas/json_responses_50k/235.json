    "summary": "I am currently working as Consultant at Korn Ferry. Korn Ferry is an international advisory firm and together with management teams we aim to make their strategy specific and concrete. Most organizations can come up with a sound strategy, but many struggle to make it stick because their talent and strategy aren\u2019t in sync. That is where we come in. We help you hire, motivate, and hold on to the best people to bring your strategy to life.\n\nAs Consultant I am part of the Young Talents team in our Amsterdam office. I am working on challenging projects for high profile organizations from all our disciplines. I work closely with senior consultants during the proposal and delivery phase of projects related to job evaluation, organization design, and strategy execution.\n\nCombining my role as Consultant with my Hospitality background, I integrate a strong customer focus with an analytical mindset. I like to anticipate on people\u2019s needs and exceed expectations in my collaboration with clients.",
