                    "description": "The Living Lab for Care of Older People is a formal collaboration between 7 Care Providers (MeanderGroep, Sevagram, Envida, Zuyderland, Cicero, Vivantes, Mosae), Zuyd University of Applied Sciences, Gilde Zorgcollege, Vista College and Maastricht University. The living lab has two vital characteristics. First, it is a multidisciplinary partnership with the core disciplines being nursing science, gerontology, old age medicine, psychology and physiotherapy. Collaborating partners are practitioners (such as registered nurses, physicians, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists), managers, researchers and teaching staff. Second, we have joint appointments of staff working both at the university and within a long-term care organization. Senior researchers work on a structural basis and at least one day a week within the long-term care organizations. They help to identify relevant issues for practice and policy, translate these into scientific research projects and enable the translation of evidence-based knowledge in daily practice. Furthermore, they initiate and coordinate research and teaching activities within the long-term care organizations. Moreover, long-term care staff (such as registered nurses and nursing assistants, physicians, physiotherapists, psychologists) participate in research projects. They may be posted to the university to conduct their PhD projects, on average two days weekly for about a 4-year period.
