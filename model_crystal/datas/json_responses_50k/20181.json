Our initiative aims to educate youth about the SDGs and provide practical volunteering opportunities to unleash their potential while being an active world citizen.\n \nFor this initiative we organised in Belgium the YouthSpeak Forum, a forum for youth to get to know more about the SDGs, follow workshops and participate in discussion panels. My job for this forum: manage the partnerships for the event with partners like Nestle, EY, Teach For Belgium etc. \n \nIn Tunisia I created and delivered a workshop for +300 young people in one of our leadership conferences to make them understand the SDGs and how we can achieve them. At the end of the workshop I launched a campaign for them to educate their social media followers about the SDGs. Ouput of the campaign can be found by clicking on the picture in the right. \n \nReach of this campaign: +10k reached. ",
