    "summary": "I am doing the master of science Earth and Environment. I am broadly interested, enthusiast about most topics in this extensive master's program. I especially like the carbon cycle - particularly the emissions-, wetlands, droughts and  forest fires, and in general feedback systems: how a small change can have an influence on this earth. \nI like to look at topics from several angles, using different disciplines that were included in my studies: hydrology, water quality, soil sciences, atmospheric sciences and earth system sciences. \n\nI was chair for several committees that were part of my student association Pyrus, and dove deeper into forest fires and leadership when I joined the University's Honours program during my bachelor.  \nAlso, I went on an exchange to Troms\u00f8, Norway, during my bachelor and to Louisville, Kentucky, US, for my master thesis.\n\nIn addition I do volunteering work, being a leader of a group of scouts for the Scouting Rambonnetgroup in Zeist. I have been doing so for 4 years, and I am happy to now also be the internal team leader, as well as part of the foundation board.",
