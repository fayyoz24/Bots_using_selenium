    "summary": "I care about embodied wellbeing and the ripple effect we have on the bigger body of our Earth. My passion and experience is at the intersection of where wellbeing meets the workplace. By empowering humans and teams towards authentic, truth centric and playful collaboration, our organisations and communities bloom from the inside out. \n\nHow? \nBy preparing the soil. Intentionally creating and stewarding psychologically safe and brave spaces. A space with permission to play, be vulnerable, inquire and meet the edges of our comfort zone. In my experience , the commonly desired team objectives of improved innovation, creativity and productivity are merely the fruits of healthy soil.",

My idea was inspired by the Japanese company I worked for as an independent consultant. Bob Proctor organized a \u2018BIG day\u2019 every month where the consultants of all the 35 countries, the company operates, focused on communicating the message of the company to as much people as possible and make the deal. I translated this idea into a \u2018BIG day\u2019 for Effectory where I took synergy, momentum and out of the box thinking as the core values. Together with Maaike Vos, the HR manager, I organized a day where all our 140 employees did at least one thing they had never done before. We allocated the employees randomly to eight different teams. Each team had to join four workshops, all based on expressing yourself or the message of Effectory. For example, they had to record an elevator pitch in the elevator. Or call potential clients to make an appointment, something most of us had never done before. BIG day became a BIG success. I definitely experienced synergy during the preparations, but also on that day. I still receive positive feedback from employees about this day. And Effectory is still organising a BIG day every year.    ",

A vast journey of enquiry into the science of yoga & mindfulness followed and I have been facilitating yoga for the last 6 years. Most recently at Space Studio in Wellington. \n\n\u2018Play and curiosity\u2019 is her mantra and she invites you to explore new pathways of movement and connection in our human body and our wider earth body \u2018Terra Soma\u2019. I look forward to exploring new pathways of movement and connection together with you!\n\nMy accreditation is with Awakening Arts, School of Yoga & Eco-Somatic Therapies. \nRYT 400 Embodied Flow\u2122 & Terra Soma Yoga.",
