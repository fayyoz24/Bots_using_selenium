    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b Hi there! \n\nI\u2019m passionate for crafting workplaces where individuals can be their best selves, so I\u2019ve just started a new role as a People & Culture Specialist at nuud, where I'm dedicated to making that vision a reality. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nMy journey has led me from my role as the Talent Academy Manager at Sana Commerce (a SaaS scale-up), where I had the incredible opportunity to shape and lead a team of 9 dedicated working students. Together, we dived into a diverse array of impactful business projects spanning across Sana Commerce's global departments. From our headquarters in Rotterdam to our international offices in Dubai and Medellin, I take pride in being a part of the journey in building an exceptional global student team that was all about making a meaningful impact on a worldwide scale. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude80\n\nWith a commitment to fostering vibrant company cultures, I now find myself at nuud, creators of a vegan anti-odorant revolutionizing freshness. As the go-to person for HR-related matters, I'm dedicated to optimizing individual, team, and organizational performance. My goal is to ensure everyone's growth and happiness, crafting a workplace where everyone can be their best selves.\n\nIf you're interested in chatting about anything and everything HR, let's connect! \ud83e\udd17",
