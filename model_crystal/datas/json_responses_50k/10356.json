It is a transversal field that includes engineered cells, and engineered tissues, aiming to re-create, replace, and restore a whole or partial organ. As a dynamic field, tissue engineering constantly evolves and integrates new research areas such as nanotechnology and 3D printing.\n\nAccording to the PubMed database, over 150 000 papers on tissue engineering have been published in the last 30 years. However, few of the proposed solutions ended in real-world applications. Many projects suffer from technical limitations such as the inability to reproduce native mechanical properties, cellular complexity, safety, and the lifespan of tissue engineering products. With the correct feedback and investors, it is possible to ensure that promising ideas have clinical application. This Special Issue aims to provide more visibility to proof-of-concept studies in order to receive feedback from the scientific community.\n\nTargeting cutting-edge research in tissue engineering may help find new ways to tackle important health conditions in terms of their diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines/special_issues/Tissue_Engineer"
