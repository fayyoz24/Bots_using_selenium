    "summary": "My name is John Paul Cook. I am a teenager from San Diego, California. I enjoy surfing, drawing, playing sports, thrift shopping, creating new outfits, exploring cities, traveling, looking at buildings, taking train trips, finding new music, learning new words, writing poems and stories, doodling in my notebooks, and thinking. I am inspired by several different subjects such as music that reminds me of my childhood, architecture and how it sends a message to the public, and the show The Twilight Zone. I allow these subjects to affect me and my work in everything I do. I find myself having deep interest in what others would consider strange. I have a fascination with chairs, trains, and typography. Why would anyone care so much about the way letters and words look? I believe it is because they are things we interact with everyday without noticing. I scrutinize small details and bits of information and love to create things with my own hands. Wether it be with a pen and paper, a software and mouse, or hammer and nails. I think this is why I love design and became a design student.",
