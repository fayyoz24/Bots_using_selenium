By competing in the Boeing GoFly Challenge, we hope to inspire inventors and creators to take on the next step. Our vehicle is designed as a flying motorcycle, bringing together speed and agility whilst being ultra quiet. \nMy position was to help raise funds, and develop a strategy towards potentially creating a spinoff. Two spinoffs were created: Shore and Titan Batteries.\n\nIn the end, we managed to showcase a real-scale flying Silverwing S1 at the Boeing GoFly Competition in Silicon Valley! The device is 2.6 meters high, and able to take-off and land vertically.\nIt was an amazing project.",
