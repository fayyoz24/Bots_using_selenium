    "summary": "Jacinta has been passionate about health & wellbeing from a young age. She started practicing yoga in her early teenage years through her mum, an experienced yoga teacher herself. Her interest in health resulted in a Bachelor and Master in Health Sciences in Amsterdam \u2013 including extensive travel to Africa while doing voluntary work or internships. In the meantime she came across The Journey, a healing method developed by Brandon Bays. She was astonished by this powerful and effective, yet simple process to get rid of emotional, mental and physical unhealthy luggage or basically clutter of any kind. Jacinta loves to work with people from different backgrounds while creating a healthy and happy life and writes on her blog to share her ideas about health, wellbeing and yoga. After living in New Zealand for 7 years, she moved back to her home country, The Netherlands in 2018. She is open to and interested in new challenges and experiences in Waalwijk and surroundings. She is an experienced Yoga teacher, meditation lover, Health promoter amd Journey therapist. Read more : www.yogametjacinta.nl",
