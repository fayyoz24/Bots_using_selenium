    "summary": "From a young age, I've had an insatiable curiosity about the world around me. I'm motivated by new experiences and challenging myself to grow and evolve. This led to me living in three different countries in the last few years: Brazil, Denmark, and now The Netherlands. This also led me to pursue a career in which I can connect with others and learn about their experiences and perspectives, as it opens up a whole new world of knowledge and understanding.\n\nThat's why I'm so passionate about building relationships and fostering connections in everything I do, whether it's in my personal life or in my work as a professional. It's not just about networking or making small talk - it's about finding common ground, sharing experiences, and learning from each other in a deep and meaningful way.\n\nWith 5 years of experience managing key accounts in the SaaS environment, I have a natural curiosity that drives me to ask insightful questions and seek out innovative solutions to complex problems. My deep sense of empathy and data-driven approach have allowed me to build and maintain strong relationships, positioning me as a trusted advisor.",
