    "summary": "Holder of a master degree in Chemistry and London Business School Senior Executive Program alumnus I have occupied several senior management positions in international companies from different industries like Pharmaceuticals, Medical, Chemicals, Engineering and lately Nanocoating industry.\n\nOver the years I have developed a good understanding of what globalization means by having worked in Europe, North America and Asia.  Such international exposure has required me to remain open minded, flexible and has constantly pushed me out of my comfort zone.\n\nMy various responsibilities have taught me to manage remote global teams. They have also allowed me to develop my self-awareness skills, to delegate to team members and to trust their expertise.\n\nExposure to the dynamic and competitive Asian business environment forced me to develop and implement adequate commercial strategies based on strong customer focus, cost competitiveness for commodity products and collaborative innovation for new business development.",
