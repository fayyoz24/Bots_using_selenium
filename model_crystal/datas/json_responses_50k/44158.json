    "summary": "I am a graduate Chemical Engineer from the University of Granada with a strong focus on business and engineering projects. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's thesis in Business Development at AGC Biologics, where I also work as a Student Assistant for Project Management. This unique opportunity allows me to apply my knowledge and skills in a practical setting while conducting research in the field of business development.\n\nIn addition to my technical background, I have also expanded my expertise through an MBA semester at the University of Newcastle in Sydney, where I immersed myself in International Business and Management courses. This experience has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of the global business landscape and the intersection between engineering and business.\n\nWith a 2-year master's program in Industrial Engineering and Management from the Technical University of Denmark, I have gained a solid foundation in the principles of engineering and management. Combining my academic pursuits with my part-time role at AGC Biologics, I am actively engaged in bridging the gap between business and engineering. My aim is to help individuals and organizations solve problems and drive their overall business performance.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep interest in the interface between business and engineering. I am passionate about making a positive and sustainable impact on the world. I thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments, and I am motivated to work alongside ambitious colleagues who share my drive for success.\n\nHaving studied as an international student at the University of New Mexico and gained international working experiences, I have embraced diverse cultures and worked in multicultural teams. This exposure has honed my adaptability and provided me with a broader perspective on life. I am continuously curious about emerging technologies and actively contribute to SDGs.\n\nIn my professional endeavors, I am known for my considerate and reliable nature. I approach tasks with a well-organized mindset to ensure productivity and overcome challenges. I believe that the skills I have acquired in the competitive university environment define me and will serve as a strong foundation for implementing innovative ideas.\n\nUltimately, my career goal is to create an inclusive environment where individuals can thrive. I am committed to utilizing my expertise in project management, business development, and engineering to drive growth and success for both individuals and organizations.",
