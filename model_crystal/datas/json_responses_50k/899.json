I learnt more than just elements of the work environment and aspects of my department, but also general guidance on finding the perfect course or profession to pursue in the future. I also learnt about vital basics on Economics to prepare me for the future IB subject, and also aspects of the business and economics in a multi-national corporation with first hand experience to these elements.

                    "description": "In this work experience, I worked as an Intern for the FNA Group (which the Cocoa Trees is a subsidiary of) in their Singapore Headquarters. The FNA group is a company which exports and imports chocolate and other sweets, from other countries to other countries, from warehouse to shops with care and efficiency. I worked from the 12 March 2018 to the 23 March 2018, from Monday to Friday with 9am - 6pm working hours, as an intern in multiple different departments in the company like logistics, distribution, marketing, retailing and sales throughout the two weeks. This gave me a great insight onto how a professional career would look like and I am very appreciative towards my employers whom treated me with great respect which permitted me to integrate comfortably on my first experience working at a workplace environment.",

We do so, by going into the local Buckenhofer Forst and collecting litter, cleansing the Forest from pollution preventing this litter from affecting animals, and the nature whom live in this environment, and also from affecting one's well-being when walking or exercising in the forest."
