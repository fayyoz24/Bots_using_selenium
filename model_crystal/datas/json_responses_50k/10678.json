    "summary": "Throughout my career, I have worked in both community and research settings to better understand and help improve service systems for children with special needs. I am currently a PhD candidate in Educational Sciences, within the LEARN! interdisciplinary research institute at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In this position, I study the educational trajectories of pupils with special educational needs and the factors that influence them, with my advisors Prof. dr. Martijn Meeter (VU Amsterdam), Dr. Mari\u00ebtte Huizinga (VU Amsterdam), and Dr. Anika Bexkens (Universiteit Leiden).\n\nDuring and after my master\u2019s studies, I was a research assistant under Dr. Jessica Suhrheinrich at San Diego State University within the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC), a multi-institution research consortium. Within this role, I studied the implementation of evidence-based practices (research-practice gap) for pupils with autism in schools. I co-authored three peer-reviewed research articles, one of which is a first author paper. I also presented the outcomes of our projects at international research conferences. \n\nI have also worked in schools and clinical centers, creating and implementing behavior support plans for children and adolescents with autism and other developmental disabilities for almost 10 years. \n\nI moved from California to Amsterdam, Netherlands in the fall of 2019. After moving, I continued working remotely on in-preparation manuscripts for American research projects, while continuing my clinical career within the Dutch system (as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst) up until I started the PhD candidate position.",
