I work with all kinds of companies, helping them with their technology stack. This can be anything: data and machine learning (my favourite topic), automation, HPC, engineering processes and everything in between.\n\nMy strength is explaining technical concepts so even my grandparents can understand it. Empowering people through technology is something that energizes me and getting more diversity in the field is something that I\u2019m passionate about.\n\nThere are a lot of things that I\u2019m proud of: successful and useful implementations of tech, sharing my learnings at events and meetups and empowering people around me to get into tech and mentor (both soft- and hard skills) to succeed in their field.\n\nThen there are things my managers are happy about: growing cloud revenue, enabling and managing growth in Azure workloads, creating AI workshops on Western Europe level and collaborating internationally in both tech and business.",
