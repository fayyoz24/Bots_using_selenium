    "summary": "Hey! Hello!\n\nI am a young professional with a passion for finding meaningful work for people. I am motivated to develop my knowledge and experience as I travel through the wonderful commercial world. I personally value learning from others and building real connections. Getting to know the passions and ambitions of others strengthens my own goals and motivates me to keep getting better. I believe in getting results, but these results should be accompanied by fun and respect in the process.\n\nMy ambition is to be able to apply and further develop my knowledge in an ambitious organization that seizes and provides opportunities. \n\nI am a big believer in setting goals and either going on untill they are achieved, or die trying. Actions rather than words. I also believe in the constant development of a person. Self-development comes first, and I am always willing to learn something new. Whether this is by reading books, listening to podcasts, watching videos, or by diving in and just starting. A day not learned is a day not lived.\n\nIn which ways do you develop yourself? And what goals do you set yourself on a daily basis to grow? What are you doing to advance your career? Feel free to let me know and connect!",
