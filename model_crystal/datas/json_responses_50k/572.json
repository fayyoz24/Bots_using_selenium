I ensured top digital campaign production by applying inbound marketing techniques. My biggest challenge was moving away from a team of general marketers and restructuring to include highly focused specialities such as performance marketers, campaign managers, social influencers managers, and media partnerships talent. I maintained a focus on driving revenue growth through multiple digital platforms ensuring a stable and positive ROI. Digital campaigns included CPC, CPM, CPA in target markets such as Europe (Netherlands, UK, France) and the USA. \n\nDedicated to driving digital acquisitions & sales: \n- Leveraged SEO and paid initiatives to generate solid traffic growth \n- Significantly boosted digitally generated sales and quickly grew digitally generated revenue\n- Led cross-functional team of designers and web developers for website design revamp and product landing pages conversion rate optimisation resulted in 3X increase of online form submissions",
