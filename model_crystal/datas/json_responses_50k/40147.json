    "summary": "I am an analyst and researcher schooled in Engineering and Policy Analysis, specialised in analysis, modelling and simulation of large scale energy, chemical and natural resource systems. Systems that are characterised by their technical and social complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity and multitude of stakeholders. \n\nI currently work as market analyst at COVA, the Netherlands Petroleum Stockpiling Agency. At COVA, I contribute to COVA\u2019s effort of providing actionable insights on developments in oil and oil product markets. Prime method of doing so - especially in current times of great turmoil - is by developing model-based instruments that explore the effects of policy interventions and external shocks under a wide range of possible scenarios. \n\nIn addition to these activities, I, at times, present the research activities I conducted for Clingendael International Energy Programme (CIEP), specifically relating to CIEP\u2019s Cracking the Clean Molecule project. Find recent publications on their website. \n\nLooking forward to learn more about your perspective. Let me know if you think we should meet \u2615\ufe0f \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb. ",
