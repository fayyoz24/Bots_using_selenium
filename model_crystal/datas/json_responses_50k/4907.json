    "summary": "About myself, I can say that I am instinctively curious and open-minded. Early on in my career, I thrived to see more of the world and to gather experiences wherever possible. This attitude never changed. At age 16 I left my home country of Germany, to move to Canada and participate in a different culture and educational system than what I was used to. Not only did this help me to grow as a person and to learn to accept differences more, but it also enhanced my desire to learn and see more.\n\nAfter a year abroad, I returned to Germany to graduate from high school and then moved on to study in the Netherlands. My goal here was clear: pursue an education that allows me to live up to my desires for the future. Which is, to work in an area where I can contribute to people's life positively, to give them experiences that last a lifetime. Because of that, I picked the Media and Entertainment Management Bachelor. In a summer job that I have worked for 6 years now, I was able to gain my own know-how face to face with customers. This job I found at the Br\u00fcder Grimm Festival in Kassel (Germany) where I worked in a team that was specialized on creating a memorable evening in a fairytale world for customers. Even though the focus here is on the customer, it is also a position that helped me personally to transition into a professional worker. This job, in addition to what my study taught me, has made me a better team worker. \n\nFor the future. I am looking forward to gaining new experiences through internships. As of now, the working world is moving into the visible distance for me. Before that, I am looking forward to trying out as many possible positions as I can to determine which media sector I can see myself working in the most. ",
