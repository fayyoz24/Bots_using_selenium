I established the organization from the ground up - developing the by-standards, creating the mission, vision, short and long-term goals, strategies to achieve them, and accepted 20+ Music Industry and Business students to become members of the organization. Developed key relationships with local radio, Universities, venues, sponsors, and other partners to ensure maximum visibility and growth potential. We produced benefit concerts with local musicians, donating all proceeds to a variety of local non-profits around the Chico area.",
