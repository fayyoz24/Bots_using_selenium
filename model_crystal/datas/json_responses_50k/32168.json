    "summary": "Ki Balancing Body Field Consult.\n\nThe most of us do not think about our body other than that it should function properly, look nice and do our bidding. We use our body as a vehicle to reach our goals and expect it to oblige. Only when we start experiencing limitations, it becomes a troublesome item in our awareness. When you think about it, that is really strange, because even for our car we take better care.\n\nThe concept that our body is a vehicle or machine we have to our disposal, is very limited because everything that happens to it, is happening to us. In this physical world our body and mind are not separated. So to become aware of its functions and needs is becoming aware of our personal needs.\n\nYou could look at your body as an organic representation of who you think you are. An organic electromagnetic battery with its own unique electromagnetic field, feeding itself with organic information (food), social-mental-emotional information and environmental information. This electromagnetic battery, when in good condition, is able to transform all these sources to energy and (re)charge itself with it. In doing so eventually the quality of the imput will determine and (re)shape the quality of the battery. In other words: you become what you take in.\n\nYou can imagine that over time the quality of your battery can diminish. Due to damage and neglect your electromagnetic field will get brushed, scratched, deformed and it loses power. Then it is high time to do something about it. Rebalancing the Body Field can help you with the change.\n\nAs we believe in selfmanagement, we also think that you should become master of your own Body Field System. So we like to support you in this. Therefore we offer the Self Management consults, through which you can obtain the tools to accomplish your true goals.",
