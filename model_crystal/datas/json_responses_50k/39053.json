    "summary": "In the early 90s, after graduating from a private university in Vermont, I worked with Budapest Week in Hungary \u2014 a dynamic, English-language city mag \u2014 designing, laying out and contributing. \n\nIn 1994 I moved to Italy, 6 months in Turin then to Rome where I worked with Colors magazine for 6 months, consulted with FAO and then signed on full-time with Business Week magazine.\n\nWhen Business Week closed the bureau in Rome 2004, I began working in communications. I rolled out the international press office for the Italian SME Technogym, then moved on to work with A-Series footballer Clarence Seedorf while he was playing for AC Milan. With Seedorf, I truly created the position of his communications manager, organizing press conferences, tv and radio appearances, finely-honed coverage, and working on major events fundraising for his charity, Champions for Children.\n\nIn 2009 I accepted the position as business development manager for ammado.com in Italy.\n\nammado was founded by serial entrepreneur Peter Conlon and Anna Kupka to connect NGOs to global private or institutional donors. While the concept was born in 2005, ammado.com came out of a closed beta platform in June 2008. ammado is a truly new and dynamic platform for NGOs and companies alike...creating every day heros and heros every day.\n\nIn October 2013 I finished an 18-month contract on the Italian news agency ANSA English desk, and am now contributing to various publications, including All About Italy and the recently launched Libero Guide. As added feathers in my cap, I have recently done some punny SEO writing, production work for a food program and am working on a manuscript for a yet-to-be revealed Ferrari story.\n\nSpecialties: writing, editing, human rights monitoring and international communications. And animals of all shapes and sizes.",
