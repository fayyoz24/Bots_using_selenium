    "summary": "My specialties are HR consultancy, talent acquisition- and management, recruitment, contract management, change- and process management, people- and performance management and sales- and account management. During my career I have always had roles in which all of these specialties where combined. \n\nIn my current role I am developing my change management skills by joining relevant training, education and (peer-to-peer) coaching. This applies to the Agile way of working as well. Obviously I practice a lot on the job. I am also learning a lot about our new generation and about how to lead talent in this digital age.\n\nIn addition, I am a hard worker with a flexible mentality. I don\u2019t mind to take that extra effort and I love challenges. I am result driven, without losing sight of the people around me. My strength lies in building (new) relationships, looking for cooperation, and really connect with people. As a colleague and as a manager, I get people moving. \nIn addition, I am solution-oriented and creative, and I work in an Agile way, which allows me to build, implement and optimize new processes easily, ultimately shaping change in an efficient and effective way. As a result, I manage to improve the performance of myself, my colleagues and the organization. Furthermore, I am enthusiastic with a positive attitude and I know how to motivate and inspire others.",
