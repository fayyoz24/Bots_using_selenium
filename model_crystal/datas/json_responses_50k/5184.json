    "summary": "As a European Law student at Maastricht University, I am currently working towards being active within the international legal work field. Before I even got to this point, I have completed my high school education at the Lorentz Lyceum in Arnhem (Netherlands), a school renowned for its international outlook and bilingual education. During this time I have been lucky enough to participate in many extracurricular activities like exchanges, MUNs but also an international internship at a multinational firm located in Tres Cantos (Spain). With that experience I started my first year of university, which I have now successfully completed. During this year, and in the coming ones too, I have been an active member of a study association called \u2018Ouranos\u2019 and participated in several extracurricular activities like a trip to the courts in The Hague, European Careers Day and many others. In my free time I like to improve my language skills, as I am currently focussing on perfecting my Spanish.",
