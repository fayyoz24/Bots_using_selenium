    "summary": "Erik Bogaart received the MSc degree in applied physics from the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, in October 2001 and received the PhD degree in 2006 for research on the transient behaviour of excitons in quantum dot nanostructures.\n\nIn August 2006, he joined DALSA Professional Imaging as a Research Scientist, and is since engaged with theoretical and experimental research on charge-coupled devices. In October 2006, he became Project Leader Research. He has led various research projects and contributed to the successful introduction of a new CCD product family.\n\nErik joined ASML in November 2010 as Sr. Design Engineer / System Architect within DE SSD Wafer Alignment. He is responsible for the optical hardware and funtionality of aligment in Twinscan systems.\nAs of March 2013, Erik switched to System Particle Contamination Control for EUV systems.\n\nCommittee member of IOP Photonic Devices, Agentschap NL.\n\nErik likes the mixture of fundamental and device physics, and the challenges involved with the development of future devices. It is always exciting!",

One project was a pathfinder for a new CCD product family.\n\nCurrently, Erik is Project Leader of two (bio)medical research programs - STW-SenterNovem - with the aim of developing a CCD image sensor for SPECT and FLIM imaging applications. This work has already resulted in a World-Record ultra-low dark current in CCD image sensors. The results are reported in the November 2009 issue of IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices.\n\nSince spring 2008, he expanded his expertise with 3D TCAD simulations. This includes electronic and optical device simulations.",
