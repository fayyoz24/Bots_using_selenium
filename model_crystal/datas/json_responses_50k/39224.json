                    "description": "EU Constitutional law and fundamental rights\n\nEurope is perceived to be confronted with a rise of autocratic regimes and tendencies. In this context, academic research and media have reported on Member States relying on current concepts of European constitutional law that structure the interaction and dialogue between the domestic and European legal order for the purpose of reinforcing its own policy to (allegedly) the detriment of fundamental rights protection. Such concepts often established to reconcile European and domestic constitutional standards of fundamental rights protection and based on a mutual understanding of the minimum thresholds of protection appear hijacked by authoritarian actors. The research project aims first to map and understand the current dynamics of this novel evolution to the background of the rationales for these mechanisms. Second it intends to assess whether the current conception of interaction between the European and national legal order on the protection of fundamental rights is to be revisited in order to more effectively prevent constitutional concepts to undermine fundamental rights protection. To this aim, it combines legal analysis with discourse analysis which maps out the (changing) discourse on rule of law, democracy and human rights in Europe.",

                    "description": "Over the past years, some EU Member States (MS) have increasingly undertaken policies and practices that go against the foundational principles and obligations to which they subscribed in joining the European Union. Observers fear that these efforts are translating into a backsliding of the rule of law (RoL), the denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the renunciation of democratic values, which could have a domino effect across the region, and contribute to a weakening of the EU as a whole.\n\nHungary and Poland in particular have instituted various measures, directives, and laws that are viewed as repressing the universal norms embraced by EU member states. They are seen as clear derogations from the founding principles enshrined in the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), which have been reiterated in subsequent EU treaties, policies, and directives, among others. These concerns have led to calls to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty which would formally recognize that a serious and persistent breach of EU values has taken place, and could lead to the suspension of certain membership rights of the states in question.\n\nHowever, Hungary and Poland have argued that the criticism and the threat of EU-level sanctions in response to their actions are biased as they are rather critiques of the countries\u2019 constitutional identities for diverging from those of fellow member states. \n\nYet these arguments, as well as the currently-available counter-arguments (for example, those made even by some EU lawyers and judges of the EU Court of Justice, lack conceptual clarity and scientific consensus. Informed by legally-sound research, a response by EU MS or institutions would have greater chance of success in tackling the de facto challenges that are already present. Other stakeholders could also take these reasonings on board, for example the institutions of the Council of Europe, thus enhancing the velocity and efficacy of institutional responses.",
