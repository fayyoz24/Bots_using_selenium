    "summary": "Born in Reunion Island, I studied in several countries and had the chance to experience different cultures: I recognise the power of culture on society. A power that I find and appreciate particularly in movies/series and media campaigns. Passionate, I have always been involved in several educational (advanced studies), literary (reading), and artistic (dance and theatre) activities at once, whilst going to various shows and, above all, to the cinema incessantly. I have, thus, acquired a solid general culture, and I have been able to develop real skills in speed, organisation, and communication that prove to be essential in marketing. You will be able to count on my energy, my proactivity and my creativity to produce meaningful and impactful content.",
