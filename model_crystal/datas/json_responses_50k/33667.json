            "description": "During my gap year it was time for me to contribute to a community that needs to survive with the littlest resources available. I volunteered at Villa Ticca in Peguche, a small indian village in Ecuador. It was striking to see the 150 underprivileged children (in the age of 0-12) who all needed education, food, care, and love. I was happy to help these children as much as I could, and thereby my previously gained knowledge of the Spanish language gave me the opportunity to communicate with them."
