    "summary": "As a highschool graduate I was always interested in bridging the gaps between technical know-how and decision-making. That was exactly the reason for choosing Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management as my bachelors, where I learned to utilise and combine a broad spectrum of academic skills, such as process interaction, law and management. \n\nDuring my time as a master student in Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics I specialised in engineering logistics, with an interest in (smart) supply chain management. It was during that time, in combination with starting as a software engineer at MareVisie Projectmanagement, that I learned that one of the, if not the, most effective way of bridging the gaps between operations and management is ICT.\n\nPrecise, inquisitive and adaptive. I constantly want to learn and am always looking forward to working together with like-minded people.",

On the one hand, this effort should lead to countries using energy originating from renewable sources (RESs), rather than fossil fuels. On the other hand, parties should promote sustainable use of available energy. For instance, in The Netherlands The Paris Agreement has led to the Klimaatakkoord, with the ambition to produce 70% of electricity from RESs and only allow the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) starting 2030. \n\nThe increased use of RESs leads to the electrification of our societies, for instance leading to 50% additional electricity consumption in 2050 due to electric road transport and another 50% from residential heating. The assumed increase in electricity consumption is expected to put additional strain on grid operator operations, whose primary line of defense constitutes two main aspects 1) grid extention and 2) \"smart\" solutions. As these aspects are never a clear-cut choice, solutions for energy systems often comprise of a mix of both. However as we make our grids smarter and introduce more and more interconnected assets that can have a profound impact - commonly known as distributed energy resources (DERs) - on distribution grids, we open up to new potential adversary models. \n\nBRILLIANT focusses on EVs as one of the most important smart assets group in the energy transtion. The main research is on the cyber resilience of smart grids against cyber-physical attacks on the end-to-end EV charging value chain. In the end we aim to have better means of anticipating, identifying and responding to future attacks on our grids through DERs.",

While, decentral energy generation, often using sustainable methods, creates local over-supply. Following the trends of the previous decade, the central balancing party (TenneT) will soon be no longer able to keep up. Blockchain offers an outcome by ruling out the third party and enabling direct sales from supply to demand. The technology offers a safe and transparent transaction platform. In collaboration with CGI Nederland a proof-of-concept is developed that proves the usefulness of the technology for a decentral, distributed, peer-to-peer energy trading system. In my thesis research I developed an algorithm that enables electricity trading between households and electric vehicles, benefiting both systems from an operator's perspective, as well as the individual system users.\n\nI was awarded with a 9.5 for my professionalism and in-depth coverage of a multidisciplinary domain, researching both electric vehicles, power management in smart grids and blockchain technology.",
