By holding bi-weekly catch up meetings, and offering a consistent and reliable point of escalation, I have increased Serko's responsiveness to these clients' support requests and increased the clients' overall satisfaction with Serko.  \n\nI have also increased the effectiveness of my managing and coaching skills:\n\n1) Coaching - (a) Have successfully introduced a clear and understandable Coaching Kata (b) Have begun coaching team members in how to coach others (c) Have held fortnightly Coaching Round Tables with the coaches in Serko China where we discuss ideas on how to improve coaching methods. \n\n2) Goal-setting and Feedback - Rather than annual performance reviews, we hold \"Improvement Checkins\".  Team members are given ratings across three simple and transparent variables that focus on individual performance, team performance, and readiness for promotion.  Goals are set with the individual's career direction and preferences in mind, and are usually related to broadening their roles into new interesting areas, to learning new skills, or to becoming leaders. All goals are set with an eye to increasing genuine autonomy. \n\n3) Kanban - I'm passionate about Kanban and am continuously learning things.  As I do, I am in a better position to provide insight to how we work. In recent months in particular, I've led sessions where we've tweaked and changed our Kanban board lanes and policies so as to better cater to our customers, to foster an attitude among the team that \"failure\" is ok (if a lane or process is not working out, we can just admit failure and make it better) and continuous improvement becomes a tangible activity rather than an abstract wish.",
