    "summary": "With over six years of experience in marketing communications and relationship management, I am a passionate and results-oriented professional who thrives on creating and executing impactful marketing strategies, fostering strategic partnerships, and enhancing brand awareness across international markets. \n\nAs the Marketing and Communications Lead at Raffles Milano Istituto Moda e Design, I developed and implemented marketing and sales plans for the fashion and design school, leveraging CRM tools, email marketing, social media, and paid ads to generate leads and increase potential student numbers. I also established and maintained strong relationships with recruiters, recruitment agencies, and educational partners, providing them with training and support to promote the brand and products. Additionally, I conducted comprehensive market research, organized high-profile marketing events, and optimized sales tracking and reporting. \n\nMy core competencies include marketing communications, content creation, CRM, relationship-building, and partnerships. I have a master's degree in public and corporate communication, and I am fluent in English, Russian, and Italian. I have a profound interest and knowledge of CSR and Sustainability thanks to the research papers I've worked on during the recent years.  \n\nI am always eager to learn, collaborate, and innovate. Let's connect and talk!",
