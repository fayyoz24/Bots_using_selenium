    "summary": "I am a PhD student at Eindhoven University of Technology. My research focuses on developing AI-based methods to reduce the calibration effort of future automotive powertrains and improve robustness to variations in real-world operation. I have studied Supervised Learning methods for powertrain control and currently focus on Reinforcement Learning for Self-Learning/ Adaptive Control. I work in collaboration with Powertrain R&D team of DENSO Automotive Aachen Engineering Center, Germany. \n\nPrevious experience: \nI did my masters in Automotive technology from Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands, and I graduated with a grade`with great appreciation'. I did my graduation project at TNO Automotive, Helmond. I worked on development of TNO's Virtual NOx Sensor to improve sensor output accuracy for HD diesel vehicles. The work focused on heat release analysis and in-cylinder state estimation using the cylinder pressure signal (CPS). Former, I did my internship at TNO in the same project.\n\nI did my specialization in Engine Control in Control Systems Technology research group and have completed control course such as Modeling and Control of Diesel Engines, Optimal Control and Dynamic Programming, Model Predictive Control, Control Engineering and Advanced Motion Control. Moreover, I have successfully completed courses such as Vehicle Dynamics, Automotive Human Factors, Powertrain and Real Time Systems. \n\nI have more than 2 years of work experience as a Mechanical Design Engineer at a warehousing automation company; developing and designing products for e-commerce industry. I completed my B.E.Hons. Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani in 2015. \n\nI have experience in automotive vehicle testing which involved performance testing and test data analysis at test tracks. Prior to that, I have worked on 1D simulations of a single cylinder gasoline engine in Ricardo Wave.",

I worked on the same project during my internship here working on the development of Offline Virtual NOx Sensor version-2. The major task was to estimate in-cylinder states using the in-cylinder pressure signal. \n\nThe objective of the thesis work was to develop the Offline Virtual NOx Sensor version-2, which estimates NOx emissions faster than the existing state of the art physical NOx sensors and achieve a target in-accuracy within 10%. The work focuses on heat release analysis and in-cylinder state estimation using the measured high frequency and average signals.\n\nThe work in the thesis included:\n- Cylinder pressure based modeling to determine trapped charge states on cycle basis\n- In-cylinder charge mass estimation using resonance frequency analysis of in-cylinder pressure signal (spectral analysis, signal processing, MATLAB)  (optimization, parameter fitting, state estimation, signal processing and analysis)\n- Heat release analysis per cylinder to study impact on bulk NOx estimation using the Virtual Sensor. Achieved heat energy balance within 3% error for each cylinder\n- Reviewed and updated the methodology for in-cylinder pressure signal pegging to determine pressure offset per cylinder (per sensor)",
