    "summary": "I have a PhD in Human Geography (1997). In 2014 I received NIMA Strategic Marketing C1 certificate (MBA-level). I work as senior market researcher/advisor and marketer in the domains of Housing, Labor, Neighborhood, Care and Cure. \n\nI like to understand the choice trade-offs people make if their life-course dreams \u2013 housing, family, work and so on - are confronted with their own personal limitations and external market conditions.  It is not strange that I am strongly influenced by Time Space Geography with specialties in Individual (Housing) Choice Modelling, Residential Mobility, Migration, and Housing/Care Policy. These trade-offs are linked to the negative loss of people's happiness in their life-course.  I think that the Pursuit of Happiness - I use the utilitarian perspective of Mill and Rawls - is a driving force in people's life. By means of (gamified) experimental choice designs we can unravel the trade-offs and the reduction of happiness. Hence, any firm, organization or government that can realize people's dreams by improving personal limitations and external market conditions, is profitable. Im my view, these profits should benefit society as a whole (social return, Mill, Rawls).\n\nI am (co)-owner of three (business) concepts that are derived from my PhD and improved by others:  Bonaventura Model (combination the Happiness Model of Prof. Dr. Ruut Veenhoven and my PhD), ZorgToGo (Improving Hectic Daily Life of informal Care Givers, co-owners Joost Hermans en Koen Brundel) and Optimal Housing Construction Search Model.
