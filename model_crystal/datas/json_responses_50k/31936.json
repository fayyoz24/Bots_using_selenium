    "summary": "A highly motivated Civil Engineer, currently working at van Oord as a Junior Coastal Engineer.  I have two MSc. in Hydraulic Engineering, the first in the National Technical University of Athens and the second in TU Delft with a specialisation in Coastal Engineering. I have completed two technical internships, namely my first in Christopher D. Constantinidis S.A. in the construction site of Ayia Napa Marina in Cyprus and my second in Triton Consulting Engineers S.A. in Athens, Greece. Both were truly rewarding experiences, helping me to link my academic knowledge to the working environment and the challenges an engineer has to overcome.\n\nI have also volunteered in non-profit student organizations, co-organizing events with fellow students and thereby cultivating team-working, leadership and problem-solving skills, which are essential both for my professional engineering endeavours and an overall well-functioning life.\n\nAs a Coastal Engineer I feel responsible to contribute to sustainable solutions related to the present challenges we face such as the climate change and sea level rise which adversely affect coastal communities all around the world. Properly equipped and enthusiastic, I am ready to expand my horizons and take the next step in actualizing the aforementioned goals.",
