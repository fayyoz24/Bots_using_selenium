    "summary": "Postgraduate student from Eindhoven University of Technology with a MSc in Applied Physics and specialization in bio/nanoscience and technology. Currently System Tester at Thermo Fisher.\n\nMy interest in science started out at an early age, as I was introduced to themes such as nanotechnology and renewable energy by the First Lego League. Throughout this competition I traveled around the world and met many people from different cultures and backgrounds. I pursued this interest in technology further by studying applied physics and specialized in bio/nanoscience and technology.\n\nMy study allowed me to dive into the world of physics, throughout which I got to enjoy many interesting projects. Additionally, my study helped me develop strong programming and software skills and the ability to learn and understand complex matters quickly.\n\nDuring my spare time I enjoy teaching breakdance, kuntao and running.",
