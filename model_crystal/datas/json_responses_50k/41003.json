    "summary": "A Canadian-born traveller, I've worked in energy since 2010, in Wind since 2014 and blade-related O&M since 2016. I've worked both in large business and helped scale small start-ups (having established a European office for one of them) and am familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of each. My latest passion has been supporting our renewable SaaS clients with technical customizations and solutions to fill product gap.\n\nI've lived in 6 different countries and excel at international and cross-culture business interaction and communication in the wind industry. I value transparency, responsibility, and am against blame culture - Let's fail fast, learn, and move on.",
