    "summary": "I worked as a researcher at the University of Naples \"Federico II\" getting involved in different projects on both railway and road transportation sector.\n\nI was employed as a trainee first and a Phd student then, by Ansaldo STS for developing marketing forecasts in the field of railway systems, which had been consulted by firm's executives to address marketing strategies.\n\nMoreover I developed an innovative microscopic simulator of railway traffic to support the design of signalling systems and operational strategies.\n\nMy main objective is to work for a private firm or a public body involved in the field of railway systems, which can stimulate my passion for this job and in particular can give me an opportunity to practically implement some of my ideas (I think quite innovative) for the management of real-time operational strategies and the monitoring of both service availability and Quality of Service in railway networks.\n\nSpecialties: \u2022\tDeep experiences in techniques and methodologies for railway traffic simulation \n\u2022\tdeep knowledge in using commercial railway micro-simulation softwares \u2013 Knowledge and experiences in programming with C++ and Matlab\n\u2022\tBasic knowledge of procedures relative to RAMS evaluation for railway systems (FRACAS/DRACAS)\n\u2022\tRealization of an innovative tool for the microscopic simulation of railway operations and the evaluation of effects induced by infrastructural and operational interventions.",
