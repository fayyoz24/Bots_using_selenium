Which is why I focus on environmental policy making, advising policy makers on ways forward into making our societies fit within natural systems. \n\nI like to conjure up wildly imaginative ideas, involve others, and then make the resulting plans realistic and workable. \nWith a solid basis in exact sciences, ample experience in campaigning and communications, and a solid capacity to advise on and negotiate in policy making, I'm able to translate between specialists, engineers, citizens, politicians, civil servants and elected members or parliament.",

Typically, sharing systems flourish in urban areas because of high densities and many users close by. In rural areas, where more space is available, people tend to own a private car and rely heavily on it for getting around. Because public transport (buses, trains) is further away, as well as supermarkets, doctors, schools, etc. So what's the public case for shared mobility in such areas? And what's the business case?",
