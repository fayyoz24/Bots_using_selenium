Over the years I have grown in experience and skill to create digital solutions and craft digital strategies that really make a difference for businesses and organizations alike with my team at Studio Projectie.\n\nIn my view our fun, beautiful and free internet has been stolen by frauds, hacks and politicians and it is our mission to bring it back by creating a more sustainable and inspiring internet, starting byte by byte with the digital solutions we who work in 'tech' create.",

            "description": "Travel Agency Dim-Sum ran into the same problem that many long-term owners of successful large and complex (one might even say bloated) websites do. Google punishes those that don't have fast responsive sites and users prefer to visit websites on iPads, iPhones and a variety of other devices. However, it's often an expensive and difficult feat to upgrade an existing custom-website, let alone replace it all together with a new website. (imagine having to re-enter 1000's of hotel and excursion descriptions in a new CMS...)\n\nUsing SCRUM we set-out the preferred user-stories of the client and managed to improve the user experience to the nth-degree using the collected user-data and extensive user research from the previous version of the website. While keeping the original administrative options, content and wide variety of options and features that the previous website offered. \n\nSEO is important for all websites but even more-so for the highly competitive travel business. We had to speed-up the website using various Javascript techniques to make sure it loads in 3 seconds or less at all times (in most situations even 2 seconds or less). Given the fact that the backend of the site was build using reliable but classic and not-so-fast PHP-code most optimizations had to be done server-side and frontend. The result is a website that scores an 80/100 in the Google Page Speed tests in most situations, 20 points more than most competitors and 30 - 40 points more than the average content-heavy website.",
