    "summary": "With elaborate education in fine arts, architecture and urban design - I try to bring my cumulative knowledge from this trinity to every project, in design and in life. I have always believed in the duty we have to others and the power of art and architecture as a medium of change in society. It is my principle to include the opinions of users and inhabitants, as well as cultural layers while designing. I support climate-responsive, site-sensitive architecture to specularity, valuing also the role of innovation in material and spatial explorations. For me, it is all about creating meaningful experiences through architecture.",
