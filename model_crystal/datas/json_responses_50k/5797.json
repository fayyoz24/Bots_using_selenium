    "summary": "Currently working as an Aquatic Ecologist at Royal HaskoningDHV, where I work on projects related to water quality (often aimed at the Water Framework Directive | Kaderrichtlijn Water) and biodiversity.\nWith a data driven approach I help clients from different backgrounds to visualize and enhance the quality of water and nature by finding the bottlenecks and coming up with creative solutions. During my work I make use of several progams, for example R, R-Shiny, ArcGIS Pro and also several more specialized tools to assess water quality such as the KRW-Verkenner and Aquo-Kit.\n\n\nMail: bastiaan.velthoven@gmail.com",
