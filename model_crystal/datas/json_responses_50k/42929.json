    "summary": "I have been researching microbiomes for almost 10 years. My research on the evolutionary ecology of microbial symbiosis combines a mixture of computational biology, field sampling, and experimental setups using emerging technologies. I began researching microbiomes and carbon cycling at St. Edward\u2019s University in Austin, Texas. at St. Edward's University.  From here I moved on to Villanova University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where I collected the microbiota of the atmosphere with a custom-built mobile sampling platform for their masters. At this stage I developed three-dimensional city models to connect the shape of cities to the bacterial diversity in the atmosphere and disentangle dispersal processes.   \n\nCurrently my research focuses on the biogeography and symbiosis of microbiota and plants with Toby Kiers and James Weedon at Vrije Universetiet Amsterdam for my PhD. On the Dutch MICROP project, I investigate  the evolution of cooperation between bacteria and fungi living on the root systems of diverse plant species under stress. What is novel here is that a phylogenetic approach is taken, to identify if a core group of microbes are recruited to plants under stress. To this effort a high-throughput root imaging platform was developed to facilitate sampling over 500 plant microbiomes without disturbing the rhizosphere microbiota communities.  \n\nI am a data scientist at the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN). Here I focus on machine learning algorithms of global maps of mycorrhizal fungal diversity. Currently I am leading a global sampling campaign to groundtruth and validate model predictions in the world\u2019s least studied ecosystems including the Amazon Rainforest, Galapagos Islands, Par\u00e1mo grasslands, Khazak Steppe, and Tien Shen mountains.  My research has been covered in news outlets including the BBC, The Conversation, and Discover Magazine. I also engages in artistic collaborations with Amsterdam based InsideOutside studios, The Dutch National Opera, and Waag FutureLabs.  ",

I am largely working on how tradeoffs in mycorrhizal fungi and root architecture modulate plant health in phosprous limiting environments. For this I have developed a high-throughput imaging platform to quantify root architectural traits and marry this with microbiome analyses through microscopy, -omics molecular characterization, and imaging. I connect microbiome diversity to plant traits using a mixture of Bayesian, machine-learning, and linear statistical approaches.\n\nMy research also zooms in on how domestication has disrupted cooperation between plants and symbionts. I have developed global maps and a pipeline to identify where crop's grow best globally in relation to pathogens and pests in relations to centers of origin. \n\nThe last part of my PhD is focusing on mapping mycorrhizal fungal networks (see SPUN section for more information). I am leading the groundthruthing project to identify error in microbial maps using a novel geo-spatial pipeline.",
