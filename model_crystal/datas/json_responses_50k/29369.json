    "summary": "Currently focusing on circular neighborhoods and systems with organisations such as ESA, Border Sessions, and Municipality of Amsterdam.\n\nFormerly I was an educational researcher involved in various projects and topics including open education, instructional design, peer-based learning, online communities, and education for marginalized groups.\n\nMy dissertation focused on the use of web technologies to provide engaging learning opportunities for at-risk youth. Among other things, it provides a set of guidelines to support the development and implementation of student-centered pedagogy for early school leavers in non-formal education. A list of publications can be found on ResearchGate (search for me).\n\nPreviously, I consultant and designer of social online platforms at Dutch Coast, an innovative tech company in the Hague. I was also involved in the renovation of a school building (from 1912) in Amsterdam, and responsible for sustainability / energy aspects. The combination of two PV-systems, high-quality insulation, and heat pump systems (and no gas), resulted in a building that is 85% self-sufficient in terms of energy-use.",

Various schools and educational institutes from six European countries participated in piloting the approach and integrating principles such as trust, relevance, self-guidance, challenge, creativity, and collaboration in the educational activities. There were successful and less successful pilots (12 in total), but the outcomes were analyzed and provided a rich picture of contextual and pedagogical elements that influence the successful implementation of such an approach and how to address disengaged youth and provide them with the confidence and tools to enable self-directed and engaged learning.",

The solution to this was conceived as al controlled ecosystem in which plants fulfil several functions: they take up CO2, produce oxygen, contribute to the urine to water cycle, and are a source of nutrients for the humans in the loop.\n\nAstroPlant is a citizen science kit that integrates a simple hydroponics system with an array of sensors, controllable LED system, cameras, and other actuators to generate essential data about plant growth. The data, the designs, hardware, and software are made open source to engage any interested designers, expert, or scientist in the development of the instrument. Scientists at MELiSSA and the European Space Agency use the data in their quest to fully characterise a large number of plant species and cultivars. We\u2019re now working towards integrating the technologies into a low-cost, comprehensive and multi-purpose research instrument for researchers and educators.\n\nAstroPlant is both a science project and an educational project that teaches aspiring young scientists and explorers about space exploration, circular systems design, ecology and biology, plant science, (open source) hardware design, automation and electronics. It also aims to open up plant and agricultural technology and research.",
