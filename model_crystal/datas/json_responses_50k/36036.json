    "summary": "I am a proactive Aerodynamics graduate, with an ever-going interest to learn about new subjects and develop myself in different ways. My roots are in the Netherlands, where I followed the major part of my education. During my study, I got more internationally oriented with semesters in Chile and Italy. I realised that technical work is only part of today\u2019s challenges. Therefore, I chose to develop my knowledge of businesses and finances, as well as social skills.\n\nMy interest lies in the technical world of aerodynamics and Aero engines, and aircraft in general. Moreover, my ambition is to become a professional in every aspect, and to work in an innovative company where team work and hard effort are central.\n\nCurrently I am combining the my passion for technique with innovation at Adyen, where we strive to innovate the payment industry.

BirdPlane is a robotic air plane, based on a goose. It's primary feature is that it is propelled by wing flapping motion only and has a very goose-like appearance.\n\nMy contribution in the project is specifically aimed on the design of the tail. Furthermore I produce parts and help with assembling BirdPlane.",
