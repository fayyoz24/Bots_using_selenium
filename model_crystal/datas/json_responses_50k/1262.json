    "summary": "Being an \u219eEnthusiastic learner\u21a0 I always searched for something new, sought for something I have never seen before or ate something I have never tasted before.\nI was always a \u219echallenge acceptor\u21a0 when I was 11 years old, I went on a trip to France, with a group of 60 teenagers who I did not know. Afraid- no way! Excited- definitely! Do it again? - For sure!\nWhat is homesickness or fear? I never experienced it. Being an \u219eOut of comfort zone seeker\u21a0 brought me to Shanghai and Bangkok. Not knowing where I was- I went. Not knowing who the person next to me was- I communicated.\nThe affinity of trying new things, accomplishing goals and changing habits are still the core of my lifestyle. Walking with an open mind and eyes through the day, many thoughts come to my mind which made me an \u219eIdea realizer\u21a0. Anything I do or try teaches me a lesson and I became an active \u219elesson learner\u21a0. Failing makes me stand up again and move on.\nIn future, I will continue to expand my positive attitude. I will stay a \u219eSolution finder\u21a0 an \u219eopportunity recognizer\u219e\u21a0Out of the box thinker\u21a0",

The kick-off week of the master program inspired the creation of a solution to the problem. The solution is a community that provides a sufficient amount of swill to the digester. We successfully provided the owner of \u2018De Toeter\u2019 with a solution which he, a biogas expert from GasUnie and an employee of the Municipality Groningen elected to the best solution presented. We achieved the title of \u201cThe Best Pitch\u201d due to excellent teamwork under pressure and my presentation skills while pitching the solution.",
