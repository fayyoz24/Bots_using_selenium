What is a valid argument? When is an argument logically valid and when is it not? How can we determine whether an argument is logically valid? How can we derive a logically valid conclusion from the premises? Or how can we prove that a conclusion is not a logical consequence of the premises?\n\nIn this course we will first explain a number of basic proof techniques, such as proof by contradiction, proof by mathematical induction, proof by division into cases, and the use of invariants. The application of these techniques will be practiced by proving and rejecting simple mathematical theorems.\nThese proof techniques can only lead to a valid argument when the formulation of the premises and the conclusion is sufficiently precise. To express statements precisely, multiple artificial languages exist, of which we will learn two: propositional calculus and predicate logic. For both languages we look at the syntax and semantics and study how to translate expressions from a natural language to the more exact languages. Furthermore we will look at how to establish the logical validity of an argument in both languages.\n\nMoreover, to be able to assign truth values to formulas in predicate logic and because of the importance of this subject in every exact science, in this course we will also pay attention to elementary set theory.\nTogether, the course provides tools that have important applications across mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and beyond.",
