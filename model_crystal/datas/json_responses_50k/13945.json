True Price also guides and trains companies towards implementing the true price practice.\n\nAs a Manager and Researcher, I supported companies in assessing the true price of their products - and working toward reducing the social and environmental externalities. One of my favorite projects was for the Dutch chocolate producers Tony's Chocolonely, where we calculated the impact of their strategy to produce the world first 100% slave-free chocolate. In addition, I worked on several publications, such as the Roadmap for True Pricing and reports on the true prices of Jeans, Diamonds and several agri-commodities.",
