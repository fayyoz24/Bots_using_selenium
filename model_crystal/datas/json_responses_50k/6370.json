    "summary": "Trained as an environmental scientist, I believe the best way to accelerate the shift towards a regenerative economy is to understand that any business operates in a complex ecosystem and its social and environmental impacts go beyond its factories. Only by redesigning business models with these impacts in mind, we will be able to transform our value chains in truly sustainable ones. \n\nWith almost 10 years of experience in international sustainability programs worldwide, I am dedicated to scale successful solutions by working alongside impact investors and companies which are serious about halting and preserving biodiversity.",
