He had worked there every summer for about 4 years and was really enthusiastic about the idea of working together. When I joined in April I was not allowed to do a lot. Do the dishes and cut the vegetables from time to time. After a week or 2, I was moved to the snack bar where I worked for 3 weeks. Learning how to work on a tight schedule with a lot of people looking at you was a challenge for me. I always felt the pressure and judgment of the people that were there. After 3 weeks of snack bar duty, I was moved to the sous chef position, helping the chef on the cold side making sandwiches and snacks. I did this till the beginning of August until the university started again. This helped me to learn how to work on a tight schedule while making the dishes to perfection and satisfying the customers.",
