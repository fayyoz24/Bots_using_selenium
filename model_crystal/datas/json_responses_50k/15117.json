During this period I continued to expand the features of the Lumiad Secure Access Controller. The Lumiad Secure Access Controller is an Ubuntu Linux server functioning as a RADIUS server, LDAP server and a Certificate Authority. \n\nResults:\n- Deploying the system at clients and providing both on-site and off-site support.\n- Developing and implementing new features such as a Subordinate Certificate Authority feature. This feature enabled the certificate authority to become part of a certificate chain involving other certificate authorities. This allowed the system to issue its own client certificates and authenticate certificates issued from other certificate authorities within the chain.\n- Performing upgrades to the Lumiad Secure Access Controller. This ranged from bug fixes to hashing algorithm improvements to operating system upgrades. Each upgrade involved thorough testing, change documentation and revisions of the system\u2019s manual.\n\nKnowledge gained:\n- This project allowed me to build on my knowledge and experience obtained during my internship at Lumiad. I gained more knowledge about Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), network authentication (RADIUS), Linux systems, OpenSSL and PHP.\n- I learned to independently perform research on improving a complex system. I researched new features and upgrades that generated added value in terms of client features and security. I pitched these ideas to my supervisor and the director of Lumiad in order to get permission to realize them.\n- I learned to document changes in a way that benefitted other developers.",

I proposed Wim Bos, the boss and owner of Lumiad, to create a solution for these problems in the form of a model.\n\nResult:\n- Together we designed a model for RADIUS implementations that reduces latency and security issues and improves reliability in comparison to traditional RADIUS implementations.\n\nExperience and knowledge:\n- I expanded my knowledge about the role of networks, security and RADIUS within large environments.\n- I learned how to design a solution in a way that it can solve a collection of issues.\n- I enjoyed brainstorming with Wim Bos with the goal of finding solutions for our clients.",

This Ubuntu Linux server system functioned as a RADIUS server, LDAP server and a Certificate Authority. During the project I worked on resolving technical issues and developing new features. Aside from the project I also performed on-site Wi-Fi coverage scans used for WLAN planning and Real Time Location Systems (RTLS).\n\nResults:\n- Making it possible to connect the RADIUS server to a Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services environment. This enabled the Ubuntu system to authenticate users using Active Directory credentials.\n- Making it possible to connect the Certificate Authority to Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services. This enabled the Ubuntu system to authenticate users using client certificates issued through Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy Objects. \n- Enabling the RADIUS server to perform dynamic VLAN allocation based on criteria such as client MAC addresses or Active Directory group membership.\n\nExperience and knowledge:\n- This internship greatly expanded my knowledge about Linux operating systems, network authentication, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), OpenSSL, Microsoft Certificate Services, Microsoft Active Directory Services, Microsoft Group Policy Objects, PHP, Wi-Fi and locating devices using Wi-Fi signals (RTLS).\n- I learned how to approach technical problems and develop added value to a complex system.\n- I learned how to connect Linux systems to Windows environments.\n- I enjoyed learning in-depth knowledge about Public Key Infrastructure and network authentication.",
