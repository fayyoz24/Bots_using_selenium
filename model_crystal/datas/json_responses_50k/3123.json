    "summary": "When you experience a stagnation in sales.\nand\nyour sales teams is telling you that they absolutely see more chances, but lack the time to explore these opportunities.\nWhen you are told that the market is what it is and that \u201cgrass does not grow faster by pulling on it\u201d.\nThat you have to understand that sales is like the tide \u201cit comes and goes at its own pace\u201d.\n\nAnd you still want to grow your business.\nIn that case I can be of assistance to make your sales team more efficient, more effective and more successful.\nI work with the PDCA method (Plan, Do, Check, Act), a method that motivates and focusses teams and generates results. A method that worked successful within the companies I worked for the last two decades.\n\nIf you are curious, please visit my website Aim4Business.nl and fill out the contact form, drop me a mail via LinkedIn, or call me directly on +31640321470.\nI hope to hear from you soon.\nBest regards,\nMarius Hendriksen",
