The care for elderly is underfinanced and too few staff are available to work in the homes, leaving elderly in lack of social contact. As an expat, I wanted to contribute to the city that welcomed me so generously and I found Stichting NL Cares/Rotterdam Cares that offered activities with elderly (among others) and as someone who feels for elderly and wants to help them with counteracting loneliness and boredom, it was a clear choice. I have enjoyed going for walks with elderly, playing games, and accompanying them for cultural activities and I hope to do much more in future. "
