    "summary": "Upon graduating in Law from Queen's University, Belfast, I undertook a Diploma in Business Management at the Ulster Business School.  Subsequently I secured a position in the Graduate Management programme of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, working in the Department of Education for 10 years.\n\nDuring this time, I held a number of key roles in high-profile strategic and policy areas including a review of post-primary education and implementing the review of public administration through the establishment of a new Education Authority.    \n\nThroughout this time, I gained extensive experience in drafting and managing public consultations - analysing results, formulating policy proposals and drafting legislation.   I regularly briefed Government Ministers from both the United Kingdom and the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly, prepared speeches for Ministers and senior education officials and provided responses to Parliamentary/Assembly questions.       \n\nIn 2011 I took a career break to focus on my young family moving to Richmond, London and then Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2017, I resumed my career in Education and joined the PPLE (Politics, Philosophy, Law and Economics) College of the University of Amsterdam as Examinations Coordinator.  I have responsibility for scheduling exams throughout the academic year, ensuring assessment components are in line with exam regulations, liaising with lecturers and tutors to ensure all necessary preparations are made, checking and processing grades.\n\n  ",
