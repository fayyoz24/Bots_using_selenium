Therefore, areas of interest have been set up around selective\nlogged trees. These areas of interest, called plots, were set up following a\nmethodology designed by Jose Gonzalez de Tanago Menaca (Wagenigen UR,\nPhD candidate) and adjusted by Alvaro Lau Sarmiento, specifically for this\nproject (personal communication, October 16, 2014). Each plot includes\nthe logged tree by at least 5 meters, is symmetrical with respect to the fell\ndirection, and have an area of 40 by 30 metres.\n\nThree main datasets (see figure 3.2) have been collected before and after\nharvesting from the 10 surveyed plots. The first dataset contains dendrometric\ndata and it was collected by a mixed GFC-Vaitarna team lead by\nHans Sukhdeo (Project Officer at GFC). The second dataset is LiDAR data\ncollected by four of the six WUR researchers lead by Alvaro Lau Sarmiento.\nThe third dataset contains data produced by the HYMSY sensor, i.e. hyperspectral\ndatacubes, RGB photos and other positioning data. The UAV\nacquisition flights have been conducted by Dr. Juha Suomalainen and assisted\nby me.",
