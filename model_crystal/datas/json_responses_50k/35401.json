    "summary": "I am currently in my third student of Built Environment faculty with a deeper interest of Architecture. I see design as a recurrent process full of various challenges, which are incredibly exciting to be overcome. From my point of view, Architecture brings everything in one place and should be approached from both philosophical and technical sides with care. Studying at Technical University of Eindhoven gives a great opportunity to touch upon different aspects and create a diverse, creative way of thinking. That is why I enjoy it so much and want to dig even more into it: I love this wonderful ensemble and want to dive in it completely.\n\nI am a National Contact of European Architecture Student Assembly for Moldova and am trying to motivate other students get as much education experience outside university as possible. \n\nI love drawing, painting, taking photos and being a part of the theater. It is really fascinating to see the connections between different areas and just exciting to combine all of it in one place.",

Storytelling was a puzzle to assemble, and only when working on it I realized why: if usual architectural developement resembles a flow and is a gradual process, architecture of Soviet Union was refracted by imposing new rules. This is why I referred to it as to Refracted Architecture: with every political change built environment had to play a completely different game. \nRead more in my new post! :)",
