When danger is present, the group expects the leader to mitigate all threats even at the expense of their personal well-being. Understanding this deep-seated expectation is the key difference between someone who is just an \"authority\" versus a true \"leader.\" ",

We work for Startups & Scale-ups to help them find, attract and hire the best tech people in the world.\n\nWe are not your traditional recruiters. As a team, we become the recruiting department for a startup. We run their recruiting processes and find new talent from their offices. We immerse ourselves in their culture, work with founders, investors, employees. This makes reaching out to candidates intimate, easy and personal. \n\nWe believe Startups and Scale-ups are great places to learn, to grow, have fun and to make an impact on the world. The speed with which they innovate and change demands a lot of their employees. On top of this, startups need talent that is particularly scarce and hard to find: growth hackers, developers, UI/UX designers, data scientists, SaaS specialists. As we help them find that talent, they have a fighting chance against the big guys.\n\nI am responsible for leading RPO projects, coaching/mentoring colleagues and do end to end, hands-on recruitment.",
