            "description": "This paper makes a novel attempt at understanding the effect of nudge plus in influencing the dietary choices of individuals,\nprimarily residents of Western First-World countries. It undertakes a natural field-experiment with an unchanged subject pool at LSE Bankside, and analyzes the impact of information and commitment in sustainably altering meal choices of subjects. This study is the first of its kind that focuses on lowering meat consumption specifically by incorporating a behavioural change amongst the subjects, and assessing their (real) dietary choices. It relies on predictions of a strong behavioural model of impure altruism, Rational Moral-Choice Model, to evaluate the persuasion rate of information nudge and commitment-device at 11% and 8%, respectively. The nudge plus is effective on 87% of the sample, while it has a boomerang effect on the remaining 13% as suggested by the cluster-analysis based on the Bayesian Belief Updating theory. The findings of this paper are critical in understanding how behavioural policies can be made to induce pro- environmental behaviour amongst individuals. Although the results have to be verified in a bigger sample-setting, this demand led solution offers a unique way to tackle the ongoing climate-change and food security problem.",

The report analyses the missing components, and the biases in this report. It makes a strong judgement as to why these biases might have arisen, and attributes them to the limited technical know-how at that period. It also conducts a scorecard analysis, and finds that the SCBA report has a low score in both the scorecards. Delhi Metro SCBA reported inflated revenues, fuel savings, and lower than real congestion costs thereby leading to an upward bias in the benefits. It failed to account for cost of fatalities, air pollution, household displacements, sewage treatment, landscape changes, noise and diverted tourism. Thus, social benefits had a downward bias. While the SCBA indicated a social return of 22.7%, this analysis shows that returns were dampened, and must be less than the estimated figures provided by SCBA.",
