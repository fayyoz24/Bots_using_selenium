    "summary": "I always had an easy-going temperament. During my time in several different countries all over the world, I learned how to work well together with people that are different from myself. I was happy to make friends across the globe. In hindsight, this developed me into becoming a better consultant, which I experienced during my master\u2019s courses at Hult International Business School in San Francisco.  \n\nThe interest in consulting has always been present. During my Bachelor International Business and Management at Amsterdam University of Applied Science, I did my specialization in \u2018Building partnerships with China.\u2019 During the specialization, I went to Shanghai to meet with several companies to discuss partnership possibilities with a Dutch company. \n\nI enjoy bringing people together. During my Bachelor\u2019s, I held several positions within my student association, Ichthus Amsterdam, and was on the board of the International Student Meetingpoint in Amsterdam (ISMA). For ISMA, I helped organize monthly get-togethers and supported the international students settling into the Dutch culture. During my period as a member of Ichthus Amsterdam, I have led the introduction committee where we were able to double our members, led one of the weekly study groups, being the financial controller, and organizing the association\u2019s promotion. Ichthus Amsterdam is part of a national-wide student association. I also organized its very first symposium with a group of 3 students for over 100 people to help them move from being a student to a full-fledge tax-paying citizen. \n\nBesides the above-mentioned extracurricular activities, I thoroughly enjoy reading. During COVID-19, I started developing my creative side more by learning pixel art and am on a quest to re-imagine Rotterdam into pixels!\n\nLast book: \u201cExecutive Presence: The Missing Link Between Merit and Success\u201d by Sylvia Ann Hewlett\nCurrently reading: \"How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\" by Donald Robertson",
