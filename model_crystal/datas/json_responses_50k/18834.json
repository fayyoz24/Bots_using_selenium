    "summary": "I recently graduated with my master's degree in Neuroscience and Cognition (Cognitive Neuroscience track) from Utrecht University with a grade of 8.1. \n\nDuring my masters, I have completed two separate research studies using electroencephalogram (EEG), investigating emotional regulation from a neurodevelopmental perspective and the neural substrates associated with lapses of sustained attention. I am currently working with Julia Berezutskaya to publish a review paper on the feasibility of the BCI-FES technology to be used as a communication tool for locked-in individuals.\n\nI have a keen interest in the neurodevelopmental perspective of cognitive and emotional processing, and I am currently looking for PhD or research assistant opportunities in related fields.\n\nFurthermore, because of my educational background in Psychology (BSc degree), my ambition is to combine my psychological and neuroscientific knowledge to improve our understanding of mental health disorders.",

I conducted my own experimental setup with the students, guiding them on the EEG setup and experimental procedure. After explaining the EEG setup, I then taught the students about the basic EEG data processing steps, along with more specific EEG data analysis such as ERP and oscillatory analysis. Each student has the opportunity to complete the EEG setup and analyse EEG data via Brain Vision Analyser.",
