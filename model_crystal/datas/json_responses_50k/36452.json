This has been a project that took over several months, as the project manager I coordinated all activities between our internal team members, Group management, external relations and our publicity agency Han Snel BV. It has been an extremely challenging project with a lot of stakeholders, feelings and emotions but the result was stunning. A gorgeous new name with a modern and fresh new corporate identity. ",
