It is indicated that all service providers ensure that their services are accessible to persons with disabilities in Ghana. Different previous researches and literature indicate that the Ghana environment is not barrier-free and accessible at all and adjustments are needed. This report arose in order to investigate to what extent this Act concerning accessibility is implemented in Kumasi.\n\nThe research assess\u2019 the accessibility of different public buildings in Kumasi, discovers the (most important) barriers which people in a wheelchair, persons with a visual impairment and hearing impaired encounter when they go to a public building and obtains the consequences for these target groups of not implementing the law. Furthermore, the report gives information about the Persons With Disability Act 715 and its constraints concerning the implementation.\n\nAll this information is obtained through literature search, checks of public buildings on the basis of a checklist and through transect walks, interviews and questionnaires with the target groups. There were also a lot of meetings with and participation in activities of the organizations for the physically disabled, visually impaired and hearing impaired in order to optimize the motto: \u2018Nothing about us, without us\u2019.\n"
