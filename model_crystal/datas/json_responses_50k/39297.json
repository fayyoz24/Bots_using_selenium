My goal is to make my district more sustainable and climate proof, but in such a way that this transformation doesn't increase inequalities but instead helps to reduce them. To give a few examples of what we have acomplished so far: on my iniative we have introduced containergardens, strips of green that surround garbage containers and that help to make the district cleaner and more climate proof. Furthermore, we also initiated a prohibition on terrace heating, which is harmful for the environment and at the same time involves energy saving we so desperately need for affordable energy prices for both citizens as well as entrepreneurs.",

We bring together members of the party to discuss and to impact policy and positions of the party on a range of topics relating to sustainability and climate change. As a member of the board, I helped to facilitate this by organizing meetings with party members, politicians and governors, by writing reports and by formulating motions and amendements for official PvdA conventions. \n\nMore information, see our website: \nhttps://duurzaam.pvda.nl/"
