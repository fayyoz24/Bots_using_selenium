    "summary": "Most innovation leaders have an inspirational vision, an ambitious goal, and a belief in a \u201cculture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d mindset when building a team. They make sure their team knows what they do and why it matters. And, even though clear in their head, most struggle to map out how they plan to go about it in a way their team can follow\u2026\n\n\nGREAT TEAMS DON\u2019T MAGICALLY COME TOGETHER\nTeams, especially innovation teams, usually come together full of energy to get things done. They work relentlessly on trying to reach what feels like over-ambitious goals. The result? Negativity slowly divides the team, preventing them from performing at their full potential. \n\nThe problem tends to be somewhere along these lines:\u2028\n\u2022 Vague or non-existent business strategy\n\u2022 Chaotic or ineffective team tactics\n\u2022 Unprepared or misaligned team members\n\n\nTEAM BY DESIGN\nI help leaders design a high-performing teams in three steps:\u2028\n\u261d\ufe0f Assessment. Analyze the status quo to identify improvement points\u2028\n\u270c\ufe0f Blueprint. Create the structure teams need to execute the strategy\u2028\n\ud83d\udc4c Implementation. Embed an improved way of working within the team\n\n\nABOUT ME\nFrom aerospace engineer to management consultant, specializing in Operational Excellence and Digital Transformation, to startup founder and innovation coach. After working at companies of all types and sizes, I realized I have a rare gift for simplifying complexity within a business. It helped me build 2 companies, launch 5 new ventures, coach 100+ startups, and manage 2 global innovation programs.\n\nI believe a strong team is at the heart of all business success. Some see me as interim CEO. I like to say I\u2019m a Team Architect.\n\n\nCONNECT WITH ME\nDo you feel there is a mismatch between your team and your business challenge?
