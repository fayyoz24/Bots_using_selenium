    "summary": "Hotels are my passion! I do love creating an unusual and positive experience for guests. And I believe that the most important key to it is staff. A team is a face, a heart, an engine and a soul of any hotel. To create a core filled with love to its job - this is my mission in my role.\n\nMy successful experience in the hospitality industry (operations and quality management) allows me to assess a need of a hotel expertly and find an excellent solution. A training program is successful if it matches RPS results, goes accordingly to a management style and vision and brings a lot of joy and delight. These are pillars that help me to involve employees and keep their hearts burning.\n\nThe structural and critical thinking, forecasting and analytical problem solving skills help me to succeed in the very important parts of HR, such as recruitment and onboarding, engagement and employees' satisfaction, learning and development, quality management. I can always evaluate risks and take an action that would help to win all sides - a guest, an owner and a team. \n\nMy skills of taking responsibilities and decision making, daring to try new and opening to challenges help me guiding a team in the direction which is required by a company needs. I can generate ideas related to the development and motivation of a team to achieve positive results. I appreciate when everything is planned and goals are clearly formulated, so it is easier to achieve them either personally or with a team. However, chaotic part of the job can be handle as well.\n\nI am happy when my efforts add value to a team.  I am eager to gain new experience and develop myself together with my company.",
