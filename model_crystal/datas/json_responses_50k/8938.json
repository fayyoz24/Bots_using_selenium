    "summary": "Hey there! Ready to know me? Let\u2019s go!\n-a Taiwanese and an enthusiast of tourism, culture, history, and sports!\n\n-I kicked off my adventure as a student in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands: diverse cultural experiences gave me good communication skills in multicultural environments, fast adaptability to places, and a creative mindset.\n\n-The next stop: as a marketing and event coordinator who planned two large-scale picnic events focused on introducing local Taiwan to the international. The result? Improved project management and organizational skills, of course! \n\n-Hobbies are always along the way: traveling, street dancing, Zumba, and basketball; Something more relaxed? Reading, watching movies, and photographing heal me.\n\nSelf-development is my lifelong quest, and I thrive on constant challenges!\n\nSo, where will my next journey be? Perhaps somewhere you are? Feel free to reach out to me.",
