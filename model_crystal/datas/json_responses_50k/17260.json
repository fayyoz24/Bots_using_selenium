    "summary": "I am a native English speaker and have been living in Amsterdam since 1998. When I first moved to the Netherlands I worked for McAfee and Greenpeace International. This gave me invaluable insight into working for international organisations. \n\nIn 2002, I obtained a CELTA qualification (Certificate in English Language Training to Adults) which is the internationally acclaimed qualification for teaching English as a foreign language. Since then I have taught English for specific purposes for several major language institutes in the Netherlands. I followed this up in 2008 with the London Chamber of Commerce, Further Certificate for Teachers of Business English.  In 2011 I qualified for Cambridge assessment via the British Council. Since 2015 I have also taught at the Hotelschool The Hague on a freelance basis and am very happy to announce that I accepted a part-time contract as an English Lecturer with the Hotelschool The Hague in September, 2019. Alongside working for this renowned hospitality institution I will continue with in-company training and Cambridge assessment. \n\nI find teaching a very rewarding experience and I enjoy seeing students master language areas and business skills. To keep myself up to date I like to explore new teaching material and attend workshops to share ideas and skills. I am a patient trainer who genuinely enjoys helping students and appreciates how hard it can be to work in a foreign language. I like my students to have fun in their lessons as I think that people learn best when they are enjoying themselves. My lessons are fast paced as I like my students to feel that at the end of a course they have learnt a lot. \n\nI think that I can help most students, particularly those that lack confidence and I find it rewarding to  teach all levels. I like to push higher level students to really expand their range of expressions and vocabulary, and to sharpen their grammatical accuracy. With low level students it is great to give them the language and techniques to manage certain skills, such as taking a message on the telephone. I give training courses in the Randstad and Noord Holland. My clients include governmental organisations, financial institutions, banks, insurance and telecommunication companies.",
