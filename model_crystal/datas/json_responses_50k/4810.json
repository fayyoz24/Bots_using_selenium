    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn, let me introduce myself. First and most important, my passion is helping companies develop their sustainable longterm goals and helping them find alignment between creating value for society and economic growth. \n\nPeople ask me how I've become so passionate about this topic? Since I was a child I went down a path that led me here. Now as sustainability consultant, I am constantly striving to develop new skills by always challenging myself, taking the path which will lead to the greatest longterm personal growth. Therefore i strive to help this world to become a better place. \n\nI act from a firm base of knowledge. Being a postgraduate in Business Administration (change management), with a previous Master in Marketing and Sales Management, I have developed a skill set that is needed to create a sustainable company. I know that becoming sustainable, runs through the whole business, the businessmodel and is well communicated internally and externally. \n\nI highly enjoy gaining a deeper understanding how to develop business strategies, set out target marketing strategies, learning how to negotiate, and how these factors can help in creating shared value for all stakeholders. \n\nHaving lived in Holland, France, Canada and the UK show that I have always been interested in learning new languages and working internationally.\n\nSay hello personally?
