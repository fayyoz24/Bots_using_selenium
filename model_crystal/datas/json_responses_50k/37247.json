    "summary": "Experience as coordinator, manager and (legal) advisor in Constitutional and Administrative Law and European Law. I am working for the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service for 16 years now, including projects VSO (development aid), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (EU Presidency) and EU (Schengen cooperation). \n\nGlobetrotter with passion for Africa. Development work Tanzania and high school South Africa. Studies in England and Sweden, traineeship European Commission. Also in work internationally oriented. My drive is to develop myself, others and my organization. \n\nCompetent in management, advising, coaching, pleading, judicial reviewing (first and second instance and appeal, Immigration Law and Naturalization). My mother tongue is Dutch. I speak English and Afrikaans fluently en have a basic knowledge of German and French. \n\nProactive, communicative and decisive, focussed on cooperation and result, keeping people in mind. Loyal and interested in people and cultures. I share my knowledge and am open to that of others. There is always something to learn. Multitasker with helicopter view. Building bridges, networker and memorator. This is also the feedback I get from people around me, including assessors. All these qualities were useful in my advising role in Tanzania, where - in a short time and in a new environment -  I have exchanged knowledge, redefined my assignment, written and presented my report.\n\nI am participating in the Himalaya Challenge: a 6-days-trekking in Nepal (November 2016), visiting projects of VSO and fundraising. VSO is an international development aid organization, which aim is to develop a world without poverty through sustainable exchange of knowledge. My personal goal: \u20ac5,000 for VSO and to mark a sporty achievement. A part of the money received will go to Sisters for Sisters, who are focused on education for girls in Nepal.",
