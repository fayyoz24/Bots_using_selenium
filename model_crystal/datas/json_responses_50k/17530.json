    "summary": "ENGLISH BELOW\n\n\u201cGrote dingen gebeuren niet alleen door een impuls, maar als een opeenvolging van kleine dingen die met elkaar verbonden zijn.\u201d (van Gogh)\n\nIk geloof in de alledaagse kleine acties die voor de grootste impact kunnen zorgen. Dit kan een gesprek zijn met een vreemde in het park. Dit kan een autorit van een uur zijn met een persoon die je pas net hebt ontmoet. Het is een rimpel effect dat klein begint maar daarna zich alleen zal verspreiden als je het laat zijn. \n\nAls project manager verzorg ik de dagelijkse operaties zodat een mooi resultaat geleverd wordt. Ik ga door bij tegenslagen en vraag altijd \u201cHoe kan dit anders?\u201d. Ik combineer een goede dosis van analytisch denken en het onderscheid maken tussen het essenti\u00eble en niet-essenti\u00eble. Verder neem ik altijd mijn enthousiasme en humor mee naar werk. \n\nProject management | Communicatief | Verbindend  | Creatief | Leergierig\n\n---\n\n\"Great thing are done by a series of small things brought together\" (van Gogh) \n\nI believe that it is small mundane actions that can generate the biggest impact. This can be a conversation with a stranger in the park. This can be a one hour car drive with a person you just met. It is a ripple effect that starts very small but can only expand if you let it be. \n\nAs a project manager I take care of the daily operations to create a great result. When facing challenges I ask myself the question \u201cHow can I do this differently?\u201d I combine a good dose of analytical thinking and discerning between the essential and non-essential. Further, I always make sure I bring in enthusiasm and humor to work.\n\nProject management | Communicative | Connecting | Creative | Studious",

For this year's FilmLAB I had decided to follow both programs because I am interesting in making docufictions later on in my career. \n\nCinemasia FilmLAB Documentary track:\nFor this program I participated as producer where I had to do the practical work in order for my team to make the documentary. My tasks consider communication within and outside the team, make a planning and all-round help. The documentary (10 min) we created is called 'Unicorn Cat' which follows the life of a young girl, a daughter of Indian expats, who lives in Amstelveen. \n\nCinemasia FilmLAB Script track:\nFor this project I had to make a script which considers a bi-cultural relationship and focuses on the female perspective. My script follows the story of a young Dutch-Indonesian bisexual woman who is about to marry with a Thai transman who experience the last stress during their wedding day when a cake is delivered with two brides on top. I chose this topic because it is close to my heart and I feel that the story is approachable and relatable with many people.",
