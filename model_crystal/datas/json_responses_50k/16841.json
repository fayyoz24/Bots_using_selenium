I helped make the breakfast at Marriott brilliant by re-organizing our host-guest check in system to make it faster and more efficient. I also took charge when supervisors were not present to hand out tasks and needed to work as a team so everything would flow smoothly. My daily tasks included opening the breakfast, taking stock and ordering breakfast items, serving coffee, barista coffee making, cleaning and setting up tables, checking in guests, talking to guests, and keeping my work space clean and organized. Here I was able to showcase my leadership and teamwork skills.",
