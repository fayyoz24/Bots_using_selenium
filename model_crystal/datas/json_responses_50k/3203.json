I am at my best in a bustling environment, any industry with a lot of machines and people make me smile & perform. The trick is to trigger others to do the same and then smile and perform together achieving more than 100%. \n\nI am a Project Management/Operations/Maintenance professional that has an affinity with ships/ports and all things in the supply chain. The connection between these roles, is that each has a million little problems to solve. Thus creating a leaner, smoother organization with more efficient processes that give you results. \n\nBilingual by birth, multicultural by experience, i love to create and build diverse teams. \n\nLets have a chat, a coffee, a drink, a meal and talk about all the little problems we solve at work!
