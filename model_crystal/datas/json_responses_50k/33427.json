    "summary": "My main aspiration is to work within a multidisciplinary (and if possible International) framework, in which I can get in direct contact with project management and experimental design of innovative solutions that could improve the welfare of people. Thus, creating a not only challenging but also fruitful work environment, where I can apply and enrich my ample scientific skills.\n\nAs secondary passion, but not least, I am a gym instructor with speciality on HIIT (high intensity intervals training) with a internationally valid Les Mills Grit certificate. \n\nScientific Publication:\n21 publications in international peer-reviewed scientific journals have been produced as a fruit of an interdisciplinary work from 2001 till the present. My research field is computational chemistry, Peptide chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, applied to drug design.\nScientific communications:\n25 oral and poster presentations to international scientific meetings have been carried out from 2001 till the present. These meetings have taken place in several parts of the world, e.g., Argentina, The Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Switzerland, Czech Republic, etc. The aim of these scientific meetings is not only to exchange knowledge but also to expand international networks.\n\n[Detailed information is available, if required]",

In particular, our research has been focused on peptides with either antifungal properties or with the ability to control protein deposits that cause the characteristic brain damage in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Both types of bioactive peptides studied in this thesis have produced not only positive but promising results indicating the potential therapeutic application of these compounds.
