    "summary": "My professorial chair at the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague covers the field of international law and development. I see and study law as a major factor in processes of development and/or transition, either as an instrument of change or as a vehicle for guarding the status quo. In recent decades, various developments have increasingly exposed national legal orders and processes for tackling development, equity and human rights issues to the sphere, if not the rule, of international law. These developments include a relatively widespread intensification of international cooperation (e.g. through international organizations such as the United Nations or through regional organizations such as the European Union, the African Union or the Organization of American States); economic and social globalization; and growing (and renewed) ideas about interdependence and common responsibility for overcoming major global challenges, such as climate change as well as massive and/or flagrant violations of human rights.\n\nThis professorial chair thus focuses on the following, interrelated and mutually reinforcing academic fields:\n- the role of international law as an instrument of change and/or constraint for realizing equitable development and human rights world-wide;\n- the role of international organizations and institutions for realizing the right to development, with special emphasis on the development cooperation policies of the European Union;\n- the contents and implications of (human) rights-based approaches to development;\n- the role of global human rights instruments in supporting the institutionalization of specific national action for realizing development, equity and human rights on the ground, with, at least initially, a special emphasis on the track record of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nFor more information, see: https://www.iss.nl/en/people/karin-arts",

It is based on quantitative data from UNICEF\u2019s State of the World\u2019s Children and qualitative data from the \u2018Concluding Observations\u2019 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The project is conducted together with Erasmus School of Economics (Prof. Philip Hans Franses and, until 2023, Prof. Dinand Webbink), and with the Dutch NGO KidsRights. The first KidsRights Index was launched in November 2013, in the Peace Palace in The Hague. In January 2014 the KRI project was presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. In June 2014 an international experts meeting was organized at the International Institute of Social Studies to discuss the results so far, and the challenges ahead, with designers of other indexes (on Africa and South Asia), a member (Ms. Maria Herczogh) and a former Chair (Prof. Jaap Doek) of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, a representative of UNICEF New York and various other practitioners in this field. Since then, the KidsRights Index has been receiving ever more media coverage and has given rise to exchanges on children's rights with various groups of professional, and with governments and NGOs.  In October 2022 we launched the tenth edition.",

Pillay has worked as a human rights lawyer, national and international judge and served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights between 2008 and 2014. In my part of the laudatio (formal public words of praise) I highlighted Pillay's contributions to the fight for the right to development and on LGBTI issues.
