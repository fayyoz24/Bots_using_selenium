    "summary": "Passionate healthcare manager with extensive experience within the executive framework of hospitals and in politics. Passionate about healthcare, politics & society. Born leader. Social and communicative connector. Goal- and result-oriented. Gets things done.\n\nHEALTHCARE MANAGER\nI developed an interest in healthcare through my father, who was a medical specialist. Consequently, I was introduced to the healthcare sector at an early age. During my studies I focused on the healthcare sector on a national and international level. The choices I made for my studies and my professional career were based on my ambition for the future: to become a business manager in a healthcare institution or to 'dream big and achieve bigger': the role of director of a healthcare institution.\n\nDECISIVE LEADER | CONNECTOR \nTaking the lead and walking in front of the troops comes easily to me. I effortlessly establish connections with colleagues in all layers of the organisation and I am able to quickly switch between strategic and operational levels. I am a connector and enjoy working together to achieve goals through focused action. I proactively contribute ideas, and I am innovative in my ideas.\n\nI have a strong passion for my work, I am decisive and have excellent communication skills. As a result, I am able to influence and motivate stakeholders to support my ideas. For example, by holding many politically strategic conversations, I have been able to obtain substantial investments for the implementation of my plans at the ophthalmology department. I also set up a program structure for the expenditure of financial resources in 3 areas: real estate, medical technology and ICT. Within these areas, innovative concepts have been applied in line with the strategic objectives of the healthcare institution (e.g. Digitaal Gastvrij Ziekenhuis en De Polikliniek van Morgen).\n\nSOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY COMMITTED \nIn addition to my interest in healthcare, I have worked at various national and international social institutions and made a positive contribution to the welfare of others. Initially through voluntary work, followed by political-administrative positions within the Dutch Labor Party, and in my  role as manager of ophthalmology within the Northwest Hospital Group and chairman of Jong STZ. I am socially committed and want to continue to dedicate myself to helping those who are vulnerable.",
