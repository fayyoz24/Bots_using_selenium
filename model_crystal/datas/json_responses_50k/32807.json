    "summary": "I am an Assistant Professor of Location Intelligence and Spatial Analysis at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). I lead the Urban Analytics Lab (https://bit.ly/urban_analytics) at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. I direct the Social Urban Data Lab at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions as a Research Fellow. In addition, I am affiliated with the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for BOLD Cities.\n\nMy research spans the fields of city design, urban mobility, and spatial data science. I focus on measuring and evaluating urban design qualities that contribute to more walkable, sustainable, healthy, and welcoming cities for all. I am convinced that in order for cities to achieve their public health and sustainability goals, quantifiable targets and standards must be developed and consistently measured. As a result, I develop evidence-based measurable indicators, which are frequently co-created with stakeholders, to help cities transition to a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable future for all citizens. I incorporate these metrics into software tools to assist designers, planners, and policy-makers in assessing pedestrian accessibility, walkability, safety, playability, and other perceived qualities of the physical environment. To identify, represent, and prioritize the factors that ensure our urban spaces are accessible, welcoming, and healthy, I bring together approaches from urban science, public health, and systems thinking with cutting-edge mobility research and spatial data science methods. I am involved in several national, European, and international research projects about cities, mobility, environmental exposures, health, and well-being.\n\nBefore joining the IDE faculty, I was a postdoctoral researcher within the Web Information Systems (WIS) group, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS), TU Delft, between 2016 and 2019. I hold a PhD in Spatial Data Science from TU Delft (2016), as a scholar of the Onassis Foundation, the European Union Social Fund (ESF), the Greek State Scholarships Foundation, the Foundation for  Education and European Culture, and the A.G. Leventis Foundation. I have also served as a research affiliate of the Joint Research Center for Spatial Information (Wuhan University & TU Delft), and of the Joint Research Center for Urban Systems and Environment (South China University of Technology & TU Delft).",

            "description": "As countries take their first tentative steps towards loosening COVID-19 lockdown, society faces the difficult task of maintaining social distancing rules in practice. With growing numbers of pedestrians and cyclists returning to city streets, keeping a safe distance can be a challenge in many urban areas due to the way public space has been designed.\nThe Social Distancing Dashboard creates interactive city maps that show on a street and neighborhood level if social distance rules can be respected when moving in public space. It offers an overview of different factors \u2013 such as the width of the footpath and location of bus stops \u2013 affecting our ability to respect social distancing rules. In this way, it helps to raise awareness about constraints posed by the design of public space and contributes to decision making for COVID-19 related interventions in cities.\nThe dynamic and color-coded maps are open access and available for use by e.g. policymakers, charged with making decisions on public health and city planners, tasked with making COVID-19 related interventions in the urban space. It is also intended to raise awareness amongst city residents \u2013 especially those in risk groups \u2013 who want to navigate the city streets as safely as possible.\nThe overall goal of the Social Distancing Dashboard is to provide an overview of different aspects that affect the ability to respect social distancing in public spaces. It envisions to support policy makers towards designing successful interventions in the transition phase, which will be local in nature and could possibly relate to specific economic sectors and commercial activities.\n",

In particular, the ROUTE project had as use case the open dataset of the Athens urban transportation network, provided by the OASA (Athens Urban Transport Organization), OSY (Road Transportation), and STASY (Urban Railways) companies. The data include the full network of stops and routes for bus, trolley, metro, subway, tram, and commuter rail, as well as the start- and endpoints, intermediate stops, and full timetable of all the aforementioned means of transport. They consist of approximately 2.1 million individual records, distributed across 9 different data subsets. The ROUTE project followed the complete Linked Data cycle, from specification, to ontology-based data modeling, RDF triples generation, linking to external datasets, publication, and finally exploitation and use in semantic web applications for cities. Approximately 4.6 million RDF triples were eventually generated that were further published to the Linked Open Data Cloud (LOD Cloud). The resulting triples were additionally linked to relevant open datasets, so as to allow the performance of complex queries. In this way, the data can provide more meaningful information for inclusion in Smart City applications, as well as for planning and decision-making purposes. ",
