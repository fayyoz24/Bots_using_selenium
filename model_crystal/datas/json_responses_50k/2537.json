    "summary": "I am an experienced sales and account management professional with an interest for relationship building and implementation of digital solutions. For ten years I had various positions at one of the world's largest IT companies, Hewlett-Packard. This has given me extensive knowledge of how sales and business is driven in the IT-industry. I left HP Sweden in April 2013, when I moved to Amsterdam to be with my partner and our first-born child. I immediately started my Masters of Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam and graduated in March, 2015. After graduation I joined one of the worlds leading global financial technology companies, Adyen, where I lead a team of Account Managers managing clients both within e-commerce, in-store with focus on retail as well as digital and issuing. As of August 2023 I am back in Stockholm, heading the AM team in the Nordics. It is a great journey to be a part of, being at an amazing company with even better people!",
