    "summary": "I qualified in Mathematics and Physics from the Univesity at Utrecht (1968) and recieved my PhD from the University of Amsterdam with particular research on tryptic peptides which potentiate bradykinin (1971). I was certified in clinical chemistry by the registration board of the Netherlands society of clinical chemistry after a stage of two years at the hospital of the Free University at Amsterdam (1973). In September 1974, I joint the board of the department of clinical Chemistry of the 'Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis' located at the inner city of Amsterdam and retired in October 1999. My research interest included optimizing medical and nurcing effectiveness in accordance with the guidelines of the St Vincent Declaration Action Program, with the aim of achieving continuous improvements in diabetes care. After my retirement I continued my study of the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes and its relevance in gestational diabetes. I have published 41 publications with a total citation number of 551 . ",
