    "summary": "20 years of management experience, built up in various industries has given me a broad view on dealing with people, teams and cultures.\nHaving traveled and worked in 60+ countries, lived in 4, I discovered that in all these places, however different, I could apply three of my personal principles.\n\nSimplicity\nIt always pays off to make doing business easier. Simplifying processes, products, orgcharts, etc makes it easier to set targets, align teams, decide on actions, follow-up, etc. Customers and suppliers will appreciate it, most employees will love it; it always pays off, always ask \u2018why\u2019.\n\nCommunication & feedback\nThe most critical and difficult aspect in teamwork is communication and feedback. Properly giving and receiving feedback are key to building sustainably winning teams. Everybody can learn to do it, no excuses, everybody is in HR.\n\nDiversity & Modesty\nBuilding teams with different characters and opinions is not easy but ultimately satisfying. It offers the best chance to have meaningful discussions to come to good decisions. A degree of modesty is required from all, as the best way for a team to learn is to listen to each other.\n\nWork experience:\nIndustry \u2013 Chemicals, Paints/Coatings/Inks, Packaging\nGeography \u2013 All continents, skewed towards Europe with a sweet spot for India\nManagement \u2013 Business management roles in corporate environments\n\nStrengthsFinder:\n1-Context 2-Positivity 3-Achiever 4-Ideation 5-Adaptability",

In blokken van vier weken maken de kinderen kennis met zeven verschillende beroepen. \nPetje af opereert bijvoorbeeld in het ziekenhuis, neemt plaats in het verdachtenbankje, bezoekt het museum en bekijkt theatervoorstellingen. In het weekend staan praktijkervaring rondom de beroepen en de ontmoeting tussen en met onze gastdocenten centraal. \nDe Petje af methode stimuleert de ontluikende talentontwikkeling van onze kinderen. De kinderen komen in aanraking met nieuwe ervaringen, verfrissende idee\u00ebn en inspirerende rolmodellen."
