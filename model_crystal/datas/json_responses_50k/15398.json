This was achieved by optimising fermentation conditions. To verify protein quality produced protein was purified using different chromatography and ultrafiltration steps. Purified antibody quality was tested using a self-developed qualitative ELISA method.\n\nUsed techniques: batch fermentation, ion exchange-chromatography, protein concentration using an ultra filter, SDS-page, ELISA, PCR, microbiology techniques.",
