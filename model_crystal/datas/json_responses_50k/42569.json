The ETL Process was automated thereafter using CRON Jobs on the Amazon EC2 instance. SQL Scripts, and the logic contained therein, was created using extreme caution to maintain to integrity data on the Redshift database. Several Python User Defined Functions(UDFs) were also created for data representation in the required formats. \nTransferring petabytes of data daily, without creating any data tunnel, was a noteworthy achievement in this project. Swaks and the email notifications associated with it have made this a complete project with constant optimizations in progress.",
