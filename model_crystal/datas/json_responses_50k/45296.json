    "summary": "I live in Amsterdam Noord and I currently work as a software developer and data analyst at Gaming Laboratories International (European office, in Haarlem). I have traveled for work with this company and that is something I always gladly do. I also really enjoy remote working, whenever my position allows it.\n\nMy usual day at work:\n-> Development of source code for testing math models mostly using C++ and Python.\n-> Review of source code from our clients, in many different programming languages.\n-> Analysis of complex analytical math models in Excel and their respective technical documentation.\n-> Probabilistic analysis and advanced slot game statistical and jurisdictional/compliance testing.\n-> Generation of data pipelines for the collection of data/inputs.\n-> Coding of Monte Carlo simulations and statistical analysis of big volumes of data/results.\n-> Compile of results in detailed Excel reports and internal deliverables.\n-> Communications with clients about the testing and compliance issues of their products.\n-> Presentation of the results of our data analysis to our internal and external stakeholders.\n-> Source code review and statistical testing of random number generators.\n\nOn top of that, I also do:\n-> Peer review and debugging of the projects of my colleagues.\n-> Workload and task management within my team.\n-> Participation in the improvement of our internal tools and source code base.\n-> Supervision of all the math projects/tasks/issues from one of our major clients.\n-> Technical and administrative training of new hires.\n-> Scoping and assignment of new tasks and projects.\n-> Participation in process and workflow improvement discussions.\n-> Organization and preparation of training sessions with our clients.\n-> Bridging different teams from different locations within the department.\n\nI am very passionate and experienced about programming of pipelines for data organization, extraction and processing. My education in physics and math made me very thorough and detailed. It also gave me sharp critical thinking and a problem solving oriented mind. I consider that I have very good data analysis, graphical display and communication/reporting skills. I always produce high quality deliverables with attention to detail. I love both learning and teaching, which gives me great teamwork skills.\n\nI am a quick learner: I have already worked in two departments at this company and both times I learned everything on the job within weeks of starting. I am also willing to study on top of my working hours, to minimize on-boarding time and smooth out the learning curve.",
