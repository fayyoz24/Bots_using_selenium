I developed a methodology for DWC design and simulation in Aspen Plus (R). This methodology gives following benefits:\n- Saving design time\n- Accurate design/simulation of the intensified equipment\n- Easy comparison of DW column application with other distillation schemes/sequences\n\nPart-2 (6 months):\nDepending on the findings from individual part, a detail design of the DW column and its auxiliaries is performed with an international team (MSc). The detailed design included HAZOP study, optimization of DWC unit operation and thorough cost/profit analysis.",
