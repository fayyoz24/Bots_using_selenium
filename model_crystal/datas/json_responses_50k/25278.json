With the current approach it is not always possible to estimate a tax base, resulting in the inability to generate alerts and start an investigation. To improve the current approach for a specific population a predictive model has been build. This population consists of companies for which no alert has been generated, but whose case, treated by conventional investigation services, resulted in a return in excess of 19,000 euros. With the model we want to predict whether or not an investigation will result in a return in excess of 28,500 euros, which is the minimum amount for an investigation to be profitable.",

Belfius Bank must prepare a Know Your Customer (KYC) document for each of its customers. As part of the onboarding process, for most of its new clients Belfius agents fill in a KYC fiche. But also for the existing customers this questionnaire has to be filled out. As Belfius has more than 3000.000 clients, doing this manually would be cumbersome. For most of the existing customers, where possible, questionnaires will be prefilled by querying transaction data using Spark SQL and PySpark. Python is being used to perform statistical analysis and for data visualization purposes. \n\n\n\n",
