I completed my Phd \u201cA study of the complex genetic inheritance of lipids\u201d in 2016 and afterwards worked for two years in the field of heritable eye diseases. I obtained a master of science degree in genetic epidemiology and a master of science degree in bioinformatics. I\u2019m familiar with several programming languages, several bioinformatic skills and are used to efficiently lead projects from beginning to end. I would characterize myself as an social, reliable and dedicated colleague. ",

Genetic risk may be single mutations, insertions, deletions, methylated sites, copy number variants, and so one. By applying various approaches I try to dissect some of the missing heritability of AMD. Furthermore, I also try to unravel the association between lipids and AMD.\n\nAlthough my special interest is AMD, I also investigate the genetic background of (endophenotypes of) glaucoma and myopia.",

Risk factors for CVD are four types of circulating blood lipid levels: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). These four types of circulating blood lipid levels are highly heritable. Despite the large number of research that has been performed about circulating blood lipid levels, the genetic variations driving this heritability are still largely unknown. Most genetic variations discovered today come from genome-wide association studies, however, these variations are mostly common and the effect of these variations on circulating blood lipid levels are small.\n\nIn my thesis I aimed to identify new variants associated with circulating blood lipid levels. Therefore I used several genetic epidemiological approaches to dissect the complex nature of circulating blood lipid levels: GWAS, genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) and exome-wide association studies (EWAS). The GWAS was applied on genomic data of up to 150,000 individuals imputed to both the Genome of the Netherlands reference panel and the 1000 Genomes reference panel. These individuals are part of several population-based and family-based cohorts. The hypothesis free GWIS was applied on the Rotterdam Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study and the EWAS was applied on ERF, an isolated family-based population.\n\nThe conclusion of the work as described in my thesis is that I was able to reveal some of the genetic variations driving the heritability of circulating blood lipid levels, but there is still much more work to do.\n\nFull thesis: https://repub.eur.nl/pub/80008",
