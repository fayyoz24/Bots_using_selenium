            "description": "This monograph uses primary data to study the perception of climate change, factors governing the adaptation strategies employed by farmers and their risk preference in the Vaishali district of the Indian state of Bihar. The study finds that farmers have indeed perceived a change in climate but often attribute it to \u201cwillingness of God\u201d, or \u201cMother Nature\u2019s fury\u201d. Such irrational belief system often leads to limited adaptation potential. The adaptation potential is also governed by their risk preference, in the sense that risk takers are more likely to employ new methods of adapting to changing climate. Risk perception and preference is captured through games wherein respondents are asked to participate in lotteries of various structures. The study shows that the mode of eliciting risk significantly impacts risk perception. While risk perception depends on age, gender, livestock and education, the actual behavior of the respondents is determined by their household size, the presence or absence of livestock wealth and their level of education. The farmers who choose to adopt climate adaptation strategies comprise of households with female heads and young farmers who have access to institutional credit or specialized cards. The study also finds that outreach through social groups and community services for better use of farming strategies can enhance inclination towards use of strategies like hybrid seeds, or crop rotation thus improving farm output in the target area.",

            "description": "Economic growth is commonly understood to reflect an increase in people\u2019s living standards over time. Economists have measured this by using an indicator called Gross National Product (GNP). While critics have pointed out that GNP is an inadequate measure of human wellbeing, nations still use real GNP per capita to measure their economic performance over time while development is conceived as the improvement of Human Development Index (HDI). Interestingly, both HDI and GNP omit any direct account of environmental degradation. It is observed that economic growth necessarily harms the environment, and therefore, the implication is that growth must come to a halt in the absence of any technological progress. This raises important question as \u2018to what extent is continued economic growth consistent with maintaining a healthy environmental quality, which is directly linked with human wellbeing?\u2019 This concern has led researchers to devise several strategies to offset these inherent conflicts including sustainable development and consumption, Steady-State economy, decoupling between growth and environment, Green GDP and Economy, and Gross National Happiness (GNH). The objective of the present paper is to critically analyze this \u201cshift\u201d in the \u201cparadigm of development\u201d and point out the inherent flaws in these approaches. The paper argues that with merging of various disciplines that give rise to an interdisciplinary approach, the understanding of development has broadened over the years. At the conceptual level, these approaches have been well taken by researchers but in actuality the importance of economic growth based on rising GNP per capita still plays a dominant role in a vast majority of countries. It is suggested that countries must understand that a high GDP cannot be sustained and is a condemnable development, whereas a GDP that is decoupled from environment and that tends to internalize the social costs is what the demand of the development is in the truest sense.",
