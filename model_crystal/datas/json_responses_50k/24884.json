    "summary": "Ana began her bachelor\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences at Utrecht University in 2013, where she explored and combined several disciplinary areas. Having become fascinated by moral dilemmas of everyday life and the interdisciplinary synergy needed to appropriately address them, she proceeded with a master in Applied Ethics, where she discovered a particular interest in the ethics of (bio)technological innovations. She then interned at the Rathenau Institute, an independent research institute that stimulates political and public opinion making on the societal and ethical aspects of science and technology, and obtained her master\u2019s degree in 2018 with a thesis on \u2018Public Trust in Synthetic Embryology\u2019. \n\nHer PhD trajectory started one month later at the Maastricht University\u2019s department of Health, Ethics and Society (HES), under supervision of Prof. Dr. Wybo Dondorp and Prof. Dr. Guido de Wert (both HES, Maastricht), Prof. Dr. Annelien Bredenoord (Julius Center, Utrecht), and Dr. Stefan Giselbrecht (MERLN, Maastricht). Her research focusses on exploring the ethical ramifications of 3D embryo-like structures (ELS) and contributing to the development of tangible guidelines, capable of harnessing the potential of ELS as valuable research tools, whilst remaining conscientious of morally and legally acceptable practices.",

            "description": "Due to the need for filtering of the increasing amount of information provided online, users are becoming blindsided by the fa\u00e7ade of algorithmic personalization. The one-sided information provided by personalized algorithms leads to the intellectual isolation represented by the term \u201cfilter bubble\u201d. In the present treatise, I argue that this phenomenon is particularly threatening to the user\u2019s capacity of self-governance, i.e., personal autonomy, by relying on existing literature and conceptual analysis. In the first chapter I offer an extensive analysis of one of the most prominent accounts of personal autonomy, namely Frankfurt\u2019s hierarchical theory of personal autonomy. From this, I discern three conditions deemed necessary to self-governance, namely 1) self-evaluation, 2) perseverance, and 3) critical reflection. In chapter 2, I proceed to inquire whether algorithmic personalization undermines these conditions. It is my view that these conditions are, in fact, weakened due to the lack of transparency and control of algorithmic personalization. Finally, I conclude that filter bubbles are a threat to the necessary conditions of personal autonomy and I suggest that the ensuing implications are broader than they initially seem. Political and moral theories based on the concept of personal autonomy are, for instance, as much under fire as accounts of personal autonomy. I end with a call for action: to safeguard personal autonomy, it is essential to raise awareness among users about the workings of the filtering process; such insights may help users gain more influence and control over algorithmic personalization",

            "description": "In this Master thesis, I argue against the implicit, although commonly held, view that it is\npossible to successfully promote public trust in biomedicine. This argument is two-fold.\nFirst, I refute this idea by showing the infeasibility of successfully governing trust,\nespecially in the face of the ethical challenges raised by synthetic embryology. In\nparticular, it is argued that (1) the public is not a coherent body of people, with equally\ncoherent values and expectations, (2) biomedicine encompasses a myriad of specialized\nfields, with equally divergent aims, and (3) trust relationships are contingent upon a\nmultitude of intricate mechanisms that are difficult to manage. Chapter three lends\ncredence to this argument by showing how the ethical challenges raised by SHEEFs may\nfurther enforce these difficulties. Second, I argue against the idea that it is possible to\npromote public trust by enhancing the motivational aspect of one\u2019s trustworthiness. I\nfocus on three prominent views regarding the motivation required for trustworthiness,\nand show that they are ultimately insufficient in promoting the public\u2019s trust in synthetic\nembryology. Thus, I conclude that biomedicine is left with a significant challenge, for\npromoting public trust is both required and deterred in light of synthetic embryology.",
