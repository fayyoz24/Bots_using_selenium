During the competition, teams are given a business case to analyze and solve within a limited amount of time. Qualifying for the championship was already a big achievement for my team and me, however, during the competition, we were faced with intense challenges that pushed us to apply our knowledge in business strategy, marketing, finance, and supply chain to propose a variable solution. I am proud to say that we were among the few teams that were able to improve their scores every day.",
