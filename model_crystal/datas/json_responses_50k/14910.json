            "description": "Author of NIS2Comply.eu\n\nMultidisciplinary Approach: Many platforms focus on just one perspective, but by covering NIS2 from the standpoint of Legal Counsel, CFO, CTO, and CISO, you're ensuring that users get a 360-degree view of the regulations. Each role brings a unique viewpoint to the table, and your platform harmonizes these different insights.\n\nTargeted Learning: Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, professionals can delve deep into content that's directly relevant to their role and responsibilities. A CFO might be more interested in financial implications and risk management, while a CTO would prioritize technological solutions and infrastructure. Your platform caters to these specific needs.\n\nPractical Compliance: NIS2 isn't just about understanding the regulations \u2013 it's about implementing them in a practical, real-world setting. By offering insights from different professional perspectives, you're giving organizations the tools they need to not just understand NIS2, but to act on it.\n\nEngaging E-Learning Experience: Traditional compliance training can be dry and unengaging. If you've utilized modern e-learning methodologies, it can make the process more interactive and user-friendly, which could lead to better retention and application of the knowledge.\n\nUp-to-Date Insights: Given the evolving nature of cyber threats and regulations, it's essential to stay updated. If your platform offers periodic updates or has mechanisms to incorporate new developments, that's another significant advantage.",

This is also no superfluous luxury at the moment, the cyber security problem is still completely underestimated by many companies. He and his team therefore try, apart from raising awareness, to provide practical solutions in which the problems can be mitigated in a good way.

We talked and we had a interesting click. He asked me one question : &quot; Tell me what do you like and what are your strong points..&quot;. I answered with the following response : &quot;I like the unknown arena. Thinking about business applications for mobile operators and develop tangible prototypes.&quot; He talked about innovation and creating paradigm shifts for large companies. So he finally offered me a job as a IT/Business consultant in the DARE project. This project was something completely new in the Netherlands. It was all about finding the intrinsic value proposition from one company and combine it with another. To make this happen I was enabled to lead a small team(5) with people for desk research etc. We created a 3 stage approach : stage 1 desk research (by 2 people from Nijenrode University, stage 2 Business Case analysis, Stage 3  Find the intrinsic value and determine the low hanging fruits if you would combine this with another company. So I made all kinds of business combinations between KPN and several top 100 company's in the Netherlands.  This resulted in various joint ventures between KPN and NS,KLM etc. For each company combination my challenge was to develop at least 10 new concepts. These concepts were tested in the board of directors meetings at the DARE sessions in Den Dolder. Some of them are realized. So you seem them after 1,5 years TV in Trains, Business dating in the sky for KLM, WIFI hotspots on train stations etc. I learned that good ideas can be produced and implemented in a structured environment.",
