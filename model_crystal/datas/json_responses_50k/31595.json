    "summary": "Chris Dekker - The La La Lies\n\nSalvo City\n\nIn the Netherlands is Eindhoven maybe Rock City, but who is waiting for rock 'n roll? For real fresh pop? You need to go to the northwest! Alkmaar is really an Britpop city, and three young guys prove that once again: Salvo City!\n\nWith a mix of the best of The Kooks, The Arctic Monkeys, Babyshambles, but Also All Time Low, creates Salvo City its own fresh, yet familiar sound. In a few months, the band played hyperactive shows in venues like the Meervaart in Amsterdam and Winston Kingdom in Amsterdam and Victorie in Alkmaar and much more!\n\nThe regional media was right in line to greet the gentlemens. and as Joep, Nick and Sander are equally able to tear away from a crowd of young, screaming girls, they don\u2019t feel too bad for the press people!\n\nIn rare interviews they tell about big dose of life experience that they have on their young age. With lyrics that will hit you hard and with the catchy melodies, and there is no word exaggerated or lied. In Alkmaar and Amsterdam is the band name buzzing through the streets. The rest of the Netherlands will follow soon. The band is at least ready for it!\n\nBOOKINGS\n\nsalvocity@hotmail.com\n\n+31 (0)6 40 98 27 31",
