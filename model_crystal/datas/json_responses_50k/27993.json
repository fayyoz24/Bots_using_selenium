    "summary": "What has kept me busy? \nI''m living my life with my dear wife Charlotte in the beautiful Nimegan ,Netherlands. We raised two wonderful children: Elmar and Imke and having a wonderful grandson. I am working as a nurse anesthesiologist at the department of Anesthesiology in the RadboudUMC, \nI`m researching literature on the Cerebrum, consciousness and chronic diseases. I've organised several seminars on electromagnetic physiology and chronic diseases with frontline scientists. \n \nBefore I was drawn into Healthcare I've been a technician with electromagnetic skills repairing electronic devices in telecommunication and healthcareI. I developped a new Hypothesis on Consciousness and our entwined connectedness as humans as well as being one with the cosmos. Anesthesiology can be explained as an ancient profession of shamanism, while in anesthesiology we use medicine derived from secrect herbs , we guard parameters such as artificial breathing and blood volume/pressure , both considered in classic science as resp. spirit and soul. Moreover we are involved in keeping patients alive during resuscitation operations or trauma's and restore the consciousness proces after an operation at a daily basis and sometimes we sadly see patients die. I support stories of non-local effects of consciousness not because they are non-local, but because to the ones which experience them it is a profound and more realistic experience as real life. \n\nI've also studied Orthomolecular Healthcare, Phytotherapy and Bioresonance. The latest study I completed was a study on Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). \n\nThis combination of Healthcare and Technique lead me to new insights on Healthcare, because I wondered why electromagnetic physics were ignored in Healthcare, while the activity of the heart, brain and muscles are diagnosed with resp. EKG, EEG and EMG and the physiology of atoms is based on electromagnetic fields. \nOn this basis I develloped new ideas on the physiology of the Brain and Selfhealing mechanisms of humans.  resulting in a new paradigm on the ethiology of chronic diseases and consciousness. \nChronic deseases have a quite different ethiology than acute ones. The latter have often a top-down cause and needs to be treatened like that.\n\nMail me if you like H.J.Bakker@Glazenkamp.net",
