    "summary": "Maximilian obtained both his bachelor and master degrees in Mechanical Engineering from ETH Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. During his masters, he focused on Robotics, Systems and Control and spent a semester as an exchange student at University College London. Maximilian contributed to several research projects during his masters with one paper accepted on the topic of using neural networks for cost estimation during RRT* path planning to ICRA 2021. He worked on his master thesis in a joint research project with the Planetary Robotics Lab of the European Space Agency in the Netherlands on the topic of solving occlusion in local robot elevation maps using neural networks.  As an extracurricular activity, he served as a lead of the simulations and control team consisting of six students of the project Euler of the Academic Space Initiative Switzerland (ARIS) participating in the European Rocketry Challenge 2020 in Portugal. \n\nIn March 2021, Maximilian started his PhD on the topic of learning and control for continuum soft robots under guidance and supervision of Dr. Cosimo Della Santina and Prof. Babuska at the Cognitive Robotics department.",

            "description": "Autonomous robots rely on accurate and complete terrain maps for safe and optimal path planning. These terrain maps are usually acquired using depth sensors such as LiDAR or stereo cameras and are efficiently stored as 2.5D Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs). However in the real-world, rocks and other terrain characteristics often create occlusion and lead to missing elevation information in the map. For autonomous robots, mostly traditional computer-vision based inpainting techniques such as Telea or Navier-Stokes are used to fill-in the missing elevation information. These methods based on analysing the nearby pixels are not able to leverage the high-level characteristics and patterns we humans intuitively use to estimate how occluded areas could look like. We propose to use neural networks to reconstruct the occluded areas in DEMs. We introduce a self-supervised learning approach capable of training on real-world data without a need ground-truth information. We accomplish this by adding artificial occlusion to the partially occluded elevation maps either by random occlusion and dilation or by performing ray casting. We evaluate and benchmark our approach on several real-world datasets recorded with the ANYmal legged robot such as on stairs or during subterranean exploration in an underground mine. We also explore the performance of the neural network in a planetary scenario on the Tenerife lunar analogue dataset recorded with the HDPR rover by ESA. Our neural network is able to run in real-time on both CPU and GPU with suitable sampling rates for autonomous ground robots. We show a 60% to 90% and 45% to 75% reduction in l1 error compared to the Telea baseline approach for supervised and self-supervised learning respectively on the synthetic datasets. We observe a similar reduction of 37% to 46% in l1 error compared to the Telea baseline approach for the real-world datasets with self-supervised learning based on ray casting.",

On a motorcycle, more than 75 % of the braking energy is lost at the front wheel. This energy will be recovered with the additional motor in the front wheel and, hence, extend the range considerably.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- FEM simulation of the frame\n- Stress analysis and fatigue strength proof according to the FKM norm for the frame\n- Development of a concept for the operation of the motorcycle and specifically the\nrecuperation of energy\n- Programming of the user interface for the touchscreen display\n\n- Control of the all-wheel-drive within the framework of the bachelor thesis\n- Design of a multibody simulation of the motorcycle\n- Analysis of the driving dynamics of an all-wheel-drive motorcycle\n- Derivation of a simplified linear model of the motorcycle for the design of controllers\n- Creation of a concept for a traction control system for motorcycles with all-wheel drive",

On a motorcycle, more than 75 % of the braking energy is lost at the front wheel. This energy will be recovered with the additional motor in the front wheel and, hence, extend the range considerably.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- FEM simulation of the frame\n- Stress analysis and fatigue strength proof according to the FKM norm for the frame\n- Development of a concept for the operation of the motorcycle and specifically the\nrecuperation of energy\n- Programming of the user interface for the touchscreen display\n\n- Control of the all-wheel-drive within the framework of the bachelor thesis\n   - Design of a multibody simulation of the motorcycle\n   - Analysis of the driving dynamics of an all-wheel-drive motorcycle\n   - Derivation of a simplified linear model of the motorcycle for the design of controllers\n   - Creation of a concept for a traction control system for motorcycles with all-wheel drive\n\nwww.ethec.ethz.ch",
