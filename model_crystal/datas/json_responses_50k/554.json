    "summary": "I believe that the way to a sustainable development is through cooperation with different disciplines of knowledge and perceptions of reality. Through my studies in Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands, and work in the academia and the public sector, I have gained an interdisciplinary profile, spanning from human behaviour to policy, planning, conflict and project management. As a result, I am experienced in working with humans from different cultures, disciplines and interests and strong in holistic and critical thinking. I am highly analytical and solution oriented, with high expectations to the quality of my own deliveries.",

The theory of social capital proclaim that people, through a strong diverse network with trust and equal norms, build a capital that increases the possibility of joint actions. Lemvig Municipality is branded as a municipality with many wind turbines but low opposition and expect to hold a strong social capital, which has contributed to their claimed low wind turbine opposition.\nThe study is a qualitative embedded single case study of Lemvig Municipality\u2019s wind turbine planning, based on six interviews with actors participating in the municipal wind turbine planning and four interviews with local citizens supporting and opposing a local wind turbine project. The findings show that the elements of social capital theory can help increase the understanding of community acceptance. The study demonstrates how Lemvig Municipality has gained their success through a strong wind turbine network. The same network is, however, affected by structural holes, where different worldviews and lack of a common language between the planning authorities and the citizens, generate two different perceptions of reality. Further, the norms operating among the citizens and planning authorities differ, which leads to different perceptions of what a fair process and outcome implies and how to achieve it. Eemotional and cognitive trust between the actors in a wind turbine planning process affect the degree of engagement, perception and acceptance of the project. \nThe study also indicates that wind turbine opposition is affected both locally and nationally, where national wind turbine regulations appear to violate community norms. Further, lack of political bravery and mistrust of the wind turbine policies, politicians and industry appears to reduce the willingness to accept and engage in wind turbines.",
