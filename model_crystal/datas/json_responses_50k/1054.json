Learning about Photo-electrochemistry and Raman spectroscopy as a characterization tool of electronic, optical, chemical properties of semiconducting compounds. Learning was done using TiO2 and SiC samples.\n\n2. To use both tools allows to characterize 690 stainless steel samples to link the properties of the material with its specific fabrication process: high temperature oxidation, resistance in nuclear or petrochemical environments and so on.",

It involved designing a versatile instrument that is capable of detecting light at low intensities which is useful in applications such as VLSI quality verification and live cell sampling and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, among others.\n\nProject work included coding, circuit design, interfacing with SNSP, testing, and hardware/software integration. A grade of 92/100 was received on the project which involved a final presentation, poster preparation and technical report.",

As a project manager, I worked at the Center of Innovation for New Energy Technologies, where I coordinated all aspects of my master degree project, including: experiments, strategic planning, and equipment installations.\n\nThe project scope included innovating, designing and scaling up an inorganic electrolyte material to address Li-ion rechargeable battery safety issues with liquid organic electrolyte. It's success will help revolutionize the implementation of Li-ion batteries, specifically in electric vehicles. I was able to successfully develop a synthesis process of the material, saving over 200 hours in the process and wrote a 100 page thorough technical report analyzing and rationalizing data to detail the improvements.\n\nTo process the material I used ball-milling, calcination/heat-treatments, sintering, SPS, PVD. To collect data I used XRD, SEM/EDX, impedance spectroscopy, ICP, TGA DSC, and to process the data I utilized Origin Pro, Mathcad, and a Microsoft Excel macro program.",

St. David\u2019s Homework Club - I tutored students with specific homework problems, with the aim to improve literacy and help them achieve their academic goals.\n\n2. Waterloo Public Library - I built a learning foundation in students of ages 6-10 and promoted continuous learn through literacy games and one on one reading sessions.\n"
