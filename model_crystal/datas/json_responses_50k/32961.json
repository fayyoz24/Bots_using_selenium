The entire system comprises bus network, bus stops with unattended delivery points and buses adapted for parcel delivery. A multi-actor multi-criteria analysis was carried out to study the impact of the proposed system on the stakeholders. The analysis reveals that the living environment has slight benefits, the public bus transport has deteriorated bus service and the urban freight delivery has minimal changes. This suggests that integrating urban freight transport into public bus transport may not be feasible to the stakeholders, particularly to the authorities who needs to lead the change. Some recommendations are provided to make the integration more acceptable, such as designing according to the spatial demand and developing reliable bus designs. ",
