During one part of their complex developmental cycle, these bacteria release an array of secondary metabolites, such as antimicrobial agents, which has made Streptomyces of great economic and scientific importance. This pool of secondary metabolites can undergo changes through a process that is known as genomic instability. In several Streptomyces species, these changes have been linked to specific cellular and/or colonial morphologies. The resulting phenotypical heterogeneity in a population can give rise to division of labor (DoL). While the population, as a whole, benefits from the specialization, the individual fitness of mutants that, for instance, have enhanced antibiotic production, can be reduced. Interestingly, DoL can lead to the expression of \u2018silent\u2019 or \u2018cryptic\u2019 biosynthetic gene clusters, providing a potential reservoir for new secondary metabolites. In this study, I will investigate heterogeneity in the bacterial populations of several Streptomyces species. The initial focus will be on the visual differentiation of different phenotypes and their possible link with specific genomic alterations. In addition, Streptomyces griseus will be used to study A-factor deficiency and restoration. These results may provide evidence on whether these concepts are common across the Streptomyces genus and lead to the discovery of \u2018novel\u2019 antimicrobial agents.\n\nTechniques used: co-synthesis assay, (resazurin) interaction assay, fitness assay, statistics, protoplast transformation, gDNA/plasmid isolation, (fluorescence) microscopy, PCR",

                    "description": "The cell wall is the outer surface layer of bacteria that provides cells with structural support and protection against environmental stresses. It mainly consists of cell wall glycans, such as peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acid. Despite its essential role, many bacteria, such as Kitasatospora viridifaciens, can adopt a cell wall deficient lifestyle when exposed to hyperosmotic stress, leading to the formation of so-called L-form cells. These cells can proliferate without their cell wall. While most cell wall-targeting agents do no longer affect L-forms, those that directly or indirectly target the cell wall precursor carrier C55P remained effective and can kill K. viridifaciens L-forms. This suggests that these L-forms still require the lipid carrier, which may be used for the synthesis of other cell wall-associated glycans that are crucial for L-forms. Notably, L-form mutant strains that are resistant to the antibiotics targeting C55P were no longer able to revert to the mycelial mode-of-growth, implying that they have acquired mutations in a pathway that is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. In this study, I have investigated what these mutations are and dissected how C55P affects the growth and proliferation of L-form cell lines. These results may be applicable in the future to combat bacteria that use L-form switching as a transient adaptation to antibiotic exposure.\n\nTechniques used: antibiotic/MIC assays, SNP analysis, E. coli/L-form transformation, conjugation, CRISPR-dCas9, gel/gDNA/plasmid isolation, protein modelling, primer design, PCR, microscopy",

However, delayed measures and our inability to meet the increasing demand for diagnostic tests at the start of the pandemic caused us to lose control. Inspired by the current COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of accessible testing, we set out to develop a novel, point-of-care rapid diagnostic kit: RAPIDEMIC.
