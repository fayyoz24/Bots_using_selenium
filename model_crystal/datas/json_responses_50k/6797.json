    "summary": "My name is Stan Roozen. I am 28 years old and born and raised in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Currently, I am doing my Ph.D. at the McGill University in Montreal where I try to make tourmaline a new mineral probe to reconstruct fluid chemistries.  I obtained a master degree in earth sciences at the ETH in Zurich with a specialization in geochemistry, mineralogy and mineral resources. My master thesis topic was the hydrothermal-magmatic origin of a porphyry Cu deposit in Argentina. The earth science department of this university was ranked best in the world in 2015 and 2016. During my curriculum, I attended a total of five universities in four different countries: The University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the University of Utrecht (UU) in the Netherlands, the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich (ETH) in Switzerland and the McGill University in Canada. \n\nI am globally orientated and interested to be able to combine my love for both geologic science and my curiosity to get to know the many parts of the world.  I speak, read and write the Dutch, English and Spanish language and I am at a beginner level in French, German and Portuguese. The driving force behind all this was my aim to develop all the facets of my personality so I can readily use my knowledge, my social skills and the languages in the working field. ",

New data is presented on bulk geochemical and Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic compositions of unaltered juvenile clasts. Micronanalytical work on the major phenocrysts constituents was performed on both the porphyries and their volcanic counterparts.  Aided by zircon U/Pb measurements and volcano-sedimentary facies analysis, the unit could be subdivided into five subunits. These five ignimbritic subunits show remarkable geochemical gradients which can be attributed to eruption from a vertically zoned magma chamber. The observed gradients in whole rock geochemistry and crystallinities, the presence of significant amounts of layered juvenile clasts, the widespread presence of crystal clots, that are interpreted to be of cumulate nature, throughout the unit could all be attributed to an magma chamber were protracted fractional crystallization leaded to the formation of a cumulate crystal mush at the base of the eruptible reservoir. From such a reservoir highly evolved and water rich melts were extracted that formed the porphyry intrusions. The isotopic variation shows a mix between crustal and mantle source regions and trace elements show the necessity of amphibole fractionation at higher depth. Equigranular quench textured gabbroic enclaves with chilled margins, the abundance of sieve textured plagioclase and simple zoned amphibole, the high variabilities in An-content in plagioclase and Al in the amphibole, the presence of abundant dissolution surfaces in many plagioclase crystals and patchy zoned plagioclase, resorbed quartz and the presence of cumulate crystal clots of mafic origin with sector zoned clino-pyroxene and high Al-amphibole all indicate that open system magmatic processes such as recharge are equally dominant in the porphyry ore generating upper crustal magma chamber.",

In order to reconstruct the major elemental composition of the fluid, I measure the thermodynamic properties of the various endmembers of the tourmaline supergroup minerals and integrate this data into internally consistent databases, so it can be used in solubility models. This data is also used for pseudosection thermobarometry. For the trace elemental composition of the fluid, I measure partition coefficients between fluid and synthesized tourmaline and fit the experimental data to an lattice strain model with the help of speciation prediction. The solubility, lattice strain and pseudosection models are used to reconstruct the fluid evolution from a natural tourmaline.",
