    "summary": "Me and my experience in a nutshell.\n\nIn 2015, I graduated with a Masters from the University of Tilburg. After graduation I started working as Communication Specialist for a short period. \n\nIn 2017, I started working at Topshop as a Cash Office Assistant. I was totally in my element, this position gave me a nice balance of administrative work and customer service. The following year I got promoted to a team leader position. In this position I was able to develop myself more as a leader and help and guide new employees and current staff in their development.\n\nI noticed that coaching and guiding someone in their development and then seeing the fruits of that labor gave me a lot of joy.",
