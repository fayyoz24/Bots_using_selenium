    "summary": "I fell in love with Graphic Design.\n\nDuring my university years, I always thought my dream was becoming this talented Interior and Lighting Designer for an award winning design studio in a big city, having my morning coffee and hallway chats with the colleagues. It really seem the appropriate dream given my BA in Interior Design. In addition, I took a Lighting Design Diploma from one of the most prestigious universities in Chile and graduated with one of the highest grades. It seemed every piece was falling into the right place. I worked in the retail industry for a couple of years but then, I came to the Netherlands (where I currently reside) and landed my very first Lighting Design job. I enjoyed this so much, I developed strong soft skills like outstanding communication strategies, conflict resolution, empathy and collaboration. It was through this great very first experience that I discovered what my true passion was.\n\nAnd that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignated the instant I had my first contact with Graphic Design. I had to do a side, freelance job for a friend that needed help with their brand and since then, I can't get enough. I knew at that moment this is what I want to do the rest of my life! \n\nSince I have already a background in Interior Design, it didn't feel like a big step at the beggining, but with time I've educated myself in different areas of the Graphic Arts like illustration, visual design and my most recent and beloved one: UX | UI Design. This was meant to be.\n\nI love applying the Design Thinking concept as a scientific method that leads you, inevitably, to understand your user and, therefore, to a smooth design. \n\nMy specialities include vast knowledge of the Adobe Suite softwares, mostly Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Also Figma, HTML and CSS. Quickly and eager to learn new skills, languages, softwares and content of any kind. Deep understanding of color theory, typography and composition. \n\nFinally, coming from a different cultural background as it is the latin culture, I've learned to be flexible and to easily adapt to different kind of people and situations. You won't regret having this sassy latina, with not only the brains, but also the sense of humor, as a great addition to your team!",
