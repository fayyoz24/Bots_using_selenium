The major cities are Bolgatanga, Bongo and Navrongo. Serious restraints in the drinking water supply are identified throughout the area. The existing water supply system has inadequate capacity to meet the demand. The high population growth in the larger cities increases the shortages. The area generally is quite arid which has also resulted in migration to the larger cities. At this moment there is a small drinking WTP located between Bolgatanga and Bongo, supplying both cities with insufficient capacity. After the foreseen system change this WTP will be dedicated to Bongo and its surroundings. The raw water source for this system the Vea irrigation reservoir is exploited to its limit which eliminates the possibility of extended use. To supply the cities of Bolgatanga Navrongo and their surroundings a new raw water source and a new WTP is foreseen. The above solution will close the demand gap after its completion. The number of people that will be supplied with potable water in 2030 is estimated to be 310,488. Of these people 230,488 currently do not have access to potable water. The remaining 80,000 will have access to a more reliable connection.",

Challenges related to the reduction of trachoma infection risks are manifold. There are many pastoralist communities with nomadic lifestyles that lack proper homes with access to safe water-, sanitation- and hygiene facilities. Animals are often in or close to dwelling areas. On the other hand, cities can be densely populated creating other hygiene issues with respect to fly control / environmental cleanliness e.g. due to bad sanitary facilities. General problems are high illiteracy rates and high poverty among the populations in all three regions.\n\nOverall Objective:\nThe overall objective of the programme is to reduce the prevalence rates of trachoma in the six regions in Tanzania that have the highest burden of trachoma infection.",

This poses a great health problem, especially at primary health care level, where the majority (almost 70%) of the population seeks healthcare services.\n\nOverall objective:\nImprove access to water and hygiene promotion in 100 selected public primary health care facilities in the Dodoma region\u2019s 7 districts.\n\nApproach:\nAfter receiving a request from regional authorities in Tanzania, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), Simavi, Witteveen+Bos and three Tanzanian partners (CBHCC, PATUTA and UFUNDIKO), implemented the MKAJI programme to upgrade water supply and sanitation systems in 100 primary health facilities in the Dodoma region. Maj kwa Afya ya Jamii (MKAJI) is Swahili for  \u2018Water for Community Health\u2019.\n\nThis intervention will considerably reduce the potential risk of outbreak of communicable diseases and infections during routine patient care and treatment, and improve maternal health care and service delivery.\n\nThe consortium made a costing of standard solutions (such as connections to existing networks; boreholes, water tanks, surface water) for all health facilities without water, including upgrading sanitation systems. It has been agreed that SDC will complement local investment and cover between 18-22 primary health facilities per year for the 7 districts. By the end of this phase, 100 health facilities will have been improved. Water management and hygiene promotion in and with communities will complement hardware investments. The FIETS principles will be implemented to ensure sustainable change.",

We work together with local NGOs, governments and businesses to make sure everybody on this planet has sustainable access to water and sanitation.\n\nIn Africa we run programmes in Ghana, Mali, Benin, Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya. In Asia, we work in Nepal and Bangladesh. In these countries we set up local alliances that enable us to optimally make use of local knowledge and networks and tap into existing WASH structures.\n\nIn Ghana more than 80 percent of people have access to safe water, but only 13% of people have access to improved sanitation. Dependency on unsafe water sources is higher in rural areas. Due to drinking contaminated water, diarrheal disease is the third most commonly reported illness at health centers across the country and 25% of all deaths in children under the age of five are attributed to diarrhea. In addition to lack of sanitation infrastructure, some cultural beliefs and views encourage people in rural areas not to use latrines.\n",
