This enormous protein complex consists of unfolded proteins and shows a mystifying selectivity to molecular cargo: small cargoes pass through, but large cargoes need help from a transport protein. My thesis project brought together two powerful tools in studying the size-selectivity mechanism of the NPC: biomimetic nanopores (well-controlled experimental replicas of the NPC, characterized by running ionic currents through them) and a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model of unfolded proteins. More concretely, I derived an extension (inclusion of ions) of the coarse-grained grained protein model, to provide a nanoscopic view of the conductance process in biomimetic nanopores.",

An experimental challenge consists of distinguishing between excitation light and SFLE as emitted from the system, as these are spectrally close. This problem is made more complex by the challenging nature of using fiber-based optics in cryogenic environments. My project consisted of using photoluminescence of GaAs at liquid N2-temperatures as a diagnostic tool for optimizing light retrieval from our sample. Optimization occured through experiments on polarization stability and power losses on various setup components, as well as performing optimization experiments on the confocal microscope as used in the cryogenic environment.",
