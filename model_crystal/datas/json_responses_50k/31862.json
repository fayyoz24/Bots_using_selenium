    "summary": "Building connection through the power of inclusive communication.\n\nI\u2019m Marlies, a woman on a mission to inspire people and organisations to build a genuine connection through the power of clear and inclusive communication. I use training, advice, and practical hands-on work to give you more insight into your communication efforts so you can successfully increase its effectiveness.  \n\nAs you can see on my profile, my career has been far from traditional. I lived in various places around the world, including Brazil, Suriname, South Africa, England and Portugal, where a variety of job opportunities crossed my path. True to my exploratory nature, I tried (almost) everything. Yet, one logical common thread wove itself through all of these various jobs: my mission to create a connection through communication. \n\nIn 2018 I founded Magpie Communications - the perfect place to share this mission and the knowledge I gained from interacting with a wide range of cultures, people and situations. \n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2?\n\nI live my life as minimalistic as possible. I like to work out (and dance) to the beats of drum \u2018n bass, and I usually read about six books at a time. My superpower is jumping double-unders - where the skipping rope spins around me twice in one jump. I can do 58 nonstop.\n\nAre you curious about what we can build together? Let\u2019s grab a (virtual) coffee!\n\nContact me on: \u2709 welcome@theworldofmagpie.com\nCheck out my website on www.theworldofmagpie.com",
