    "summary": "Interested in working in Climate policy around agriculture and wrote my bachelors' thesis on \u201cAn Ethnography of the Vegan Community in Japan Through the Perspective of Lifestyle and Activism\u201d while taking various courses focusing on climate mitigation and carbon footprint calculation. \n\nBorn and raised in Scotland, I moved to Kyoto, Japan for a Bachelors degree, and after completion moved to Den Haag, Netherlands to pursue an Adv. Masters in International Relations and Diplomacy. \n\nWhile living in Japan I worked with in various industries, with my work at \u2018jimomin\u2019, and UNESCO where I have developed my intercultural communication and teamwork skills, working in both Japanese and English. At \u2018jimomin\u2019, I worked as a translator and copywriter where I was required to produce written and photographic work to a very high standard to short deadlines. This has required me to adapt quickly and research topics in depth in a short time span.\n \nI am also confident in public speaking which is evident through my participation in ASEP (Asian Student Exchange Program) in Taiwan, and my work as Deputy-Leader of Oritor, to organise events for freshmen throughout their first year.",
