Our time at art-school has always been about breaking things: conventions, rules and now free from the bubble of art-school. We felt the catalouge should be a representation of the students. We interviewed everyone in our graduation class via skype about their graduation, overal school experience and some personal views. Every interview turned out completely different, which resulted in a textual profile picture of every student. At the same time the texts are a summation of various views and topics discussed in the past four years. To accompany this we added four essays that where influential to us and fellow students and are all written between 2010 & 2014 which concludes our time at the academy.",

I decided to redesign a collection of essays in the publication Open Letter using a different kind of navigation trough the book. I generated a list of keywords that were most common in all essays and used them as a stamp for each page. This in combination with abbreviations of every chapter title makes numbering a page obsolete while at the same time connecting essays based on the keywords on each page. The book follows the format of a novel to imply a future way of navigation. ",

These centers are very sterile environments where expression is almost none existent. Our design takes the form of a sticker toolkit which allows the children in the center to create a personal profile picture showcasing their story trough symbols with different meanings. The story can take you trough different countries or manipulate a countries flag. Because of this playful interpretation of quite loaded political symbols their meaning changes into what is constructed in a playful way while at the same time having a connotation with the Dutch immigration policy",
