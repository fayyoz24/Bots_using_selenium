As part of a team of four fellows, we developed an action project to encourage youth political participation ahead of the October 2018 elections, sponsored by the National Endowment for Democracy. We researched, designed, and produced an interactive boardgame based on the Bosnian political system to engage first-time voters in informed, critical conversations about their role in driving political progress. We launched the game at an event at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Sarajevo, and distributed the game materials and learning resources to local civil society organizations.",
