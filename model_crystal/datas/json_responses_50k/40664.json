    "summary": "I am an anthropologist and cultural entrepreneur, available for creative research, artistic programming, content director or project manager.\n\nMy strength is developing creative concepts and cultural projects with a socially engaged character in the domain of audiovisual arts and urban development. I do qualitative research, I do the thinking and the executing, searching for funding and coordination of the implementation. \n\nI am an ignitor, a catalisator and a motivator. I inspire others to realize their dreams and to believe that everything is possible.\n\nTo come to splendid results I observe, listen, analyse and identify needs. Reflect, invent, intermediate, connect, facilitate and implement. I transform, guide and make it happen!\n\nBetween 2003 and 2020 I was director of cultural foundation Caramundo. We realized film festivals (Camera Mundo - Independent Brazilian Film Festival in Rotterdam), artistic exchange projects and workshops. We founded a cultural center, organized (street)art exhibitions and art projects in public space. Our most known project was R.U.A. - Reflexo on Urban Art (international platform for muralism and streetart on buildings in urban settings) with partners and clients such as municipalities, housing corporations and real estate corporations in the Netherlands and abroad. Caramundo was active in both Brazil and the Netherlands. \n\nI started my career as a cultural anthropologist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I spent over 15 years studying, doing research and working with Brazilian social, cultural and political institutes. I realized exchange programmes between Brazil and other Latin American countries, Europe and African countries such as South Africa and DR Congo. \n\nSet me a goal or destination, and I'll figure out the way to get there, with the people, for the people.",
