This included collecting data about the indoor, as well as the outdoor, light intensity, relative air humidity and temperature. Besides, a literature study was done on the effects of these factors on the productivity and performance of the students and teachers. Resulting in an advise towards the school head about how to create a healthy indoor environment for the students and teachers.",

During this internship I collected data regarding the fuel consumption by the heavy equipment working at the construction site. By analysing the fuel consumption a carbon footprint of the project's heavy equipment was created, which gave Heijmans an insight in the fuel consumption and carbon footprint at construction projects. Giving advice about the approach of such an analysis in the future was also part of the internship.\n\nBesides the main project I also analysed the fuel consumption of the road construction teams in 2012 and 2013. This lead to more insight in the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of the teams and to the discovery of administrative flaws.",
