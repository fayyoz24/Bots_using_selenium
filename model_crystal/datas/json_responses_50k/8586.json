The first two months of the traineeship consist of an educational program at Calco\u2019s headquarters in Maarssen. During this period I am gaining knowledge about different functions and processes in IT and I am following a specialisation course that matches my interests and skills (e.g. information analyst, programmer, tester or junior project manager). In addition, an important part of the traineeship focuses on the development of soft skills, such as presentation and communication skills.\n \nAfter the educational program has been completed, I will be working for one of our clients for a period of 22 months. Whilst working there I will further develop my skills on the job. A field manager from Calco will coach and supervise me during this period, and together we will create a personal development plan in order to continue my personal development.  \n \nAfter successfully completing the two-year traineeship, it is often possible to carry on working at the client's company, but I can also decide to continue my career at Calco.",
