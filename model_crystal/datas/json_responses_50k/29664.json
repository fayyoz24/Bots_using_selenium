    "summary": "Natallia E. Uzunbajakava holds a Ph.D. in physics and an engineering degree (the University of Twente) and certification in Strategic Management & Innovation (CBS). \nShe demonstrated impact by delivering costs savings, new product propositions, support of product launches, claim substantiations, regulatory clearance and new scientific discoveries.\nShe pioneered Raman Spectroscopy for imaging of single human cells (two awards at \u2018Focus on Microscopy\u2019). Her joined investigations with Dr. Botchkareva and Dr Westgate explained mode of action of low fluence light pulses resulting in long-term hair reduction in photoepilation. Collaboration with prof. van de Kerkhof deepened understanding of Sensitive Skin (\u2018Sensitive Skin Syndrome\u2019 Eds. Honari, Andersen, Maibach 2017). Research within European project CLASSIC (ID 607886) culminated in a discovery photoreceptors in the skin and hair follicle cells as new molecular targets for light therapies (Keith Foundation Best of Photobiomodulation Session, ASLMS 2017; Molecular Dermatology, Eds. Botchkareva, Westgate, 2020). \nDr. Uzunbajakava has 43 publications, incl. 3 Book Chapters, 22 Technical Notes at PHILIPS. She holds 27 US granted patents and applications, lectures nationally and internationally at an intersection of biophotonics and skin biology. Her H-Index is 18 (Scopus @September 2023). \n\nEXPERTISE: \nAPPLIED PHYSICS, Biophysics, LIGHT-TISSUE INTERACTION, SPECTROSCOPY, MICROSCOPY, PHOTOBIOLOGY, Skin & Hair Physiology, in vitro & ex vivo Skin Models, Clinical Studies, LEAN, DfSS.\n\nIMCAS Academy member, peer REVIEWER of BIOMEDICAL Optics Express, Experimental DERMATOLOGY, Archives of Dermatological Research, OPTICS Express, Lasers in Surgery & Medicine, Journal of Photochemistry & PHOTOBIOLOGY.\n \nSCIENCE:\nhttps://youtu.be/nxp5SaoK8NU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtzO5y27icI\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-4524-7528\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natallia_Uzunbajakava/publications?pubType=article\n\nDERMATOLOGY:\nhttps://www.imcas.com/en/academy/show/5791/how-hair-follicle-cell-response-to-low-and-high-fluence-photoepilation\nhttps://www.imcas.com/en/academy/course/851/the-alopecias-from-diagnosis-to-treatment\nhttps://www.imcas.com/en/academy/show/2280/what-are-we-learning-about-sensitive-skin\nhttps://www.imcas.com/en/academy/show/2284/safe-and-effective-home-use-microdermabrasion-quantitative-evaluation\n\nHOBBIES: 3rd women, 51k Trail Eifelmarathon, 2014, Waxweiler Germany. 1st women, 46k Trail La Provinciale, 2014, Mirwart Belgium",

The skin has developed during evolution as the organ to adapt to these challenges and by doing so to protect the \u2018milieu interieur\u2019.\nPhysical challenges can be: (i) acute mechanical challenge (wounding) or chronic mechanical challenges (rubbing, friction, and shaving) and (ii) photo damage, again as an acute or as a chronic form. \nThe response pattern of the skin is intended to recover the integrity of the skin and to protect against microbial and chemical damage. The initial part of the response is an inflammatory response to eliminate body-foreign elements or altered self (damaged cells) and the secondary response is regeneration of the skin. \nThe response pattern may follow a normal dynamics with the usual subjective sensations of the skin (a certain degree of pain or itch), with some degree of inflammation (erythema, induration). Some subjects may have aberrant responses with feeling of excessive irritation or signs of irritation (Koebner phenomenon in psoriasis).\nSome challenges have become part of our way of living: shaving or laser treatment in skin care procedures (e.h., hair removal using photo-epilation and skin rejuvenation using fractional photo-thermolysis). However, irritation of the skin and the feeling of burning skin remain to be a serious limitation for these common procedures. The latter one imposes restrictions on the efficacy of skin care procedures and on the applicability for all ethnic groups and in particular for subjects with the so-called \u201csensitive skin\u201d .\nThis proposal aims to find out the biological reality of  \u201c sensitive skin \u201c and irritation originating due to the following procedures:\nI.\tmechanical shaving, incl. dry and wet shaving \nII.\tlight-based skin treatment, such as:\na.\tfractional photothermolysis \nb.\tlight-based hair removal using IPL or a laser source.",
