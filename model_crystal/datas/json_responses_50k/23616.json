The model was then subjected to several hypothetical scenarios in order to depict the capability of the model and also tabulated the response of the airport to these scenarios.\nThis simulation model could act as a tool to the BIAL in order to monitor the terminals current queuing situation and also see its response to hypothetical changes even before actually implementing them on field.",
