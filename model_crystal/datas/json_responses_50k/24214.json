    "summary": "Global community builder, digital product manager, collaborative teammate, and entrepreneurial spirit known for tenacity, data-driven decision-making, creative ideation, and cross-functional problem-solving.\n\nFollowing my years as a student-athlete, I wanted to help people learn which I did with Teach for America and Pearson. Noticing an increase in media consumption and decrease in interpersonal connection, I pivoted to help people listen to inspiring ideas and each other at TED. Having built two, digitally enabled, global communities that impact people\u2019s thoughts, I wanted to lean into also impacting people\u2019s actions. I am ready to start a new adventure contributing to how adidas helps people live their healthiest lives by doing something they love \u2013 sport!\n\nPersonally, I love to run, bike, play volleyball, rock climb, and try new sports. My favorite days are those spent with loved ones at home doing DIY projects, outside exploring the city, lost in conversation, or abroad experiencing incredible cultures. Yeats said it well: \"There are no strangers here, only friends we haven't yet met.\" so please reach out if you are interested in collaborating...",
