However, the country still faces a significant challenge in achieving SDG 13, particularly with respect to the target for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion per capita indicator. To tackle this challenge, the Finnish government has released a national climate and energy strategy with an ambitious goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2035. To support decision-makers in developing effective policies to achieve this goal, a comprehensive 3-E analysis of Finland's national electricity system was conducted. This study explored three scenarios, including a Business-as-Usual scenario, a Netzero-emissions scenario, and an Own Vision scenario, which took into account the complete electrification of the road and rail transportation sectors. The findings reveal that while demand and power generation capacity will increase, the social costs associated with the transition will vary across the scenarios. Nonetheless, Finland is well-positioned to succeed in creating a carbon-neutral future by 2035, and comprehensive examination and informed assessment of future pathways can optimize this transition.",

The findings of this study is targeted for the Citizen's Assembly of Ireland towards decision-making on sustainability, as it highlights the significance of stakeholder engagement and the need to employ decision-making methodologies such as multi-criteria analysis to ensure a rational participation in the decision-making process.",

One way to tackle this issue is by dumping the heat available during the summer months into the ground by using a heat pump in the reverse mode and thereby also satisfy the cooling demand in buildings.

            "description": "In this project, a unique method to enhance the optical properties of a Pectin-PMMA composite substrate was explored by introducing a fluorophore into the material. The results showed that the addition of fluorophore significantly improved the substrate's ability to block UVB light by over 99%, which could help reduce thermalization losses in solar cells. The fluorescence spectroscopy of PSBF substrates also revealed fluorescence in the 400-480 nm wavelength range, potentially contributing to the substrate's increased transparency and photocurrent production in solar cells. While there was no impact on the substrate's haze in the visible zone, this study establishes the concept of enhancing substrate properties through fluorophore infusion, with the potential for further development using alternative fluorophores with better quantum yields.",
