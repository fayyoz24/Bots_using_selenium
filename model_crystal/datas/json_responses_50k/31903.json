    "summary": "My main interest over the almost 40 years in education is learning, organisational learning and organisational development and topics related to this. Trained as a language teacher and working in various highschools I realised that one can easily spend a lifetime in this field. Since I joined the social housing sector in 1988 I realised that learning in organisations and organisational development is directly related to language an communication and I never looked back. Over the years I have been involved in many projects as a project manager or as a member of a project team or as an executive/ non-executive board member in various boards. The common denominator in all this was excitement of people working together and learning to overcome differences and challenges and in the end achieving something we set out to do. And this is what me still keeps excited: the miracle of achieving something with other people within a team or in a role as coach or facilitator\n\nSince 2015 I am retired but still working as a Technical Advisor/Consultant Capacity Development for NASHO but based in Deventer in the Netherlands. Since Corona my work for NASHO has come to an end. I am fully retired now and focus on other interests. Since 2020 I am a volunteer at EICAS (European Institute for Contemporary Arts and Science). It is the first contemporary art museum in Deventer and is housed in a monumental schoolbuilding from the 1950's. It focuses on Zero Art and contemporary artist that work from the same inspiration. I am an attendant and also involved in the Educational committee.\n\nMy specialties are:\nFacilitation, presentation, training and curriculum development, learning and organizational learning, organizational development especially in the field of rental/social housing",

The main support of the Trust is through the sourcing of funding for projects such as the provision of schooluniforms to poor learners, money for education school outings, libraries, educational tools etc. It is directly linked to the Stichting Siyafunda based in the Netherlands which raises funds in the Netherlands.",
