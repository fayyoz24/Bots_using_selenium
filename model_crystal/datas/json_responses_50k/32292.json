    "summary": "Jon has a passion for the cross-section of where culture, cycling, startups, and sales meet. He has 17 years of racing experience from the streets dodging traffic in alleycats to track sprinting internationally to amateur road racing and criteriums to digging deep in Dutch mud racing cyclocross. For Jon, \u201cit all comes back to the bike.\u201d\n\nThe roots of Twotone go back in 2007, when Jon cofounded a fixed gear focused bike shop in Atlanta, GA named No Brakes. Jon's clothes nearly always matched his track bike & he earned the nickname Twotone. He cut his teeth on promoting his own shop, the brands they sold, and even suppliers, athletes, and other organisations they partnered with all before Instagram! Those entrepreneurial roots grew into the hold your line, you'll be fine full-send approach to how we run our business today. \n\nA 10 year old nickname became a Dutch BV in 2014 & Twotone has become THE one-stop-shop for cycling savvy sales, marketing and PR across Europe in the USA. Our earliest accounts began with brands like Zwift (then still beta!), Wahoo (before the Elemnt & Kickr!) & komoot after meeting the founders at SxSW in Austin, Texas. We're proud to work with the biggest names in the business but still advocate for the underdog brands in our roster as big ones like Zwift, Wahoo & komoot started small.\n\u200b\nNow a team of 7 hailing from 4 countries, Twotone confidently delivers cycling- savvy brand strategy, commercial services, communications consulting and content production implementation to brands large & small around the world in partnership along with trusted agencies and freelancers across Europe.\n\nBefore Twotone, Jon sold to companies in industries like L&D/HR, App/Software Consulting, Translation and Localization, and even B2C selling in the cycling industry back at No Brakes.\n\nAt Springest, Jon learned from and helped HR Managers and L&D Directors who experienced unmotivated employees, teams lacking the tools to find and book the courses they want & HR depts with excessive admin on automate-able tasks\n\nPreviously, Jon led new sales for Big Nerd Ranch, Europe in Amsterdam. Before Europe? Jon did sales for BNR and Highgroove Studios in Atlanta. He earned real-world entrepreneurial experience in co-founding and running a bicycle shop, No Brakes. Jon also cut his teeth in building online presence & internet strategy for the bike shop. \n\nBefore that, as an intern at ALTA Language Services, he was focused on online marketing activities and helped establish an innovative online experience along with an SEO strategy to drive new business nationwide.",

In tight collaboration with Samsung, Fabian Cancellara, Gr\u00e9gory Rast, the rest of the Trek Factory Racing Team and cycling legends Jens Voigt and Phil Liggett, 72andSunny created a film to kick off the campaign and introduce the domestiques for the launch of the Tour de France. Socially 72andSunny also launched the Domestique du Jour, a twitter based activation led by celebrated cyclist Jens Voigt to honor the domestiques along the route, and the Diary of a Domestique, a blog chronicling the journey of the hero domestique from the main film, Gr\u00e9gory Rast, throughout this year\u2019s Tour de France.\n\nFind more here.\nDiary: http://www.trekfactoryracing.com/blog/diary-domestique-july-19\nDomestique du Jour: https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23domestiquedujour&lang=nl",
