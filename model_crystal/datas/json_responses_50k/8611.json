    "summary": "I am a computer vision scientist, data scientist, and biomedical scientist with specialties in medical image processing, signal processing, deep learning, and machine learning, and radiation therapy. I have a strong passion for proactively pushing on the development and deployment of cutting-edge computer vision, signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in the medical and industrial fields for the benefit of patients and customers. I distinguish myself through my application- and results-oriented attitudes by providing efficient and high-performance algorithms, participating deeply in the clinical routines, and collaborating closely with doctors and technicians. I have international study and work experience in five countries on three different continents, being involved in four universities, which gives me an international vision and the ability to work in a multi-culturally diverse environment. \n\nAs a research associate in the medical imaging research center of KU Leuven, I put a lot of effort into developing AI-based computer vision platform to assist doctors in the planning and verification of liver cancer treatment by using cutting-edge deep learning and machine learning techniques. This platform was applied to over 100 patients in 3 years. I was closely involved in the clinical routine and the processing of patient data at University Hospitals Leuven. I also collaborated with medical imaging companies in UK and Belgium for optimizing medical image software and clinical workflows. I recognize myself as a technology innovator in the team, bringing new ideas to the current system, taking firm actions to achieve the goals, and making concrete and effective changes.  The successful application of my research results and algorithms to the clinic gave me a strong feeling of self-fulfillment and a desire to contribute more to the industrial and medical worlds. \n\nMy Ph.D. research, funded by the EU\u2019s H2020 programme, gave me plentiful opportunities to network with other excellent researchers and professors in medical imaging across the world. During the last four years, I visited different institutions, universities, and companies in the United Kingdom, France, Austria, and Belgium. This gave me a broad international vision and interest in diverse cultures. Regular secondments to the medical imaging company in UK during my Ph.D. and internship at Philips during my master enabled me to know how R&D is conducted in the industry. This gave me a different perspective from industry instead of a single thinking pattern in academia.",

New key photonic components will be developed to realize a novel detector showing high-end performance for both spectral and non-spectral X-ray imaging. The usability and applicability of the new spectral NEXIS X-ray system for stroke imaging will be clinically evaluated in a European top hospital.\nThe project brings together a multidisciplinary consortium, involving the full value chain (photonics R&D, medical system integrator, application owner, supply chain and equipment manufacturing). It will allow key players in the European medical photonics industry to generate sales and stay competitive by providing new X-ray imaging modalities and EU based manufacturing. NEXIS will strengthen European competitiveness by developing a spectral detector technology that meets the needs of the European and global X-ray image detectors market. In the coming decade NEXIS is expected to initiate the transition of standard (black&white) to spectral (colour) X-ray detectors, which will improve performance and functionality of X-ray imaging systems.",
