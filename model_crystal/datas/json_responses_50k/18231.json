I work on innovative field studies that track people (with subjective and objective measures) with severe problems related to stress, aggression or addiction over long periods of time trying to establish possible links between bodies, thoughts, behaviour and environments. With various stakeholders (patients, caregivers, managers, designers, developers, scientists) I\u2019m involved in co-designing ambulatory biofeedback and novel bio cueing systems for self regulation. I\u2019m also interested  how we can design and work with technology  starting from core human values such as compassion (https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/compassionatetechnology/).\nFor the next 5-10 years my focus will be on integrating all these themes on the topic of moving the measurement of stress from the lab to daily life in the multidisciplinary Stress-in-Action project (https://stress-in-action.nl/).",
