    "summary": "Raffi Feghali is a performer, peacebuilder, and trainer based between Beirut and Amsterdam. \n\nAs a performer, he's acted in 100s of performances all over Lebanon, the Arab World, Europe, and USA. He's worked with numerous renowned directors in Lebanon and abroad. Raffi is an improviser who contributed to the creation of a modest improv scene in Beirut through performances and training as well as through the creation of an improvisational theatre-based organization, that he left as a fully functioning entity after 8 years to pursue an independent touring career. Furthermore, his debut storytelling, biographical monodrama was launched at the Amsterdam Storytelling Festival in 2018. Raffi is a member of the Lincoln Theater Center Directors Lab 2018.\n\nAs a peacebuilding consultant, practitioner, and trainer, Raffi has worked on projects in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and Turkey in his 15-year career. Over the years, Raffi has been frequently trained by CDA Inc. on their tools \u2013 Reflecting on Peace Practice, Listening Exercises, and Systemic Conflict Analysis \u2013 culminating in a master training at Harvard University in Boston. He has facilitated multiple dialogue sessions and working groups through various formats and for different outcomes. Through harnessing the power of the arts, he has used them not only as tools for his peacebuilding work, but also as guiding methodologies and approaches. He is an avid practitioner of Theatre of the Oppressed, Playback Theatre, and other related formats, some of which were of his own development. His training sessions are filled with embodied arts-based exercises. Raffi uses project-based and experiential learning and as such has a holistic approach to learning. For him, learning doesn\u2019t only happen at the cognitive level of the human\u2019s existence, but through all of their aspects of existence.\n\nFor the last 5 years, he's been bringing his multi-disciplinary skillset to the corporate world by offering training and coaching on various soft skills using improvisational theatre and storytelling through his company Perform.\n\nFor a better representation of the work, please, visit raffifeghali.com",
