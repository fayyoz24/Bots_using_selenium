    "summary": "I am an alum of Law at Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland. I have finalised my master degree in the Department of Civil Law (my last semester of studies was completed at RUG University under the umbrella of Erasmus+ Program). My master\u2019s thesis \"Withdrawal of a consent for data processing under a GDPR regulation\" focused on the topic of protection of the privacy and effective measures for personal data protection.\nDuring my years of studying at Jagiellonian University, I have accomplished many internships at different law offices and non-profit organizations. For instance, at The Halina Nie\u0107 Legal Aid Center I have been working with projects concerning human rights, immigration, and asylum problems. In Allerhand Institute I have been involved in different studies concerning polish and international civil law. In Tadeusz Dobiecki Law Company I had an opportunity to participate in cooperation with various subjects in different litigations applying practical knowledge of Polish and international law. I have always been an active member of academic scientific circles (KNHD, History of Doctrines Student Association of Jagiellonian University), participating in university conferences.\nDue to my accomplishments, I was granted a scholarship to help me pursue an internship in Budapest in July-August 2017 in The European Center for Non-for- Profit-Law. It was an extraordinary learning experience, which convinced me to channel my professional path to an international course. Proficient in Russian, Polish, and English is my strong asset.\nMy attention is focused on the international market and companies which can provide a diverse environment for professional development and new challenges.",
