    "summary": "Currently doing my PhD at Wageningen University, in the Environmental Systems Analysis Chair Group. My research interests lie in transformative change, marine conservation & governance, and participatory futures methods. I am also passionate about youth inclusion and social justice in climate and biodiversity decision-making processes. \n\nI have an interdisciplinary background, so while I have focused on climate change and marine conservation (both natural and social science perspectives), I have knowledge and experience throughout the environmental and sustainability realm, including in alternative energy strategies. I also have experience with both quantitative and qualitative scientific research methods and data analysis. My MSc thesis focused on the role of collaborative governance and knowledge co-production for climate change adaptation in Marine Protected Areas.",
