During the holidays they can reach me for questions, for booking activities and for problems. In winter, guests arrive by car, plane or bus. An envelope is available for guests at the reception with information on how to reach us. In addition, they can rent their equipment from us or book ski lessons and we organize activities such as tobogganing and a BBQ night.",
