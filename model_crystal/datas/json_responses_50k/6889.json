    "summary": "It is a cliche, but the world is changing, and that is a good thing! IT is also changing, and even more: IT is contributing to the rapid changing world. New organizations emerge that make smart use of the new developments and business models. Established organizations are collapsing due to their inability to change their old business models and lack of innovation. To which category of the spectrum does your organization belong? These changes that IT brings is what I call Digital Darwinism. It is not the richest, nor the strongest company that survive.  Those companies that embrace the changes brought by IT that will survive.\n\nWith CLS Inter we help organizations to become aware and understand the possibilities of a digital first strategy in order to achieve the business goals. We do this based upon an approach that has academic rigor and proven effectiveness.\n\nCLS Inter - where do we start your acceleration?\n\nINTERESTED?\nContact me at: \n\u260e\ufe0f +31 6 51 80 00 28\n\ud83d\udcec ronald.kerckhoffs@clsinter.com ",
