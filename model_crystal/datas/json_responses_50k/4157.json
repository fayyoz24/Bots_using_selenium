    "summary": "As the name suggests, Italy is the most stylish country on Earth and it\u2019s also the primary source of inspiration for the collection that owner Egbert Zwier proudly presents in his Store. Senso Fashion opened its doors on the Denneweg 110/A in The Hague, in 2003. With great feeling for passion and love of the clothing industry, Senso gives their customers, in a relaxed atmosphere, the best what is out there in the field of menswear today. The collection is best described as an Italian interpretation of the preppy look and is inspired by the fashion loving street sc\u00e8ne, for example, in Milan and New York.\n\nThat's exactly where the team of Senso get their satisfaction. Love for the profession, love for the clothes, and an opportunity to share this with like-minded people. \n\n\u201cDare to be different, but be comfortable doing so\u201d\n\nAs ingredients for the advanced style exercise, Senso uses high quality products from well known names such as Xacus, Tramarossa, Chiave Napoli, Tagliatore, 100 Hands, Filippo de Laurentiis, Duno, Lardini and many more....\n\nFor the suits and jackets Senso works with Chiave Napoli. \nThis Italian family company makes beautiful products as per the right traditions since 1951. \nThis results in a wonderful collection for every occasion. \nTheir jackets are made with love for fitting and  gentle for the posture of the customer. \nTo get the Italian look right it\u2019s perfect to combine them with a chino from Briglia.\nThis is another personal favorite from Egbert which is regrettably not well known to outsiders.  \nA super fit, nice  & slim and a narrow foot size. \nThey are available in contemporary washes and special finishes. \nIt doesn't get much better than this. \n",
