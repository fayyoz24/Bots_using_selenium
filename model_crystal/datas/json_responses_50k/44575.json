I facilitated the communication from the board to the committees and vice versa. I attended weekly board meetings where we worked on our policy plans (e.g. we created an admission policy) and we organized activities like the Active Member\u2019s Activity. I proposed and set up the Monthly Committee Drink and I organized two Dance Exams. Lastly, I tried to help members with their questions during activities and dance lessons and I tried to make sure new members would feel welcome at our association. "
