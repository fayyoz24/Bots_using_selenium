You became a father.\nWith fatherhood, you got Responsibility. Capital R.\nAnd you feel it in your bones.\n\nThat Responsibility has made you a different man.\nIt\u2019s the best thing that has ever happened to you.\nYou know it is.\n\nYou simply wish for it to be easier.\nPeople make it seem easy.\nWhy isn\u2019t it for you?\n\nI\u2019ll let you in on a secret.\nParenting is never easy.\nNo parent has it easy.\n\nWe all feel like you do.\nGuilty.\n\nBecause we\u2019re not enjoying ourselves as much as we would like to.\nBecause we don\u2019t want to be angry all the time.\nBecause we feel we have to be better for them.\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible to drop the dad guilt.\nTo feel great as a dad, instead of insecure.\n\nTaken to the next level, you will flourish.\nYou\u2019ll create a more enjoyable life and meaningful experiences.\nNot just for yourself, but for your kids as well.\n\nBecause your kids will mimic you. \nIf they see you struggle, they will learn to struggle.\nIf they see you glow, they will learn how to glow.\n\nWould you love...\n\u2022\tTo drop the guilt?\n\u2022\tMore energy?\n\u2022\tWay less stress?\n\u2022\tMore joy?\n\u2022\tMore direction?\n\u2022\tFor yourself and your kids?\n\nBrace for the good news... I'm a parent.\n(World\u2019s best dad 7 years running, according to my kids.)\n\nI'm a pretty damn fine coach, too (if I do say so).\n\nI\u2019m nerdy as well.\n \n\nWhen I watch LotR, I watch the extended edition.\nIf you do as well, and you want to know how to help you enjoy this whole dad thing and not lose yourself in the process\u2026\n\nSchedule a call with me.

It has to be wanted, it should be challenging, and, if possible, fun as well. These are the three elements I use to create bespoke coaching to get you, your team and your organisation to the next level.",
