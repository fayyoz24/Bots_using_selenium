    "summary": "Over the years I have now worked in the hospitality industry, I have learned that I really value human interaction and would like to take that into my future job. I have worked in a bakery for several years with great pleasure and nice colleagues, but I was looking for a slightly more challenging job. During the corona crisis, I found it at Brouwerij de Werf in Enkhuizen. Today, I still enjoy working there in a very nice and, above all, young team. There are many fun activities organised for young and old that include the younger employees, so there is plenty of diversity in the work. I have been trained in many areas such as bar, hostess and waitress which keeps the work very enjoyable.\n\nAt the moment, I study tourism management in Diemen, am in my second year and next year I will first follow a minor about responsible travel, and then go on study abroad abroad to Mexico for 6 months. There I will be following a minor at a university of Monterrey on international relations and business. And on my return I will complete another six-month internship and then I can start on my graduation thesis.",
