    "summary": "Choreographer and performer Pauline Roelants has graduated from the Amsterdam Theatre School, direction Modern Dance and Dance Expression.\nPauline Roelants is co-founder of United Cowboys and has been with the company from the start as resident choreographer; she\u2019s also involved in all the performances as a dancer / performer.\nIn the first years the oeuvre concerned dance solos, combined with video / music, such as Virgo (1989) and Amok (1994). During those days United Cowboys developed as an interdisciplinary group, in which different art forms were present, and in which dance prevailed.\nDance as a means of revealing eloquence of the moving body.\nOver the years Pauline Roelants has developed a personal idiom that is characterized by a subtle combination of power, sensuality and eroticism, the choreographies are one of the pillars of the overall work of United Cowboys. Notable examples from those days include Untitled (Cowboy) (1992), Say No More (1998), Error (2001), To Be Continued (2005), Please do not touch the Parrot (2006) and Boogie Nights (2008)).\nHer expressive and at times explosive dance idiom can be described as \"the power of motion reduced to the essence.\" To achieve this, Roelants \"boned\u201d dance to the fascination for the body and the power of the performer. 'individuality, not uniformity'.\n\nIn 2011 Roelants\u2019 picked up her individual choreographic research with Apology; a dance performance, again about Man wandering, Man who\u2019s still just trying, and not often failing.\n\nNext to the Netherlands, performances are played in Belgium, France, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia.\n\nWith intervals, Pauline Roelants gives workshops and Master classes dance and performance, further, she\u2019s involved as a teacher at the Fontys College of Arts in Tilburg  (NL) and formerly at the Royal Conservatory dance department at Antwerp (BE).",
