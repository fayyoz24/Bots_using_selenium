    "summary": "I am a dynamic and self-motivated researcher with 5+ years of research experience in industry and academia. With background in Polymer Science, I'm currently working as a PhD candidate in the Elastomer Technology & Engineering group at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. The goal of my PhD project is to develop a better understanding of rheological and dynamic properties of silica-filled synthetic rubbers (SSBR, BR), which can help in developing next generation (functional) elastomers for tire-related applications.\n\nOver the years, I have proven my abilities of problem solving and strategic thinking, and advanced in research analysis and communication skills required for successfully building collaborations and integrating in multi-cultural environments.\n\nOne of my other passions is teaching mathematics. In my free time, I maintain my website www.mathletic.nl and help students overcome the fear of math.\n\nI look forward to connect with professionals from diverse backgrounds working in industry and academia and expand my network.",

The functions and requirements of a bridge bearing (elastomeric and plastic part) were detailed. Based on literature, theoretical study on designing the elastomeric part as well as the plastic part of the bridge bearing (elastomeric part: compound ingredients, mixing, vulcanization, recycling possibility; plastic part: choice of material, production process, economical aspects; fixing of both parts) was carried out. A proposal to achieve a low friction surface of the bearings and replacement of steel laminates with thermosets was presented. The final presentation was held at company headquarters.",

In this study, the synthesis and characterization of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots using two precursors of Cd and Se by methods of colloidal chemistry was carried out. Soluble selenide was employed to provide a highly reactive Se source in the synthesis. Reactions temperature and Cd/Se ratio in raw materials were also important parameters influencing the morphologies and phases of the products. Different particles sizes were grown on the colloidal suspensions and this depended on reaction time. They hold potential applications in area of fingermarks detection in forensic traces to develop latent fingermarks in the field of forensic science.",

A uniaxial compression method was employed to quantify unconfined yield strength of the mixes. The content of loosely bonded filler particles were measured using a specialized equipment which quantified the dampness of the mixes. The analysis of data using mathematical tools helped in developing a predictive model for the future.",
