    "summary": "Full stack software engineer with a lot of experience on web applications, both on the back-end and front-end. I enjoy working with challenging problems and to coming up with innovative, efficient and creative solutions for them.\n\nThroughout the years, I worked with many different languages and technologies, such as C, C++, Perl, Java, Python, Javascript, among others. I'm experienced on Windows, MacOS and Linux, both as user and developer.\n\nI enjoy working as a team player, although I have also worked many times as lead and also stand-alone developer. I'm always ready to explore new grounds, and test new ideas.\n\nI was born and spent most of my life in the big city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. In 2013, I decided to move to Amsterdam, Netherlands, in search of new challenges and opportunities. Above all, I was attracted to the city's penchant for enterpreneurship, critical thinking and innovation. I enjoy its lifestyle and multi-cultural environment, and I especially love its beautiful canals and parks.",

Working with a very small team (most of the time with only 2 developers), we successfully launched the MVP on the AppStore for iOS in August/2017 with the Android version currently being in its final stages.

Worked on all aspects of the bliep stack, acquiring experience with Google App Engine, Google Datastore, BigQuery, as well as other platform solutions such as Amazon Web Services.\n\nDuring that time, dealt with many different types of challenges, from usual software development tasks (new features, bug fixing, internal support) to architectural, going as far as re-engineering the whole stack to (successfully) port bliep to a new MVNE on a very tight schedule, for telecom industry's standards (6 months), thus helping the company to achieve its goal and meet the deadlines.\n\nAs a team member, used agile software methodology, test driven development, short release cycles, and continuous integration, focusing on Python.",
