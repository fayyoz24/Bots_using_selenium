He is fascinated by the contrasts created between human instinct, intuition and perception. In search of a deeper understanding of the function and the existence of the human being, he uses the human body as a medium that gives shape and form to life\u2019s abstraction. His ultimate goal is to show richness and multiplicity in layers of meanings and symbols in order to invite the viewer into a trip, to stimulate one\u2019s fantasy and to open up new doors for interpretations and associations. To inspire them to experience things from a different perspective so that they can re-evaluate on basic principles of human nature such as what we consider to be normal.\n\nWhen working with his artistic team, he establishes an intimate working environment during a creation that creates fertile ground for artistic exchange. He challenges both himself and the performers in a making process by taking risks, surpassing comfort zones and constantly experimenting. At the same time he gives a lot of freedom to their creativity, potentiality and personality. Conceptually, he is interested in combining different theories from a vast field of sources including philosophy, dream analysis and modern physics which he aims to translate into concrete live images. Inspired by the movement of Surrealism, he deals with the theatrical elements in an aesthetic way as if they are a surreal painting of juxtaposed realities, striving for images of strong emotional power and poetry. He is searching for consequence in the choices of those characteristics; costumes, material, puppets, masks, d\u00e9cor, sound and light. Dance and performance is placed in relation to them, making his work potentially a total work of art. He is eager to adjust it in many different contexts in the working field such as theatres, musea, galleries and location festivals.",
