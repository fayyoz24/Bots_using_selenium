    "summary": "As both an engineer and a teacher I combine my skills to get the best results out of my colleagues and myself everywhere and everytime. As an engineer I enjoy analysing designs and processes to understand both the technical reasons and the process related reasons for any improvement or new design. I love problem solving, and my thirst for knowledge and background insights, gives me the opportunity to be creative in coming up with solutions. As a teacher and team oriented person I enjoy sharing my knowledge and background with other people, trying to help them learn and grow, and also improving awareness and understanding across the organisation.
