    "summary": "Diana Adela Martin is an educational researcher focused on engineering education, engineering ethics, responsibility and interdisciplinarity.\n\nDiana has examined how ethics, sustainability and societal aspects are taught and implemented in the engineering curricula. She also developed teaching materials and case studies.\n\nDiana was a guest speaker at the invitation of The European Commission DG Research & Innovation,  Euraxess  Japan  &  Delegation  of  EU to Japan, the European Forum Alpbach, D\u00e9l\u00e9gation Wallonie Bruxelles a Bucarest, Engineers Ireland, University College London, the SATORI FP7 project on themes ranging from engineering ethics to social entrepreneurship and research policy.\n\nFor her educational, projects she was selected by the European Forum Alpbach as one of Europe's innovators in tackling inequality.\n\nDiana is also interested in research and educational policies. She collaborated with the European Commission DG Research & Innovation as a founding member of Euraxess-Voice of Researchers (2012-2016), and took part in advisory meetings with policymakers from Romania, Austria, Belgium and Albania on education related issues. \n\nSince 2019,  Diana is active in the working group on ethics of SEFI - The European Society for Engineering Education, where she develops a monthly newsletter and organizes a series of online seminars.\n\nAcademic background\nDiana completed her PhD project entitled \" Towards a sociotechnical reconfiguration of engineering and an education for ethics: A critical realist investigation into the patterns of education and eccreditation of ethics in engineering programs in Ireland\" at TU Dublin, in July 2020. Her dissertation committee included Eddie Conlon (sociology), Brian Bowe (STEM education), Kevin O'Rourke (digital education) and Carl Mitcham (philosophy).",
