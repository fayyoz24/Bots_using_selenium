    "summary": "I thrive on making people WORK.\n\nI sincerely believe in making the sheer impossible possible, by connecting people and resources. Connecting the people around me is what I live for. While I have a professional background in financial analysis and risk management, what I always look for in anything I do, is the social factor. I do not believe in shareholder value or financial profit as goals in themselves. \n\nProfit for an organisation that I work for is shown by the results that matter \u2013 the people.\n\nMy personal reward in anything I do, comes from supporting other people and enabling them to achieve their goals \u2013 and to excel while they are getting there. The combination of my ability to get to the bottom of every problem that is desperately looking for a solution with my drive to help the people around me \u2013 that is where I can and will make the difference.",
