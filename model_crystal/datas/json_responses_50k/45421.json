The psychiatrist, Kelly, tormented by an abusive childhood, finds solace in the scientific realities of the medical profession. But this trust in medicine is shaken when she begins to treat, and then befriends a young Chinese girl, Eve, who lives nearby. Soon this relationship becomes more than friendship, as Eve entices Kelly into a world of cults and dark magic. With no place to hide from an invisible nemesis, the walls between reality and fiction, truth and lies, doctor and patient disintegrate. Ultimately only tragedy can bring this well written story of director Edward Lau to a shocking conclusion.",

This relatively new field of inquiry focuses on cultural content (music, video and film, TV, radio, performing arts, etc.) and its integration with the most recent Information and Communication Technologies, including the field of Human Computer Interaction.\n\nThe research areas comprise a vast number of aspects ranging from multimedia processing and analysis, new media formats, content creation, searching, integration, adaptation, diffusion and presentation. The application domains of MAT range from improvements in conventional areas such as computer graphics, sound and music computing and artificial intelligence through enablers of new media industries up to new development of health therapies, education, fashion, and tourism, for example.\n\nThe MAT research program aims at achieving innovation in various scientific and technological fields within the domain of Media Arts and Technology. Expected outcomes will range from knowledge production (high-impact scientific publications and publications in the general media) to innovative prototypes and modular technologies of use to industry as well as end-users.",

In particular, how do systematic patterns of signal properties (timing, metrical structure, loudness, etc.) relate to the experience of groove at several levels of the metrical structure?\n\nTo answer these questions, in ShakeIt, we follow an analysis/synthesis approach, and explore complementarities between three lines of work:\n\n- Automatic analysis of groove features from audio. In particular, focusing on automatic learning from examples of what we call the \u201cgroove archetype\u201d of certain music styles.\n- Empirical experiments with human participants to validate/invalidate these features and to investigate if there are other relevant features for the perception of groove.\n- Implementation of a software for real-time generation/manipulation of polyphonic rhythmic sequences conveying the groove of a certain style, or to gradually change the groove feel of a rhythmic sequence at run time.\n",

            "description": "The genetic material of virtually all eukaryotes exists as chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is a nucleosome, an octameric complex of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, around which about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped. Chromatin is a complex and highly dynamic environment. Nucleosomes are differentiated by variants of histones H2A and H3 and by many histone post-translational modifications, chromatin-associated proteins and linker histones. Nucleosomes are positioned both by the underlying DNA sequence and by remodeling enzymes and histone chaperones that can mobilize, disassemble or replace histone subunits. In most eukaryotes, chromatin is also modified by methylation of cytosine bases in DNA.\n\nOur goal is to understand how chromatin components interrelate and integrate to regulate transcriptional activity. We combine genetics and biochemistry with genomics and computational analysis to study DNA methylation, deposition of histone variants, chromatin associated proteins and nucleosome remodeling. Our primary model organism is Arabidopsis, which has a compact, gene-rich genome with extensive DNA methylation and numerous viable mutants in key chromatin-related proteins. These features provide an exciting opportunity to analyze chromatin on a genome-wide scale.",
