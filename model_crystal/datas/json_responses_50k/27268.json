Worked on MATLAB modeling project for the group \u2018Electrochemical Materials and Interfaces\u2019.  Achieved improvements by implementing these additional physical processes and programming:\n\n- Describing the illumination of the semiconductor by dynamic charge transfer processes from both valence and conduction bands of the material. Hereby also coupling the ordinary differential equations (ODE) with the intermediate oxygen evolution reaction species.\n- Implementation of a non-static boundary condition for the hole concentration build-up at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface.\n- MATLAB ODE solver refined by implementing chain-integration methods. Hereby enabling efficient and feasible chopped light illumination simulation. \n\nThis resulted in more realistic model outputs to describe the limiting factors of the electrocatalysis of hydrogen, at the hematite n-type semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Hereby enabling better investigations on the performance of photo-electrochemical water splitting applications.",
