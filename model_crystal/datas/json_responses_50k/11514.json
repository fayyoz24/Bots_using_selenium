I was promoted to Technical Support Representative Level II in November 2003, which involved supervision and assistance of Level I Representatives.  On several occasions I went out on the road with a sales representative or independently, meeting customers face-to-face and troubleshooting and repairing their instruments, and represented IDEXX at veterinary congresses in the UK and Ireland.  I also wrote the work instruction documents for new colleagues learning to work with SAP and gave the SAP training (including Sarbox compliance). In July 2006 I became the Country Process Lead for the UK team, which meant that in addition to my duties as described above, I became responsible for all UK processes for Technical Support and Customer Support (Order Entry), I coached my colleagues in process issues, and reviewed the team\u2019s call tracking.
