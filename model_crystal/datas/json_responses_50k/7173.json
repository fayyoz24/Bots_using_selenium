    "summary": "In my current position I plan, coordinate and execute our internal and external events that relate to our 43 countries and the furthering of their business development and client engagement goals. I work closely with our service lines to create a vision for their events, ensuring it fits with the overall strategy and goals for their team as well as the company. \n\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor in Commerce, with a focus in International Business, I moved into the Tourism & Hospitality Industry. Helping people and creating a great experience for them is one aspect that all my previous positions have had in common and to this day is still what I thrive on. \n\nIn recent years I changed fields and entered the world of commercial real estate. I moved to Europe from Canada, and combining my interest in languages and cultures and my hospitality & service background, I put my detail oriented nature and optimistic attitude to use and stepped into events. \n\nToday I work hand in hand with the Head of Marketing, Communications, & Business Development for EMEA, building a platform so that our advisors can focus on their business. I do this with the help of a team that includes graphic designers, marketing managers, and PR and social & digital teams, and I manage the relevant budgets in relation to this all. \n\nI also act as board secretary to the EMEA Board.",
