And what do they do?, we found out that a lot of young people don\u2019t know where to go and what to do, they almost keep on going to same places every weekend, and therefore we came up with this idea .  Our mission statement is to be the leading web-site that has to deal with promoting events and provides services in Qatar. Our customers will be the youth of Qatar who live in Doha or even outside Doha, and speciously those who are between 15 and 30 years old. Not forgetting that anyone else can join in.\nThe business plan is a web-site that provides information about Qatar\u2019s entertainment, the events that are going to happen in Qatar, and also a lot of services that are going to help the people of Qatar. It\u2019s also going to be very helpful for anyone else who doesn't live in Qatar and would like to come and visit as a tourist.\nIn more details, our web-site provides information about the events that are going to happen in Qatar, information about Qatar, everything that has to deal with Qatar\u2019s events, in sports, concerts, and more.",
