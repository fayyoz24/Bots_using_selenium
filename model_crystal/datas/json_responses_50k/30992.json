    "summary": "I am convinced that high-tech horticulture is the best and most efficient method to produce food. With fewer resources and less surface area needed, higher yields are realized. The produce is safe, of uniform quality and available year-round. Worldwide there is a high demand for knowledge on the best practices in the fields of cultivation, climate control, crop protection, energy consumption, irrigation, labor management and cultivar breeding. It is my personal ambition to play a role in the implementation of these practices in the global horticultural industry. \n\nMy competences that contribute to the achievement of these objectives are: ability to think both strategically and commercially, leadership, loyalty, passion for technology, a large global business network, broad general knowledge and high-quality international horticultural experience.\n",
