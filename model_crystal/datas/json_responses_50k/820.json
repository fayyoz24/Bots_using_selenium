    "summary": "I am a dedicated highly skilled Marine Electrical & Automation specialist with over 30 years\u2019 experience both sailing and shoreside. \n\nI originally sailed as a Radio Officer. After that I completed my ETO training in South Shields, successfully gaining a HND in E&E Engineering and Electronic Navigation Equipment Maintenance certificate. I joined Stolt Tankers where I have been working for the past 27 years during which time I have progressed from a Trainee Electrical Engineer to Electrical & Automation Manager.\n\nAs the company grew the number of ships increased to over 100 ships the Electrical & Automation department was merged with the Maintenance & Reliability to form the Technical Asset Management (TAM) Department. I became the Senior Electric Project Manager.\n\nMy primarily responsibility is to support our fleet of 105 chemical tankers regarding electrical, communications and navigation equipment, especially our fleet of 21 Diesel Electric ships. My main areas now are sustainability projects (shore power, ESS, VFD's etc) and life extension projects.\n\nI am responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Managing Electrical & Automation life cycle projects. Current major projects ongoing are:\n   -Shore power initiative with the Port of Rotterdam, Vopak and Stolt Tankers. https://www.stolt- \n     nielsen.com/news-insights/news/stolt-tankers-joins-feasibility-study-for-shore-based-power- \n     installation/\n   - Retrofit of 4 Ships complete Integrated Control and Monitoring System (ICMS) from Valmarine XD \n      System to Hoglund Marine Automation. 2 of the ships also included an complete retrofit of the Main \n      Electric Propulsion control system from Cegelec (GE) SYCONUM to ABB Mega drive propulsion \n      control system.\n   - Upgrade of SEPAM 2000 with new \u201cSEPAM 1000 Series 80 protection relays on DE ships.\n   - Retrofit of Cargo system on 4 ships \u2013 integration of latest technology into legacy system. \n   - Maintenance and selection of Navigation and Communications equipment including \n       the GMDSS communications equipment (EPIRB, SAT-C, LRIT, SSAS, Etc)\n\u2022  R&D and innovation processes related to electrical and automation activities. \n\u2022  Identify mid- and long-term initiatives related to Energy Management projects for new and existing assets. \n- With the Engineering Applications & Connectivity Specialist we have ownership of all engineering and operational applications on managed ships related to software processes of equipment installed on the managed fleet including cyber security on the OT network and data streams from ships to shore.",
