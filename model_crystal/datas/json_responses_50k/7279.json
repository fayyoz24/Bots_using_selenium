The interest and drive to spread that interest to others came later, although it has always been present in the background during my upbringing. \n \nTheatre and art are two other important things to me and I try to bring creativity and expression to my profession. \n\nCurrently, I am involved in developing teaching methods in reading comprehension that focus more on reading skills and strategies as opposed to test preparation. \n\nI am caring, creative, communicative, enthusiastic, helpful, organized, prepared and team oriented",

            "description": "The Komatsu Bachelor Thesis Prize is an annual prize awarded at Leiden University's Japanese Studies department. Students either submit their thesis themselves, or are put forward by their thesis supervisors. In 2010, my thesis was put forward for consideration for this prize. \nMy thesis, entitled \"Danzaemon\" delved into the meaning and position of this socio-politcal inheritable position in early modern Japan. Danzaemon was the name and title given to the leader of the group of outcasts known as the \"burakumin\". This group consisted mostly out of \"hinin\", people on the fringes of society, and the \"eta\" - tanners, butchers, and executioners. Based on two historical events in the history of these groups, I analysed what kind of position the title of \"Danzaemon\" entailed. \nAfter having being judged by various members of the teaching staff, my thesis, in the end, won the Komatsu Bachelor Thesis Prize. This greatly attests of my ability to research historical data in Japanese, extract the necessary components from them, and analyse them in detail. It also showed my innate ability for writing academic texts and transferring knowledge in an easy-to-read format. ",

This means I have regular talks with my students about their own progress and how they think they are doing. As a mentor, I coach them along their desired path in school. When there are any issues, I am their first point of contact.\n\nAs an extra-curricular activity, I also teach a course in aspects of foreign film for the upper form students.",

Since Bpf Koopvaardij has a great deal of foreign participants to its pension scheme due to the seafaring nature of its members, it is the wish of the pension fund to communicate more in the English language, in order to facilitate the members of the pension scheme whose first language is not Dutch. As such, my main asset for the team lies in my vast knowledge of the English language, my written work, answering phonecalls, and the translation of official documents. In addition, as a team member of the Bpf Koopvaardij pension fund, my other tasks include, among the following:\n\n-\tAnswering incoming telephone calls and correspondence sent by pension fund members;\n-\tAllocating an pension benefits;\n-\tCalculating equalization based on divorce;\n-\tProviding calculations for prospective pensioners;\n-\tMaking application forms for pension fund members.\n\nFurthermore, I had the opportunity to study for the LCP (Leergang Collective Pensioenen) exam, which has increased my understanding of pensions on a whole. It provided me with the necessary knowledge to better answer questions from members of our pension fund and be a more valuable member to the team.",
