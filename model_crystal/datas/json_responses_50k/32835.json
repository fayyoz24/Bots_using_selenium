    "summary": "Working extensively in the international/ European projects and programs from Vereniging Deltametropool on strategic planning/ systemic planning and urban governance. My focus and role in the association and in the planning discussion revolves around bridging research and practice agendas and positioning the Netherlands in the European context. My interest remains on the knowledge network and community of practice on cross border development around the themes of climate transitions and urgencies. I strongly believe in strengthening the knowledge and practices by peer learning and exchange from international networks and urban studies around the world. \n\nSome of my current agenda includes energy and climate actions, spatial planning and design strategies, cross border cooperation, research by design in the Dutch and European context. My work experience has always provided me the opportunity to work in cooperation with hundreds of organisations within my projects and discussions. I enjoy that working method and foresee developing certain tools and skills for better cooperation. I actively take part and organise quite some inclusive activities, debates and platforms. \n\nExperienced Co-Founder with a demonstrated history of working in the design & planning field. Strong business strategy professional with a Master's degree focused in Urbanism from TU Delft and still learning Project Design and Management from Europa Business School.",

At the same time, cities have high demands of infrastructure such as transport and building, and resources such as food, water, and energy, as well as issues like scarcity of adequate land, unapproachable government. All these are adding to the extreme need to find smarter solutions for cities, that can provide better liveable conditions for the citizens. Thus, the Indian government planned 100 smart city project. Many questions were raised on the proposal justification on time, money, approach and objectives.  Through this project, I am evaluating the current proposal as an urbanist and using the opportunity to refine the project  for a realistic and promising future, rather than creating a label of smartness.\n\nIn this project, I explore the conditional development of smart cities, investigating various examples from different continents and producing an analytical framework towards the approach of making a city smarter. These examples are assisting me to set guidelines, to shape the Indian cities with its own definition of smartness. The focal point of this project is Delhi, but the other Indian cities will be able to learn from the process of selection of projects and principles. Although, due to lack of time, I would emphasis of few sectors of smartness, in selective neighbourhoods of Delhi.",
