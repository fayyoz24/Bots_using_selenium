    "summary": "Hi!\n\nThank you for taking the time to take a look at the development of my career and me as a person! \nI worked and studied in two countries, learned three languages, saw various departments, and finally found my passion in marketing and account management.\n\nCurrently working at Deeploy as a Growth Marketer where we enable high-risk industries to further develop innovation, be efficient, and at the same time take responsibility for their AI models. We believe that a human-centric approach with a continuous feedback loop will set the foundation for making ML deployments truly accountable, manageable, and explainable. \n\nI started my full-time career as an Account Manager at LeasePlan. Being part of a company where the customer is central in all the decision-making, provided me with a lot of enthusiasm and interest to conduct meaningful sales.\n\nWant to get to know me or if you want to exchange ideas, please send me a message!",
