    "summary": "Starting my own furniture business was the most challenging, yet the best thing I've done so far. With personal expertise in both product design and manufacturing, I set out to build a business that could bring an idea into a final and manufacturable product. I like to create unique and authentic furniture instead of walking the already-paved path. For this, I have received recognition in the design community and recently a gold winner award in the international muse design competition. I work with both small-scale, hand-made furniture series as well as products ready to be produced at large-scale. I focus mainly on furniture made from wood due to its sustainable character and beautiful looks. I also find it important to design every process in furniture making from a sustainability point of view. I rather think twice than wasting precious resources.",
