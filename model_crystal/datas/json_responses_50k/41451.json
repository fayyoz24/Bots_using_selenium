    "summary": "I am a human rights lawyer with over 20 years of experience. After graduating from the University of Oregon School of Law in 1999 I began my career working at the intersection of environment and human rights in Tanzania with Lawyers' Environmental Action Team. Upon returning from East Africa, I worked to protect the landscapes of the western U.S. from fossil fuel development. I then took a break from law to pursue an M.F.A. in Science and Natural History Filmmaking from Montana State University. This is how I met Our Children\u2019s Trust. In 2010 while leading the North American program for the international human rights organization, WITNESS, I partnered with Our Children's Trust to create a ten-part film series, \"Stories of TRUST\". This series elevated the voices of our youth plaintiffs. Once this partnership came to an end, I stepped onto the Board of Our Children's Trust while traveling the world teaching communities how to use video to document grave international crimes and devastating human and environmental rights violations. I now head up the global work at Our Children\u2019s Trust. In my off time, I can be found with my dogs, Tingo and Charley, rowing or paddle boarding around the canals of Amsterdam or biking the tens of thousands of kilometers of bike paths throughout Europe.",
