    "summary": "Jana is an international installation and photography artist. She was born in the Philippines to a filipina mother and dutch father and proceeded to move around Asia. Considering her home bases to be in San Francisco and Amsterdam, her perspective is based in being asian, international and queer, gender pending. As an artist, it is my life's work to focus on the beauty in life and pursue the interests and issues that intrigue me most. Focusing on installation work as a medium for my photography, I try to explore the people and surroundings in my life.",
