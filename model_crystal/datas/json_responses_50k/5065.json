In this regard, he founded in 2001 Initiatives for Peace and Human Rights (iPeace), a regional NGO which is currently working in Burundi, DR Congo and Rwanda with the grassroots people and local authorities. Apart from the field of human rights in which he was called first by necessity then by passion, Mr. Mbembe has an outstanding politico-legal expertise on the African Great Lakes region that he has been scanning for over ten years. His excellent mastery of the region combined with his academic qualifications made him a first-choice consultant for renowned institutions and organizations, especially in the field of Peace-building, Human Rights, Good Governance, Rule of Law, Regional Integration and Foreign Investments.",

As lecturer of law at this university, I have directly empowered with legal knowledge and legal research skills about 1,000 students in five years. In my teachings the regional integration approach is preponderant. Among others, I have taught the following:\n-\tEconomic and Financial Law (the equivalent of Commercial Law in the American system): I have been teaching this course to undergraduate final year students since 2011. This year (2013) I have put more stress on the attraction and the management of Foreign Direct Investments in the East African Community. With students I explored the legislations of all EAC partner states and the EAC treaty and protocols. Research and discussions were held among others about the applicability of the NT and MFN principles vis-\u00e0-vis the EAC integration process. Compliance to GATT and GATS core principles and exceptions were also tackled.\n-\tMethods of Legal Research: Intended to provide 3rd year law student with knowledge and skills on how to find, explore and analyze legal documents to make a clear and concise report. This course prepares law students for the redaction of their final dissertation. I taught this course between 2007 and 2010. \n-\tIntroduction to Scientific Research: This course is intended to 1st year law students to get them used to legal terminology, to find out legal resources, to read and understand legal writings and documents.

But the consistency of the system depends on how courts at various levels align their respective decisions not just with those rendered by the Supreme Court but also with those taken by any other hierarchically higher court. This alignment fosters harmony and coherence of justice decisions, which definitely strengthens the public confidence in the judiciary. In the framework of the UNDP-funded project \"Research on Leading Jurisprudence from Civil Cases in Rwandan Courts\", I am leading a team made of 4 legal experts and 1 social science researcher in order:\n- To identify and assess legal issues arising from civil cases decided by Rwandan courts between 2010 and 2015\n- To assess and discuss legal basis (statutes and regulations, jurisprudence and other leading authorities) for decision, provided in identified cases\n- To identify, highlight and justify the selection of the leading jurisprudence and legal basis thereto.\n- To provide supplementary legal information that can help judges to decide upon related cases and serve as legal reference for legal practitioners.",

This research was governed by a pre-determined questionnaire and research process outline. The Rwanda country information contributed to the construction of a regional index on free movement of\nservices for the EAC.\nSpecifically:\n- I reviewed and analyzed Rwanda\u2019s commercial laws concerning trade in services to determine their compliance with the \"Freedom of Movement of Services in EAC\" chapter of the EAC Common Market Scorecard.\n- I participated in constructing the regional index and narrative report.\n- I implemented a country-specific verification process on preliminary data collection results.\n- I ensured submission of duly filled data collection forms by respondents and ministries of EAC, and compiled all information sources to ensure data traceability.\n- I participated, when requested, in developing informational, promotional and media\nmaterial for the EAC Common Market Scorecard in relation to the freedom of\nmovement of services.\n- I also produced any other reasonable output as agreed by the World Bank Group in the development of the EAC scorecard.",
