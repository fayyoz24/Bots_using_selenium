Keep reading! \n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf93From 2014-2020 - I did my bachelors in Marketing & Sales (Commerci\u00eble Economie) and Masters in Business Administration (MSc BA). I travelled to Norway and the United States for my internship and graduating assignment\n\n\ud83d\udcafNice! Because I learned fluent Norwegian and English in speaking, writing and reading. \n\n\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4From 2019-2020 - I moved to Norway and improved my Norwegian to become even more fluent and understand it's culture. I led a team of warehouse and construction workers to improve it's internal processes. \n\nI learned what it's like to work with people from 5-7 different cultures. Takeaway? Do not judge! \n\n\ud83d\ude80From 2020-2022 - I founded Avensi after 5 years of experience with selling on Amazon. Avensi helped brands sell on Amazon. I learned what it's like to run a business and all aspects that come with it! \n\n\u2705During these years, I have seen many different cultures, learned fluently speak two new languages, did lots of sales calls with (potential) clients, hired a team to outsource some work and learned more about sales funnels, sales strategies, marketing strategies, online marketing, advertising, copywriting, integration softwares, API connections, building a website, teambuilding, SOP's and much more.     \n\n\ud83c\udf81In 2022, I asked myself: \"where do I want to be in 5-10 years?\" \n\n\ud83d\udcaaI like to work with and being around other people. I get energy from renewing and changing circumstances and I like to develop, design and implement new projects. \n\n\ud83d\udcc8New Business Development - With this in mind, I have chosen to work for Nedap. Starting as in Inside Sales Specialist where my responsibilities and results lie in New Business Development - Lead Qualification & Lead Conversion. \n\nLead Qualification - Qualifying and converting marketing qualified leads into sales qualified leads\n\nLead Conversion - Converting sales qualified leads into happy customers. \n\n\u2705 My foundation for this have been Consultative Selling Techniques as I love to listen, help and advise rather than to talk and to push.",
