As a consequence, productivity was low and frustration high.\n\nWith my gentle persuasion, we moved to Jira and started the Scrum ritual of user story estimation, and built up a backlog. As the team grew, we split into two Scrum teams. The team also moved the software architecture toward supporting one release channel for (almost) all projects - a major step toward better test coverage, and enabling all clients to benefit from a single upgrade.\n\nAmong my responsibilities:\n\t\u2022\tDefining the technical roadmap\n\t\u2022\tDoubling the software team from 8 to 16, and managing performance\n\t\u2022\tImplementing and teaching Scrum with Jira Cloud\n\t\u2022\tWriting offers and preparing contracts\n\t\u2022\tManaging integration projects\n\t\u2022\tWriting and reviewing customer documentation\n\t\u2022\tAdministering subsidies and tax incentives\n\t\u2022\tManaging the day-to-day office environment",
