    "summary": "Following my A Level education in Saint Lucia I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science degree programme in Psychology at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago and graduated in 2012. I obtained employment at The Wee Wisdom International Montessori School, a private international school in Saint Lucia in 2012, as a full time Assistant Teacher in the Reception classroom (children 5 \u2013 6 years). \n\nDuring my time in the Reception classroom some of my responsibilities included:\n\u00b7 Supporting teaching and learning by assisting and supervising individual and small group independent work sessions;\n\u00b7 Introducing basic concepts using Montessori materials in all work areas (sensorial, practical life, arithmetic and language);\n\u00b7 Assisting in planning and leading supervised lessons in general, health and social science;\n. Assisting in writing parent teacher termly reports and conferences;\n\u00b7 Preparing children for annual school activities such as the schools Christmas concerts and National Independence Day celebrations.\n\nThroughout my time in the Reception classroom I became interested in working with children with learning difficulties such as dyslexia and autism, which encouraged me to further my education within the field of Developmental Psychology. I proceeded to the University of York in England in 2014 and completed a Master of Science in Development, Disorders and Clinical Practice in 2015.\n\nIn 2016 I decided to attended the Center for Montessori Education in New Rochelle, New York to gain professional competency in the Montessori Philosophy of education. Following a course of study and internship I successfully completed the programme in preschool education (children 3-6 years) in 2018. I returned to the Wee Wisdom International Montessori School, where I worked as a lead Montessori teacher in the preschool classroom until November of 2019.\n\nAs a trained Early Childhood Montessori teacher most of my responsibilities now reside mainly in writing lesson plans, conducting individual and small group teaching sessions using Montessori working materials and developing and nurturing social and emotional skills among students. However I also have experience in creating student evaluation criteria in developmental and behavioral progress for end of term academic assessment reports and in conducting classroom placement assessments for foreign students between the ages of 5- 9 years. Additionally, I have also worked with children with specific learning needs in the preschool classes alongside other support professionals.\n\n \n",
