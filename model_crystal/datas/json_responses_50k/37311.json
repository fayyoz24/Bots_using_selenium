    "summary": "I am an independent advisor on board matters concerning corporate governance, corporate litigation and stakeholder management. My ability to combine extensive experience as a corporate lawyer at top-tier law firms with good knowledge of management and (sustainable) finance theories has proven unique and particularly useful for companies navigating legal challenges, significant change or rapid growth. Throughout my career I was most praised for my analytical skills, consensus-building skills and writing skills. \n\nIn addition, I am one of the founders and the Board Chair of Marula Square. We run a USD 2m investment fund focused on early-stage ventures offering education-technology, agri-processing or private healthcare solutions in South Africa, Nigeria and/or Ghana. To preserve our values and intellectual freedom, the fund is exclusively funded and managed by graduates from the University of Oxford. Its activities are supported by Marula Foundation. \n\nFluent in Dutch, English and French. Faded knowledge of Polish, Norwegian and Spanish.",
