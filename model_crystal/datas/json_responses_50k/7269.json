    "summary": "Experienced in sustainable use of water resources and flood management by working with both, the academic and the private sectors. I finished my master degree in water science and environmental engineering from 4 different universities in Europe in addition to my bachelor degree from Japan. Throughout my academic journey, I was gained a lot of knowledge and experience from Japan, Jordan, USA, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Slovenia, Gulf countries as well as my home country Egypt. \n\nI have worked as a researcher and as a specialist hydrologist in Japan. I was assigned to work on IWRM and holistic flood-related management projects in data scarce regions and development a risk assessment plan and mitigation despite the lack of data by using other alternatives from remote sensing. I was involved in further projects on the international level in Japan, Jordan, Egypt, and other countries mainly in the gulf regions. In addition to the professional experience, I managed to publish articles in International peer-reviewed journals and a book chapter as well as taking part in international conferences. \n\nI am currently based in Amsterdam and I am working as a flood risk and water resources engineer at CDR International in Amersfoort, which is a fast-growing Dutch engineering consultancy firm in the water sector, that operates globally and has already provided outstanding services in various countries.",

The event was organized and hosted by the WRRC at DPRI and jointly sponsored by the GADRI.\nThe event was successfully held despite the restrictions at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis."
