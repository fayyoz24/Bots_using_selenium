    "summary": "A young dynamic sales professional.\n\nHaving worked in Poland, the UK and the Netherlands over the past five years across a wide range of industries, one conclusion is certain, my vision: Customer First! \n\nMy diverse experience has pushed me to my limits and brought about a greater will to learn and to self-growth. I have developed a particular interest, and consequential unique set of skills, in the vehicle tracking and IT industries. Since beginning my adventure as an Expat in 2010, it is safe to say that I have loved every day.\n\nOn a personal level I am most passionate about motorcycling, learning languages, traveling (covered most of Europe but eager to see the world!), playing sports, cooking or even enjoying TV shows on Netflix.\n\nDon't hesitate contacting me if you have anything I can help you with.",
