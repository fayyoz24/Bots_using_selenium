    "summary": "I am driven by new technologies and nature. I love tinkering with new tools and methods as well as being out in nature. Where these two meet I can best apply my skills and find my passion.\n\nI am good at scripting, image processing, and modelling. I mainly script in R and am working at strengthening my Python skills. I know my way around several GIS tools (QGIS, ArcGIS, Google Earth, FME Workbench) and know their limits. I can work with neural networks (Tensorflow, Keras) and apply classification methods.\n\nIn the founding and leading of a company I\u2019ve had to learn fast how to manage projects and teams. This has been strengthened by working as a freelancer (GIS and EO analysis and consulting), where I learned from others. As a freelancer my main projects are quick feasibility studies with relations to satellite data, analysing (high resolution) data, database design, data visualization and giving workshops to different stakeholders on the usability of EO data. \n\nI am always looking for new places to apply my skills, and new methods and challenges. \n",

I work on the full data flow, from data acquisition and processing to product development, and customer interviews. Next to this I take care of project management.\nThe main project I work on is reforestation in Indonesia, providing information based on satellite and drone data to people in the field. With this information they can monitor more efficiently, and improve management (eg. Early warning for illegal logging and fire detection, monitoring vegetation growth and providing species maps in complex tropical forests).",
