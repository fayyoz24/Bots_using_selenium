In the second phase I define the spares, tools, and training materials that will be needed, and produce the service manuals and training materials. During the third phase I provide technical support for the service engineers, as they learn to work with the new machine. I also propose improvements to increase uptime.\n\nFrom august to early november I was assigned to assist a more experienced Equipment Engineer, to learn basic EE-skills. In addition, I made the initial push for a new way of working to produce and maintain multiple, extremely large service manuals.\n\nIn early november I was transferred to another competency, and assigned to deliver a series of service manuals, for which no supporting technical documentation was available. While writing these, I encountered issues with the design, and started initiatives for design improvements.\n\nFrom january onwards, I became the responsible Equipment Engineer for this entire subsystem. When a crash action was announced to homegenize safety warnings, I developed a way of working to minimze the workload from this action. After that, I piloted a human safety review process for safety manuals. The conclusions from this review contributed to a requirement from the program for another crash action, that all projects perform such a review.\n\nMay-june I spent a month at a customer, to provide training for the local service engineers, and to gain first-hand experience with maintenance in the field. I learned how maintenance actions are performed in practice, at 6 am after a 10 hr shift. I also came up with a simple solution to an equipment deficiency, which had existed for years at this particular customer.",

In addition, I made some hardware changes for the same purpose.\nTo take advantage of the system\u2019s improved stability, I reconfigured the calibration procedure, to simultaneously increase its accuracy and reduce its downtime from sample measurements. In addition, in cooperation with the glassblower I designed and implemented a cooling system with a lower internal volume while maintaining backwards compatibility with similar systems, to reduce the recovery time from switches by more than 50%.\nThe result was a much more reliable system. In addition, calibration accuracy was improved by up to at least 30 per meg for oxygen. Daily uptime for sample measurements with maximum precision was increased from 14,5 hour to 21,5 hour. Improvements were applied to an existing, similar system as well.\nDuring this assignment, I gained experience with Delphi, with gas handling for precision measurements in a Swagelok-based system, and with custom-designed glass devices.",

My assignment consisted of developing an algorithm to determine the wind turbine sound level received for any location in the Netherlands, based on the locations and emission spectra of wind turbines in the Netherlands.\nI collected information on the locations and types of wind turbines from local governments and data on their emission spectra from manufacturers. I used the method from the \u2018Manual for measurements and calculations of industrial noise\u2019 to develop an algorithm suitable for computation. I also coordinated the implementation of this algorithm in a web application with a software developer. \nThe result was a publicly available online application, which was available for a year, where people could enter the location of their house, which produced the wind turbine sound level received there.",

I began work as a sideline job, but quickly developed from starter into a self-sufficient, reliable producer of well-readable articles. I was motivated to take on ever more assignments, sidelining the study for several years in the process.\nEventually I decided to prioritize the study over the job, and to complete my MSc in Physics.\n\nAs an IT journalist, my daily activities in included:\n\u2022\tI established and maintained good relations with IT manufacturers to obtain pre-release product samples for review, information and news.\n\u2022\tI participated in press events in numerous countries in Europe and in the US, to network, obtain information on the latest products, and learn about the latest and future technical developments from manufacturer\u2019s technical representatives.\n\u2022\tI arranged the pre-production samples and other components needed for review, before deadline, and if necessary with technical support to overcome technical issues with the pre-production samples.\n\u2022\tI performed technical evaluations of IT products to determine their quality, performance and usefulness for our readers. Taking into account that what is interesting to a reviewer is not necessarily useful to a user, and that relations with business partners are closer than with readers, I nevertheless always performed reviews from the reader\u2019s perspective.\n\u2022\tI wrote articles on technical subjects for a non-technical audience, this included describing complex subjects in simpler terms, while maintaining accuracy.",
