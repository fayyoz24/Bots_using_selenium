    "summary": "Currently, I work in an awesome, rapidly growing start-up in Amsterdam, where the challenges suit my interests.\nJust before that, I did my Master Degree in Germany - in my thesis I utilized Neural Networks as the surrogate models in the Aeroelastic shape optimization problem.\n\nMy interests and possible working goals are related to the widely understood usage of computational power to solve real-world problems with the emphasis on numerical methods, data science, algorithms design, and simulations. I believe that both my education and work experience make me well adapted to projects in these fields. My commitment made it possible for me to hold multiple scholarships and win study-related competitions.",
