    "summary": "Driven by strong challenges, I bring a novel yet adaptive mentality. While being in a fast-paced environment I keep on top of things with a proactive attitude. With a natural feeling for commerce and customer needs I manage to translate their wishes into commercial products. My strength is to quickly understand the actions that need to be taken and push these through the whole organisation and internal departments. I am a real team player and manage to bring all the pieces, from each department, to a satisfying, finished project.  \n\nAt Coulisse I am the glue between field sales and the internal departments. In my job I make sure things are running smooth and on time while proactively working on new leads and projects. My positive nature, proactive attitude and experience not only allows me to manage challenging situations well, but also prioritize what is most beneficial for the business.\n\nWorking within the design and buying department of large Chinese multinational for almost four years, I led designs from creation to customer. In this role I oversaw the development of accessories collections for various markets in South America and Europe. I feel at ease working in fast paced environments and diverse cultures while being able to quickly understand the business dynamics and growth levers of the brands. Given my tenure, I bring about in-depth knowledge of managing relations with Chinese coworkers and international clients.",
