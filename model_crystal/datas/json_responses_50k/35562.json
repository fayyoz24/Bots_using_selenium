    "summary": "\nI have been employed with financial institutions in a wide range of functions, with  significant experience in corporate loans credit policies and credit extension. In that I have been involved in tasks ranging from platform operations (client portfolio management, customer service and credit analysis) and sales (branch and corporate level) to remedial/ recovery in cases of insolvency and credit facilities in default (business loans level). \n\nIn effect this has embedded the ability to understand banking operations together with an understanding of the underlying processes behind front office operations and product links. Having dealt with such a variety of issues, has provided an ideal opportunity to have exposure to a multi-discipline environment both internally, i.e., internal audit and/or compliance departments as well as with external agents such as external auditors, customers, regulation and supervision agencies.\n\nThe position held with Ernst & Young, has provided the opportunity to grasp global account management and proposals coordination and in a truly international organization. Regulations that ranged from the dissemination of information to particular stakeholders to Chinese walls should there be conflicting interest among working groups. The coordination of regional (Southeast Europe- Greece, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and FYROM) financial and business development reporting was an integral part of responsibilities. All aforementioned business engagements had significant client facing interface and exposure, heavy reporting requirements and business analysis. \n\nOn the entrepreneurial level, central in all endeavors had been the element of leadership and own initiative as to constantly evolve the final product, sales management, administration and control of company accounts and relations with external providers.
