The project started with a business idea of beauty and makeup subscription box having French beauty products for the customer based in China. The project URL will give an idea, how the website might look like if transformed in an actual business. Some key points that were kept in mind while designing the website are:\n\n1. Demographic: Chinese women in middle/high-income level and aged between 18-60 years.\n2. Returning Customers: How can u engage your customers so that they become loyal to your brand.\n\nWebsite Address: http://frenchbeauty.wix.com/beautybox\n\nP.S.: Wix is a free platform to create website hence do not support some features that one would like to have in a live web page.",
