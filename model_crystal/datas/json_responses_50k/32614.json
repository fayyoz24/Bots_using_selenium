My main task was to conduct a scientific study on the effectiveness of political and legal programs against human smuggling in India. For this purpose, I conducted interviews with local grassroot organizations, among others. I visualized the main findings of the study in a short documentation. I was also involved in organizing outreach events and information sessions on international human rights.",
