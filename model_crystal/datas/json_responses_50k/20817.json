That will increase their productivity and well-being.\n\nThe third step focuses on attracting and retaining perfect-fit customers for the organization. That is of course the key to a successful business and I make sure that the sales teams develop the mindsets, habits and best practices to go from \"sales at any costs\" to selling to perfect-fit customers.\n\nBelow I describe the different Services I provide.\nThey can be implemented in a complete Program or as independent Modules.",

It has been demonstrated that when people work connected with a purpose bigger than themselves, they work better in teams and they connect with more ease with clients with a similar purpose. Working with ego definitely makes things more difficult at all levels, including wellbeing, because increases cortisol levels and inflammation, which is the precursor of disease.\n\nI will help you to surface your Implicit Purpose, declare your Aspirational Purpose, and Create an Inspirational Purpose that will ignite your team and your clients.\n\nWith \"The Passion Test for Business\" Method, I will also help you as a company, department, or group to find the Top 5 Business Passions that are most meaningful for the whole team, in a consensual manner, so everyone is aligned with your 5 Business Passion Statements.\n\nUsing a specific questioning technique, I facilitate that everyone gets on the same page.\n\nYou will walk out with the Top 5 Business Themes/Passions/Core Values that everyone agrees with, so it will be much easier to make decisions day by day.\n\nAlso, this Method provides you with \"Scores\", \"Markers\" and an Action Plan, so you can identify if you are on the right track to creating the results and impact that you want to create.",

They took us by the hand, translated our material to Russian, and presented it to our prospects.\n\nThey also explained to us the proper way to drink vodka shots: always with a small pickled cucumber afterward!\n\nI never dreamed of visiting Russia 16 times, learning a bit of the language, and meeting amazing people from Electricity companies, both conventional power generation and Nuclear (I was even inside the headquarters of Rosenergoatom: the Operator for all nuclear power plants in Russia!).\n\nBy respecting people\u2019s culture and bringing my passion for technology with the same enthusiasm that I brought to Mexico, the United States, or Malaysia, I was able to connect with the decision-makers of the companies in Russia and make in-roads.\n\nRussians are one the most vibrant and life-loving people that I have ever met. I fell in love with the openness of people there. Don\u2019t ask a Russian, How are you? unless you have 15 minutes to spare because they will really tell you what\u2019s going on in their life in detail!\n\nI discovered that the passion for your work, respect for cultures, creating long-term relationships, and connecting technology features to urgent business needs, are key fundamentals to do business in every part of the world.",
