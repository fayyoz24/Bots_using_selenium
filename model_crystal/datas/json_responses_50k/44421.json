    "summary": "In 2018 I finished my masters in Theoretical Physics. Parallel to my studies I've honed my coding skills through university courses, hackathons, open source contributions, freelance and personal projects ranging from 3D computer graphics and a toy crypto currency to API backends and developing iOS apps. After receiving a scholarship from Apple for WWDC in 2017 and later being admitted to the T500 by TNW, my motivation and interest for programming were even more increased.\n\nI was able to apply my programming skills at BIT, both during and after my studies. Here I have been working on high tech innovation projects for several large companies, both as a developer and a tech lead.\n\nBit also gave me large creative freedom. While my main role was as a developer and tech lead I was also given the freedom to design and build large parts of their new office spaces and contribute to their branding.\n\nAside from Theoretical Physics, programming and tinkering with hard- and software, my passions are  acting, making, surfing, snowboarding and rowing. I also have a passion for art, be it film, music or visual.\n\nI'm currently looking for a new challenge. Preferably at a company with a futuristic, social or environmental mission. I have broad experience in hard- and software, gained from projects covering hardware prototypes, data science, neural networks, computer graphics and backend development.",
