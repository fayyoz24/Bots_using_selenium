    "summary": "A huge eCommerce, growth hacking and marketing enthusiast. I enjoy tackling different markets, studying different behavior and solving growth issue with many different type of experiments. \nI've done offline marketing, online marketing, client management, sales, as well as leading a team of 15.\n\nI've been mostly a nomad in my entire life. I've lived in 5 countries in the last 12 years. I've learned to adjust and adapt depending on the place I'm living in. \nI managed to receive a few awards during my professional stint: Gasterra Transitie Prijs, a Netherlands-wide competition to improve sustainability in FrieslandCampina's dairy farmers worth EUR30,000, Bronze in OOH advertising with my agency, Columbus, the TOP Brand award in Groceries with HappyFresh Malaysia and had HappyFresh Campaign featured in Adweek. \n\nWhen I'm not working, I spend my day golfing, or singing my lungs out to pop songs. Never doubt your bathroom talent, it landed me an IMDb page!",
