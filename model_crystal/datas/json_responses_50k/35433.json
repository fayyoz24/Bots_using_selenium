After investigating the causes which affected the quotation lead time I came up with solutions together with the departments involved; Sales, Purchase, Logistics and Finance. I made Service Level Agreements and Key Performance Indicators for each department and I created management information tools. By simplified and automatised processes and by installing Service Desks at both Purchase and Logistic departments, I had been able to bring down the average quotation lead time by almost 80% within three months.",

At each department a specialist was appointed to be part of the project team. I was representing the Sales Department.\n\nThe highlights of the project were:\n\n- to assess and optimise current processes\n- to create added value for customers\n- efficiency in the supply chain ready for the future\n\nIn order to maximise the effect four phases were planned. These four phases strengthened each other and delivered a holistic view on the processes organisation and management information with a maximum of potential savings, and total integration of change management.\n\nIn phase one \u201cMake strategy explicit\u201d the management defined a competitive strategy. The processes with improvement potential were defined, changes were pointed out and the critical success factors were listed.\n\nIn phase two the organisation was looked upon \u201cfrom the moon\u201d: the existing business scenarios were investigated by flow of goods, money and documents/information.\n\nIn phase three the project team zoomed in on the business integration scenarios by checking out all end to end processes & documents. We analysed them and made simplified processes with reduction of time and reports.\n\nThe last and fourth phase was to asses all processes in all their steps with the question in mind \u201cis an activity adding value for the customer?\u201c In this last phase the processes of phase three were broken up into activities, skipping non-contributing process steps and introducing value adding steps.\n\n\n\n\n",
