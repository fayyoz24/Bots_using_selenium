    "summary": "-- Global marketing, integration and innovation professional whose entrepreneurial leadership and creativity produce outstanding results for organizations who must innovate in order to grow. --\n\nThe global marketplace is a constantly evolving ecosystem. Large organizations are plotting their course through turnarounds, re-inventions and expansions -- and require transformative approaches to do so.\n\nStartups are disrupting large organizations at an ever-increasing rate. When you look at the numbers, Startups are failing more than succeeding. I can pinpoint the absolute must-haves for startups to succeed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nInvestors, whether Angel, Seed, Venture or Private Equity are placing their bets . . . . and sometimes it seems like a roll of the dice. I have a way to methodically reduce this uncertainty.\n\nMy passion is defining and delivering dynamic, innovation capabilities and new ideas recognized for producing outstanding growth and profitability for companies \u2013 both large and small, brands, investors and people ... even amidst complex organizational and marketplace challenges.\n\nI am a wholehearted believer in the power of integrated communications and have developed an expertise in cross-business and cross-geography collaboration. My leadership makes connections happen -- whether that connection is between the internal and external; the business and the agency mix; or the idea and the implementation.",
