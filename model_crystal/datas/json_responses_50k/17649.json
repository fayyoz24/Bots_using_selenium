Land and the resources that are embedded in it are of crucial importance to enhancing livelihoods, thus ensuring that these lands are community property is vital to ensure that it will not be sold, subdivided or grabbed for industrial development projects or tourism. Additionally, I will take part in investigating triggers for conflict between different actors in the region that often arise from natural resource distribution and claims to land. IMPACT facilitates inter communities conversations on these resource-based conflicts and especially focuses on training youths in peace building and dialogue.",
