Establishing a genuine connection between the volunteers and the children was important because we wanted the kids to truly feel relaxed and happy. Another vital goal of Foodclub was to encourage children to seek further education and boost their confidence in academia, as well as converse about their dreams and goals. Overall, the club proved to be a major success and continued to host many more meetings."
