    "summary": "It is undeniable we are facing the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. Climate Change, human rights and public health crises continuously follow each other up at an unprecedented pace. \n\nHowever, we already have the solutions. It is up to us to commit ourselves to these solutions, dedicate the necessary resources and collaborate to reach the goals we have set out. \n\nWe will need courage, honesty and accountability to defy the odds and implement these solutions before it is too late. It is my mission to foster these values in order to reinvent our future. \n\nMy approach is centered around building effective coalitions, platforms, and content to foster collaboration, inspire stakeholders to take action and build bridges towards collective, inclusive solutions. \n\nThrough my mixed academic background, varied work experience, and limitless curiosity I have been able to facilitate cross-sector partnerships, organize knowledge-sharing events (>100 people) and contribute to the implementation of international standards on human rights and climate change. \n\nWhen I am not working I maintain my blog on sustainability, mental health and diversity and inclusion, enjoy various sports such as fitness and bouldering  or spend time with my loved ones.  \n\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out or connect with me.",
