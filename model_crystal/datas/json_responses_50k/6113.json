    "summary": "Hi everyone, I am a 24-year-old part-time student currently pursuing a Health and Clinical Psychology Research Masters degree at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Prior to this, I completed my International Bachelor's degree in Psychology at the same institution. I also completed my International Baccalaureate at the International School of the Stockholm Region in Sweden.\n\nIn terms of work experience, I have been fortunate enough to gain a range of diverse experiences. Most recently, I worked as an Education Manager for Queer Leiden University, where I helped build a manual of resources that are Trans- and Non-binary friendly. In January 2022, I worked at Karolinska Hospital A05 Diagnostics in Stockholm, where I was responsible for packing corona test kits to send to big corporations around Sweden.\n\nI have also worked as a Substitute Teacher at Dibber International School, where I taught Spanish, English, Swedish, and Social sciences, as well as planned and implemented anti-bullying courses in classes of children between 11-14 of age.\n\nIn addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a diverse range of personal interests that reflect my passion for learning and growth. Lately, I have been delving into the world of third wave therapies and eastern medical approaches to healing, as well as exploring Buddhist philosophy and end-of-life practices. I am also deeply interested in the psychology of palliative care and its impact on individuals and families. As an advocate for LGBTQ causes and sexology, I believe in the importance of promoting understanding and acceptance in all areas of life. These varied interests reflect my desire to constantly expand my knowledge and engage with different perspectives.\n\nI would describe myself as an ambitious and fast-learning person who enjoys learning new things and expanding my areas of knowledge. I am always looking for opportunities to grow and support others' growth. I enjoy talking to people, exchanging ideas, and executing them. Thank you for taking the time to read my overview, and please feel free to connect with me if you would like to learn more.",
