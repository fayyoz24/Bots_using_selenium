    "summary": "I believe that Strategy and implementation need to be aligned closely. I like working with organizations and people in developing intuitive and structured solutions to the business challenges they are working with and then help them achieving it.\n\nI have been helping clients develop a strategic perspective on various business and operational areas. This includes Revenue focused 'Growth Strategy' (Business model shifts, market entry, sales force optimization) and Performance focused 'Operational Strategy' (Cost, speed, organizational efficiency in Supply chain, operations and manufacturing) areas. \n\nI started my career working with Citibank in their global analytics team and then moved on to KPMG as part of their strategy and operational consulting advisory business. This journey has been interesting and insightful and has given me the opportunity to learn and interact with multiple companies, business models and people across 4 continents (Asia, Africa, US, Europe) and multiple countries having delivered 50+ engagements.",
