I would love to pursue a career in management consultancy, project management, investment management, or finance traineeship.\n\nI have a background in civil engineering that gave me an analytical mindset but also I developed soft skills such as communication, negotiation, leadership, and management under my master's in business administration. I like to speak in public, talk to people, and bring some experience in consultative sales. \n\nI enjoy developing business strategies such as digital transformation or M&A.\n\nAnalytic, amiable, and sportsman person.  I am a resilient and committed person, with more successes than failures in my life. I am creative and I enjoy developing strategies. Available for relocation. Fascinated by multidisciplinary, multinational, and multicultural challenges. \n\n\u201cGoing global\u201d has been a natural fit for me as I am multicultural and have lived and studied in Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and the Netherlands working for European, and Chinese organizations.\n\n\nThanks for visiting my Profile.\nharoldmcaro@gmail.com",
