    "summary": "I graduated from the University of South Florida in 2011 with a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences in Women and Gender Studies. I maintained a 4.0 GPA within my collegiate focus and graduated with honors. In 2012, I started attending the proper courses required by the IND for Dutch immigration through the Ttif.Company. In early 2014, I received my diploma for the Staats Examen NT2 I. My past education experiences have provided me with a lot of practice in research, ranging from researching topics on human/gender/women's rights, environmental policies, the relations of food to our cultural and historical backgrounds, and even how to properly use verbs and form sentences in the Dutch language. Along with research, my writing skills have also been fine tuned due to the copious amounts of papers, projects, and presentations I was assigned, as well as the essays I practiced writing weekly in order to pass the Staats Examen.\n\nI also have the ability to balance busy work schedules with life. I attended University full time, worked full time, became a volunteer research assistant, and maintained a social life. I volunteered as a research assistant at Mary Help of Christians Foundation Inc, beginning in early 2011. Through this position, I researched grants that were available and that the foundation could apply for. I also edited grant proposals before they were submitted. In addition, I worked in a high volume casino and was able to acquire great teamwork skills, sharpen my customer service skills, further improve my communication skills with guests, colleagues, and management, and be responsible for large volumes of money.\n\nI am confident that I would be an asset to a company because I have the ability to learn new skills, succeed at anything I put my mind to, work well within group and personal settings, remain both flexible and focused, and multi-task while still paying attention to detail. I do have a valid work permit in the Netherlands.",
