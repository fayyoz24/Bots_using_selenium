    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for visiting my profile. Drop me a message if you would like to establish a connection. \nSomething about me - Creator, maker, inventor, design engineer, photographer, guitar player, videographer, astronomer and a superdad. I like to keep my mind sharp and to explore new skills and competences. Life is a personalised series of challenges. I analyse, adapt and overcome every single one of them.\n~~~\nTECHNICAL BACKGROUND AND SKILLS:\n- Mechanical Engineering - I am experienced mechanical engineer. Creating something from nothing with CNC milling, turning, laser routing and additive manufacturing is something I wholeheartedly enjoy. My software skills related to mechanical design are: SolidWorks,  Siemens NX, CATIA, Fusion 360 and Inventor. \n\n- Electronics and Electrical Engineering - I am experienced electronics and electrical engineer who enjoys fiddling around with black magic and sparks. Everything and anything that goes on a PCB is interesting to me! Performing PSPICE simulations and routing of multi-layer printed circuit boards is always fun too. My software skills related to hardware design are: Altium Designer, Mentor Graphics Capital Suite, OrCAD, Eagle, NI Multisim, LTspice.\n\n- Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer - I am confident in performing multi-physics simulations.  My software skills related to CFD analysis are: COMSOL, FloTHERM, SolidWorks Simulation and ANSYS.\n\n- Manufacturing - As a hobby I am interested in machining - CNC routing and turning. I have very good soldering skills of small surface mounted devices. I have operated various 3D printers for rapid prototyping of machined parts, test fitting of complex assemblies and practical objects useful for my astrophotography hobby. I have practiced some TIG and MIG welding techniques.\n\n- Programming - I am capable of general high level programming and I am familiar with several embedded micro-controller eco systems. I have experience in using NXP, Microchip PIC, Atmel AVR devices. My programming language skills are: MATLAB, C++, Arduino, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.",

The translator converts text files into Braille characters which are displayed on a matrix of 48 actuators in groups of six, each group displaying a single Braille character, enabling digital text to be displayed 8 characters at a time. The ultimate aim is to to reproduce the text as sound, using speech synthesizing software, and ultimately to process printed documents, using a camera and optical character recognition software.",

Every year they design and build a racing vehicle for the UK Formula Student race held on the Silverstone track. Hundreds of teams from many countries around the world participate in the event.\nI was involved with UGRacing for the first two years of my undergraduate career.  At first I was team leader of Class 2, Powertrain division. Later on I became a member of the Electronics Class 1 team. I also assisted the team with System Administration. \nI worked on various projects such as data acquisition system, dash display, variable air intake manifold, CAN bus, Engine ECU, RPM sensors, inertial sensors, wire harness design and installation etc.",
