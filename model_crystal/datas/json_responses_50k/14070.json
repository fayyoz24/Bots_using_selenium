    "summary": "Currently, I am an associate professor in strategy (tenured) at the University of Amsterdam Business School in the Netherlands and a docent at Aalto University School of Business in Finland. At Amsterdam Business School, I am also the co-director of the sustainability initiative and of the Honours Programme Sustainability. My primary research interest is corporate sustainability through cross-sector interactions (between public sector organizations, businesses and civil society). More specific research themes include: sustainability partnerships and alliances, international corporate sustainability in context, corporate responsibility regulation, political corporate social responsibility; business - civil society relations; circular economy; corporate sustainability and development; and corporate stakeholder strategies. I have published widely in the fields of (international) management, business ethics, policy and environmental studies and have editorial roles in multiple leading academic journals and have received several research, teaching, and academic service awards. In addition to an international and cross-disciplinary academic career, I also have experience in CSR and public sector consulting and working for nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations (such as Save the Children and the United Nations). In research and teaching, I have collaborated with organizations such as City of Amsterdam, City of Helsinki, Google, Interface, KPMG, Nokia, Philips, Stora Enso, Unilever, VodafoneZiggo and several start-ups and scale-ups.\n\nFor further information, see my university website (www.uva.nl/en/profile/a.e.kourula), Google scholar profile (http://scholar.google.com/) or twitter (https://twitter.com/ArnoKourula).",
