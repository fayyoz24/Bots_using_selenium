Over the past six years, I've engaged in 15+ projects across Vietnam and The Netherlands, holding positions from Project Manager to Social Media Influencer, all closely tied to my studies.\n\nMy former manager once shared that he chose me due to my clarity in knowing my preferences and my dedication to transforming my dreams into reality. My fascination with people drives my passion for interaction and connection. Creativity, curiosity, and a thirst for learning fuel my personal growth. Embracing diverse working styles and methods that align with individual personalities and paces is something I strongly value.",
