    "summary": "I am an innovator with a passion for improving the quality of and accessibility to mental health services through technological solutions. \n\nCurrently, I am a PhD candidate at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR) at the University of Amsterdam. My research currently focuses on social robotics and expanding the theoretical framework underlying human-robot communication, and understanding communication in general. \n\nI am also the founder of The Sarg Initiative, an early stage social startup aimed towards improving mental health literacy in the educational ecosystem in India. We are currently seeking out educational institutions to be our first users!\n\nI completed my BSc (Hons) in Psychology from University College London in 2019. My undergraduate dissertation about the differences between interpersonal trust and trust in artificial intelligence was awarded the PsyPAG Undergraduate Award. Subsequently, I graduated with MSc in Human-Machine Communication from the University of Groningen in 2021. During my Master's degree, I was a visiting research student at Cornell Tech, Cornell University. I also completed an internship at the Human Factors group in TNO, Netherlands. \n\nDuring my time at UCL, I was involved in various student activities. I was the founder and president of a student research network known as UCL Connect.ed. During the pandemic, my cofounder and I are brought the core missions and vision of Connect.ed to life outside UCL and on a global scale. The CABLE Project played an important role in allowing university students to build their professional networks in an increasingly remote world.\n\nIn 2019, I was selected to be a part of the University of Groningen Honours Master's Leadership cohort, which allows a selected group of students with an aptitude for leadership to further develop their skills. I also brought Hult Prize to the University of Groningen and led the first-ever OnCampus Program. Additionally, I have also worked for UN SDSN Youth as a Project Officer for the Investment Readiness Program. \n\nOutside of my work and education, I am an avid reader, photographer, and traveller! If you see something interesting here, feel free to drop me a message. I am always open to new collaborations and enthusiastic discussions.",

The research investigated the effectiveness of gameplay on learning with students studying cybersecurity. I learnt about the challenges related to data collection and analysis in naturalistic settings. I further improved my report writing skills. My learnings from this project effectively supplemented my degree studies. \n\nI also completed an independent research related to navigation instructions and the influence of personality. This research studied the how different navigation instructions interact with one's innate personality to influence navigation performance and route memory. Broader implications associated with the use of navigation technologies were noted. \n\nMost recently, I worked on a research investigating the difference between trust in humans and in artificial intelligence technologies. The effect of individual differences on trust was explored. I am currently attempting to publish all projects.",
