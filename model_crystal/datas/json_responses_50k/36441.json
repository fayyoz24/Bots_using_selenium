    "summary": "I spent more than 20years mastering the piano as a concert pianist. This allowed me to learn the qualities of discipline, practice, tenacity and have a good \u2018product\u2019. I then spent years diving in leadership (transformational leadership, leadership through art) as a coach and facilitator. This allowed me to learn the qualities of playfulness, mistakes and the value of \u2018the process\u2019. Both aspects, like yin and yang now inform the way I work as a piano teacher, workshop leader and process designer. \n\nIn the spirit of playfulness and innovation and due to the lack of an all-encompassing word that will \nexplain my diverse background and experience, I've coined the term 'education alchemist'.\nThis better reflects my desire to shift the educational paradigm from its current 'one size fits all' \nmentality, to a path of self-actualization through a more personalized approach. I use \n\u2018education\u2019 in the broadest sense, referring to self and organizational development, problem solving, \nteam building and any growth related processes.\n\nI believe that education is not something that happens exclusively between four walls in education institutions, it is a hands-on, life-long experience with no set curriculum. I am passionate about creating opportunities for cross sector innovation as I strongly believe it is the only way to respond to the ever changing, emerging future with fresh insight.",

As one of the first European conferences on compassion for young people, it responds to the growing need for empathy, authenticity and collaboration in our fast-paced society. \n\n'Deeper knowing-listen from within' is designed to be a safe container that can hold our individual and collective vulnerability needed in order to step into what may feel as unknown but has always been there. We will find our true, authentic voice and explore ways to keep connected to it.\nCombining the wisdom of practices like mindfulness, self reflection, U Theory, Alexander Technique, theatre voice work we will access the knowledge that lies beneath the layers of opinions- ours and inherited, fear- ours and inherited, doubt, limitations, information\u2026and everything that clutters our inner clarity.",

Can I be compassionate with others if I am not with myself?\nJoin me in exploring these questions.\nThis workshop is designed to be a safe container that can hold our individual and collective vulnerability needed in order to step into what may feel as unknown but has always been there. We will find our true, authentic voice and explore ways to keep connected to it.\nCombining the wisdom of practices like mindfulness, self reflection, U Theory, Alexander Technique, theater voice work we will access the knowledge that lies beneath the layers of opinions- ours and inherited, fear- ours and inherited, doubt, limitations, information\u2026and everything that clutters our inner clarity. \n\n"
