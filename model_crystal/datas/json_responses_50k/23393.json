    "summary": "I\u2018m currently a first year Master student at TU Delft in the track of aerodynamics and wind energy.\n\nI got my bachelor degree of engineering in Northwestern Polytechnical University. In my bachelor phase, I solidly learned the basic knowledge of aerospace engineering such as aerodynamics, solid mechanics and the basic rules on how to design an airplane. After I came to TU delft, I spend more energy and time on CFD and numerical analysis. \n\nI have 5 years' Python and Matlab programming experiences and machine learning research experiences. My bachelor final design is the combined result of the above three skills. It was about the Gliding Strategy of Aircraft in Turbulence with the Application of Model Predictive Control(MPC).\n\nI usually pay close attention to the cutting-edge developments in the aviation field, such as electric aviation, the development of the fifth-generation fighter jets, and the application of AI in the aviation field. I very much hope to invest in it in the future\n\nI\u2019m looking for an intern about 3-5 months in the field of aerospace industry, especially on the aerodynamics analysis or eVTOL design.",
