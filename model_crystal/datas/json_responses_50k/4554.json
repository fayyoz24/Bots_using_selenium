    "summary": "\u201cFailure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.\u201d \u2013 Henry Ford\n\nI try to keep my projects within scope, budget and on schedule. Having 5+ years of corporate experience in the areas of Program and Project Management, my strength lies in ensuring the success of the projects through streamlined processes, capturing and sharing best practices & creating winning teams. Known as an innovative thinker with strong communication skills, I have had the opportunity to provide project management guidance to cross-functional teams, lead and facilitate project planning, risk management and financial forecasting efforts, maintain project KPIs, report high level program status to executives and help the teams adapt to innovative and agile ways of working. My experience with corporates, operating in different industries at different positions has taught me to appreciate openness, innovation and cultural diversity.\n\nBeing a Green Belt six sigma certified profession, I have worked with manufacturing teams to derive meaningful insights from data, look for improvement opportunities and design innovative solutions in a very structured manner, thereby leading to improvement in yield throughput (%) of products from 15% to 85%. I have incorporated the methods of lean principles (Kaizen, VSM, RCA, 5S, TPM) to bring in operational improvements, leading to savings of 500,000 USD.\n\nHaving pursued an MBA in the field of International Business from Nyenrode University, Amsterdam, I have had the opportunity to work as an MBA student consultant for various companies. Through these consulting projects, I have developed a deep understanding of how to successfully carry out such projects, delivering outstanding results and managing customer expectations.\n\nCurrently working as a PMO, I am looking for the next best opportunity in the Netherlands to utilise my structured creativity and results proven ability in delivering value to the organisation and its customers.",
