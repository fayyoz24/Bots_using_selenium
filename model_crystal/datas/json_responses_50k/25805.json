It seeks to challenge university students to conceive, design, build, cost, present and compete as a team with a small single-seat racing car in a series of static and dynamic competitions. The format of the event is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a motorsport competition.\n\nThe supply chain management is unique in Formula Student. I applied classroom theories into practice but also develop an understanding in key business aspects including project management, teamwork, presentation skills.\n\nI was sole responsible for product launches, and sponsorship.",
