I talk to everyone and get on with everyone. I am friendly, compassionate, and caring. I have good organizational skills. I am able to manage a large patient caseload without any problems. I am always happy to co-operate with other colleagues within the physiotherapist department, or other health professionals like HCA's, OT's and nursing staff when required. I believe I am trustworthy and reliable. I am good at timekeeping. I am confident with my skills to provide patients with proper and professional clinical diagnosis and create a realistic and patient-centered negotiated treatment plan in order to facilitate them to get back to their established goals and baselines. I know how to maintain patient documentation in a accurate and confidential way. I know the importance of relaying information to other health professionals in the hospital such as OT's or nursing staff so a best plan of action inter-professionally can be achieved to the highest degree. Happy to take on extra responsibility such as running a successful staff experience day. Always trying to develop as a professional physiotherapist further through research, innovative technologies and continuous professional development and education. I am a hard worker and always strive to better myself so that I can better the care for my patients and clients and so making the physiotherapy team more efficient and successful in patient-centered care.",
