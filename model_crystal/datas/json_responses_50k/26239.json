(http://u-learn.nl/en/home-2/)\n\nWe all face challenges at work or at home. Some issues are more practical in nature, while others have a far more profound impact on our lives.  \"Every disadvantage has its advantage,\" said the famous football player Johan Cruijff. At U-learn, you explore what stops you from reaching a goal, gain insight into your questions, and/or learn techniques to face the challenges that shape your life. \n\nBecause every person is unique, we all require different approaches. Some of the tools used are: \n- reflective forest walks,\n- (guided) meditation,\n- Theory U,\n- life coaching, \n- systemic coaching and\n- kinesiology \n\nSome courses I completed:\n- Leading From the Emerging Future, An introduction to leading profound social, environmental and personal transformation.\n- Dealing with emotions, effectively and mindfully\n- Energetic Protection: HSP and how to deal with it\n- Kinesiology\n- Family Constellations (ongoing)",
