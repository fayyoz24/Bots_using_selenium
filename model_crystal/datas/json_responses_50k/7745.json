    "summary": "I have had a variation of different jobs/internships which all have taught me certain skills which I am able to put into practice into my future jobs. I have learned how to target specific market groups during my internship at the Melkweg through social media as well as mainstream media. I have also learned how companies create a brand identity over the course of my thesis. I have learned how to be a leader within large or small groups organising and executing various tasks and activities. \n\nFurthermore I have learned about the sports industry during my minor, sports management, where topics such as sponsorship, event management, branding and history of sports were taught.  As well as that in my first year studying International Leisure Management my course group was selected to represent the school at the Young Entrepreneurship finals coming in third place. Which shows my ability to come up with creative and original ideas. \n\nAs well as being fluent in both Dutch and English I have lived abroad for 15 years in different countries such as Mali, Bolivia, America, New Zealand and the Netherlands. This has shaped me into someone who is able to adapt quickly and get settled into new situations. Also it has made me more open and has improved my communication skills. I believe that these experiences have made me valuable asset to all companies I have worked or companies I will work for, as I am someone who is able to adjust and overcome obstacles with a determined attitude.
