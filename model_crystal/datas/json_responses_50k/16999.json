    "summary": "Experienced Professional holding Bachelors and Master\u2019s degrees in Urban and Regional Planning, I've cultivated extensive experience in the Planning Profession with top-tier Dutch and Indian firms. My journey in the geospatial domain led me to develop EarthML, an advanced Python library dedicated to streamlining geospatial and remote sensing data analysis. Check it out here: https://pypi.org/project/earthml/. EarthML offers processes for geospatial data conversion into geohashes and pre-processing of SAR datasets from Sentinel-1, ALOSPALSAR, and TerraSAR-X. With an ambitious roadmap, we're gearing up to include a broader spectrum of remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Multispectral Optical.\n\nBeyond this initiative, my work experience has sharpened my proficiency in Spatial Data Analysis through scientific methods, GIS techniques, and Python programming. I possess a proven track record in deploying Machine Learning Algorithms for GIS-based Regression Models and utilizing Remote Sensing Techniques for \"Land Cover Segmentation\", \"Above Ground Biomass Estimation\", and \"Deforestation Detection\".\n\nEager to leverage my expertise in addressing real-world contemporary Geo-Spatial challenges, I'm always open to collaborative opportunities that drive innovation in the urban sector.\n\n\ud83d\udce7 akhil.chibber@gmail.com | \u260e +31-687751485",

The Objective of this Project is to Prepare a Model using Python Code so as to Generate the Forest Stand Height (FSH) of entire Amazon Rain Forest using free available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data which can then be used in the Allometric Equation (e.g. AGB = 0.0673 \u00d7 (\ud835\udf0c\u00d7 D2 \u00d7H) 0.976) which can thereby be used to calculate the amount of \"Carbon Sequestered\" in the Amazon Rain Forest.

Developed with a vision to cover a wide array of functionalities, EarthML currently supports geospatial data conversion into geohashes, and pre-processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets from Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Geohash Calculation: Automatically computes the smallest geohash that represents the geographical bounds of the dataset.\n\n2. SAR Data Pre-Processing: Offers functionalities for pre-processing steps on SAR datasets from Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X. This includes thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, and geometric correction.\n\n3. Adaptive Speckle Filtering Technique: EarthML offers advanced algorithm Adaptive Speckle Filtering Technique that dynamically adjusts based on the local properties of the SAR image to reduce noise while ensuring that essential image details remain intact, enhancing the overall quality of SAR imagery.\n\n4. Future-Ready: EarthML is actively improving with a roadmap for integration of other remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR \ud83c\udf32, Hyperspectral \ud83c\udf08, and Multispectral Optical \ud83d\udcf8.\n\nCollaborate with EarthML:\n\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f For Remote Sensing Specialists : If you have an M.Sc. or higher qualification in Remote Sensing and recognize gaps in the geospatial market that no other python library address, I'd love to hear your insights. Please feel free to connect and drop me a direct message.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb For Contributors: Passionate about shaping the future of geospatial analysis with us? To maintain the quality and expertise of EarthML, we welcome contributors with an M.Sc. or higher qualification in Remote Sensing. Looking forward to innovative collaborations!\n\nLink: https://pypi.org/project/earthml/",
