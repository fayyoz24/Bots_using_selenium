    "summary": "Graduated as a Civil Engineer. Worked as a QA Engineer and Requirements Engineer in IT sector. Became a mother. It seems like an unrelated complicated journey, but all these steps were a natural choice. \nI am a technical individual, passionate about technology and how to \"build\" things. Studying engineering gave me a sense of what means to build successful and sustainable products. \nI have almost 4 years of working as a Quality Assurance Professional, from Windows apps destined for PCs to mobile iOS and Android apps. Quality Assurance really gave me an understanding on key aspects that a digital product has to have. \nI was given a chance to become a Requirements Engineer. For over 2 years I worked on digital health products, working in an Agile environment, familiarizing with a products' life cycle, product vision, roadmaps, backlog refinement and prioritising. I became passionate about Scrum and Scrum Methodologies, and really pushed myself into becoming a Scrum Product Owner.\n\nAbout me in numbers and facts:\n- 7+ years of professional working experience in IT - 4+ as a QA and 2+ as a Requirements Engineer\n- Self-starter digital enthusiast\n- Agile/Scrum | Product Visionary \n- ISTQB Certified QA\n- Certified Product Owner PSPO I\n- JIRA/Confluence, Microsoft Office 365, G Suite, Trello\n\n\nStrong points:\nStrong Communicator | Team Player | Facilitator | Storyteller | Delegator | Conflict resolver | Effective Escalator",
