    "summary": "Eager to learn, intelligent, ambitious, helpful, responsible, positive, and enthusiastic! These characteristics are mainly reflected when I get a challenge and with that the space to do my own thing. I create things using my helpfulness and insights. I have an eye for detail and work analytically and structurally. I am socially conscious and I take the earth, climate and the lifes of humans and animals into account. I have many (sportive) hobbies: bouldering, slacklining, winter sports, motorracing (https://www.race-kids.nl/), reading, painting, and traveling!",

In the period that I did not have an assignment due to Corona, I started working for QTG as Software developer. I developed the ExamTrainer application - a tool to practice exams to receive a certificate. The goal is to take the application into use in September. A Product Owner, 4 developers and 2 testers form the ExamTrainer Scrum team. Since everyone is required to work from home (due to Corona), Teams is used as means of communication for, among other things, the standups and cooperation. The building of the ExamTrainer is done in Java 11 in IntelliJ, where the User Interface is build in JavaFX. All codes of the application are managed in Gitlab. The application is built according to the principle of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), because that way the application is easier expanded with new features. To start of, there is a differentiation between the front-end and the back-end. I quickly gained the skill to work with JavaFX, and in this way I enrolled as front-end developer. The UI screens are built according to the design of the Product Owner and the MVC model is applied to this. Within this model, the elements of UI screen, the data for that screen, and the executable code of the screen (such as linking the data to the UI elements or the action behind a button) are separated from each other. In that way, the code is clear and reusable. I have also been involved with the back-end, specifically to come up with ideas, code review, and core refactoring. From this a connectivity-layer arose, which functioned as a clear layer of communication between the front-end and back-end.  In this way it becomes clear where data needs to be requested or passed on, and the front-end and back-end developers can keep working without bothering each other. After a month, we have delivered the first version in package-form, solved bugs that were found by the tester, and given a demo.",

The CRIS application is the registration system of Slachtofferhulp. With this application, clients, conversations, and services are registered. I had the assignment to deliver a trustworthy, easy to maintain, automated regresssion-testset. The framework that was build for the \u2018Online Platform\u2019 team can be taken over and reused to the upmost extent. The main difference between the automation of tests for the \u2018Online Platform\u2019 team and the \u2018CRIS\u2019 team is that the CRIS application is built in iframes. This caused the locators to find web-elements to be different, but a stable and clear solution was found for this problem. In addition we have discovered that the CRIS application functions properly, which means it is not necessary to rerun tests when they fail. Finally, I have thought about efficient test scenarios and managing the high quantities of variables. As a result, the test framework has a clear design and is an easy maintainable whole. Due to the Corona pandemic, the budget for the CRIS team was tightened, which unfortunately led to the decision to temporarily stop and finish the project. Because of this and the size of the CRIS application, we could only automate a small fraction of the regression testset. It is a team of Exact Synergy consultants and application administrators without much knowledge regarding programming. Nevertheless, the transference of the project to the team went over well.",

I am, together with an Eager colleague, hired as test automation engineer by the product owner of the 'Online Platform' Scrum team. This team is responsible for the website (https://www.slachtofferhulp.nl/). We have received the assignment to deliver an automated, trustworthy and maintainable regression testset. The automation of the regression tests was done in Visual Studio with MS Test in the programming language C#. To make sure the tests are trustworthy, a test framework gets installed which reruns tests that failed initially. Additionally, a dynamic waiting function has been used, to ensure that the flow only continues if the website has loaded completely. Extent Reports yield a clear report of where all testcases, teststeps and parameters are described, including their status (succeeded, failed, info, warning). Tags have been added to find an overview, per feature or per browser, of how many testcases have succeeded and failed. At the end of the assignment, the automated testset runs in the pipeline every night. We have transferred our work to the team so that they can manage and expand it themselves. The transference of the product, I did assertively and step by step; by informing the team during the creation-process, instead of afterwards when everything was finished, we received feedback early on and the team immediately benefited. Additionally, demos were given with the review, the daily standup was participated in, and a manual for making new test cases was written up. During the rounding up of the assignment, every wish was fulfilled and the team was very satisfied with the trustworthy additional feedback they received daily on their developments to the online platform.",

As softwaretester, I was responsible for making testplans and work out, automate, and execute the tests and keep them working. The code I have build with C# in Visual Studio, just like the developers. The assignment required a high degree of abstract thinking. I came across lots of different concepts that I had to understand quickly, such as a product line, services, domain models, REST API requests, dependency injection, and inversion of controle. I have build an automated testset for both the back-end (API) and the front-end (UI). The back-end tests I did with the help of SpecFlow and the UI tests I did with SpecFlow and Selenium. I have taken care of a clear structure of the test projects to keep it a maintainable whole. I have also delivered documentation for the test projects and written a quick start guide for both the back-end and the front-end tests. Since every installation was places in a separate solution and worked together with other installations, my code was put in multiple solutions, all the while executing chain testing. At the end of every sprint, the delivered product was of higher quality and considerably less critical bugs were found. The bugs could also be solved distinguishably quicker. At the end of the assignment,  I have transferred my test responsibilities to my successor.",

Together with my Eager colleague, I got the assignment to build a regression test for the application Zorg  van de Zaak Online - a portal for employers to register absenteeism of their employees. One of the obstacles was that all knowledge was in the heads of the ICT-team members, there was no documentation available at the moment. That is why this assignment required tight collaboration with the ICT-team. In consultation with the functional designer, we decided what was supposed to come in the regression test and what the necessary coverage was supposed to be. Subsequently, they have elaborated and worked out the regression test and executed it manually. Findings were enacted in Jira. \nFrom late December 2017 onwards, I have started automating the regression test in C# with Selenium Webdriver, with the goal not to be obligated to this manually constantly, as well as to create a sustainable, easy to understand and maintainable regression test set. Finally, we have written an elaborate and clear documentation regarding the setup of the automatic regression test set. \n\nThe final result were releases of better quality (less bugs) and an automated, sustainable and easily maintainable regression test. Because of the approach - the consultation with the functional designer -, the regression test was successfully set up with the desired coverage. Due to the elaborate and clear documentation regarding the setup  and the automatic regression test, the automatic regression test set became easy to maintain. \n\nUpdate April 2020: the automated regression test set has been maintained by the developers and is still successfully in use.",

Dat hield in dat ik met de kinderen samen ging rijden en ze tussen de sessies door feedback gaf over hoe ze nog beter konden worden.
