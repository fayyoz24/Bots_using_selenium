    "summary": "Rik is a Dutch Architect who has worked in Sydney for over 5 years, most recently at Bayley Ward as a Project Architect. He moved to Australia after graduating from his Masters Degree of Architecture, Building and Planning from the University of Eindhoven in 2016. During his time in Sydney he has worked on a variety of projects varying from smaller scale projects to high rise buildings in the CBD, including One Circular Quay with KKAA, 371 Pitt Street and Opera Residences. Having worked on various design competitions, concept designs, design developments and construction documentation projects, he has demonstrated his allround design and documentation skills in addition to his critical thinking and attention to detail. He has also recently successfully undergone the process of Registration as an Architect in New South Wales. \n\n\"In 2010 I started my career in architecture by enrolling in the bachelor Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences, at the University of Eindhoven. During my bachelor I developed an interest in the diversity of architectural education systems used by universities. To learn more about these various educational systems, I decided to study at Delft University of Technology for a semester to complete a minor of Archineering. After completing my bachelor in 2013, I continued to further expand my skills as an architect by working at Diederendirrix for six months. My time at Diederendirrix was a decisive moment, where I gained perspective on my goals and ambitions. My newly found ambition to work at an international architecture firm was a strong incentive to study at the University of Sydney for a semester in 2014. Additionally, I have partaken in the International Spring Academy Ruhr 2015 at the University of Dortmund. My final year culminated in a thesis focussing on contemporary Swiss architecture and the educational system. This project resulted in a design proposal for a new faculty building for the school of architecture situated on the campus of AA Mendrisio. Whilst graduating I complimented my curiosity regarding architectural education by becoming an Architectural Tutor guiding first year projects.\"\n\nThe combination of having acquired various design methods, architectural training at various universities worldwide and a continual curiosity for architectural innovation makes Rik an asset to any architectural practice in this diverse and evolving world.",
