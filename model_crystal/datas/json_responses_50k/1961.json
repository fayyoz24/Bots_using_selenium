    "summary": "\u201cYou outperformed yourself once again, Chau\u201d \u2013 my supervisor Tadhg O\u2019Sullivan said to me after my graduation defense that finalized my internship at Heineken Netherlands. \n\nAt the age of 19, I made a bold decision to move to the Netherlands all by myself to follow my dream of becoming food product developer. I started my journey with Process and Food Technology (PFT) at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. My first year was extremely challenging to the point where I wanted to give up and move back to Viet Nam. My performance at school was not very positive and the experience of living alone for the first time brought me both mental and physical struggles. The main thing, besides family, kept me going was my dream.\n\nBeing a result-oriented and disciplined person, I kept pushing my limit to grow both professionally and personally. In my fourth year, I got accepted in Global Innovation and Research department of Heineken for my graduation internship. Given such creative topics with endless support from Heineken, I graduated my Bachelor of Science with distinction. It was hard work paid off! \n\nMy time at Heineken also reconfirmed my strong passion for food technology and product development. In order to prepare myself for the future career, I am participating in European Master in Food Studies in Wageningen University & Research. The master program will take place in four countries: Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden and France with the cooperation of 9 food industry partners. \n\nA new journey is ahead of me with lots of challenges as well as opportunities. More importanly, this ride will be full of excitement and joy which I would like to share with you. Let\u2019s connect and share our beautiful journey together!\n\n\u2709 nguyenchau1831@gmail.com\n\u2706 06 16044592\n\nKey Competencies\n\u2022\tOrganic Chemistry\n\u2022\tBiotechnology\n\u2022\tFood Chemistry\n\u2022\tFood Safety\n\u2022      Dairy production\n\u2022  \tSensory Evaluation\n\u2022\tDrying\n\u2022\tBrewery\n\nProfessional interests\n\u2022\tFood Product Development\n\u2022\tFood Production Process",
