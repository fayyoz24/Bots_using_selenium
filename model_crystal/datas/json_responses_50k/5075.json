    "summary": "George Weiss is the founder and CEO of Radio La Benevolencija Humanitarian Tools Foundation ( \"Radio Benevolencija HTF\"), an organization that sets up media projects to teach populations to resist hate speech and manipulation. The organization is one of the first to use long-duration broadcast campaigns to mass audiences for the purpose of citizen empowerment. Based on Weiss' experiences working for La Benevolencija Sarajevo, a unique local NGO during the Bosnia War of 1992-95, this work promotes an agenda of sanity, empathy and mutual help among minorities and individuals who are the target of hate speech and those who want to help them, as well as among societies that have suffered its consequences.\n\n- Originally a Film- and Television Producer , Weiss produced three feature films and was responsible for the worldwide distribution of blockbuster films such as Dances with Wolves, Henry V, and Driving Miss Daisy in the late 1980's. Since then, he moved first into documentary production, producing more than 20 feature documentaries as international co-productions and co-founding French Film Production Company Unlimited SA. of which he is still a shareholder. \n- Moving into the emerging field of Humanitarian Activist Media, he set up Radio Benevolencija HTF in 2003. The organization's Great Lakes Reconciliation Media project, a regional project in Rwanda , the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi, in operation since 2003 has gained international acclaim for its unique combination of applied psychology with entertainment-education strategies and  techniques. Its methodology - using Media Entertainment - Education to inoculate large national audiences to recognise and resist the psychological and circumstantial triggers to identity-based incitement,  has proven impact that has been published in several seminal papers.  \n- It is currently applied in interventions to fight radicalization in prototype projects in the online- and videogaming  space in 5 European countries, to be enlarge to all of Europe and the US in the next years. - www.labenevolencija.org\n- An Austrian citizen, Weiss studied Archaeology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, holds a BA in Communications and Media from the State University of New York, and was trained in Television production at BBC production training.
