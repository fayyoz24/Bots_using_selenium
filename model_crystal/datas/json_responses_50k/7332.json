    "summary": "Story is at the heart of everything I do. \n\nI recently rediscovered recordings of stories I made when I was a seven year old. It was all there: the setting, the characters, the arc and dilemma. The style was rough around the edges, but not bad for what you\u2019d expect of a kid. I like to think I\u2019ve polished somewhat in the years since. I never stopped crafting stories either for myself or for the people I work with, be they clients, collaborators, or those I love. I help others with their stories and ventures-- the authentic core they want to give to the world, their contribution that merits the world\u2019s attention. \n\nThose old tapes held recordings of songwriting and fiction, and those old loves have held fast and true. Today, my writing and work also explores themes inspired by my multi-decade study into human relationships, creative processes, and entrepreneurship.",
