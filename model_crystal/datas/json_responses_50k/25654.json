    "summary": "I am a decolonial researcher, educator, consultant, curator and director of the Research Collective for Decoloniality & Fashion. I am the author of 'Moroccan Fashion: Design, Tradition and Modernity' (London: Bloomsbury, 2014) and coeditor with Jennifer Craik of 'Modern Fashion Traditions: Negotiating Tradition and Modernity Through Fashion' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016). I am also the guest-editor with Toby Slade of the special issue of Fashion Theory on Decoloniality and Fashion (Vol 24(6) 2020). \n\nMy scholarship grows out of an effort to critique the denial and erasure of a diversity of fashioning systems due to eurocentrism, unequal global power relations based on modern-colonial order, and the Euro\u2013American canon of normativity. In 2012, I initiated the Research Collective for Decoloniality & Fashion (RCDF), which has played a strong informative role in my scholarly development. As an experimental platform beyond institutional, disciplinary and geographical boundaries, the RCDF experiments with decentral and decolonial ways of knowledge-creation and sharing regarding body fashion, through the coalitional and communal, through conversation and a radical act of listening across multiple differences.\n\nIn addition to lecturing, publishing, consulting, curating and managing the RCDF, I have worked as a strategic cultural policy advisor for the Municipality of Maastricht (2020-21) and cultural policy officer for the Dutch Embassy in Rabat (2006-2012).",

                    "description": "The Research Collective for Decoloniality & Fashion (RCDF) is an experimental platform beyond institutional, disciplinary and geographical boundaries established in 2012. It aims to critique the denial and erasure of a diversity of fashioning systems due to unequal global power relations based on the modern-colonial order, the Euro-American canon of normativity and the exploitation and abuse of cultural heritages, human beings and natural resources. Transcending academe, it strives to experiment with other ways of knowledge-production and sharing in regard to fashion studies \u2013 through conversation, through listening, through the communal, through a broad diversity of voices across age, race, gender, education, discipline and geography.",

It aims to critique the denial and erasure of a diversity of fashioning systems due to unequal global power relations based on the modern-colonial order, the Euro-American canon of normativity and the exploitation and abuse of cultural heritages, human beings and natural resources. Transcending academe, it strives to experiment with other ways of knowledge-production and sharing in regard to fashion studies \u2013 through conversation, through listening, through the communal, through a broad diversity of voices across age, race, gender, education, discipline and geography.",
