The project has been mainly focused on the application of hybrid engines to propeller regional and business aircraft, due to the still immature capacity of today\u2019s batteries for large commercial aircraft. \n\nBased on Roskam, a methodology for the design of hybrid-electric aircraft and the weight estimation of its propulsion system was developed. A Python tool has been devised for the application of the theory and the research outcomes to multiple configurations.\n\nProject developed within the Flight Performance and Propulsion department under the supervision of Dr. Fabrizio Oliviero.",

Major delivery companies such as DHL, UPS or Amazon have been developing during years small drones to deliver packages, an exciting alternative to truck delivery which is expected to start operating in the near future. Its advantages are its speed, sustainability and safety: a drone is not subjected to traffic, it can be electric and is more efficient than truck delivery. \n\nThe project was carried out with other 9 students during the period of 11 weeks under the supervision of Dr. Francesco Avallone, Dr. Joost Ellerbroek and Eirini Tsiangou. Main tasks performed: \n\n\u2022 Participated in the project management and the project systems engineering\n\u2022 Analysed and mitigated technical risk as the project's risk officer\n\u2022 Performed first-class weight estimation and drone sizing\n\u2022 Performed 2D and 3D aerodynamic analysis of drone's wings and fuselage\n\u2022 Performed complete subsystem integration and stability analysis of the vehicle\n\u2022 Developed CATIA model of the complete drone\n\u2022 Designed final poster\n\u2022 Presented the project results during the Aerospace Symposium\n\n- I presented the project at the Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Conference on the 28th of November 2018 at RAI Amsterdam.\n- The project summary was published in the Leonardo Times, October 2018 issue (http://leonardotimes.com/magazine/, page 42).",
