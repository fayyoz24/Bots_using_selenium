    "summary": "I am truly passionate about creating more efficient and environmentally sound businesses through engineering solutions, and data analysis. Over the years I have worked on many projects that use engineering solutions to improve the environment. These projects do not only look at leveraging the latest technology, they also balanced the risk, monetary cost, and environmental impact of new technologies.  This passion for making a greener future is what drove me to work for General Motors. I have worked with many colleagues at GM to make lithium ion battery technology safer, cheaper, and more practical for everyone.\n\nI have a Master\u2019s Degree from the University of Michigan in Energy Systems Engineering and also received my Certificate in Entrepreneurship while at UM.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me to connect, I am always looking for interesting people to connect with.",
