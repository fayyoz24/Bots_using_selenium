    "summary": "To me every day starts at zero and by the end of the day I want us to have achieved something. I believe that the secret of getting things done is to act. \n\nIn the last few years I have lead, managed and supported multiple projects and change processes in numerous multi-disciplinary and global environments. Due to my background in IT and Business, I very much enjoy working on the cutting edge of Business and IT. This means I\u2019m familiar with concepts such as Agile, Lean, Scrum, DevOps and SAFe.\n\nI have a strong results-driven approach and believe that asking (the right) questions is key to finding (the right) answers. I particularly thrive in an environment with enough freedom to be heard so I can make difference. Always smiling, even when things don't go as planned.",
