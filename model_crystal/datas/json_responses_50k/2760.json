    "summary": "After 50 years of work (the last 20 years for charities) in nearly all continents, I am ready to use the acquired knowledge, experience and numerous contacts for assuming the role of corporate advisor or assigned negotiator. A lawyer by training, a banker and financial consultant by profession, a creative mind inherited and an unrelenting drive are the four main factors to help succeed the principal with its foreign ambitions.\n\nSmall and large companies having international relations (or planning to establish a relationship with companies abroad) are often insufficiently prepared because they lack the know-how of foreign mentality, national culture, local customs and other traditional behavior of the foreign legal entities. This intimate knowledge is often essential for successful negotiations. Therefore, to have a professional outside advisor or negotiator may be a wise decision for many companies dealing or planning to deal with foreign counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n",
