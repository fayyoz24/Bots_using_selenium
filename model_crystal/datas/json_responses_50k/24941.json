CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining \u201clocal flavour\u201d and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. CITYCoP will benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen\u2019s interaction with community and LEAs through technology. The partners in CITYCoP build on long years of successful collaboration in EU projects dealing with UGC, smart surveillance and privacy (CONSENT, SMART, RESPECT) positioning CITYCoP solutions to achieve integration into smart city eco-systems. CITYCoP will pilot deployments of multi-lingual smartphone apps, portals and serious games training packages in Bucharest (Romania), Lisbon (Portugal), Florence (Italy), Sheffield (UK).",

MAPPING would specifically investigate and debate the existing innovation policies, business models and legal framework related to the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the changes needed to set up an improved governance structure for the EU innovation ecosystem. The key to MAPPING\u2019s success would be its planned mobilisation of a wide spectrum of ICT-related stakeholders and social actors from both EU Member States and associated countries, including academics, law and policy makers, ISPs, international and EU Internet governance bodies, NGOs and civil society organisations. The project would provide these actors with a forum for informed discussion of issues related to the digital transition, such as problems of personal data and IPR protection online, business models and e-government applications based on the use of personal data, economic exploitation of IPRs and open innovation. MAPPING would then move to create an Action Plan and put forward workable policy guidelines based on a multidisciplinary perspective on the latest and foreseeable developments in ICTs taking into account conflicting interests, perceptions and practices of different societal actors that shape the EU\u2019s technological future. MAPPING would thus significantly contribute to creating an enabling framework for completing the digital transition and improving the innovation climate in the EU.",

Electronic evidence is no different from traditional evidence in that is necessary for the party introducing it into legal proceedings, to be able to demonstrate that it is no more and no less than it was, when it came into their possession. In other words, no changes, deletions, additions or other alterations have taken place. The very nature of data and information held in electronic form makes it easier to manipulate than traditional forms of data. When acquired and exchanged integrity of the information must be maintained and proved. Legislations on criminal procedures in many European countries were enacted before these technologies appeared, thus taking no account of them and creating a scenario where criteria are different, uncertain, regulations are not harmonized and aligned and therefore exchange among MS jurisdictions and at transnational level is very hard to be realized. What is missing is a Common European Framework to guide policy makers, Law Enforcement Agencies and judges when dealing with digital evidence treatment and exchange. EVIDENCE aims at providing a road map (guidelines, recommendations, technical standards) for realising the missing Common European Framework for the systematic and uniform application of new technologies in the collection, use and exchange of evidence. This road map incorporating standardized solutions would enable policy maker to realize an efficient regulation, treatment and exchange of digital evidence, LEAs as well as judges/magistrates and prosecutors and lawyers practising in the criminal field to have at their disposal as legal/technological background a Common European Framework allowing them to gather, use and exchange digital evidences according to common standards and rules.

State actors and private corporations adopt information communication technologies (ICTs) because they are cost-effective. The motivation for adoption may be different in the private and public sectors but once adopted these ICTs are then capable of being bridged in multiple ways permitting police/security forces to go beyond the data they gather directly but also increasingly tap into data gathered and stored by private corporations. These ICTs, which have to date gone through a period of largely organic growth, will be deemed to be \u201cin balance\u201d if they are implemented in a way which respects individual privacy while still maximising convenience, profitability, public safety and security. RESPECT seeks to investigate if the current and foreseeable implementation of ICTs in surveillance is indeed \u201cin balance\u201d and, where a lack of balance may exist or is perceived by citizens not to exist, the project explores options for redressing the balance through a combination of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies and operational approaches. Investigating at least five key sectors not yet tackled by other recent projects researching surveillance (CCTV, database mining and interconnection, on-line social network analysis, RFID &geo-location/sensor devices, financial tracking), RESPECT will also carry out quantitative and qualitative research on citizens\u2019 awareness and attitudes to surveillance.

Stichting Business Generator Groningen supports these researchers from the University of Groningen (RUG) and the UMCG by translating promising research results into innovations that are very relevant for society.\n\nOur team identifies opportunities, supports researchers in building a business case for a new start-up and introduces them to the right network. If an innovation requires it, we also offer support in IP protection and provide information on funding opportunities.\n\nIn this way, the Business Generator supports researchers in their (often first) steps as entrepreneurs and together we take fundamental research further towards the market and society.",
