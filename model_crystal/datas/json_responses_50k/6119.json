Knowledgeable in Quality Assurance, Quality Management, and Production processes. Aspiring to build a career in the pharmaceutical, consumer goods, & life sciences industry and explore the field of Sustainability.\n\nMy work experience allowed me to exhibit strong technical skills and apply my knowledge in Lean Six Sigma in the Pharmaceutical and Manufacturing industry specializing in production process supervision, project management, process audit, and improvement. I was able to enhance my leadership, collaborative, and communication skills by spearheading different Operational Excellence projects that ensure Quality, Safety, and Efficiency of the production process which are essential to the success of the company.\n\nAfter working for 5 years, I wanted to challenge myself more and decided to move to the Netherlands and start an MBA at TIAS. Pursuing an International MBA has allowed me to broaden my knowledge about businesses and appreciate diverse cultures and backgrounds. After my MBA, I hope to contribute to the growth of the company by showing integrity and commitment to my work which allows me to make better contributions to society.\n\nKeywords: Pharmaceutical and Manufacturing Industry, Life Sciences Industry, Consumer Goods, FMCG, Process Audit, Process Improvement, Quality, Quality Control, Quality Assurance, Production Process, Process Engineer, Operational Excellence, Continuous Improvement, Six Sigma, Sustainability, Sustainable Development",
