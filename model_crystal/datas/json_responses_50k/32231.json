    "summary": "I have recently graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree (Magna Cum Laude; 3.9 GPA) in Business Administration from Stetson University, Florida, USA. I received the University\u2019s distinguished Business School Foundation Merit Award for Marketing in May 2023 for my outstanding academic ability and performance. During my time as an NCAA Division I student-athlete, I competed on and was the Captain of the Women\u2019s Tennis Team. I was also the team representative for Stetson's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee. Completing a Business Administration Bachelor with a major in Marketing helped me acquire skills that I believe would serve as valuable contributors in the workplace - including communication (drafting/public speaking), leadership, and project management. \n\nMoreover, I have been accepted to and will be attending New York University (NYU) in the Fall of 2024, with a view to completing a Master\u2019s Degree in International Relations. The goal would be to, later on, pursue a professional career through advocating for Human Rights and Social Justice. I am currently looking to gain work experience through an internship in a field of relevance prior to attending graduate school. I believe that my diverse background has molded me into an individual with a high awareness for cultural diversity and inclusivity - a worthy trait in this field. I am of Finnish-Lebanese descent, have lived in five countries (FIN, USA, AUT, NL, & FR), and speak four languages.\t\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I played, inter alia, a leading role in developing the class\u2019s final research project on \u201cAdvancing Human Rights and Social Justice\u201d. I have participated in several Model United Nations (MUN) conferences and completed the International Baccalaureate Degree, which gave me an early insight into the various complex Human Rights issues worldwide and the high demand for support to resolve these issues. In addition, through a six-week internship in the Communications & Marketing department at the International School of The Hague during the Summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to put into practice and improve my professional communication, organisational, as well as teamwork skills.",

I coordinated various Marketing projects and conducted extensive research on methods for increasing the school's admissions numbers. The research focused on key audiences, the competition of the school as well as the marketplace environment. In terms of Marketing, my colleagues and I composed a Marketing Brief for both Primary and Secondary schools. I was able to get hands-on with the school's social media - posting various creative posts and informational content for their platforms. In addition, the internship provided me with excellent experience in engaging with others in a professional work environment, where communication skills played a big role in my development as an individual.",
