    "summary": "I am a critical, analytical thinker, with a strong theoretical background and a multidisciplinary mindset. I am passionate about \"spreading knowledge\" through continuous learning and teaching and about building personal relations.\nThis, together with my initiative and my goal-seeking attitude, grants me to successfully take up a leadership role.\nI want to work in the field of innovative and sustainable technologies, aiming to have a positive impact on life and the environment: the ethical side of business is important to me.\n\n\nI am helpful, polite, sincere, sociable, particularly suited to dialogue and relationships with people.\nI have always been very committed and productive, both personally and at work.\nI consider prioritary to complete every task in the best possible way; since I was a child, I have always had an engineering orientation to \"optimization\": scientific education (high school and University) has provided me with further tools to put this attitude into practice in both study- and work contexts.\nParticular aptitude for teamwork achieved in experimental projects in high school, reinforced in extracurricular activities and exploited in study projects at the University.\nAs a result of my open character and theatrical experiences, I feel comfortable speaking in public.\n\n\nOther activities that helped me to become who I am:\n- For over 10 years (2009 - ongoing) I have been giving private lessons to high school and University students, mostly - but not only - on scientific subjects, in both Italian and English, achieving excellent results in the vast majority of cases.\n- Almost 10 years of experience (2009 - 2018) as an educator of secondary and high school students in the parish: this led me to develop on the one hand a particular sensitivity in human interactions and relationships, on the other hand an aknowledged ability in organizing events, shows, trips for large groups of people and summer camps.\n- Many theater experiences (2010 - 2015) as an actor in comedies and musicals; more recently (2016 - 2018) as director/supervisor of teenagers' shows.",

I focused on the proven possibility to obtain different environments varying the surface power density.\n\nThis research led to the presentation of a poster at the \"Workshop on the Exploration of Low-Temperature Plasma Physics\" (WELTPP-22), held in Kerkrade (NL) on November 28-29, 2019.",
