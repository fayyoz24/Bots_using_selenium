Unbound Education's focus is:\n\n1) Being a physics teacher. Students have unlimited potential when given self-responsibility in a safe but challenging learning environment.\n2) Creating courses such that the world becomes the classroom -instead of the classroom the world for the student. My mission is to bring more adventure into the fossilized world of education. Let students plan their way out of that classroom. Let them do an internship at Royal Dutch Shell or realize their dream to climb the Mount Everest. Let them talk about their adventures and the things they\u2019ve learned. Let them conceptualize and analyse, to make these experiences valuable for the rest of their lives.  \n3) Developing educational programs for companies. I implement concepts and idea's from the practice and science of education to help commercial businesses to: a) make the learning curve of their employees steeper and more meaningful b) use group dynamics to stimulate knowledge transfer among employees c) organize fun and valuable work shops and lectures d) mentor employees to achieve their goals. \n\nCommercial businesses can learn a lot from education; especially in a time where it is necessary to keep learning; a life time learning. \n\nI love learning and am a quick learner. This has given me the self confidence and opportunity to reinvent myself and try out several things. This way I got to see a lot of the world and learned about myself, to finally find my passion: education. Learning is a skill you can develop. It can open up your world too. Unbound Education.",
