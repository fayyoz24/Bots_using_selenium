    "summary": "The beginning of my path in the field of law was marked by the bachelor programme \u201cInternational and European Law\u201d at the University of Groningen. During my bachelor programme, the various fields of European Union law were of great interest to me and have determined me to write my bachelor thesis on the rule of law in the European Union. \n\nAfter completing my bachelor programme, pursuing a career in the field of European Union law seemed more than natural. I have recently accomplished a master in \u201cEuropean Economic Law\u201d at the University of Groningen. During my master programme, I have discovered an affinity for the inner workings of the European Union, in particular for internal market law, state aid law and competition law. I wrote my master thesis in the field of state aid law. Simultaneously, I am interested in the field of energy law and particularly in EU's internal market with regards to the energy sector. \n\nI am deeply inspired by my studies and I desire to pursue a career in which I can apply my expertise and integrate my worldview but at the same time one in which I will be able to learn and master new skills.",
