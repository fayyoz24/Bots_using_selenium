    "summary": "Stefan (Hubertus Johannes) Heijmans was born on April 6, 1992 in Weert, the Netherlands. After finishing his secondary education at Het College in Weert, he studied Mechanical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven, the Netherlands, were he received both the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees (both Cum Laude) in August 2013 and 2015, respectively. During his study, Stefan performed an international internship at the University of Queensland (UQ), Brisbane, Australia, in cooperation with CRCMining. In addition, his master thesis entitled \"Interconnected Systems with Networked Communication: A Stability and Performance Analysis\" was awarded with the Unilever Research Award 2015.\n\nIn June 2019, Stefan received his Ph.D. degree for his research conducted within the Control Systems Technology group at the department of Mechanical Engineering of the TU/e under the supervision of prof.dr.ir. Maurice Heemels. His work focused on developing original scientific solutions for networked control systems or in general control systems in which the sensing, actuation, computation and/or communication resources are limited. During his PhD, Stefan was a visiting researcher at the Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine (ENSEM) in Nancy, France, (5 weeks in May, 2016) under the supervision of Romain Postoyan and prof. Dragan Nesic and a visiting researcher at the University of Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia, (11 weeks in January-March, 2018) under the supervision of prof. Dragan Nesic. Additionally, his work was rewarded with the DISC Best PhD Thesis Award 2019.\n\nAs from September 2019, Stefan left the academic world to explore his ambitions as a software engineer at Demcon Advanced Mechatronics.",
