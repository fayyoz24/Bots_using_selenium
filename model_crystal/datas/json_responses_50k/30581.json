This was especially challenging as the companies (legacy) technology stacks were spread over different cloud providers and tool sets.\n\nGiven the situation, an initial effort of figuring out the correct tools was needed. Through several different PoC\u2019s around tools such as Kubeflow, AWS Sagemaker, and GCP Vertex, as well as an MVP around real time model inference with tools such as AWS Kinesis, Kafka, Feast, and Seldon, we came up with a design that satisfied both these business constraints as well as the requirements of the users.\n\nThe platform development began with the training environment around GCP Vertex, with a lot of automation work in Github Actions for provisioning the required cloud resources using Terraform. We also developed a command line interface for our users to register with our platform and request any of our offerings themselves, which allowed for a much smoother onboarding experience.",

Due to the model chosen (Robust Random Cut Forest), a separate model needed to be trained per customer, which provided a unique challenge, as more traditional ways of scaling the model are insufficient.\n\nThe POC was setup in AWS using Glue and Athena, with an Airflow instance for scheduling. In production, the project was run on the KPN Dataiku environment, which has a Kubernetes backbone, in Python.\n\nMy job was implementing this move from AWS to Dataiku, the optimization of the data flow, and improving performance, which resulted in having to rewrite the model for multiprocessing in Python.",
