    "summary": "Globally touring stand-up comedian from the Netherlands with a base in Nepal. Performing mostly in English and Dutch but can also perform short sets in French and German. Comedic style could be described as culture shock comedy. Through anecdotes from foreign cultures I try to portray the oddness of our own culture. This is also where my background in anthropology covertly comes in to play.\n\nBesides performing I also frequently organize shows. Currently I am organizing shows in Nepal, Netherlands, Spain, Bulgaria and Germany. I am also the festival director of Nepal\u2019s first international comedy festival, the Top of the World Comedy Festival. An initiative I started to enrich Nepal\u2019s entertainment scene, develop local talent and promote Nepal. \n\nMy urge to talk to groups of people doesn\u2019t limit itself to comedy. I also freelance as a trainer/teacher in web development and web technologies. From short corporate trainings to university lectures. Specialized in HTML, CSS and Java Script. ",
