            "description": "The Archipelago of Knowledge is a new spatial configuration that reconsiders the relationship between port and city. The port areas are fragmented into islands, resulting in the formation of a continuous, 100% accessible, waterfront. The quality embedded in the direct relationship between city and the water is re-establish and enhanced , for the benefit of the citizens and the maritime cluster.\n\nA new linear space, a continuous waterfront, is envisioned for the area. The new system can finally bring back water to the city that, although in close proximity to water, often lacks a direct relationship with its largest water body, the Maas River. The waterfront is a system that goes beyond administrative boundaries and fragmentation, but rather unifies the ongoing efforts of port revitalization into one, coherent urban vision. The strategy itself, before its implementation, can be seen as the tool to bring all the different actors together at the same table; actors from the city, the maritime cluster, and the port.\n\nThe waterfront becomes a new shared space for negotiation, where interests and needs of different actors are discussed in order to find points of intersection and mutual interest.\n\nThe islands are spatially defined areas where scenarios can unfold through time. Although their shape is fixed, in order to assure a new beneficial relationship between port and city, their program \u2013 be it maritime, commercial, residential or recreational \u2013 can occupy the space according to future economic trends, needs and decisions.",

In this study five locations along the ring road of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht will be explored on the basis of research by design. Assumptions are hereby future scenarios where car ownership is an outdated status symbol, cities need to be further compacted because of the large housing task and where the fleet is emission-free. The study is a joint initiative of BNA (Institute of Dutch Architects) Research, TU Delft, the municipalities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht, the province of Utrecht, and the Directorates General Access, Space and Water and Public Works of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.\nThe government aims for cleaner cars, a development that will lead to major changes due to technological advances in the future. Automatic and electric vehicles will have an impact on traffic, modality choices, accessibility, land use, infrastructure and the environment. Can future images of this upcoming developments in conjunction with existing and proposed plans help us to relativize the current image of mobility, infrastructure and environment? What are potential opportunities, ideas and visions for the ring roads, to connect and interact with the city network and the nearby (built or unbuilt) space?\n\nThe aim of this study is to release creative energy at the level of the five cases, and from here to a wide range of possibilities of thinking that is relevant to the future of the ring roads within the Dutch urban landscape.",

The project responds to the different -rather conflicting- identities of the valley, proactively avoiding any forced simplification which wouldn\u2019t pay respect to the multiple souls of the site and the city. The community, the river, the industry, the railway and the hills are the elements that emerge as layers of a juxtapose palimpsest of a valley that has been and -must continue to be- one of the main driving forces of a city that seeks re-birth.\nThe \u201cParco del Ponte\u201d is a large-scale urban strategy that proposes to intervene in the urban fabric with micro-interventions in order to generate a new urban structure centered around public space and ecology.\nA thoughtful approach that addresses a bottom-up multi-folded strategy that complements the necessary top-down approach of the infrastructural reality of the valley. The \u201cParco del Ponte\u201d is an opportunity to consolidate a fragile territory by stabilizing hilly slopes, reducing river flood hazards and reclaiming a soil that has been polluted by the presence of over a century of massive industrial production. The \u201cParco del Ponte\u201d has the potential to revive the industrial identity by directing it towards small and medium-sized high-tech companies and thus catalyze the many research realities present in the territory.\n",

The trail, takes advantage of the topography in order to avoid the use of an elevator. The access point is in-fact located on a higher point of the uneven terrain and, from there, it ramps up to reach greater heights, gradually showcasing the forest as a vertical ecosystem. Its defining circular shape, sharply contrasts with the forms of nature, avoiding any simplistic mimic; furthermore, the trail trajectory is always curving, constantly disappearing within the forest canopy, generating a desire to discover the forest, step by step. \nThree main attractions are placed within the trail: a (1) copper sphere which functions as a multimedia room for 365 degrees\u2019 projections, a (2) large net, for visitors to lay or play and a (3) panoramic tower which allows a view over the forest, and integrates a half-spiral staircase to exit, as an alternative to walking back through the long ramp of the trail.The columns of the structure are organized in clusters, abstract simplifications representing group of trees in the forest and are made from cor-ten steel. In total there are 17 column clusters that support the trail and the additional elements.",

            "description": "Central Parks are green islands within cities, where a natural landscape contrasts with the surrounding urban setting. Such contrast -we believe- is where the quality lies and the limit between Park and City is where the transition can be more dramatically experienced. Our proposal for Central Park Kaliningrad, is an \u201cIsland in an Island\u201d, where the insular identity of the park is maximized by digging a new canal, transforming the edge in a new rich and diverse urban experience.\nThe current acid soil, is diversified (by adding layers of alkaline one) in order to create a neutral and basic soils, in addition to the acid one. The resulting landscapes will follow the soil chemical composition avoiding a mere top-down, neo-pastoral approach but, rather generating a park genuinely part of the site ecosystem.\nThe urgency of the changing climate, alongside a new understanding of human responsibility, lead the project to be based on one of the main natural resources: soil. The varying acidity of the different layers provide the conditions for different habitats responding to the ground conditions, rather that recreating a fictitious scenography.\nOur project takes the quality of the transition and multiply it by three. The transition becomes here not only a separation between city and park but, through the digging of a canal and the formation of an island, the edge becomes simultaneously city, waterfront, canal and park. \nOktyabrsky island, is a partially artificial land which demanded massive investment to be realized. The project of the Park aims to be sustainable both financially and technically. The excavated land from the perimetrical canal, is reused in order to form a hill, unique symbol of the future park.",

The project wants to critically represent a number of forest typologies rising both awareness on the importance of nature in urban environments and on the dramatic effects of climate change.

The region is in a unique geographical condition, being simultaneously part of the Andes mountain range and also the Amazon river basin. The region is defined by the extensive production of coffee, around which the local economy is completely reliant. The urge for a spatial vision is enhanced by the changing climate: because of rising temperatures the agricultural landscape is a \u2018migrating\u2019 one. In-fact, producers are moving the coffee plantations uphill, whilst \u2013 in lower altitudes \u2013 former productive areas are rendered vacant and available for future scenarios. As coffee production is defined by specific geographical and environmental conditions, the study goes beyond the given site-boundaries and elaborates on a global condition: the condition of resource extraction.\nThe aim of \u2018Altitudes\u2019 is to reorganise a currently inefficient coffee production chain, demonstrating the touristic potential of the area, whilst creating the conditions for the region to move beyond the monoculture of coffee and its fragile single-commodity economy. The economy of coffee is extremely volatile \u2013 a condition evident in the annual glaring discontinuity of supply and demand \u2013 and this imbalance is heightened by the patterns of the changing climate.",

The recognition of the site as a form of archeological park \u2013 gives the opportunity to secure in time and space the traces of the past, transforming them into a new cultural/education infrastructure at public disposal. \nWhile radical preservation defines the general approach, two design actions are re-defining the park(s): (1) retracing the former path system of the Prussian\u2019s Wallpromeade and (2) defining new geometries that can enhance the rich cultural/environmental context of the area while hosting new programmatic opportunities. \nThe geometrical spatial definition of the \u201cdevices\u201d -responding to the military defense infrastructure and Prussian landscape gardening design language- overlaps with the parks in seven different locations. They are as intensive design interventions centered around the main features of the site (water, ruins, topography, etc.); they are program-less objects that create the conditions for temporary occupation, while permanently highlighting the cultural and environmental diversity of the park, and more broadly, of the ring to-come.\nThe park is in-fact a system of 2 parks defined by autonomous identities: Kashtanovy Park and Litovsky Park, tight together by a comprehensive strategy. It bears the potential of rethinking the former ring as a whole: a new infrastructure that can host social and ecological interaction, while bringing back the historical layers as evidences to pass-on to future generations.

The asphalt square is based upon the original neighbourhood grid and the grid is made visual and tangible through the white marking lines running through the space. At the points of the grid we placed different play elements in-spired by the modernist playgrounds of Aldo van Eyck in Amsterdam. To create coherence all objects are painted Breedveld orange and blue, two colours that have been used in a recent renovation of the adjacent buildings. Through the cohesion of the colour, each object achieves a new identity, independent works that collectively form an open-air museum of play elements.\nThe austerity and monotony of the context is broken by the new playscape while employing the same elements and the layout of the Van Gool plan. \nThe square is framed by the grid of plane trees and grass and planting along the sides, the rectilinear form is punctured at three points by two green circles (active play space developed with local schools and pas-sive green space that acts as a sustainable drainage point) and a rectangular multifunctional sports court.\nOur material palette takes inspiration from road infrastructure, considerably cheaper than usual open space design materials, asphalt surfaces, white road marking lines and \u201ctraffic orange\u201d (Ral 2009) and \u201ctraffic blue\u201d (Ral 5017) colours. Colourful landmarks make the space identifiable from a distance, an important factor in children\u2019s spatial awareness. \n",

            "description": "The recent economic crisis is amplifying disparities and installing declining dynamics in vast areas of the Portuguese territory, and, by doing so, it is deepening the fragmentation of its urban fabric \u2013social and physical\u2013 and threatening the needed territorial cohesion. Private investment in real estate \u2013the main engine of the fast urban growth of the last decades\u2013 has mostly stopped. Public investment \u2013until now devoted to the creation of the main networks that support urbanization\u2013 is suffering severe cuts.\nThe apparent result is the disappearance of all investment from numerous urban areas leading to de-clining dynamics, intensified by several factors: unemployment, emigration, mobility costs. What we are witnessing is a broad redesign of urbanization structures, processes, actors and dynamics, with no evalu-ation of the possible consequences. Figueiredo (2011) has referred to this withdrawal of investment as a retreat with no apparent strategy: a desertion.\nIt is, therefore, urgent to rethink spatial planning practices, in order to adapt them to the new conditions of scarcity. \nThis investigation aims to contribute to this discussion at two levels: \n- Understanding the urbanization processes and actors through a critical analysis of the different urban policies implemented in Portugal during the last decades, and their impacts, underlining the existing mis-match between the formal planning system and the un- dergone urbanization processes.\n- Understanding the present context through an analysis of the structural changes we are now witnessing, identifying the different dynamics installed on the territories of the Portuguese Northwest and recognizing the new frameworks \u00e2\u20ac\u201cactors, dynamics, resources, processes\u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are emerging and will be the support of future planning practices. These analyses will lead us to discuss a set of general guidelines towards a more adequate planning culture for the emerging context.",

To invent reality is a requirement without which it remains opaque and indistinct, difficult to perceive what is really important for collective decision-making, and what might be in the reach of our actions. These are the matters that show the territory essentially as a political issue and, therefore, subject of debate and deliberation. \nThe territory is not something predetermined or stable. An idea of territory is something to be progressively built through a set of readings, representations, speeches and debates collectively produced around what is acknowledged as something common and that gives sense to reality. \nThe House of the Territory welcomes these ways of seeing, experiences and essays on the \"territorialization of reality\", making its many forms explicit. \nMaking territory visible is a condition to make it public, to organize a particular view of a world and expose it to the judgment of others. Without this, society remains invisible and the territory, an abstraction. If we wish the territory we inhabit to be understood and dwelled as a common home - as a realm of life and relationship of the social group living there - then, this home should be the result of the collective construction of a common imagery and shared projects on what we are as a society, and on the things and places we can and should share.

Marginal Territories is the term chosen to describe the isolated condition depicted in this case study about Flores Island, in the Azores archipelago.\nThe main goal is to identify the starting points for the implementation of long term strategies. The study is based on a survey of the present potentialities and opportunities, on a necessarily deep and multidisciplinary study of the dynamics which define and structure the micro insular context and its oceanic correlations, along with an analysis and reflection on the current planning practices and their operative solutions.\nTwo \"devices\", Territory and Landscape, have been used to allow articulated interpretations, on different levels, of the case study. The graphic representation and its consequent image production are used as tools of analysis/acknowledgment/approach relating to the specific territory. Its integration in the planning process as a mechanism of divulgation and perception that allows/supports/sustains the construction of shared strategies, is also considered relevant.\nFlores is characterized by its exceptional landscape values and also by the strong spirit of identity of its population, that guarantees the survival of traditions related to the life in the rural dimension, structuring matrix of this territory. The 2009 acknowledgment of Flores as Unesco Biosphere Reserve reinforces a condition which is strongly related to its \u201crecent\u201d story of human occupation: the Laboratory-Island condition.\nThese mergings are opportunities towards the definition of innovating strategies, focusing the search of a coexistence and a balance between human presence, human activities and the environment.\n\nMaster thesis research | tutor: Nuno Travasso (CEAU/FAUP)\nPlanning in \"low intensity\" territories | An island as a laboratory.\nCase study: Flores island, Azores, Portugal\n\n",

In particular Milan has been and still is an area of interest, and Casa della Carit\u00e0 is an institution of reference point for the continuing commitment to the work of reception and care of most complicated situations in the camps. In parallel Multiplicity.Lab has a role in the research and scanning of these realities in the area of Milan.\nIn February 2010, the Politecnico di Milano in collaboration with Casa della Carit\u00e0 promotes a design competition for the extension of Chiciora school in the town of Tintareni. The competition, open to all students, requires a court that will accommodate 25 students and a space-house laboratory for the entire local community. Respond to the call twenty project teams, and in April 2010 a winning proposal is selected for lightness in structure and ease of implementation; the winning project proposes two separate volumes, classroom and laboratory, articulated around a light cover that communicates with the existent school. In December 2010 the project was officially presented to the city and the mayor of Tintareni Dr. Maria Vasilescu in headquarters building of Casa della Carit\u00e0, starting a direct communication with the local community, and allowing the construction and completion of the initiative by September 2010 .",
