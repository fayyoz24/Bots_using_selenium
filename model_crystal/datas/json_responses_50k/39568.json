    "summary": "As a real estate professional, I help set up (complex) construction and real estate projects and lead them to achieve the intended goal. At the start, we devise plans together by drawing up feasibility studies (business cases) or analyzes of the current real estate portfolio. After all, we want to achieve at least the maximum social and financial return on the property. With my pragmatic attitude and, moreover, I am not easily confused, I am always looking for opportunities to lift real estate to a commercial and more sustainable plan and to make it function more efficiently. My knowledge of the construction and real estate chain I combine with a feeling for processes and commercial, political and administrative decision-making. We prefer to keep it simple. If it helps, I make complex situations with many interests and stakeholders transparent, or I provide new insights. Through this way of working I get people moving and I realize deals and projects.",

Binnen \u00e9\u00e9n uur staat de reiziger hartje Schiphol, en in nog geen half uur kan hij vanuit Breda in de hogesnelheidstrein zitten, op weg naar Parijs. Het station wordt het kloppend hart voor iedereen die bij een internationaal vervoerknooppunt wil wonen, werken en winkelen. In het station zelf komen woningen, kantoren en winkels. Het nieuwe station biedt voldoende capaciteit aan het groeiend aantal reizigers.  Het stationsgebied van Breda is een van de zes door het ministerie van VROM aangewezen nieuwe sleutelprojecten.",

I led concept teams, development teams and construction teams and worked out plans, designs and agreements. The plans had to be coordinated with the municipalities for permits and any private law agreements.
