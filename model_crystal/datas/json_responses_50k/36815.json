Many professionals but also many 'ordinary' music to come to Hamburg to play at the dozens of pubs and clubs. \n \nTogether with The Hague's pop sector we make a shortlist of eight bands / acts that we think that fit with the festival and thus have a good chance. From this short list, the organizer of the Reeperbahn Festival makes a choice of up to four bands / acts that will be to present. \n\nMusic City The Hague Showcase Party and more .. \nDuring the festival we create our Music City The Hague venue were all the bands that travel with us can perform and present themselves to the international market.",
