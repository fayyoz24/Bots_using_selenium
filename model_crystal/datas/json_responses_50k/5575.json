    "summary": "(I am currently not seeking new employment!)\n\nHello I am Kate. I am an IT All-rounder with a broad knowledge of administrative and management aspects in automation. Such as infrastructure, system and software management and with more than 35 years of experience. This extensive experience allows me to act quickly when action is required. Also experienced with management and all associated tasks (reporting, communication and budget management). At my last full-time employer I was able to achieve a system availability of 99%, after analysis showed that a 24-hour business operation without automation was no longer possible. For this, we managed to apply only the most necessary support contracts and introduce spare systems and hardware to save on costs. My creativity in these positions was also proven when I won the first prize in a \"Create your own USB stick\" competition at a supplier. I hope that I can apply my creativity and ability to take initiative in your organization!",
