Some of Broadway\u2019s top Lighting Designers hire me to support them in the implementation of their designs from inception to execution. Below are some of my favorite recent highlights.\n\nIn Residence on Broadway - Concert Series: \nAlong with Lighting Designer Mike Bal- dassari, I developed the 3D system for a flexible lighting rig that gave each act their own unique look. In close collaboration with each performer\u2019s Lighting Directors, we created 7 distinctly different designs. For each design, there was a complete package of drawings and instructions for the crews. These 4 hour lighting change- overs where a Broadway first.\n\nOn Your Feet - Musical - Beatrix Theater Utrecht, London Coliseum, UK Tour:\nAs Associate Lighting Designer, I was responsible for transferring the original Broadway design to the Netherlands. With Ken Posner\u2019s blessing, I had full executive license to adapt the show to the Beatrix Theater in Utrecht, and subsequently collaborate with the UK production team to make the show tour-able within their budget while protecting and maintaining the designs original intent. Another key part of my job was the training of the local crews to maintain the high quality of the Broadway design and leave them with all the needed documentation.",
