During those 3,5 years I organized dozens of various events from exhibitions to conferences. My main personal achievement was managing a wine festival in Saint Petersburg for a large wine producing company. I was responsible for communication with the client, budgeting, developing the content, communication with technical suppliers, control and support of the event in-place, and also team leadership and delegation.\n\nIt was a great period of my career that gave me a lot of transferable skills. After all I decided to get back to Computer Science field and pursue a Data Science Master's degree in the Netherlands. That is why I merged several employers into one episode here on LinkedIn but I am glad to tell you more about what I did and what I learned during that time.",
