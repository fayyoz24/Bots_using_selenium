    "summary": "Second-year International Business student, future marketing executive. My passion for languages and leadership brought me to NHL Stenden, University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, where I am working on my BBA in International Business. During the past academic year I have been an active member of various student associations and councils, which allowed me to further hone my communication, organisation and management skills.\n\nThe most valuable lesson I have learned from NHL so far has been the importance of properly communicating and understanding cultural differences, when wanting to successfully work together in an international environment. After completing a semester-long project on \u201cInternational Business Strategy\u201d, which entailed a major focus on \u201cMarketing\u201d and \u201cResearch\u201d, I am looking forward to another project in the areas of \u201cFinance\u201d and \u201cSupply Chain Management\u201d in the second half of this academic year. Both major topics will include a close collaboration with companies, to ensure that the acquired knowledge is immediately put into action and transformed into real life experience. Additionally, \u201cBusiness Transformers\u201d classes continue to teach me important lessons in psychological and societal topics, concerning both the people around me and myself. \n\nAfter having reached the A2 level in Dutch ahead of my classes, I am dedicating myself and my freetime to reaching another proficiency level in Russian. Additionally, I continue to build skills in HTML5 and CSS, while taking a closer look at modern business skills, to ensure that I have the proper knowledge and preparation for my upcoming internship in the next academic year.",
