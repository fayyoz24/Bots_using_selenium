    "summary": "Fresh graduate from the University of Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, and looking for the next step for a professional career in Archaeology. My ambition is to be a much sort after Professional Archaeologist and Heritage professional. \n\nI completed the MA Archaeology in Landscape and Heritage from the University of Amsterdam and my interests are on Sinhalese warfare, Military history & architecture, Colonial history and Conflict Archaeology & Military landscape heritage. My non-professional interests are also closely linked to my passion for the outdoors and the environment around us; they are nature and wildlife conservation, environmental studies and the exploration of the unknown.\n\nI have conducted a comprehensive survey on the archaeological remains of the Fort of Colombo and have since been invited to and delivered lectures to numerous organizations including the Sri Lanka Navy, and have published my findings both locally and internationally.\n\nMy Masters thesis was an inventorying of VOC and Kandyan fortifications through a Geographic Information System (GIS), combining historical, archaeological and landscape data.",
