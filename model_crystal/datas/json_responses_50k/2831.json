Had my own band, several records and performed worldwide in \ntv and \u2013radioshows. In the Netherlands my own tv-show (Jos\u00e9 b.b.h.h) in the years 70.\nAfter slowly finishing my career as a singer I was asked to start to carry out\nwedding ceremonies in Ouderkerk. \nThis opened a total new perspective,  in line with the singing I could use my experience in \nassociating with all kinds of people, backgrounds and cultures. The result was that I was asked \nalso to carry out wedding ceremonies in Amsterdam, Centrum, West and New West. \nAs well as in the rest of the Netherlands and abroad.\nTogether with painting both are forms of expression, one (painting) is something you do alone, \nthe other (weddings) is something you do together. \nBoth give me positive energy what has a great outcome for me. \nMy paintings are often inspired by this positive energy I get from happy people.\n\n\nJosina den Burger Beeldend Kunstenaar/professional Painter\njosina@josina.eu\nhttps://josina.see.me/\nhttp://www.trouwmabtenaar.josina.eu\n020 6977150 / 0629 097097",
