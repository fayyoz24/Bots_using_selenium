    "summary": "I am an adaptable, passionate and responsible Law graduate from the University of Sheffield, I also have a Masters Degree in International Criminology. During my degrees I have combined my studies with other commitments and work effectively, showing myself to be determined, resourceful, self-motivated, and capable of working under pressure. \n\nI have experience in multiple fields, from Sport Management, to Higher Education, to Sports Journalism. My main passion however lies in the Sport sector, especially in regards to grassroots sport.\n\nThe content of my degrees is something I am interested in outside just an academic context. While I have studied these subjects as part of my degree, my interest is based on an enthusiasm and engagement with the subject, rather than a pragmatic approach to developing a career. I have a particular interest in the sociological aspects of law, with special interests in organised crime, deprivation, and juvenile justice. I have also travelled independently to Luxembourg and Den Haag to attend the European Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice, where witnessing the prosecution of war crimes had a long lasting impact on my world view. I have an analytical mind that is practical when problem solving. I enjoy working on my own initiative or in a team.\n\nIn my spare time I play Water Polo and also write in depth analytical articles on Ice Hockey for multiple outlets. Overall I am dependable, trustworthy, and diligent, with a passion to learn new skills.",

As an international  umbrella association with 70+ active members, bringing new members on-board, as well as maintaining current membership, is vital. In my role I therefore liaise with potential new members, highlighting the synergies and benefits that membership to ISCA would bring to organisations, as well as work with current members to see how they can best take advantage of being an ISCA member, and ensuring that our goals and their goals align as best as possible.\n\nAlongside these two key areas I also work on aspects of event management and well as advocacy.",
