Primagen also performs service testing with these diagnostic products and facilitates contract R&D, e.g. nucleic acid assay development, in vitro toxicology studies and evaluation of clinical studies. In the period of 2002-2006 Primagen has made a major change from a inside directed R&D company to a externally, customer and market directed product development and service company, operating according to the highest quality standard.
