    "summary": "As an independent and impartial Complaints Officer and Disclosure Coach I am responsible for mediation in the hospitals complaint and dispute procedure. I inform and support patients and doctors with complaints and conflicts, in medical liability issues (claims) and offer counseling to patients/ relatives during the research process of critical incidents (NL calamiteiten). \n\nProject manager Quality and Safety (Martini Hospital Groningen). My two main areas: 1) Developing a quality standard for Oncology & Wellbeing and 2) The use and improvement of quality indicators. Including two subprojects: 1) Reducing administrative burden on quality indicators and 2) Giving substance and meaning to transparency by means of quality indicators.\n\nIn March 2010 I started my PhD project \"The use and effectiveness of inquiries in (Dutch) healthcare\" (Erasmus University Rotterdam). My research focuses on critical incidents in hospitals and relates to incident supervision by the Health Care Inspectorate. I am particularly interested in the relationship between internal (i.e. reporting and investigating \u2018calamities\u2019 and critical incidents; VIM) and external (governance) incident supervision. Since September 2014 I continued my PhD research on a part-time bases.\n\nMaster thesis Sociology, University of Groningen/ RUG (2009) \"The conditions of moral case deliberation for nurses in a general healthcare facility\". The research led to an intake- and evaluation protocol and proposals for policymaking and implementation of moral case deliberation and ethics consultation in the hospital.\n",

Special field of interest Ethical Reflection (Moreel Beraad)\n\nAs a project manager (Care Cluster Oncology) I am responsible for the development of a new quality standard (Martini Standaard voor Oncologie & Welzijn, Martini Borstcentrum). The standard focuses, complementary to medical quality guidelines, on wellbeing aspects for oncology patients. The aim of the standard is to unite high quality requirements of the hospital (Santeon group) with the divers professional guidelines of scientific associations, quality marks of healthcare insurers, and relate to patients perspective (outcome measures) concerning holistic wellbeing criteria. The purpose of the standard is to improve internal organizational processes, but also regulates and contributes to interdisciplinary cooperation with external actors (among others: GPs and primary care). \n\nMy second project relates to the hospital-wide use of quality indicators. Besides the obligatory IGZ and ZiZo-indicators, we focus on the development of RVE indicators (Resultaat Verantwoordelijke Eenheid: i.e. departmental). Within this project, I am responsible for two additional subprojects: 1) Reducing administrative burden on quality indicators and 2) Giving substance and meaning to transparency by means of quality indicators.",
