The differences between both versions are huge and the entire operation has more resemblance to a new implementation than an upgrade. Besides configuring the new system and creating all the interfaces to other Rabobank systems, many software changes are required to the standard product to cater for the gaps.\n\nAs a member of the project management team I contribute to planning sessions, issue meetings and the organization of the project.\n\nAs a business analyst, my main focus is on Corporate Actions and on the (validation of the) Data Migration. My daily tasks are requirements analysis, discussing the solution documents with TCS and discuss/ approve test plans and test results with our test team. Similar to previous roles, I elaborate the configuration of the many business rules so they match the business requirements and discuss this with the Operations users, both as validation and as part of knowledge sharing.\n\nFor the data migration, I have prepared a test approach covering aspects like timeliness, completeness, correctness and usability of the migrated data.\n\nThe IT department already followed the Agile principles. The project was started as a regular project, but mid 2020 the approach was changed to Agile.",
