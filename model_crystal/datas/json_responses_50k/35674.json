I have more than 20 years experience within R&D but have always been working at the interface between development and production (processes) which makes my working experience very broad and versatile. \nOne of my strenghts is the ability to form and work in multidisciplinary (and international) teams. I like working according to set procedures although I am not shy to find my own way or improve these set procedures. Self steering, innovative, teamplayer, thinking outside the box.",
