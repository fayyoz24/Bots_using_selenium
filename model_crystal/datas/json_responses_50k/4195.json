It is the first time that an acronym has been used to identify the publication. This is primarily to allow for that identifier to go beyond the function of a title. \u2018JREAM\u2019 is also an assumed philosophy, which recognises the criticality of journalists as agenda setters. \n\nThis magazine is a collection of in-depth stories, which highlight realities under six main themes: Abuse, Minorities, Public Health, Education, Economy, with an emphasis on youth, and Environment. \n\nThe JREAM Edition is now live on three digital interactive magazine publishing and hosting platforms, and the best part is - it is FREE! You may read it whenever you please from personal digital devices.
