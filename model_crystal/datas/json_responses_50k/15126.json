He registered the domain name 'Thuisbezorgd.nl' the very next day. The companies ambitions extend beyond the Netherlands, which is why they also operate in Belgium, Germany, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Vietnam. Today Takeaway.com is market leader in Europe. \n\nIn a team we optimized our websites to make sure people can easily find us on every search engine in the World. Besides that I worked with our content team, creating awesome stuff for our blogs, and I optimized our apps for iOS and Android (ASO). \n\nIn 2014 I started working for Affiliation as well. I managed all partners and campaigns, mostly for The Netherlands, Belgium, The United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. \n\nNext to my daily tasks I conducted lots of other work within the company as well.\n\nI really loved working for Takeaway.com and I think I could have worked there for many more years.
