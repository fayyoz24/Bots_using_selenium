Recently, Google claimed to have reached quantum supremacy, a large milestone in this field of research. The laws of quantum mechanics that make these kinds of achievements possible also allow for information theoretically secure cryptographic protocols. These protocols have the property of being secure even in the presence of an adversary with unlimited computing power. ",
