Regarding the latter, I also evaluated applications in the 4th and 5th lists.\n\nI have also reviewed national and regional gas transmission system Risk Assessments, and supported some Member States in the elaboration of their national RAs, namely in the estimation of risk scenario consequences using hydraulic simulations. In addition, I have assessed technology needs, possible bottlenecks and other related problems in the LNG sector.\n\nI have conducted hydraulic simulations of EU Gas Transmission Networks, including interactions with Electricity Transmission Networks and ICT/SCADA systems. Results fed into various work packages contributing to increase awareness of the risk the EU energy networks are faced with. This work required a close cooperation with the Member States concerned and their Transmission System Operators, as well as partners in industry, academia, DG HOME and DG ENER.\n\nI have contributed to the EC\u2019s and the Member States\u2019 Energy Critical Infrastructures Protection efforts, within the framework of European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and the Gas Security of Supply Regulation (994/2010) and Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply by developing methodologies to identify the most relevant EU Gas Transmission Network risks and vulnerabilities.",

Previous transpiration radiometers relied on steady state temperature measurements in a porous element crossed by a known gas mass flow. As a consequence of the porous sensing element\u2019s intrinsically high thermal inertia, the instrument\u2019s time constant was in the order of several seconds. \n\nThe proposed instrument preserved established advantages of transpiration radiometers while incorporating additional features that broaden their applicability range. The most important developments were a significant reduction of the instrument\u2019s response time and the possibility of separating and measuring the convective and radiative components of the heat flux. These objectives are achieved through the analysis of the instrument\u2019s transient response, a pulsed gas flow being used to induce the transient behaviour. A thin microperforated steel plate was used instead of the earlier, thicker sinterized steel sensing element.\n\nA thorough literature review was followed by the development of two distinct analytical models (based on Green\u2019s Functions and Finite Differences) and the comparison of their results with those obtained using commercial Computational Fluids Dynamics software. Dimensioning procedures were discussed and applied to the design of prototypes, which were then built, tested and calibrated.\n\nPatent PT106475 was also granted as a result of the work developed in this framework.",

Increases in availability and reliability are highly desirable, being especially relevant regarding thermal equipment, namely in terms of energy consumption costs.\n\nI used CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) tools to build a \"virtual\" furnace, validated with experimental data. This model was used to simulate both normal and \u201cfaulty\u201d behaviours, regarding parameters such as energy conversion efficiency, steam leakage and fouling. A database was developed comprising normal situations and simulated fault sets, characterized by virtual sensor outputs used in the evaluation of diagnostic parameters patterns to be processed and recognized by the diagnostic system.\n\nThe database was processed using ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), with satisfactory results even in their most simple form trained using standard algorithms. Pattern recognition was thus performed, identifying root causes of simulated anomalies.",
