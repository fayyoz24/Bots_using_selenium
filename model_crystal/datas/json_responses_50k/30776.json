    "summary": "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Cheyenne. In November, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing the pre-master's program in Materials Science and Engineering with the intention of continuing into the Master's program in the same field.\n\nIn addition to my studies, I am eager to gain practical experience in the field of sustainable material design across various industries. I am particularly interested in branches related to textile design, (winter) sports, construction materials, materials used in the aerospace industry and space exploration, outdoor activities, and environmental services. I am open to projects both within and outside the Netherlands.\n\nDuring my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design Engineering, I acquired practical experience in the field of design. I participated in an exchange minor program at the University of Cincinnati in Industrial Design, completed an internship at the architecture firm Moody Nolan as an experiential designer, and spent a year as a design engineer in the Delft Hyperloop student team. To broaden my knowledge, I pursued a minor in Biodiversity at the University of Leiden and engaged in various committees within the Industrial Design student association. More information about these experiences can be found on the remaining sections of my LinkedIn profile.\n\nAt present, I am eager to delve deeper into the field of materials science and I am open to employment opportunities.",

Along with three other design engineers, I was in the Scalability Department of Delft Hyperloop VI. As a design engineer, I was involved in the concept development of a future hyperloop station on top of the Amsterdam Zuid train station and the digital and physical visualization of these plans. During my year I was mainly involved in the project management and planning of the design engineers, contact with partners, aeroshell design, video design, and creating and designing the model. \n\nEvery year is European Hyperloop Week, a competition in which hyperloop student teams from different countries compete. There was no award category for the design engineers, but we did get to present our design and the scale model we made was placed at the WTC at the Zuidas. \n\nDuring this year I gained both social and practical skills including project management, presenting, Rhino and KeyShot.",

This includes 2D and 3D graphic design and other elements for branded environments and spaces.\n        - Floorplan lay-out including signage and wayfinding design. \n\nI got more experienced with the Adobe Suite Programs Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, and learned the basics from Sketchup.",
