    "summary": "I studied Sustainable Energy Technology at TU Delft, with a specialization in solar energy. \n\nI have worked on improving solar cell efficiency through advanced light management techniques, which included almost 18 months of first-hand experience with fabrication, measurement and modelling of solar cells, as part of my MSc thesis project. I have worked on the complete design of a photovoltaic system as part of my Master programme. The education has also helped develop a thorough theoretical understanding of different energy technologies, and honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\nI also hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, which has given me a foundation in mechanical failure analysis, structural design theory, and project management. A minor track in Environmental Engineering is the result of my passion for sustainability and included an education in solid waste management. \n\nI am interested in opportunities related to the design, development and manufacturing of photovoltaic modules and systems.
