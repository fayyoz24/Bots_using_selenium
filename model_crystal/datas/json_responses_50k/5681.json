    "summary": "Passionate bilingual public health specialist currently seeking opportunities in project/program coordination and development, with a focus on HIV/AIDS/STIs targeting migrant populations.\n\nMy fervor for public health and adventurous spirit put me on a path to learn about different cultures and discover new ways to make a significant impact on the health and well-being of people across the globe. As an experienced project coordinator, I have performed a broad range of work in complex environments, including facilitating projects in low-resource settings. Examples include coordinating greenhouse construction at a Peruvian school to combat malnutrition and supervising construction of a water filter system in a Costa Rican village. \n\nWith more than 15 years work experience in public health and a MSc in Public Health Promotion, my strong track record will ensure a high quality of service delivery. I am an effective communicator skilled in adapting to new environments and serving a wide range of key populations such as MSM, PWID, migrants, refugees, youth, and LGBTQI+. Flexibility, initiative, a positive attitude, empathy, open-mindedness, team player and pragmatism define my approach to work.\n\nWhen I'm not globe-trotting, I enjoy writing about my travels, watching foreign, arthouse, and documentary films, spending time near the ocean, and volunteering.\n\nHighlights:\n\u2022  Project Coordination/Design on overseas (health) projects\n\u2022  STI/HIV, reproductive health education and training \n\u2022  HIV testing and counseling \n\u2022  Community engagement/Outreach\n\u2022  Webinar sexual health lesson plan development\n\u2022  Webinar delivery on STIs, HIV, and PrEP/PEP",
