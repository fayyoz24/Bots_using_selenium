Across seven weeks, twelve working days were spent on the design and creation of the game. Tank Takeover won the Best Design and Best Game awards at IGAD's bi-annual Game Release Party.\n\nTank takeover was featured at the INDIGO stall during Gamescom 2013 in Cologne, and was displayed on the showfloor during INDIEVELOPMENT 2014. It is currently being improved as an entry in Microsoft's Imagine Cup.\n\nBecause of the time constraints on the project, we chose to approach the game's artstyle with a modular focus. I was in charge of planning and creating the modular assets used for building the game's various levels. Because the size of the assets in the game view, we focused on designing the assets to have interesting silhouettes and poly-painted colours rather than interesting textures.\n\nAfter this was finished, it was my job to integrate the various assets into Unity, our chosen engine. this entailed communicating between various internal teams and managing build iterations.",

As part of my responsibilities at the CGU, I met with these clients and discussed their criteria, created app or game concept documents based on these criteria and presented them back to the client. After the client approved on the concept, we would prepare a concept design document and an assignment brief for the students who would take over the client project.\nIn addition to handling concept designs and related clients, I was also responsible for supervising seven student teams, each between eight to fifteen people strong. These teams were working on separate games for use in a large client project. I handled the communication between these teams and the client, ensuring both sides had the materials they required at all times. I also attended progress presentations and provided feedback on design- and technical issues.",
