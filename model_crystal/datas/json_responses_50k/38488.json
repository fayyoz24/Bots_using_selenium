    "summary": "Hi, it's nice to e-meet you. I am a third-year BSc Computer Science and Engineering student at TU Delft. I've worked with the robotics (VEX Robotics, FRC) and agriculture (Stanford EARTH) industries and I love automating anything and everything I can get my hands on. Some of the projects I worked on include IR Remote Lighting System, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, Amazon Price Tracker, Auto-trading with Python, Crop Growth Detection through Satellite Imagery, and some smaller-scale scripts (mostly, web crawling based) that make my life easier.\n\nI am tremendously driven to help accelerate the transition to sustainable technologies. Specifically, in the energy, agriculture, and consumer discretionary sectors. \n\nIn the past, I've conducted some research into analyzing the efficiency of photovoltaic cells in terms of photon energy & flux, spectral irradiance, and the radiant power density on the surface of our sun compared to the radiant power density on the surface of Earth (solar irradiance). I've analyzed the effects of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering on solar energy production and researched ways to mitigate these losses. \n\nWhat's quite intriguing to me is that while most sectors become more sustainable as they adopt a demand-driven supply chain approach, it's the opposite for renewable energy. Due to the inherent unstableness of renewable energy production (except for hydro), the generated energy has to be stored until demand arises. I believe that inevitably, an infrastructural change to the energy sector will depend on state-of-the-art ultracapacitor and battery technologies along with extremely efficient renewable energy production (maybe even cold fusion, who knows).",
