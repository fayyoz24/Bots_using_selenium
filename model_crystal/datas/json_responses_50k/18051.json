    "summary": "Applied quantitative and theoretical aspects of biology. My work involves the application, dissemination and further development of mechanistic models in eco(toxico)logy. In particular (simplified) models based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and the General Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS), but also toxicokinetic models. In general, these models will be used to interpret and predict in the effects of toxicant and environmental stress on life-history traits of invertebrates.\n\nThe DEB/GUTS perspective on stressor effects allows to interpret experimental test results in a mechanistic manner: how does the stressor affect the life history of the organism? Such a mechanistic understanding is essential to analyse toxicity data from complex experimental setups (e.g., time-varying conditions, multiple stress), and it allows for the prediction of effects under realistic (e.g., time-varying) field conditions. For more information, check out the www.debtox.info website.\n\nSpecialties: Process-based modelling, TKTD models, data analysis, dynamic energy budgets (DEB), ecotoxicology, DEBtox, DEBkiss, GUTS",

Modelling within these frameworks adds value to scientific and applied research projects in a wide range of fields (see my website for an up-to-date list of projects that I am, or have been, involved in, and lists of publications in which these models have been applied). I am currently particularly interested to participate in multi-year research projects that involve dedicated and structured experimental efforts (I do not have the opportunity to perform experiments myself), but I will also consider other opportunities to provide my modelling services.",
