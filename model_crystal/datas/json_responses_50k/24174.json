    "summary": "Bringing magic to our world and making people explore it again with new immersive experiences. \n\n\nAs a creative person, my mind is constantly overflowing with ideas on how to improve and create games, apps and experiences. \n\n\nI am a student in game design, where I'm learning how to bring all these ideas to life. But most importantly, I learned how to work with various people, from all over the world. This makes adapting to different teams easy for me, including all their individual ideas and views.\nI am now planning on learning about AR during a minor and my free time. \n\n\nWorking next to my study always reminds me that I have dreams I want to make true, and that I have to work hard to achieve those. \n\n\nI have always loved reading, dreaming of new worlds has brought magic to my life. It made me fantasize of my own stories that I enjoy writing down. Getting lost in books is what made me want to bring magic in this world, which becomes harsher every year, where people fear for their children and grandchildren. \nI want to help these people to stop thinking about how negative things are, and show them the beauty that this world holds.\n\n\nI am currently looking for an internship in the Augmented Reality field.",
