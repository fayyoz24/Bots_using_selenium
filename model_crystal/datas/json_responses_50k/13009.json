    "summary": "I currently work at HackerOne where I am the Senior Design Manager in EMEA.\n\nI'm a Design leader with over 20 years of work experience. My passion is helping others to grow in their career.\n\nI\u2019ve had the privilege of working with some amazing people and companies including HackerOne, funda, UBER, AXE, adidas, Klarna, eBay, Google, BFI, General Assembly, Unilever, Velocity Partners, Depop, JUST EAT, Havas Media, KIA, Inmarsat, Emirates, The National Lottery, Hyundai, Time Out, The Guardian, Hilton International and The Virgin Group.\n\nI love to teach and learn from others... I was previously a lead instructor at General Assembly and a Lead Tutor at The Guardian in London, teaching over 400 people from a wide variety of backgrounds to learn about user experience and blogging. \n \nMy passion for design lies in crafting experiences that solve real problems, in a simple way.\n \nI think and plan strategically to design across the full lifecycle of the UX process, from research to wireframing and prototyping, usability testing to UI and, if needed, I can turn designs into prototypes. Designing with informed decisions, I understand that a fantastic experience is one where the combination of how things look, read and work end up providing true value for people. \n\nThe driving force behind everything I do is the impact that design can have on people.",
