    "summary": "As a seasoned expat with a bachelors degree in Global Law, masters in Communications and pending master's in Labour Law, having lived in 9 countries predominantly in Asia and Africa, I am passionate about implementing responsible business conduct in order to improve labour conditions (and remove the WFCL), access to justice and the corporate accountability of adverse human rights impacts. I have produced extensive research on the WFCL particularly in relation to the artisanal mining of cobalt in the DRC. \n\nAfter studying film and media in the UK and in Amsterdam and working at VICE Media, I decided to pursue labour law in order to make an even larger impact on improving labour rights and social protection. On an EU level, I am driven by increasing social protection of vulnerable and atypical workers who find themselves in a weaker position in a fragmented labour market.\n\n\nJoin the European Citizens' Initiative: https://www.goodclothesfairpay.eu/\n#goodclothesfairplay",
