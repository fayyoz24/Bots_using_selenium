    "summary": "First of all, welcome to my profile. I am glad to see your curiosity to who I am and what my journey has been like so far.\n\nI am Danny, a 23 year old student from the Netherlands. Currently, I am in the last year of the MSc Business Administration with a specialization in Consumer marketing. This Master\u2019s degree followed after my BSc Industrial Engineering and Management. \n\nEven though I have learned and am learning a lot every day through my studies, it has only be a part of my overall journey so far. During the years as a student, I gained experience through being active in my study association Industria and the student network ESTIEM. It resulted in 30 travels all around Europe, many experiences in study-related and study-unrelated topics, and a deep intercultural understanding.\n\nIn addition, I gained experience through my jobs as student assistant at Eindhoven University of Technology and as an advisor in a store of VodafoneZiggo. They pulled me out of my shell and learned me vital professional skills I can use in the rest of my professional life.\n\nI am curious to the opportunities that will arise for me from now on, and if you are still reading my bio by now, feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn.",
