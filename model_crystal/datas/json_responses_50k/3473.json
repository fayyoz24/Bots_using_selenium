    "summary": "Bruno Alves de Almeida (Brazil/ Portugal) is a curator and architect based in the Netherlands, currently Artistic co-Director and curator of the Lule\u00e5 Biennial 2024 \u2013 Art & Architecture, in Sweden, curator and resident liaison of the Jan van Eyck Academie, and tutor of the Design Academy Eindhoven, in the Netherlands. His practice is rooted in site/context-specificity and transdisciplinary thinking, resulting in projects responding to timely issues, creating bridges between institutional and public spaces, and experimenting beyond customary formats and spaces for the presentation, production and experience of artistic practice. \n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Bruno has spearheaded exhibitions and site-specific public commissions responding to key urban contexts. Through commissions to emerging and established Latin-American artists and architects, these projects have dissolved boundaries between exhibition spaces and the public realm, have reached wider and diverse audiences, while broadening the public discussion on pressing socio-political and urban issues.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Bruno has worked closely with a multidisciplinary group of artists, designers, architects, curators, among others hosted by the Jan van Eyck Academie and the Design Academy Eindhoven. The projects he has curated have explored the agency of artistic practices in face of socio-ecological breakdown, and fostered debates and crossovers between the arts, design, the social and natural sciences, and institutions and policymakers beyond cultural spheres.\n\nBruno has also collaborated internationally with institutions such as TATE (UK), Harvard Graduate School of Design, Storefront for Art and Architecture, Independent Curators International (USA), PACT Zollverein (Germany), 11th S\u00e3o Paulo Architecture Biennial, Piv\u00f4 Art and Research (Brazil), among others. He is an alumnus of the De Appel Curatorial Programme, Amsterdam, holds a Master from the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture, Switzerland, and a Bachelor from the Oporto Faculty of Architecture, Portugal.",

Artists are invited to conceive site-specific works which are conceptually anchored in the occupation of the gallery space and, simultaneously, of another location already hosting its own functions and situated within 500m from the gallery. To grasp the works, visitors go from one place to the other, traversing a neighborhood in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo where a great variety of local establishments coexist with a mix of social classes and dynamics that are symptomatic of wider urban processes.",

In addition, there is an emphasis on Latin American artists, as they have another bodily and intellectual spatial understanding that comes from an intense familiarity with the complexity of the public sphere and of the urban and social processes which are specific to Latin America.\n\nBy chaining a disparate series of artistic proposals that dialogue directly with the public space, SITU intends to continuously engage and incite a broader and more heterogeneous audience. The main purpose is to conceive works that are not innocuous representations of reality, but rather elements that engender critical spatial conditions of an ethical-aesthetical commitment, through which pressing issues can be formulated, discussed and propagated.",
