The Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP) is convinced that by working together we can contribute to solving these problems. Nationally, but also internationally. Because water doesn\u2019t stop at borders. Within the NWP network private companies, NGO\u2019s, knowledge institutions and governmental organizations collaborate to achieve more impact abroad. The global water challenges offer opportunities for the Dutch water sector, that\u2019s why NWP shares knowledge, organizes matchmaking and increases the sector\u2019s visibility (conferences, missions, etc.). NWP is also co-executor of governmental programmes such as Partners for Water and YEP Programmes.\n\nMy focus is on the MENA Region countries, especially Egypt (Deltateam), the occupied Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, the Gulf region and South Sudan. \n\nMore information about our work can be found on the website of the NWP: https://www.nwp.nl \n\nDo you also want more impact abroad?
