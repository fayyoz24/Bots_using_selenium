    "summary": "You can't learn to build a Tesla/Polestar by talking to people who have made gas-burning cars for 30 years. A leader's job is more than innovation\u2014it is to see the world through a fundamentally different lens.\n\nPhenom People was founded to revolutionize the talent lifecycle through technology\u2014specifically, artificial intelligence (AI). While our passion is to create jobs and help ONE BILLION PEOPLE find the one that\u2019s right for them, we are not an HR company. We are a technology company that is redefining the talent experience.\n\nTalent experience (acquisition, retention, and evolution) have been misunderstood as separate processes. In reality, they are all connected within a cycle. It is a complete loop.\n\nPhenom People's Talent Experience Management (TXM) platform is an AI-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that connects all the stakeholders\u2014candidates, recruiters, employees, and management\u2014in the talent lifecycle. What does that mean? We bring velocity to recruiting and employee retention. We supply managers and recruiters with actionable data. We provide candidates with relevant information and best-fit job recommendations. And we show employees how to evolve their career journeys at their present companies.\n\nMost of our time is spent listening to customers, learning about who they are and what they want to accomplish. In the process, we\u2019ve realized there\u2019s a common thread that connects them all. The conversations are almost always fueled by three main talking points: the puzzle, the wow, and the fear.\n\nThe PUZZLE is what they need. The WOW is what they want. And the FEAR is what they don't want.\n\nThe best part of our job is being able to help customers solve problems by addressing the puzzle, the wow, and the fear through technology and our revolutionary platform.\n\nOur mantra is to help ONE BILLION PEOPLE acrross the globe!\n\nI am curious to get to know your company to revolutionize your entire Talent Experience Management lifecycle, while giving you a competitive advantage in attracting, hiring and maintaining the best of the best people on board.\n\nOpen to invitations, opportunities to network and interesting business ventures.\n\nWhatsapp or call me : +32 (0) 472 54 49 16\nemail me : Vic.Vanhove@phenompeople.com \nHelp One Billion People! www.helponebillion.com\nWebsite: www.phenompeople.com",
