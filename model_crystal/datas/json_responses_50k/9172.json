    "summary": "I acquired my BSc Diploma from Applied Mathematics which provided me with a solid theoretical background. Afterwards, I desired to learn something more practical, as well, to be able to apply my knowledge on various fields. In addition, I was always interested in psychology and working with people instead of sitting alone with my laptop all day. To combine these factors with Mathematics, I engaged in the Data Science direction.\n\nI gained work experience during my internship, and worked on a couple of team and individual projects at my university which taught me a lot about managing my time and prioritising tasks. These projects boosted my research and presentation skills, and taught me how to explain my findings to a non-technical audience. My private tutoring years and being a teaching assistant at the university also enhanced my explanation skills. Being a mentor of first-year university students and incoming foreign students contributed to my organisational and managing skills.\n\nI enjoy solving real-life problems which have an actual impact. New challenges and changes in my environment bring the best out of me, and I am eager to learn more and prove myself. I like to embrace the notion \u201cI am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it\u201d (Pablo Picasso).\n\nConcerning my personality, I am responsible which I showed during my mentoring years, as well as in my studies. At the university and my internship I learnt how to work independently, but I enjoy working in a team more. I am an open person with a high share of empathy and patience, so it is easy to get on well with me. When there is a goal set, I am hard-working, productive, and focused on the path leading to it. I believe my personality could bring value to any team with my open, enthusiastic and analytical mind, and caring for people around me.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy doing sports (for example, running and hiking), meeting up with my friends, cooking together, playing cards, going on walks in the city or in the nature, reading, and doing some creative work.",
