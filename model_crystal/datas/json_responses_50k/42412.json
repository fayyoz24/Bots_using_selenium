    "summary": "I began my professional journey in 2010 with Siddhartha Das Studio in Delhi, India, as an exhibition designer, working with a team of curators and traditional miniature painters & craftspeople to execute the scenography at a heritage monument. For the next 5 years, I was a part of the core scenography team at Rajeev Sethi Scenographers, Delhi, India. We executed the permanent exhibition for the Mumbai International Airport, currently Asia\u2019s largest Art Program. Together we worked with more than a hundred artists to develop the spatial staging. Post that, I worked in different fields of design such as Lighting Design, Way-finding and Signage, Environment Branding, etc. After which I practiced as an independent designer and executed several Exhibitions.\n\nI have also been practicing as a collage artist since 2017, applying the same knowledge of building narratives, and have done several commissions and exhibitions since. I recently graduated as a Master in Scenography in HKU Utrecht, Netherlands, where I am also based currently.",

The scenography was interpreted through six thematic installations\ncomposed of 4000 artefacts juxtaposed with artworks by India\u2019s finest traditional and contemporary\nartists at the Airport Terminal 2, India. Jaya He was conceived as an initiation into the immediate environment and the larger context of the airport, the city of Mumbai and of India as a whole. Reflecting the many-layered story that is India, the collection evolved into an immense multidisciplinary endeavor, like a new museum.\nJaya He brought together designers, artists, artisans, architects, art historians, anthropologists,\nand conservators with the technicians, all working together to distill and interpret India culturally,\naesthetically, historically and socially in a manner that leaves visitors with no doubt that they are in the\nheart of the South Asian subcontinent.\n\nThe project has three sections to it, namely, Thresholds of India, Layered Narratives and Baggage\nAcclaimed.",
