    "summary": "Interested in gaining new experiences, I like to learn from surprising perspectives and ideas. I experience \u2018unknown\u2019 situations \u2013 private and within work environments \u2013 as a challenge. This requires patience, creativity and a curious mentality, some of my strongest features. Varied work fits in well with this, but I find an extensive or long-term project equally interesting. \n\nFurthermore I consider myself as precise and consistent in executing tasks, clear in raising and answering questions and good in setting up and maintaining relations. I excel in creativity as far as situations require innovative solutions. ",
