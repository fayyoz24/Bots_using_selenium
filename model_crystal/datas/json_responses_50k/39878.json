    "summary": "I have been learning from many different companies how to optimize logistics and adjacent processes. While maintaining daily operation I have gotten quite creative with optimizing many of them. In some cases it was handling speed, I also have created Excel templates for others to work with, or found a low budget workaround that would save thousands of Euro's on a yearly basis.\n\nI like to solve things. That's why eventually started studying for my Post Bachelor Project Management and am currently working on my Masters degree. To build something.\nBefore that I wanted to simply be good at everything and did a broad array of studies to match the experience I had.\n\nI need to be challenged though. I have never looked for a home within a company, as an easy way to get a safe and steady income. That's what I am looking for in a company that does its work going from project to project, demanding nothing but the best possible outcome.\n\nWithin a  company I see everyone as my customer and I still believe customer is King. Choices have to be made, but eventually I always try to create a win-win. Within a company I can quickly find my way. In a personal matter I am used to get acquainted to just a few individuals, but I'm not interested in being everybody's friend. I love transparancy and if possible I would like to avoid politics altogether. This way I can stay as objective as possible and dedicate myself to the company. In a professional matter you can point me in any direction and I will deliver good results. \u2026.I can be charming...:) and give a presentation or two, but I still prefer working on my own, doing my part.\n\nI'm looking for a company that pierces through my CV and sees someone that has a skillset to get things done, a mind to learn new things and a creative approach to the things at hand.\n\nIf the work is project based and I am able to help making things better, I am home. That's where my energy comes from. I hope you want this from all your employees.\n\nThank you for reading this. I hope you will find what you are looking for as well.\n\nDavid\n\n\n",
