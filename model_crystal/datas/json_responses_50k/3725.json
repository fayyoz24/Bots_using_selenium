There are bore, frustration, inanity, laziness, depression, resentment, jealousness and etc. These negative emotions or evil powers often invade our minds before we realize. They would probably put torch of passion out, which is hard to generate previously. In this family, we gather many torches with enough fire together, which have the ability to stand out in front of storms of life. In such a pure place, more people can intake energy and become brave enough in face of challenges.\n\n-  Found this informal non-profit organization\n-  Set up culture and values (Honest, Giving, Gratitude, persistence)\n-  Featured as one of the successful and inspiring story by Saxion University Magazine\n-  Invited to make presentation during introduction day for new students \n-  Had members from China, Dutch, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bulgaria and Vietnam",
