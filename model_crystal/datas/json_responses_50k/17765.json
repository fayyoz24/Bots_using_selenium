    "summary": "I am searching for a full-time, part-time, or paid internship position, in the field of project assistance, or research assistance. It is very important for me to work in an establishment with a worthy cause, either in the humanitarian field or in climate change projects. Furthermore, I am also very interested in science communication projects. I have spent the past 5 years advancing my scientific career, by obtaining my Bachelor of Psychology, and finishing my research master in Sociology, with excellent grades. Now I am excited to apply all the theoretical and research skills I have mastered in the past years in a professional setting. For further details on those please have a look at my experience, but also do not hesitate to reach out for further information.\nMost of my free time is filled with consuming science media (podcasts, videos, articles, etc.) and submerging myself in small crafty projects (such as baking (pastries and bread), crafting, and learning piano) but also continuous self-education (learning Dutch and Spanish, reading a variety of books, researching cephalopods). I am a person of various interests, with a lot of empathy and motivation. Even though my interests are very varied, I have no trouble submerging myself into one project and dedicating most of my time to it. I am very interested in taking the unconventional way, and generally, I always try to think of new ways to approach research, teamwork, etc.",
