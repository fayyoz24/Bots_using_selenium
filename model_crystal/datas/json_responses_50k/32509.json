The PDeng programme trains and prepares master students, employees of companies, and other professionals to a senior engineer level. To this aim, PDEng trainees are trained to solve complex problems and deal with complicated issues in a systematic way.\n\nThe research objectives of this PDEng research are: [1] to introduce a method that enables Rijkswaterstaat employees to make a first-order assessment of the geohydrologic risk in canal projects; and [2] to present a control measure development methodology to best reduce the identified risk. The output comprises methods to indicate where and how much change in groundwater level will occur for a user defined scenario, what the consequence of this occurrence is, and which control measures are most suitable to manage the risk.  \n\nMethods \n\nThis first-order risk assessment consists of a 4-phase approach that combines groundwater calculations with geographic information. One of the main deliverables of this PDEng research is a step-by-step user guide which helps the user set-up, run and analyse different scenarios using numerical groundwater modelling software (iMOD). \n\nThe control measure development methodology consists of 3 phases: [1] Value Engineering; [2] Design research/development; and [3] Dissemination. The output is a semi-qualitative decision making tool to determine the most suitable control measure and a roadmap of systematic research/development of the selected measure.",
