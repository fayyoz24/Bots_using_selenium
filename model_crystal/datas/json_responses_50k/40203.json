Professional experience of five years in a high-ranked law firm in applying tax treaties in cross-border scenarios and structuring corporate tax planning for a great range of multinational enterprises, as well as in writing/editing the content of KPMG\u2019 tax technical publications to be provided to their network in Europe.
