    "summary": "Lachlan Marks is an award-winning screenwriter with TV and film projects in development in the UK, Europe and Australia. With a focus on horror, sci-fi and dark comedy, he\u2019s passionate about examining monsters of all varieties through unexpected, timely and inclusive stories.\n\nArmed with an ADHD-driven, outside-the-box brand of problem-solving, he's often brought in as an 'ideas machine' for brainstorming sessions and writers' rooms.\n\nA graduate of the Australian Film Television & Radio School, Lachlan has consistently won and placed highly in screenwriting competitions (WeScreenplay TV, Shore Scripts TV, Monte Miller Award).\n\nIn 2018, he was selected for development from Scripted Ink, a screenwriting incubator run by showrunner Shane Brennan (NCIS, NCIS:LA) and inducted into the peer-reviewed Australian Writers\u2019 Guild Pathways program designed to showcase exceptional local screenwriting.\n\nSince he began splitting his time between Australia and the Netherlands in 2019, Lachlan has developed TV projects in the sci-fi and horror space for several Amsterdam-based production companies and worked as a script editor on material financed by the Netherlands Film Fund. \n\nIn the UK, Lachlan has been brought in to create concepts for major music videos by international music acts such as Trivium and Amon Amarth, now viewed over four million times.\n\nRecently, his script for Game won the award for Best Unproduced Short Screenplay at A Night of Horror International Film Festival in 2022, judged by industry peers.\n\nHe creates material individually and with regular writing partnership MMGG, featuring fellow AWG Pathways members Bec Moret and Jasper Garner Gore. See more at: www.mmggcreative.com\n\nBefore committing to a life of screenwriting, Lachlan worked extensively as an entertainment journalist and touring musician internationally. As such, he\u2019s well accustomed to long hours, little sleep, large egos and surviving on literal peanuts. He gets stuff done.\n\nSee more here: www.lachlanmarks.com",
