    "summary": "Offering Clinical Interface Terminology Services for Hospitals and Health Systems to improve the clinical workflow in Hospital Information Systems and to generate better clinical documentation and coding (ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOMED, and many other official code sets). Our products and services are front-end solutions for clinicians to capture their real clinical intent at the patient encounter. Moreover, Intelligent Medical Objects is a healthcare data enablement company that ensures clinical data integrity and quality \u2014 making patient information fit-for-purpose across the healthcare ecosystem, from hospitals to health information exchanges to payers, and beyond.\n\nAbout myself as professional:\nI'm an experienced Sales and Business Consultant, besides that a people \u2013 manager and an active coach. I act as an entrepreneurial manager defining sustainable solutions for specific (international) business challenges from both a customer point of view as from the organizational perspective. My effectiveness is based upon (getting) a strong knowledge of the market and the products and services the company offers and the specific need of customers. In my long career as account manager, training manager, sales manager and sales director I prefer to work intensively with relative small professional (sales and management) teams on all levels (and especially international) and with companies offering high value products and services. 90 % of my experience is built up in Business-to-Business markets (pharmaceutical, medical, IT \u2013 services, publishing) and especially in institutional sales. This requires consultative selling and a project approach, being able to work with the different stakeholders in the DMU.\n\nSpecialties:\n# Offering HealthCare Data Solutions to C-Level people in Hospitals and Hospital Systems;\n# Working with High-Level Professionals either at the customers side or the organization side;\n# Working as Sales and Business Consultant to solve the problems at the customer side and to  deliver what the customer needs;\n# Working in the International Health Care Environment;\n# Selling Sophisticated and Complex Products and Services;\n# Helping to implement the Solutions offered;\n# Translating business concepts into daily practice.",
