    "summary": "I create and implement communication strategies for people and organisations who are in the business of change-making: companies that make the world a better place, such as sustainability agencies, gender data startups, sexual health companies, foundations, and independent (documentary) film-makers. \n\nCommunication is about storytelling and connecting. And connecting to others is pretty much what life is about, if you ask me (whew! We went from communication to life's purpose real quick). On a serious note: marketing is about making sure that the world \u2013 the people you are trying to service or sell to \u2013 know what you do and why you do it. And it can be really difficult to get that story right when you are the one doing the work. \n\nThat's where I come in. \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI help impact organizations with their marketing & communications. This could be writing a marketing strategy, running a multimedia campaign from start to finish, or day-to-day social media management. With my tiny team of freelance creatives I can help you with all-round content support.\n\nI love being allowed into the the different \"worlds\" of my clients. This variety and diversity in my work is why I love communications. I may be creating a communications strategy one day, organizing a conference the next day, and writing a blog post the day after. \n\nIf this speaks to you, feel free to send me a DM or email \u2013 whether you are looking for content support or are a freelance creative looking to do project-based work \u2013 I'm always open to chatting! \n\nEmail: hi@irisweges.com \ud83d\udce9 \nWebsite: https://irisweges.com/\n\n_____\n\nOther things to know about me: \n\nI love collaborating with people from different cultural, national and industry backgrounds. I studied social science and gender studies, specializing in ethnicity and sexuality. That basically means I'm trained to analyse power structures (and that I have really cool friends \ud83d\ude09). Diversity and inclusion are important to me. Diverse perspectives and lived experiences also make for the best work.\n\nI believe the future of office work is remote and flexible. I'm a part-time nomad, mostly based between San Francisco and Amsterdam (my home base), but Washington, D.C. and Mexico have also been home in the past few years. (Read about some of my digital nomad adventures on my blog \u27a1\ufe0f https://irisweges.com/).",
