    "summary": "As Chief Marketing Officer of bol.com, the largest e-commerce marketplace in the Netherlands and Belgium, I\u2019m in the unique position to work with the best creative and tech people out there to create the best customer and partner experiences. My goal is to drive growth through purpose-driven and insightful (data driven) marketing. Together with my team we drive brand and business growth by creating stories and experiences that are impactful, engaging and culturally relevant.\n\nAwarded Marketeer of the Year in 2021 (https://dutchmarketingawards.nl/winnaars-2021/)\n\nReporting to the CEO and leading a team of 400+ Marketeers divided over 5 departments (Brand & Performance Marketing, Customer Service, Product Marketing, Partner Success and External Affairs & ESG), I believe my most important accountability is to grow and nurture a high-performing team.\n\nI am proud of my ambition to become frontrunner in sustainable retail, and the number of innovative solutions we launched to achieve this - from labelling our green assortment (not easy with over 40 million SKUs) to removing the extra bol.com outer-box when shipping items with a strong box, such as coffee machines. For our brand to truly live up to its promise of \u201cthe winkel van ons allemaal\u201d, we have a huge responsibility here, both in our sustainability efforts as well as in being an inclusive brand and employer, where representation matters and everyone can feel included.  \n\nThroughout my career I have focussed on building strong brands by combining tech, data and creativity.  Gaining my experience at Unilever in Marketing, at wieden+kennedy in Creativity and at Google in Tech, I learned from the best people around the globe over the last 24 years.. \n\nSince 2017 I am honoured to be a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam, as part of their \u201cUvA in Carre\u201d program, a lecture series for students of MSc in Business Administration. I am an active public speaker and panelist. Topics include: Creativity & Tech, Customer Centric Innovation, Leadership, ESG/ Sustainability, Social Media and Culture. \n\nWhen I\u2019m not searching for the best digital experience anyone has ever had, I love travelling with my family, and hunting for vintage furniture.",
