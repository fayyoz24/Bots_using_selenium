    "summary": "An executive in leading human capital with a 20-plus year international track-record.  I formulate and execute the forward-thinking strategies and tactics that enable organizations to achieve desired levels of performance and productivity on a global scale.  Steering collaboration and liaising in top leadership teams to enhance speed of delivery.  Influencing through informal authority, persuasiveness and perseverance is my most valued reward.  I have held assignments in Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Finland, United Kingdom, United States and the Netherlands.  My responsibilities have crossed over one hundred countries including remote locations in all areas of Latin America, North America, Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and large nations such as Mongolia, Russia, China and Australia.\n\nThrough organizational structures, I increase business opportunity.  Restructuring operations, combining business groups, and establishing alignment to grow shareholder value are my priorities.  I drive enterprises toward a culture of fairness and consistency, increasing employee trust and motivation.  I quickly assess the right organizational model tailored to meet the business needs.  I hold leaders accountable for their personal and team development.\n\nMy ambition is to make a measurable difference in impacting the culture of an organization.  I am motivated by international, progressive enterprises with opportunities to engage in top level organizational design/structure activities coupled with reward management systems that drive business results.  I perform best in organizations with diverse people and experiences.\n\nFunctional Expertise\n-Transformation\n-Performance and Reward\n-Organizational Design and Structure\n-Leadership Team Development",
