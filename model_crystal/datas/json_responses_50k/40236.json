    "summary": "I am an engineer in training and an explorer at heart. Having been raised in a multi-cultural environment of bilingual students from all four corners of the world, I quickly learnt about the benefits of people coming together to achieve great things. The space industry had always represented to me one of these great collaborations in engineering. With projects like the ISS and the Apollo program, I was always fascinated in the excellence in engineering, the collaboration reflected, and the drive for discovery that the aerospace industry holds. I saw in this field the new explorers of our time. This time they didn't have the name of Marco Polo or Magellan but were called Voyager and Curiosity and were exploring our solar system and our world. I also saw how space not only allowed us to look further into the stars but also helped connect us all together. Since then, I have always wanted to be able to participate in fields that seeks to better mankind.\n\nI started my studies by setting off to Boston to earn a combined B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Physics at Northeastern University. I was able to learn engineering and physics skills while also having the chance to work in places such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Protonex. Here I learned how to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice and had the chance to lead test programs on mechanisms that were used on Mars. Wanting to learn more about the aerospace field, I then headed to the Netherlands to get an M.S. in Aerospace engineering with a specialization in space engineering. Here I had the chance to lead the build of a small aircraft and have been part of the Assembly and Integration team of the first Dutch student built CubeSat, which will be used to educate students about space all across the Netherlands. \n\nI am now looking to finally join the workforce and help a new engineering project grow. I bring a varied amount of experience in thermal, mechanical, and testing engineering but I also bring with me a thirst for learning and improving. In this website I share the different experiences I have had throughout my young career as an engineer and would be happy to talk and share about my experiences with anyone interested in contacting me. \n\u200b\nI enjoy using 3D printers, solving spatial problems, traveling around the world and diving into new technologies even if I am no expert on the matter.",
