    "summary": "I am a nice and friendly person who can work independently as well as in cooperation with any kind of human beings. I am graduated in Informatics (Management Information System) at the Delft University of Technology. After my graduation, I always have been working as application developer and educator in development of information systems and mathematics. I also graduated at the Open University of the Netherlands in Business Science specialized in Business Processes and ICT. At the moment I work as educator, teaching students in development of information systems. I am teaching students to write programs with .NET C#, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, php, python using MySQL and Postgresql as DBMS, Once worked as programmer, I always want to operate in the development and management of information technology. Searching for challenge I write a survey concerning the state-of-the art of energy-efficient programming / information systems. The goal is to obtain a phd degree. I likely want to meet companies that are interested in my skills, my knowledge and my work experiences. Moreover, I am certified in Cisco CCNA Networking and CyberOps Associate. I am a(n) hardworker and I always accomplish my objectives with enormous passion and enthousiasm. My slogan is: \"A DAY THAT I DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING IS A LOST DAY\".",
