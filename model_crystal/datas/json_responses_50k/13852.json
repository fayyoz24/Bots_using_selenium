During a two phase (\"path\" and \"camp\") particpants learn about developing themselves, the environment, social aspects and the people around them. Participants were challenged to join a path where the activities differ from cultural explorations in Helsinki to climbing challenges and meeting santa clause in the northern city of Rovanimi. The \"camp\" part consisted of five different activity fields in the different learning areas of the roverway. But most of all, participants are invited to have a good time at what is called \"the jamboree amongst jamborees.\"\n\nAs member of the Dutch contingent I am responsible for the website and co responsible for other digital communication (like twitter/facebook). As a member of the Internation Service Team (IST) I worked at one of the activity fields during the event itself.\n\nDuring this project I worked in an international team and learned about cultural differences in organising and managing an event of this size. In prepraration to and after the event, I worked in a team of three to maintain and update website and social media, design and order clothing (sweaters and neckers) for participants, and communicated through newsletters and e-mail with participants of this event.",
