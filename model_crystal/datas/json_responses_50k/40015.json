    "summary": "Across Amazon, I have owned a range of Products, Programs and Projects - with experience of managing large teams across Europe and stakeholders worldwide. Currently, my focus is on expanding our operations, and the complexities that come from launching a new network (new country) alongside our existing network. Previously I've owned growing the Prime Member base in the Netherlands, scaling up our Small and Light business across Europe, launching Fulfillment by Amazon in Australia, and leading the business development efforts for Pan-European FBA worldwide (started pre-launch). I'm excited by the early stages of products and programs, and excel in an ambiguous environment that needs to be structured. \n\nAdditionally, I'm an experienced interviewer, participating in well over 500 interviews. Often I'm supporting these interviews as outsider to support gaining a diverse perspective across our teams. I've been a passionate advocate for the Graduate Program in the UK, helping Amazon become the largest recruiter of graduates in the country - leading the charge in revamping the program from interview and onboarding experience to 'graduation'. Furthermore, I've taken an active role mentoring - generally maintaining 2-3 mentee relationships at a time, supporting them through the Amazon career development process and promotion path.\n\nGiven that we always have roles to hire - I look forward to help potential applicants find interesting roles, and help them get ready for their interviews with Amazon.",
