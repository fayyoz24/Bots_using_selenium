I've been working on design and implementation of new features in a generic motion control framework for high performance control loop systems. The framework is used by various subsystems of ASML scanners.\nAfter two years of development work within the motion group, I started to work as subsystem integrator. In this role I was responsible for integration of the motion control framework into a new Wafer Handler application. This was a great opportunity to learn more about a specific application within the ASML system. My personal communication skills have proven to be helpful in translating application and integration issues into new framework requirements.\nTogether with the Wafer Handler team and later also with the Wafer Stage team, I was involved analyzing complex system issues to improve reliability and up-time of the ASML machines.",
