Participants were asked a series of challenging questions about the historical happenings that led to this union, and were expected to provide insightful and well-researched answers.\n\nI am honoured to have been part of an event that celebrates the rich history of Romania and inspires students to explore the past and learn from it.",

I had the privilege of communicating with the management of the Swedish institution, sharing insights about my own culture and learning from theirs.\n\nDuring my time in Sweden, I gained a greater appreciation for the diversity of cultures and the importance of building bridges across borders.
