    "summary": "Positive, action and results driven operational people and project manager with sound education and broad experience at well known leading international companies, active in the (petro)chemicals, industrial gas, biofuels as well as technology, engineering and project services (solutions). \nSignificant experience with improvement projects (Six Sigma, Operational Excellence) and change management (restructuring) as well as with investment projects (revamping, de-bottlenecking, automation, turnarounds, capital maintenance and product/application development).\n\nI'm getting energy and fulfillment from results in general and from those from my teams and customers in particular, as well as from learning from a new experience (incl. mistakes) with others. Especially through sustainable improvements in processes in the broadest sense, hence from both technical, operational, organizational (cultural) and transactional ones. \n\nI'd like to meet, work with and engage people and learn from them through an intensive exchange of knowledge and experience to explore new opportunities to mutual increase value and uncover hidden resources in the broadest sense.\nWhile doing this I'd like to provide/create some structure and disciplined work processes, while forgetting neither to discover the first steps to get things in motion towards this better place, nor to create an environment where we can also apply and share our creativity.\n\nIn the end I'd like to get things done. First things first, safe and as efficient as possible in order to free up resources to explore the next improvements to do things more effective and/or for brand new things.",
