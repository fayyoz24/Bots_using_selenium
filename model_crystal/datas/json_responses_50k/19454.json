Few recommender systems exist, however, for the academic domain, where they could help students choose courses or academic programs. This thesis focuses on building a recommender system for this academic context, capable of supporting the needs of various types of academic departments. The main recommendation methods are analysed: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and demographic filtering; and different hybridization techniques are described. The idea of a single unifying model, a hybrid system with a statistical model that incorporates knowledge about items, users, and ratings, simultaneously, is introduced. The unifying hybrid framework is built and evaluated against the non-hybrid systems, using actual academic data from two different types of educational departments.\n\n[ Information Filtering & Recommender Systems ]",
