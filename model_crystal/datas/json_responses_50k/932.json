Fieldworkers from communities in the three areas identified people with knowledge of folktales and asked them to narrate the stories in storytelling sessions which were in some cases audio- or video-recorded. \n\nTo date, the project team has documented over 60 folktales, many of which are accompanied by audio of the storyteller\u2019s narration and photographs or video of the session.",
