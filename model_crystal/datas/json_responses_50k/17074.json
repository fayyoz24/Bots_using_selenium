    "summary": "My path to UX was built on a combination of research skills from academic training and experiences working with B2C and B2B start-ups. In my PhD, I gained skills in understanding how factors in built and social environments influence human behaviours. Through teaching and giving conferences talks, I have learned to communicate science in an exact and inspiring manner.  I am interested opportunities where I can help companies and organisations develop their products, services, and technologies through deep insights about human interactions and behaviours.",
