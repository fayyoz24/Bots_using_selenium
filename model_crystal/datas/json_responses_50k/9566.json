    "summary": "Welcome to my page! I am a technology enthusiast with a relentless passion for leveraging digital platforms to transform the aviation industry. My journey began as a curious kid, fascinated by the design of high-tech machines like airplanes and rockets, and that fascination has evolved into a lifelong pursuit of revolutionizing the way we experience air travel.\n\nThroughout my +25-year career, I have been dedicated to envisioning and implementing digital solutions that redefine the boundaries of aviation possibilities. My commitment to driving innovation has led me to work with leading organizations such as Embraer, F/List, and Inairvation GmbH, where I harnessed technology and creativity to enhance the aviation ecosystem.\n\nAs a visionary in this field, I actively explore emerging technologies, staying at the forefront of industry trends and pioneering the adoption of cutting-edge digital platforms. Collaborating with diverse stakeholders, including airlines, manufacturers, and technology providers, I seek to create a seamless and connected aviation experience for passengers and operators alike.\n\nWhile my current ongoing project is under wraps, I am excited about the potential it holds to revolutionize the aviation industry further. My dedication to this field is evident in my pursuit of continuous professional development. Recently, I completed ThePowerMBA program, where I gained insights from visionary entrepreneurs who have shaped some of the most innovative companies in the world.\n\nBeyond my professional endeavors, I am an avid traveler, constantly exploring new cultures and seeking inspiration from diverse experiences. I firmly believe that technology has the power to bring people together and enrich our lives in unprecedented ways.\n\nIf you share my enthusiasm for the limitless possibilities that digital platforms can bring to aviation, I would love to connect with you.

            "description": "ABSTRACT: The aviation industry is going through one of the most critical moments in its history due to the Covid-19 pandemic, high oil prices, and lack of human resources. As a result, the level of indebtedness of airlines in the world reached the level of USD400 billion (source: Bloomberg), and there are now 2.3 million fewer people working in the aviation industry (source: Randstad). Consequently, several airlines have ceased to exist, and the companies that survived the crisis anxiously await the resumption of passenger volume \u2013 which should only occur in 2025, according to IATA forecasts. As a result, airlines are looking for every opportunity to optimize costs and reduce the complexity of their operations.\nWith this scenario in mind, Fabio Molina, Matheus Reis, and Sebasti\u00e3o Correa Hon\u00f3rio bring an innovative proposal, placing airlines at the center of a digital transformation strategy. The \u201cNew Horizons\u201d project proposes a new approach to connect the main actors in the aviation ecosystem in a digital platform, reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of airlines worldwide in a sustainable way, and at the same time, reinforcing Embraer\u2019s position in the aftermarket business, leveraging operational efficiency, and consequently, financial results.",
