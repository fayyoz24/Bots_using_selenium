    "summary": "- I have 5 years of experience working as a Project Assistant in the Gas hydrate synthesis and Spectroscopy Lab, at CSIR-NGRI Hyderabad India.  \n- I have been primarily working on laboratory synthesis of gas hydartes for gas storage applications.  I have gained hands-on experience with various spectroscopic and characterization tools. Specifically, I worked on Raman spectroscopy and XRD instruments. I also have experience with IR and DSC. Working in this laboratory has given me everything from basic laboratory skills to advanced instrumentations.\n- I registered as a Ph.D. student at the same institute. I will be ready to deliver my final thesis defense viva in th coming few months. \n- In the Netherlands,I have been exploring different opportunites and gained experience in working in an international environments. \n- I have worked  as an Teaching assistant for pimary and secondary school level delivering IB curriculum lessons in the Netherlands.",
