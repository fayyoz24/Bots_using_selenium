Through qualitative and quantitative research we concluded that out of the three nominated products, the FoodFriend was the best product to import. The FoodFriends are silicone food caps that helps to keep al your fruit and vegetables fresh, so you don't have to waste any of it. \nAfter we wrote a market research report plan, business plan, purchase plan, sales plan and a communication plan we started to purchase the products and sell them on the Dutch market. After we sold the products we finished this project with an annual report, sales report and a job performance appraisal report. \n\nIn the first 4 months I was the CEO of Exito. My main responsibilities were to motivate, encourage, coordinate and control everything that happens within the company. I was also joint and several liable for fulfilling the obligations of the enterprise. \n\nIn the last four months of our import-project I was the marketing/sales manager. As a marketing/sales manager I was responsible for writing a professional marketing plan about the FoodFriend, determine the marketing strategy and arranging the pre- and aftersales.",
