It included 3 business units, 4 offices in 4 countries (DE, BE, NL & CH and +/- 150 FTE.

This all in an extremely tight labour market. Main levers to achieve this were simplification of business portfolio by divestment of one business unit, rebranding of Fluvia as employer on the Rhine, adjustment of benefit packages to market standards and continues improvement on operational control leading to an enhanced customer satisfaction.",

Main work streams include business development, design & engineering, commercial contracting, environmental permits, procurement & construction. Rationalised masterplan for terminal development and adjusted organisation accordingly. Landed a 15 year commercial agreement (take or pay) on LPG export terminal for a USA-Korean joint venture.
