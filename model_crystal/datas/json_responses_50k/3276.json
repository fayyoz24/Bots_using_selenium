    "summary": "CarbonOrO delivers an energy-efficient CO2-scrubbing technique to convert landfill gas (LFG) or biogas into a renewable energy source or extracts CO2 out of flue gas. \n\nWe have eliminated previously known disadvantages of amine scrubbing such as high heat demand and corrosion.\n\nOur scrubbing technique runs, compared to conventional scrubbing techniques, at a lower temperature of  110 \u02daC (plus with 4-6 bar pressure for further liquification). It reduces capex (small footprint) and opex costs (less heat and less degradation of amines) for the carbon capture process of up to 50% compared to MEA.\n\nWorking from preliminary ideas of the Eindhoven University of Technology, CarbonOrO developed this innovative technology with the aid of chemical company AkzoNobel.\n\nRead here the press release on our first client: \nhttps://www.carbonoro.com/press-release-viridor-carbonoro/",
