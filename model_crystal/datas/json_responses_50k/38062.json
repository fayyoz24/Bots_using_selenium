My current roles make me a strong operations and events generalist with strong management organisational, and communications skills, and have allowed me to develop excellent critical thinking and strategising skills.\n\nI studied PPE (Politics, Philosophy, and Economics) at Erasmus University College, alongside becoming active in the Effective Altruism community, learning Dutch (B2) from scratch, and building my coding skills. I also attended Leiden University in the Hague (Sep 2021) to complete a minor in public administration and governance.",
