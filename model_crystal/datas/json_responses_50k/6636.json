We are also active in area development such as our current project \u2018Hyde Park\u2019 in the middle of the Metropole Region Amsterdam with a variety of 4,000 houses.\n\nIC Netherlands is a member of the International Campus Group, expanding throughout the whole of Europe. The International Campus Group is sponsored by Brookfield (TSX: BAM.A; NYSE: BAM and NASDAQ: BPY; TSX: BPY.UN).\n\nFrom January 2018 - August 2018 I also was Member of the FIZZ Fund Management Team in Luxembourg and Germany.\n\nThe 'FIZZ Student Housing Fund', named after International Campus's main brand 'THE FIZZ', is intended to operate as a long-term investment vehicle and will help accommodation specialist International Campus expand across Europe with its accomodation for students and young professionals.\n\nThe new fund is being seeded with four fully leased German properties containing 1,200 apartments in Berlin, Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Hanover.
