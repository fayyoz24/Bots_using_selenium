    "summary": "An important concern for me is how politics and business can strive for a more sustainable future. With my Master's degree, I want to become a future \"change maker\" who is able to develop holistic governance solutions for the major and complex challenges of environmental sustainability. Already in my Bachelor's degree, I was particularly interested in how the economy and businesses can be designed sustainably. I am particularly passionate about the topics of sustainable finance and CSR.\n\nI am curious, love personal development and strongly believe in the power of thoughts, shared visions and education as a basis for action.",
