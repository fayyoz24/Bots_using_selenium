    "summary": "Proactive, detailed-oriented and committed young professional, with over 6 years of experience in Digital Marketing and over 10 total years of experience within Marketing.\n\nGraduate from Luiss Guido Carli (one of the premiere marketing & business schools in Italy) in 2013 in an English-only Master's Degree course of International Business, I started working, in the same year, for Methorios Capital, a consulting company in Rome, gaining experience in equity and debt capital markets.\n\nIn October 2014 - following my goal to have a career in a multinational corporation - I got hired by the British tobacco company Imperial Tobacco, as a part of a  graduate program. I started my experience in the Brand Marketing department and in 2016, after an internal re-organizational model, I moved to Trade Marketing for the new South Eastern European Cluster of Imperial Tobacco, taking care of the Italian market as a Planning Coordinator.\n\nWith the launch of the e-cigs brand blu in Italy, I moved to digital marketing, which is the field I'm currently pursuing a career. I coordinated for 2 years the overall planning and execution of digital marketing activities for blu in Italy, focused on driving brand awareness, social Share of Voice and conversion to sales, and strictly linked to the overall brand marketing plan and developments.\n\nIn January 2020 I moved to the Amsterdam HQs of Fontem Ventures, the subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco which owns the e-vapour brand blu and which serves as the center of excellence for digital marketing to all global markets. With the qualification of Digital Project Manager, I acted as a bridge between local markets and the global HQ, coordinating roll-outs of new digital products and gathering feature requests from markets. I collaborated on a daily basis with designers, developers, testers, SEO agency, internal stakeholders and local market stakeholders.\n\nIn June 2021 I decided to change industry and moved to the Web & Display team of Pandora A/S, working as a Digital Project Specialist in the company HQs in Copenhagen, and being responsible for defining, handling and executing all digital projects, marketing campaigns and content management across markets.\n\nIn October 2022 I returned to Amsterdam to take on the eCommerce Manager role at Miele X (subsidiary of the German household appliances manufacturer). I am now responsible for different projects on the website, aimed at generating additional revenue streams and improving brand consideration.",
