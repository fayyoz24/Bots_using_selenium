    "summary": "I am passionate about making healthcare technology beneficial for patients and doctors alike, and affordable for societies... I focus on Oncology; seen too many people around me succumb. \nIn the past 14 years I have started up 3 companies in localized and sustained drug delivery for Cancer, Diabetes, CNS and Orthopaedics. Together my teams and I initiated and raised over euro 120 million for high tech investments in biomedical businesses and public-private fundings.\n\nIn the coming years I dedicate myself to my company OncoLize. I will make sure we get proper funding and empower the teams and the partnerships worldwide so that we can unleash the magnificent potential that localized delivery of drugs can do for tumor eradication. \n\nI have a strong, successful track record in turning around, expanding and starting up high tech businesses in DSM, SHELL and start-up's, in EU and China.\n\nCurrent Industries: Drug Delivery - Cell Therapy - Regenerative Medicine - Biomedical Materials \nPast industries:      Performance Materials, Pharma Actives, Bio-energy, Food.\nMNC's:                   Unilever, SHELL, DSM\nSME's:                   OncoLize, Hy2Care, InGell Labs, Branching Tree, Beta Cell, Isotis Orthobiology, ACSBiomarker.\nCountries:              EU - China - India - USA\nSettings:                Start-up's (3); JV's (2); turn-around's (4); accelerate (2); Asia (2). \nStyle:                     Understand the options - Choose and focus - Unleash energy - Reward. \nTraining: Tumor Virology/ molecular biology (1985 - Univ Leiden, NL) - Business Administration (1984, Erasmus univ, NL) - 1996, IMD Lausanne)\n\nLove to play modern music, sailing, snowboarding, gymnastics... and to cook on Sundays for my family.",

Helena has now joined our founder-team, and we will be operating from our labs in Dublin and in Leiden in the near future. \n\nRaising our Series A of \u20ac3+\u20ac6 million.  \nOncoLize develops injectable drug depots to treat solid tumours, from the inside. Clinical benefits are clear and simple: improved efficacy, less side-effects, lower cost of care.  With our partners we have established pre-clinical proof-of-concept in Pancreatic tumors and Lung tumors, and we have started  our funding round to bring these products to clinical trials in US and EU.\n\nWe start with some of the rare and deadliest tumors: Pancreatic cancer, Liver cancer and Lung tumors. Why? Because the unmet needs are greatest, and not much progress has been made to date. Patients and doctors will greatly benefit from OncoLize products through 1) higher dosing of drugs inside the tumor to increase tumor-eradication; 2) far less side effects in the rest of the body; 3) Triple A products: Affordable and Accessible for All.",

Great connection and collaboration with the founders and the first stage investors to re-structure and re-position the company. While boot-strapped for every penny, we managed brilliantly to get the pivotal pre-clinical data on the tabel that convinced the Series A investors to close the deal at good valuation for the current investors.\n\nAs scheduled, the newly appointed CEO specialized in medical devices for sports medicine can take it from here, while I now focus on starting-up my own company for drug delivery in cancer patientes: OncoLize. (see above)\n\nHy2Care has developed a one-stop non invasive solution to repair Acute Focal Defects in knee cartilage. We are now scaling-up and expanding the team. \nMy role as part-time CEO is to close the coming investment rounds, to build the team, to drive industrialization and scale-up manufacturing, and to expand the business.\nThe team and I have been working together in previous Osteo Arthritis projects, and the in-situ crosslinking hydrogel technology is familiar....

Together with the Dutch and Chinese partner we quickly and radically changed the incentive system and the management processes and got the company back on it's feet. \nBy introducing new technologies and new products from the DSM mother company, we grew at an amazing speed, both in value and in volume. Without major investments we exanded the company with simple and effective order-to-cash principles like 'first- time-right', and minimum value targets; these were evaluated on a monthly and annual basis with substantial variable pay for the whole company as incentives. Within 4 years my local teams had quadruppled the turn-over and we had become very profitable in a local commodity industry growing at 15% per year. We negotiated patiently to buy the majority position from the Chinese state-owned enterprise JPC of Nanjing, and we produced a strong cash flow ROI for both partners. The company has expanded consistently ever since, forming a corner stone of the global business group. Most of my local collegues have moved up in their careers within DSM, and we keep track of each other, helping out where we can. During that time I was also active as co-founder of various DSM China Management platforms and I chaired the DSM SHE (Safety, Health and Environement) Platform, emphasizing SHE as a connecting value for all DSM China activities and introducing SHE as a mind-set for sustainable growth. In those years I was invited by the Chinese government as the vice-president of the Nanjing Foreign Investment Association, and as standing member of the Jiangsu and the National FIA's. After I handed over my position to my successor in October 2002, I consulted for DSM in Chinese activities for Dyneema and Nutritional Products.",
