The regional focus lies in rural areas in the Teso region in the North-East of Uganda.\n\nOur mission is to protect, support, and empower the lives of abandoned street children, displaced teenagers and young child mothers through counseling, housing, and a variety of educational programs. Our goal is to help these young and highly traumatized individuals to effect a positive and sustainable change for themselves and the communities they live in. \n\nMany of these girls and boys are HIV infected or have been brutally abused or raped during the local rebel war started by Joseph Kony, who was indicted for crimes against humanity in 2005. Unfortunately these young people are mostly forgotten and don\u2019t receive any further attention from their government or any charity organization.\n\nWe believe that everybody deserves the opportunity to live a safe, productive, and fulfilled life. \nTogether, we can make it happen, so why don\u2019t we?  For more information, including your donations please visit our website www.mamawatoto.org\n\nWe are currently looking for dedicated and passionate volunteers in the areas of fundraising, back-end and front-end development, project management, and PR support. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me at engelbert@mamawatoto.org if you have any further questions.",
