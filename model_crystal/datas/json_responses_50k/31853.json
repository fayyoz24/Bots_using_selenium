Descriptive sensory analysis, fatty acid analysis, solid-phase microextraction, stable isotope ratio analysis, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy and proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry proved to be very successful analytical tools and provided scientific evidence to link the sensory and chemical profiles of the meat to the characteristic diet of the animals, which is again linked to its origin.  Biomarkers (terpenes) derived from plants were detected in the meat and fat of lambs.  Consequently, the claim that fragrant bushes makes Karoo lamb unique could be verified.  The results serve as evidence for the certification of Karoo lamb and justify the protection of its indicator status in the European Union.",
