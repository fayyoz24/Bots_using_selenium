Since 2006, the INVK has been the leading Foundation in the Netherlands focusing on the sharing of knowledge and development of business leaders.\n\nWe bring together colleagues and other like-minded sector-specific peers in a wide range of profit and non-profit sectors. They are strategic leaders, managers and entrepreneurs. Together, they debate strategic challenges, receive innovative information and share views and advice with others from within their sector and the INVK. The result: new solution paths and their application, plus an enhanced network of branch contacts. INVK Members are invited only after an introductory conversation and always agree to complete confidentiality on the topics they discuss at their national forums (Landelijk Overleg) and in smaller meetings (Master Mind groups). In this way, they can continue to develop themselves and their organisation on an ongoing basis and reap long-term results.",
