Always ready to help members with their questions, apply information about memberships, solve problems that occurred while members were using the facilities and engage in social small talk to put members at ease. \n\nDuring the daily shifts it was also necessary to keep track of the stock. This to ensure that all the food and beverages were available at the counter for commercial purposes. Of course the job entailed answering incoming phone calls with sufficient information about the club. As usual cleaning also played a big role (e.g. washing mugs, cleansing the counter and lounge, refilling the coffee machine etc.).\n\nAs from the first of September 2020 the premium club was taken over by Basic Fit. Tasks were fairly the same other than the fact of implementing new membership forms. The installment of several new machines was ensured to improve automation of existing processes (e.g. machines for people to subscribe and get their membership card and clubcard scanners in order to open the door), however this also created the task of helping people using the machines.",

In order to do so it was necessary to maintain contact with photographers, graphic designers and influential people within the fashion industry.\n\nWriting copy for flyers and brochures was one of the main components. These written products are still used today. The flyers are handed out to in-store customers and clients, but are also used during events as a way of advertising. \n\nThe importance of social media in today's society lead to the development of an improvement proposal for the brand's social pages on Facebook and Instagram. This plan was partially implemented by starting a different posting strategy while using the functionalities within the apps. It also included the development of an online Easter contest within Instagram to enhance engagement and following. Taking pictures and writing copy for LinkedIn were also included. \n\nDuring INTERNATIONAL Fashion Weeks the brand had their own fashion show where I was in charge of styling twenty-six models. After researching the upcoming trends for spring/summer 2019 I came up with a concept and made sure it was executed correctly.",
