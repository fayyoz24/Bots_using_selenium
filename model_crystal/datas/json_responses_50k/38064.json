    "summary": "I am passionate about human health and development, and this has firmly shaped my professional career pathway in the Netherlands and abroad. In my different roles as a health practitioner, adviser and currently a scholar, I have been deepening my understanding of how our health interacts with socio-cultural, legal, political and economic structures and how this leads to health inequities. From a long and deep dive into the complexities of HIV care and prevention, I have turned to contentious health issues in more recent years, at the intersection of gender and sexuality studies. I have also become increasingly interested in local politics as a means to contribute as a citizen to the difficult tasks that lie ahead of us in the face of climate change, migration and health emergencies such as COVID-19, and currently chair the board of the D66 democratic party in Delft.",
