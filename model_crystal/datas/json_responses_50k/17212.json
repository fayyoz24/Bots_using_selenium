The paper was written with analytical support by Material Economics, and sets out that while moving to renewables can address 55% of global GHG emissions, to achieve UN climate goals it is imperative to tackle the remaining 45%.\n\nConcentrating on five key areas (cement, plastics, steel, aluminium, and food) Completing the Picture: How the Circular Economy tackles Climate Change illustrates how designing out waste, keeping materials in use, and regenerating farmland can reduce these emissions by 9.3 billion tonnes. That is equivalent to eliminating current emissions from all forms of transport globally.\n\nSee link for paper: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/completing-the-picture-climate-change",
