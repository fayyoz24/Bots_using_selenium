    "summary": "With over two decades of experience, I am a seasoned product strategist and tech entrepreneur. I possess a visionary mindset, driving holistic solutions that deeply resonate with market needs to deliver value to both users and customers.\n\nMy journey spans start-ups, healthcare, entertainment, and corporate sectors, encompassing B2B and B2C landscapes. In the face of uncertainty, I excel at pioneering products from zero to one and leading cross-functional agile teams in dynamic, innovation-driven settings.\n\nMy diverse background empowers me to embrace and influence change, devise unconventional problem-solving approaches, and foster collaboration. Prior to contributing to Elsevier's product team, I founded The Werck Group, an Amsterdam-based human-centric strategy and product consultancy. I also founded and managed a thriving Los Angeles design and innovation agency that delivered best-in-class client services that also spun off several successful lean start-ups and acquisitions.\n\nThroughout my career, I have guided the product journey for global giants such as Twentieth Century Fox, Roche, Sony Networks, and more, spearheading design, UX, and technology strategy for impactful consumer-facing applications. My track record underscores my commitment to innovation and transformative leadership.",
