For this role, I relocated again, this time to the Netherlands, and feel blessed to be able to explore this beautiful country and meet so many amazing people! \n\n> \ud835\ude1e\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35'\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26?\n\nPreviously, I worked with NOKIA in Belgium for 3+ years, where working alongside some amazingly high-skilled engineers and inspiring people, together we successfully delivered some of the most cutting-edge DSL technologies in broadband services which have already benefited more than 10 million homes.\n\nBefore this, my first job as a Software Engineer was with HELIC (ANSYS subsidiary) in Greece for 1 year, where I got hired to implement a solution I had presented in my Master's Thesis research which ended up improving the performance of a company's proprietary product by more than 90%. (Pat on the back!)\n\nApart from being an engineer, I have also been a start-up team member when I helped my 2 brothers set up a trucking business that has become one of the most fast-growing of the ones serving the Greece-Italy transportation line.\n\n> \ud835\ude1c\ud835\ude31 \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude3a?\n\nIn the summer of 2019, I sold everything and embarked on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure in extraordinary destinations and remote tiny islands around South-East Asia! My only carry-on? Just a backpack, a good mood, and a hunger for exploring the unknown! \n\nAfter 1 year of traveling, I came back to Europe (Greece) after being stuck in Thailand for 3 months (not a bad place to get stuck, right?) due to travel restrictions imposed after the \"the-virus\" breakout. \n\nI'll tell you all about it if we ever meet in person!\n\n\ud835\uddd8\ud835\ude05\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2: C++, C, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), UML, Design Patterns, Python Scripting, Linux, High-Performance Computing (HPC), Embedded Systems, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Agile/Scrum, SAFe, POPM.\n\n\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude00: Team-Oriented, Result-Driven, Big-picture thinking, Growth Mindset, Customer-Centric, Adaptability, Communication.",

We describe in detail the strategy for equivalent circuit synthesis. Specifically, starting from numerical data obtained by measurements or simulations, the rational function representation of Y-parameters is found using vector fitting procedure which relocates poles to better positions. Then, an equivalent circuit synthesis method is applied in order to obtain the equivalent reduced-order circuit. Two equivalent circuit synthesis methods are presented in this thesis, the first of which generates an RCG equivalent circuit, whereas the second generates an RLC equivalent circuit. The accuracy and efficiency of these methods is demonstrated through a series of experiments that are presented and analyzed.",

In these iterative solvers, preconditioning techniques for complex-valued matrices are applied which are based on incomplete LU decomposition. Then, a comparative study of ILUK, ILUT, ILUTP and ARMS is presented where we compare their performance in terms of time for computing each of them needed, as well as in terms of the total runtime and the number of iterations needed for the convergence of the iterative solvers. The numerical results are analysed on a specific application area regarding the large complex sparse liner systems obtained from the analysis of power grids of integrated circuits. \u0391 brief comparison between the above iterative solvers and the direct LU solver is also addressed for the aforementioned application area.",
