    "summary": "Allow me to share with you my knowledge on the history and cultural practices of wine and food; all through the lens of hospitality. \n\nWith an educational background at Hotelschool The Hague (BBA), and professionally having fulfilled a Business Operations Manager role at a hospitality consultancy firm, I decided to fully dedicate myself to my longtime passion and interest, namely wine! My wine journey has taken me all over the globe; from working in the finest and most awarded restaurants in the Netherlands, England & Australia to working in vineyards in France and South-Africa. \n\nCurrently I am owner of Wineclub NOTK [eno\u02c8t\u025bka]; a place where we combine a POP-UP Wine Bar concept, wine education as well as consultancy & an online shop where we sell our own imported wines from small domaines in Italy and France. \n\nAlso, I am part of the Association de la Sommelerie Internationale, having passed the exam with gold-level. Currently #2 Best Sommelier of the Netherlands. My goal is to push my knowledge and skills to the highest level and challenge myself in International competitions. Ultimately I would like to give back to the hospitality community by mentoring & guiding future sommeliers.",

Started off as a waiter during the breakfast and lunch/afternoon tea at the Grand Salon Restaurant in the Waldorf Hilton Hotel in London. \n\nAfter two months I got the opportunity to become a trainee supervisor, due to my performance, my persistence and my drive to learn. Delegating a team of 16 people, I was responsible for making employee schedules, forecasting, reservations, dealing with complaints and supervising breakfast, lunch and afternoon service together with two supervisors and my manager. \nDuring my time there, we managed to achieve a number one ranking in Breakfast Satisfaction and Loyalty Scores amongst all Hilton Hotels in London.",

The goal of this event was to raise funds in support of research to cancer. \n\nAs I have lost quite some people in my surroundings to this horrible disease, I felt like it was my duty to step up and contribute my efforts to people in need of cancer treatment. That is why I decided to participate in this event and cycle this mountain twice alongside my father."
