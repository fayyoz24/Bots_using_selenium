The stage can be determined for any desired depth range of the measurement volume. Additionally, the known limitations of the depth of focus striking by light projection techniques will be overcome. During the measurement procedure, an illuminated Ronchi Test in front of a projection lens is moved both in z and x-directions by two vertically arranged linear translation phases. These results in an oblique shift of the projected grating, resulting in an oblique scan of the projected fringe pattern in the measurement volume i.e. the object space. For a well-focused image acquisition, a CCD camera placed on the same z-stage in front of an observation lens takes a series of images of the scene in different z-positions. This focusing allows the use of large apertures and therefore a better exploitation of light. In our assembled sensor, the triangulation Principle basis of 115 mm nearly corresponds to the distance of a person\u2019s pupils. We used MATLAB for unwrapping phase distribution to real world 3D coordinates.",
