    "summary": "Programme Manager YEP: \"Investments in young people are one of the most sustainable investments you can make, because you can 'harvest' this for a long time\".\n\n+++\n\nPreviously: Project Manager YEP Water, Secretary NGO Water Platform and Secretary International Division, Top Sector Water & Maritime. \n\nGlobally too much, too little and too dirty water pose great challenges. The Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP) is convinced that by working together we can contribute to solving these problems. Nationally, but also internationally. Because water doesn\u2019t stop at borders. Within the NWP network private companies, NGO\u2019s, knowledge institutions and governmental organizations collaborate to achieve more impact abroad. The global water challenges offer opportunities for the Dutch water sector, that\u2019s why NWP shares knowledge, organizes matchmaking and increases the sector\u2019s visibility (conferences, missions, etc.). NWP is also co-executor of governmental programmes such as Partner for Water and YEP Programmes.\n\nDo you also want more impact abroad? Send me an invitation to connect!\n\n+++\n\nFormer policy officer for the Multilateral Organisations and Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. As a member of the post-2015 team my focus was on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the post-2015 sustainable development agenda (Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)) and the Financing for Development (FfD) process of the United Nations. Previously I have gained working experience in the field of international relations and sustainable (inclusive) development as an intern at Oxfam Novib as an intern and as a volunteer for the Kumasi Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Ghana.\n\nEducation: BSc Human Geography (Utrecht University) and MSc Human Geography (University of Amsterdam).
