Recent evidence has suggested that hypoxia, which occurs in a majority of cancers, may be a driver of aggressivity and poor outcomes. Understanding the complex interactions intrinsic to hypoxia is critical for understanding what molecular features drive tumor progression and stratifying patient risk for early stages of cancer. Here, we used a multiplexed immunohistochemistry platform to measure the single-cell expression of 29 proteins in a tumor microarray of 252 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples. These data establish NSCLC histology-specific molecular subtypes that dominate tumor samples from patients with poor prognosis. Utilizing a density-based spatial clustering approach, we identified and characterized contiguous regions of hypoxia in tumor tissues. Hypoxic stress in the tissue results in a concurrent average increase of protein expression and decrease in protein pair correlations compared to normoxic tissue. Spatially derived hypoxic features better predicted 5-year survival (AUC=0.72) compared to non-spatially derived features (AUC=0.49) in a held-out test set. Additionally, the total area of defined hypoxic regions was better able to distinguish patients with poor outcomes in a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p=0.024) compared to standard percent positivity measures (p=0.268). Our results highlight the utility of highly multiplexed spatial analysis in understanding complex cancer phenotypes and demonstrate the clinical significance of the spatial organization of phenotypic cancer drivers.",

This heterogeneity drives tumor behaviors ranging from drug resistance to metastasis.  For example, hypoxia may lead to activation of diverse signaling pathways that enable cells to alter their metabolism and undergo EMT.  Historically, studies linking microenvironmental cues, spatial-patterns within tumors and cell signaling has been difficult as technologies for measuring both spatial patterns and protein expression (e.g. immunofluorescence on pathology sections) have been limited to measuring 3-4 protein markers. Using data from a newly developed highly multiplexed immunofluorescence platform, we are able examine links between hypoxic regions of tumors and dozens of proteins. I will present; 1) an algorithm for segmenting hypoxic regions through spatial density in multiplexed lung cancer image data; 2) an analysis of the differential expression and correlation between hypoxic and normoxic conditions; and 3) the usefulness of the spatial component in stratifying patient survival.",

Unfortunately, the multi-omic analysis required to discover important disease mechanisms is exponentially more challenging than single-ome analysis and thus is intractable for the majority of the biological community. To address the challenges of multi-omic analysis we are developing an open-source workflow platform: the Workflow INstance Generation and Selection MultiOmic Discovery Engine (WINGS-MDE).  WINGS-MDE will enable the creation, management, distribution and effective use of multi-omic workflows. We aim to 1) create semantic workflows for performing multi-omic analysis; 2) Develop a multi-omic discovery meta-workflow engine; and 3) develop an inter-lab workflow repository that supports the annotation and dissemination of public datasets. By developing tools to reduce the barrier to integrating multiple types of heterogenous data we anticipate that it will become more possible for the broader biological community to uncover the mechanistic consequences of genetic mutations on biochemical function and accordingly the better understand the complex relationship between the genome and the functioning or malfunctioning of cells. \n",

Aggressivity is commonly acquired though tumoral microheterogeneity resulting in spatially-constrained ecological niches in which available resources are low. Characterization of hypoxia, an ecological niche of particular interest, is important in both understanding differential cancer progression and for accurately prognosing patients. Here we have developed a novel algorithm for leveraging spatial context to identify hypoxia in the tissue across a cohort of 254 non-small cell lung cancer samples. We utilize a hyperplex imaging platform to simultaneously quantify 29 protein biomarkers to evaluate how hypoxic stress affects key lung cancer pathways and overall survival. Our analysis reveals a differential response to hypoxia across histological subtypes and demonstrates the clinical utility of a spatially-aware approach.",

The coupling of single-cell measurement technologies with algorithms, such as t-sne and SPADE, have enabled deep investigation of tumor heterogeneity. However, such techniques only capture molecular heterogeneity and do not enable the quantification nor visualization of intercellular interactions . They additionally do not allow the visualization of ecological niches that are critical to understanding tumor behavior. Novel computational tools to quantify and visualize spatial patterns in the tumor microenvironment are critically needed. Here, we take a tumor ecology perspective  to examine how predation, mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism may impact tumor development and spatial patterning.  We  additionally quantify local spatial heterogeneity and the emergent global spatial behavior of the models using geostatistics. By visualizing emergent spatial patterns we demonstrate the  potential utility of a geostatistical analysis in differentiating amongst cell-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment. These studies introduce both an ecological framework for characterizing inter-cellular interactions in cancer and a novel way of quantifying and visualizing spatial patterns in cancer.",

Tumor evolution is significantly influenced by the poorly understood ecological processes between cancer cells and their environment; namely the spatial interactions between cell types. Applying ecological methodologies to the tumor microenvironment will help uncover spatially-influenced mechanisms that differentiate between tumors that progress and those that remain indolent. To help elucidate spatial relationships we 1) use agent-based modeling to model tumor growth and progression under four different ecological contexts; predation, commensalism, mutualism, and parasitism; 2) apply spatial statistics to quantify the spatial heterogeneity on a local and global scale; and 3) visualize the spatial patterns of the tumor microenvironment that lead to tumor progression. We show that the small differences in local spatial phenomena are reflected in the emergent global spatial behavior in each of our well-defined ecological models. To demonstrate utility in more complex systems, we validated these spatial patterns and show that they can separate patients in terms of overall survival in a cohort of 252 lung cancer FFPE samples in a multiplexed histopathology data set. The results of this research show that spatial statistics can differentiate between small changes in local spatial interactions in a well-defined tumor ecology context and can be directly applied in computer vision analysis or pathomic analysis of histopathology data to provide better prognostic power.

The algorithm presented here leverages the spatial organization of cells in the tissue to segment regions of interest in histopathology samples. We employed this algorithm to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the expression of proteins known to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer and on patient outcome. However, our algorithm are extendable to any histological analysis using tissue samples for any disease phenotype for which there is a measured proxy.

Recent evidence has suggested that hypoxia, which occurs in a majority of cancers, may be a driver of aggressivity and poor outcomes. Understanding the complex interactions\nintrinsic to hypoxia is critical for understanding what molecular features drive tumor progression and stratifying patient risk for early stages of cancer. Here, we used a multiplexed immunohistochemistry (IHC) platform to measure the single-cell expression of 29 proteins in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 252 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples. These data establish NSCLC histology-specific molecular subtypes that dominate tumor samples from patients with poor prognosis. Utilizing a density-based spatial clustering approach, we identified and characterized contiguous regions of hypoxia in tumor tissues. Hypoxic stress in the tissue results in a concurrent average increase of protein expression and decrease in protein pair correlations compared to normoxic tissue. Spatially derived features better predicted 5-year survival (AUC = 0.72) compared to non-spatially derived features (AUC = 0.49) in a held-out test set. Additionally, the total area of defined hypoxic regions was better able to separate the patient population in a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p=0.024) compared to standard percent positivity measures (p=0.268). Our results highlight the utility of highly multiplexed spatial analysis in understanding complex cancer phenotypes and demonstrate the clinical significance of the spatial organization of phenotypic cancer drivers.",

Hypoxic stress can lead to gene silencing through hypermethylation, growth of vasculature supporting proliferation through angiogenesis, and intravasation and potential metastasis through extracellular matrix remodeling. Understanding the complex interactions intrinsic to hypoxia in the tissue is limited by current immunohistochemical techniques that can only profile a small number of proteins at a time. In recent years, immunostaining platforms capable of measuring the in situ expression of dozens of proteins simultaneously have been developed. The critical barrier has now become developing computational methods to analyze these new multi-dimensional data types to understand complex tissue level alterations in the heterogenous tumor microenvironment. Toward this goal, I will present an algorithm to segment regions of lung cancer tissue under hypoxic stress and an analysis elucidating the molecular underpinnings of hypoxia in lung cancer. With this work we aim to facilitate treatment and prognostic decisions through more sophisticated tissue-level biomarkers and develop greater understanding of the phenotypes that drive lung cancer.

Historically, studies linking microenvironmental cues, spatial-patterns within tumors and cell signaling has been difficult as technologies for measuring both spatial patterns and protein expression (e.g. immunofluorescence on pathology sections) have been limited to measuring 3-4 protein markers. Using data from a newly developed highly multiplexed immunofluorescence platform, we are able examine links between hypoxic regions of tumors and dozens of proteins.

WINGS-MDE will enable the creation, management, distribution and effective use of multi-omic workflows. We aim to 1) create semantic workflows for performing multi-omic analysis; 2) develop a multi-omic discovery meta-workflow engine; and 3) develop an inter-lab workflow repository that supports the annotation and dissemination of public datasets and workflows. The WINGS-MDE system is first being applied to fully reproduce an integrated proteogenomic characterization of colorectal cancer.

To better quantify cellular interactions and the tumor behaviors they influence, I modeled predatory, mutualistic, commensal, and parasitic ecological interactions in a tumor context using an agent-based model of tumor growth. I demonstrated the utility of spatial statistics and their emergent properties to identify tumor phenomena and to differentiate between small changes in single cell interactions.\n\nProject: Computer vision-based analysis of hypoxia.\nHypoxia, a lack of oxygen in the tissue resulting from diffusion limitations, drives tumor progression through a variety of mechanisms. Appropriately identifying hypoxia in the tissue will lead to better prognostic power. Leveraging spatial cellular density, I developed an algorithm to identify regions of hypoxia in histopathology data. In collaboration with GE Global Research using a pre-commercial hyperplex immunohistochemistry platform, this work resulted in the discovery of a novel spatial biomarker that was validated in multiple cancers across multiple platforms. Additionally, I discovered differential responses to hypoxic stress between subtypes of lung cancer.\n\nProject: Arbitration of results in reproducible workflows.\nWhen exploring research questions, there are often many possible algorithms and parameterizations that can be employed to answer those questions. This project aimed to give confidence to a proposed hypothesis by combining the results of parallel workflows, arbitrating between different results, and providing provenance for reproducibility. This early-stage work was conducted in collaboration with Yolanda Gil's group at the Information Sciences Institute at University of Southern California on the WINGS semantic workflow system.",

            "description": "I served as a student mentor for an incoming PhD student in the Biosciences at Stanford University for two Summers.\n\nAbout the ADVANCE program:\nhttps://biosciences.stanford.edu/current-students/diversity/advance/\nStanford Biosciences\u2019 ADVANCE Summer Institute is an intensive 8-week transition program for incoming graduate students from diverse backgrounds. The ADVANCE Summer Institute evolved from a similar program created by the Biomedical Association for the Interests of Minority Students (BioAIMS) in 2010. ADVANCE seeks to prepare students for a successful graduate career at Stanford and we look forward to building on the successes of the past two years.\n\nThe summer before a matriculating student\u2019s first year offers an excellent opportunity to transition to graduate school without the usual whirlwind of activity that begins in the fall. Through ADVANCE we will facilitate the participants\u2019 smooth transition into their first year, laying the foundation for a successful and rewarding graduate experience.\n\nADVANCE provides participants with an opportunity to begin research in their home program a quarter early. Participants will participate in small literature discussion groups led by faculty and postdocs and attend workshops that will support their successful transition to graduate school. Additionally, they will participate in mentoring and social activities hosted by BioAIMS and SBSA as a mechanism for fostering a sense of belonging and community. Support for ADVANCE participants will continue throughout their first year and beyond through mentoring, tutoring and research update meetings.\n\nADVANCE is motivated by the Biosciences\u2019 commitment to be fully inclusive and supportive of all students, and by the belief that a diverse graduate student body enhances the quality of the educational experience for all students."
