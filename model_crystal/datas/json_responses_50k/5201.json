    "summary": "As a dedicated and proactive individual, I approach new challenges with enthusiasm, aiming to create a positive impact in every endeavor. My background in childcare and ongoing university experience have equipped me with strong communication, organizational, and problem-solving skills that align well with people-oriented positions. With a relentless drive for both personal and professional growth, I am confident in my ability to effectively contribute to a collaborative, team-oriented environment.\n\nMy journey from Brazil to Belgium at the age of 18, where I worked in childcare while learning the Dutch language, followed by my move to the Netherlands, reflects my dedication to personal development and cultural immersion. These experiences have notably strengthened my interpersonal and cultural awareness skills.\n\nI am currently in my third year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in Psychology at Maastricht University, known for its problem-based learning approach and international atmosphere. At the same time, I am undertaking a minor programme at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I aim to learn more about Work & Organisational Psychology.",
