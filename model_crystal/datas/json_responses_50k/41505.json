    "summary": "Applied anthropologist operating in the field of SRHR, public health and gender-justice. Within this field, I have acquired various working experiences in the domains HIV/AIDS prevention and harm reduction, comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) and gender-based violence (GBV). Other topics I have worked on include young people's socio-economic empowerment, technical/vocational skills development (TVET) and inclusive development. In the work that I do, I specifically focus on the themes of inclusion, intersectionality, power dynamics and meaningful and inclusive youth participation (MIYP). I take a particular interest in the (unintended) effects of power imbalances within the international development sector. \n\nI have gained academic and working experience in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique, as well as in the Netherlands through various international partnerships in Africa, Asia and the MENA region. \n\nThroughout these experiences, I have engaged in applied research, monitoring and evaluation (M&E / PMEL), country programme management, reporting and reviewing, proposal development, ToC development and validation, fundraising, the organisation of (on- & offline) events, facilitation of workshops and trainings, and communication. Hereby, I have acquired experiences within all different stages of project development, as well as wide variety of disciplines within the field. \n\nWherever I can, I try to add a level of creativity to my work by combining it with my personal interests in critical journalism, photography, film and writing.",

It advocates for social change and informed decision-making regarding young womens and men's (sexual) health and family planning. The local project implementation is part of a larger partnership with Global Affairs Canada, Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). Furthermore, I am partly involved in the Citizen's Voice programme in Yemen (and occasionally Syria), focussing on social cohesion, inclusive governance, peace-building and gender-justice.\n\nOther responsibilities include: \n- fundraising and proposal development for various projects in Yemen and Syria\n- desk research on various topics (e.g. the intersection of GBV and COVID-19 in Yemen)\n- proofreading and editing activity reports\n\nAbout RNW: Our mission is to identify young people\u2019s needs and to bring young people together in user-owned digital communities where they can safely engage on taboos and sensitive topics and generate strong stories for advocacy to unleash their potential for social change. The two main areas of focus are on 1) Social Cohesion and Inclusive Governance (SCIG) and 2) Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) in restrictive settings.\n\nhttps://www.rnw.org/",
