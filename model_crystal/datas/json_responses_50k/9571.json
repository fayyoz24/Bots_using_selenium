    "summary": "A young research professional who is talented in working in a mixed method research environment. I have a research background in political science data analyses and history. My passion is in combining many different sources together to find cross-sector insights to aid decision making or makers. Whether form web data venders, databases, interviews or political or historical primary source documents. The chance to explore and find multiple angles to any research questions allows me to not only write good reports but also employ my dyslexia thinking ability to its best ability to find the insights the majority will miss. Corporation and team work is key to mixed method research and thus, has by association led me to develop skills in information, project and stokehold management as well as presenting and conveying complex ideas clearly.",
