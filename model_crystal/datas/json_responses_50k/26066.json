    "summary": "I have been interested in computers since I was a kid and I still am to this day. I have always been tinkering and writing utility programs to help me with day to day tasks.\nI decided to build more on my interests by doing a Computer Science bachelor at University of Twente. I have learned a lot over the years I've been here and I also had the opportunity to become a Teaching Assistant after my second year of studies, which has taught me a lot and improved my soft and hard skills.\nAt University of Twente I had the opportunity to work in teams with people from all around the world, and I learned to successfully lead and work in a team. We have developed all kinds of software: board games, web applications, networking protocols, embedded systems and even our own programming language.\n\nMy biggest achievements at University of Twente are the creation of a Discord bot that allowed remote education for Module 2 during the COVID pandemic, and the research paper I wrote as part of my graduation project, which was later presented at the international conference CNSM 2022 and published at IEEE Xplore.\n\nI have experience with development of almost any sort, I have worked with databases and different types of programming languages: Procedural, Functional and Object Oriented. My favorite programming language is Java and I am proficient in it. I have experience with Linux, Windows, low level and high level programming, and I am a big fan of efficient code and optimizations. I always have the complexity of the code in the back of my mind. I have developed numerous personal projects in Java and Python, that were deployed on Raspberry Pi and Desktop.",

The aim of the system is to create heterogeneous teams, since they are\nmore effective according to research.\n\nMy role in this project was to establish user requirements, interview potential clients, conduct research, design the system, implement the matchmaking part, and manage the team.\n\nThis project was done as part of my graduation at University of Twente, and attempted to solve a real problem at the university. Our team was later hired by the university to maintain and extend the functionality of the application.",
