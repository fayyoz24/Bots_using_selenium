My projects where hugely varied, from schools, offices, hotels and even a ship navigation school. Due to the size of the company I was required to be organised enough to work between three teams and multiple projects, setting my own deadlines to make sure each team met their deadlines on time. I attended meetings, site visits and social events with the team leaders to help them with clients first-hand. However the biggest challenge for me during my internship was that I was the only employee who was english, herein I learnt a new skill; refining my communication skills to discuss projects with those who didn\u2019t speak my language that well and on top of this also learning some Dutch in return, a skill which I hope to work on further in the future.",
