It provided extensive insight into Singapore\u2019s corporate social responsibility, sustainability practices, and outlook. After only a five-month company acquisition phase, we managed to arrange a variety of exciting and insightful company visits, including Ingenico, Roedel & Partner, PwC, Aquila Capital, Medtronic, CDL, Ginkgo, Peri, SAP, and Altman Solon. The different visits were structured around the three guiding themes of CSR, economic, ecological, and social. Besides company visits, we also connected with the business club of the National University of Singapore, and networked with Singapore-based Alumni."

Founded in 1975, it now has more than 72,000 members in more than 1,730 campuses worldwide. \nEducators guide and business leaders support the projects that are started within these campuses. Through entrepreneurial commitment, projects are started that impact and improve the lives of many - so far more than 1.3 million lives have been positively impacted.\n\nThroughout my time at Enactus, I have been part of the initiative at the University of Mannheim, actively supporting the project \"Blauherz\" which was aiming to impact the lives of wheelchair users by providing them with clothing that was especially tailored for their needs. Additionally, the production of the clothes was conducted by workers with disabilities at the \"Pilgerhaus\" in Weinheim, providing them with secure and fair employment.\nAt \"Blauherz\" I was mainly supporting with the social media and IT departments. I was involved in the creation of the website and webshop that we were able to launch during this time. Other than that, I also contributed to the overall strategy and represented \"Blauherz\", e.g. at a fair for rehabilitation, therapy, care and inclusion."
