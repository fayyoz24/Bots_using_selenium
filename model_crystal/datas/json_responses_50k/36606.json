The goal was to increase the use of reusable cups and pots in the Cristal\u00b4s stores, making the customers asking their beverages or ice creams in reusable items. This simple gesture reduces sig-nificantly the environmental impacts.\n\n-The project shows that when fully implemented, this policy could save Cristal more than $30 k per year in packaging costs. The in-store reusable pilot test showed that noteworthy environmental and economic benefits could be achieved from even minor changes in store operations. A reusable cup and pots may be used, on average, 1,000 times or more (and is generally designed for 3,000 uses), the environmental benefits of using reusable items in terms of reduced energy use, air and water pollution, and solid waste can be tremendous.\n\n\u2022 Project successfully implemented: remains the use of reusable cups and pots.",

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the UN are a crucial step towards a more just and sustainable future for all.\n\nThese goals cover a wide range of issues, from poverty eradication to gender equality, clean energy, health, education, and more. What's more, they are all interconnected and dependent on one another, making it imperative that we work together to achieve them.\n\nThat's why the \"Truck Knowing the SDGs\" project is so important. It's a historic itinerary that empowers individuals to become the protagonists of the 2030 agenda. Through the project, we can reach communities, cities, and regions with information about the SDGs, promoting awareness and active participation in the quest for a better world.\n\nThe project is especially important for reaching those who may not have access to information about the SDGs, and for showing how each of us can contribute to their achievement. It encourages the creation of networks and partnerships so that we can all work together towards a more just and sustainable world."
