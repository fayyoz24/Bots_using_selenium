    "summary": "I'm an opportunist, an adviser, passionate about my work and I always strive to help out my customers in the best way possible. I'm great at finding new customers and starting new relations but I excel at building long term relationships. I'm not your average sales representative as selling \"no\" is always a possibility in my book. I always take the long term into consideration and I strongly believe that this is the best way to achieve my goals. I see myself more as an adviser than a sales representative in that regard.\n\nSpecialism: Accountancy Software, Account Management and Customer Relationship Management.",

Starting januari 2016 I stopped writing news articles and started focusing more on reviews, previews and special articles. The planning of the larger articles also came to me at this point. I created a monthly planning on the larger articles and kept track of this planning by working together with the other editors which was a team of eight. \n\nBesides the editorial work I also visit large game-events on a regular basis to get information on the newest games. I have visited the E3 in Los Angeles and the Gamescom in Cologne in the past. \n\nStarting July 2018 I have taken up the work as PR Manager for N1ntendo. In this role I uphold contact with all of our press-relations which include publishers, developers and press-companies.\n\nStarting January 2019 I took up the role as Editor in Chief at N1ntendo.\n\nFrom 2019 till launch in july 2021 I worked with a team of websitedevelopers to create a new home and branding for N1ntendo. We managed to launch a new website and branding in July 2021 (https://www.n1up.nl/). After transfering over to N1-UP I concluded my work and at the end of 2021 I gave up my roles to others within the team to step down."
