Sharing this common interest, and having lots of fun and intense work made us propose a concept service where local people put challenges to the tourists, giving them a way to connect with the travel destination by providing an authentic experience. It seems that humour, fun, stereotyping, having awesome people from Live|work with awesome offices to work at and distracting view of Rotterdam at our feet, an insightful mentor and, of course, a chicken in your presentation can get you a long way, cause we were actually selected as \"best service design\" proposal for the Rotterdam Jam!
