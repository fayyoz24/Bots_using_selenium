    "summary": "I have 8 years of professional experience designing and implementing web applications and RESTful APIs. My language of choice is Python (2.7 or 3.x) which I have been programming in for over a decade, but I'm always open to learning new technologies. I also have some limited experience with front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (and it's many child libraries/frameworks such as React, AngularJS, JQuery, Clojurescript, D3.js, etc...).\n\nWhile I originally learned to code in the functional paradigm using a LISP derivative, I am well versed in Object Oriented design as well. Both are powerful tools that tend to lend themselves to different applications. \n\nSpeaking of tools, I know my way around a UNIX command line and have experience interacting with Docker, Jenkins, JIRA, Review Board, and github/gitlab. I'm enough of a git expert to have mentored junior developers on the difference between rebase and merge, but I still have to look up man pages from time to time for less common commands.\n\nMy wife has accepted an opportunity in the Netherlands; as such I am only considering remote positions and positions in the Netherlands. I will need visa sponsorship to work for a Dutch company.",

I worked on this project alone; taking it from feature discovery/design all the way to implementation and maintenance.\n\nThe project uses these technologies: Linux, MySQL, Django, JQuery, CSS, HTML.\n\nUnfortunately, this project is full of sensitive client information, so I can't link to it. Eventually, I might put up a generic version of the site as a tech demo, but it's not a huge priority at the moment.",
