    "summary": "With a product design background and a PhD in Design Creativity, my research and educational focus is on the support of designers in creative problem solving. \nIn 2016, I have obtained my PhD with the thesis \u201cDecoding designers\u2019 inspiration process\u201d, which dealt with the influence of external stimuli on the creative work of designers. Stimuli, what we may call inspiration sources, can have a strong impact in designers\u2019 ideas, and subsequently, affect innovation \u2013 positively or negatively.  Thus, the aim of my PhD research was to support designers to better understand and implement the most effective practices of inspiration use, in order to promote creativity and innovation. \n\nCurrently, I am exploring the role of inspiration sources and creativity in service & product design and at the collaborative level. I am also interested in how inspirational information triggers co-evolution of the problem and solution space. \nI am interested in creativity and innovation, inspiration and information, random stimuli, curiosity, surprise, design thinking, design methods, design methodology and visual thinking.\n\nAs an educator, I have been coaching students at the bachelor and master level. I have been involved in design-studio courses (PO3 Fuzzy Front End; Bachelor End Project; and Joined Master Project), design-theory courses (Design Theory and Methodology), and research-based courses (Creating in project teams; SPD research project). \nCurrently, I am the coordinator of the course SPD Media, which aims to support students from the Strategic Product Design master in the development of their expressive skills. In this project-based course, students work individually to explore and improve a set of media skills, which could include different types of sketching, prototyping, digital design, animation, video, among others. Therefore, this course aims to bring expressiveness to SPD-related knowledge, in order to improve how their work is presented and communicated to others.  \n",
