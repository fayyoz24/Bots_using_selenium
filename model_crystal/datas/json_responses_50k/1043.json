    "summary": "My passion lies with innovative materials: all the way from research, testing and optimization, to manufacturing and the application in a real-life setting. I would say I am quite an active student, with a lot of experience in projects, meetings and organizational work. My strengths during teamwork lie in my communicative skills, proactive and organized mindset and empathy towards others. \n\nOutside of my study I enjoy taking part in student activism such as organizing the study trip of my study association to Japan and organizing a lustrum celebration for my sorority. \n\nAs a person, I like to know how things work, but I find it crucial not to lose track of how to actually implement the idea and stay practical. I am not one who will talk your ears off, however, I will not be shy to give my opinion when I know what I am talking about or when I\u2019m enthusiastic about something. \n\nFeel free to contact me on LinkedIn for new opportunities!",
