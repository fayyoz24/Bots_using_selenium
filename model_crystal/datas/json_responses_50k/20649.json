As the IB teaching approach emphasis is on making connections, inquiry, and student-centeredness. The IB teaching beliefs includes the words global, cultural, whole student and sense of social responsibility. The tools the IB encourages in effective teaching were identified as reflection, collaboration, assessment, and adaptability. Commonalities among the IB documentation, focus groups, survey results, and a review of the broader educational literature include: focus on the learner, and a combination of creativity, fairness, flexibility, openness, caring, and knowledge. Nonetheless, international mindedness as a teaching perspective is more strongly emphasized in IB teaching. By combining this quality with inquiry-based teaching and social responsibility, the IB has created its own unique teaching identity. Put simply, if IB teachers could be meta-tagged by the words that best describe their attributes, perspectives and practices, they would be tagged with inquiry, global, whole student, connections, social responsibility, creative, and flexible.\nlooking forwards for years to come, education is an endless road..",
