    "summary": "Nuclear power, long derided by vast swaths of the public, represents one of the best solutions to climate change.  As the world grapples with the challenge of decarbonizing electricity generation, industry, and transport, the benefits of nuclear energy are becoming more evident.  Governments, business, and investors have taken notice.   Many have taken action by greenlighting nuclear new build projects or investing in start-up technologies.   \n\nDespite the renewed enthusiasm in nuclear, there remains a significant knowledge gap.  Criticality Thinking fills this gap.   How safe is nuclear? What benefits does nuclear have over other forms of power generation?  Why can\u2019t we use only wind and solar? What are some of the persistent misconceptions about nuclear? How can I invest in nuclear? What\u2019s the difference between Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and advanced reactors?  What kind of fuel do nuclear plants use? Who makes it? How secure is the supply chain?  Where do policymakers stand on nuclear?  Is this all just a passing fad?",

Putin became president of Russia and Lord Robertson was NATO Secretary-General, they agreed that NATO and Russia should dial down the animosity towards one another.  As a start, the NATO Information Office in Moscow was opened with the mission to explain the role of NATO to the Russia public.  As NATO was still a four letter word in Russia, this was not an easy task.  With the help of an amazing Russian staff we managed to build strong relationships with MFA, MOD and many academic institutions across Russia.  When the office opened, Russian public opinion hated NATO.  By the time I left, public opinion viewed NATO as a fish out of water--a Cold War relic searching for a new purpose in world facing  terrorism and asymmetrical warfare. Progress!",
