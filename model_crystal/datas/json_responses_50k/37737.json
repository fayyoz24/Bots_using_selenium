Alongside with McKinsey Company we closely worked with customers understanding their pain points, creating personas, validating hypothesis and establishing KPIs. Together we became a customer oriented Agile team, responding to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical feedback. We strive to build properly tested product increments within short iterations with the opportunity to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. ",
