    "summary": "8+ years of experience in a broad range of high-risk and low-risk medical devices (both hardware/software and software-only products) and In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD). I am particularly experienced in working on innovative devices that fall into grey-areas of medical regulations, where the exact regulatory requirements are not well established or unclear. The experience I\u2019ve built in my former R&D role gives me the additional advantage of understanding both the technical aspects of a device as well as the regulatory implications, so that I can provide practical, real-world, sustainable guidance to the organization on developing safe and reliable products minimizing time to market.",

The platelet counter is connected to a normal laptop where the platelet counter software application runs that controls the platelet counter and does all the image processing.",

            "description": "Edocald is an early mouth and throat cancer detection system. \n\nThe goal is to differentiate pre-cancerous lesions from a multitude of other red, white, or ulcerated lesions that also occurs in the oral cavity. Most oral lesions are benign, but many have an appearance that may be confused with a malignant lesion, and some previously considered benign are now classified as premalignant because they have been statistically correlated with subsequent cancerous changes. Conversely, some malignant lesions seen in an early stage may be mistaken for a benign change. So for our system we are targeting very high sensitivity and specificity. Any oral lesion that does not regress spontaneously or respond to the usual therapeutic measures should be considered potentially malignant until histologically shown to be benign. A period of 2 to 3 weeks is considered an appropriate period of time to evaluate the response of a lesion to treatment. When our system takes a second image of the patient we can overlay the images and see if lesions from first image are still present or if new lesions have appeared. When lesions are present in both images and are identified as pre-malignant or malignant then a definitive diagnosis is warranted (biopsy). Our objective in this project is to use the results of the research to build and validate the demonstrator in a clinical setting and subsequently to commercialise the first low cost screening tool for early detection of oral cancers. \n\nThe project is being funded by the 7 th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, grant agreement number 605254, by the European Union.",

The monitor tracks your head and helmet position and provides you with tactile or acoustic feedback when you are out of your optimal aerodynamic position. Before using the monitor it should be calibrated towards your optimal aerodynamic cycling position. For the best result the calibration should take place in a wind tunnel with the help of aerodynamic experts. But it works just as well when you visit a training center or shop with experienced professionals to help you find that ideal aero position. The monitor aims at making you aware of your head position while riding, and guiding you towards that sweet spot where you cheat the wind as best as possible.",

            "description": "The Thrombospin project enables full automatic platelet extraction for platelet function testing using LTA. The ThromboSpin is an automatic device for platelet separation out of whole blood. The separated platelets are used for platelet function testing via the standard Light Transmission Aggregometry [LTA] method and counted to quantify the obtained platelet concentration, which enhances the accuracy of the LTA measurement. Platelet aggregation testing measures the ability of various agonists to platelets to induce in vitro activation and platelet-to-platelet activation. Classically Born aggregometry uses platelet rich plasma [PRP]. In the Born aggregometer, PRP is stirred in a cuvette at 37\u00b0C and the cuvette sits between a light course and a photocell. When an agonist is added the platelets aggregate and absorb less light and so the transmission increases and this is detected by the photocell. LTA test takes about 30 minutes. ThromboSpin is a controlled table top device with disposable blood separation containers. The system is intended to be used in a clinical setting by qualified professionals for obtaining PRP and PPP from whole blood and counting platelet concentrations in platelet rich plasma (PRP) from a sample of one of this fluid",

The challenging mission is to make as many cars on the road (yet) considerably more economical and, consequently, save substantial costs and make them emit less CO2. A driver taking part in daily traffic often goes from \u2018start to stop\u2019, time and time again. Nobody spontaneously switches off the engine between times in a traffic-jam, when waiting at a roundabout or in heavy urban traffic. Installation of the \u2018start2stop\u2019 system in the car reduces unnecessary fuel consumption. Henceforth, the car will automatically switch off the engine as soon as the driver stops and will restart when the driver wants to drive on.",
