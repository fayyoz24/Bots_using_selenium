    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic professional who strongly believes in the power of connections and the collective pursuit of a world that is more just, equal and kind to all. With this motto in mind, I aim to actively contribute to finding sustainable solutions to the social challenges that we face nowadays. \n \nThroughout my professional experience I have transitioned between communication, public policy and cultural production, experimenting, at times, also with creative and technical positions inside the art world. In total I can offer over ten years of relevant practice divided in the mentioned areas. Five years were dedicated to coordinating internal communication departments; developing activities such as ghostwriting; conducting research and writing institutional reports. In the cultural sector my professional experience was also extensive and more diverse, throughout eight years I developed competencies in project and process management and also in policy analysis, development and evaluation. These capacities were shaped inside governmental cultural departments in the States of S\u00e3o Paulo and Goi\u00e1s (Brazil).\n\nMy identification with the cultural area comes from a profound respect and belief in its power to transform. Therefore, empowering the arts and culture has been both an inspiration and a target.  I am proud to have been formed under the reality of the cultural sector and I am confident that it provided me strong skills, such as resilience, that empower me, personally and professionally, wherever I go. \n\nI am a realistic and acute planner, that likes to be exhaustively prepared for the unexpected inevitable events. Passionate about strategy and looking for opportunities that encourage people to strive for innovation. Patient and therefore good in mediating processes and dealing with different stakeholders. Truly convinced that good evidence-based data is essential for public policy, but it can only be optimal once it is refined by listening to the ones directly benefiting from it and understanding their specific contexts. Since forever curious and creative, and confident that there is always room for both.\n \nIn a way, I identify myself as someone that makes interdisciplinary connections and brings specific attention to blind spots where conventional thinking is applied. I am aspiring to contribute to organisations that value diversity, team collaboration and personal growth, but also provide opportunities for deep and individual work, since I believe that there is where I best express my analytical and thinking skills.  \n",
