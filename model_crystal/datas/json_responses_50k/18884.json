    "summary": "I believe that we build the world we want our children to live in, based on what we ourselves have learned. This is also my approach to any work.\n\nTo me, Data Science is the study of the past to improve in the future. It can create tools and software to assist us in making choices better than others made before us through learning from our predecessors' successes and failures. \n\nI started my career with the study of applied mathematics and astro-physics, but soon changed to Computer sciences and applied mathematics, since I felt I can influence the lives of people more through the use of software applications. \n\nAfter my bachelor studies I took one year off to work before continuing with a Masters degree. This gave me valuable information about the industry and what can be relevant for further studies. My masters degree was simultaneous with working as a Scheduler of Timetables. I found this to be a very fulfilling job where I learned many valuable soft-skills, such as Expectation management, Customer Service communication, Problem solving and Documentation writing. \n\nMy years as part of the Voortrekker organization taught me a great love of nature and will to help people. This passion encouraged me to pursue a job in that has the potential to affect humanity and the environment on a large scale.",
