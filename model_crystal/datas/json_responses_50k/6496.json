On the evening of 20 January 2016 the opening of the Dutch Presidency took place with a high-level dinner co-organised by Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, celebrating its 100 years anniversary, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. On this evening the Dutch EU Presidency was introduced and a unique cooperation between the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and the Dutch National Ballet was presented. \n\nOn 21 January 2016 the discussion on the future aviation strategy took place. The discussion focused on boosting the competitiveness of EU aviation. It was an inspirational session by panels dedicated to the three themes of connectivity, innovation and smart regulation. Participants  were European Commissioner for Transport, Transport Ministers, Members of European Parliament and CEOs of the European aviation sector. \n\nIt was an interesting and wonderful experience to be part of the oranisation team for this high-level aviation event!",

Individually, I chose my design direction and developed an application for smartphones and tablets in which osteoarthritis patients can motivate each other to move more by doing activities together.  Since Philips was interested in my design of the MOOVs application, it was placed under embargo until Nov 2013.

The interventional specialists work in uncomfortable work positions that can lead to occupational hazards. I generated ideas and concepts to decrease physical complaints in the neck, back, knees and feet of the physicians. My chosen concept was elaborated into a final design of the X-eRgo. Finally I made a working model which was tested by the interventional specialists during image guided procedures. The design serves as a relief and support to improve the current work environment for interventional specialists.",
