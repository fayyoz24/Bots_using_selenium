    "summary": "Recently, I completed my master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Twente and currently I am looking for a next challenge. \n\nI am mainly interested in the intersect of process engineering and chemistry. My main motivations are to enhance the sustainability of the (chemical) industry and to reduce emissions. With the knowledge I have gained during my studies, I hope to contribute to that in a future position. \n\nDuring my studies and internship, I have gained experience in chemical process design; process simulation with software like Aspen Plus and MATLAB and process performance analysis with regard to sustainability and plant economics. Moreover, I have also followed chemistry-related subjects \u2013 like organic chemistry and electrochemistry \u2013 to be able to better understand the underlying chemistry. During my master\u2019s assignment, I have applied this knowledge in the laboratory. \n\nI have finished both my master\u2019s and my bachelor\u2019s degree with an average grade of above an 8,0/10, of which I obtained my bachelor\u2019s degree Cum Laude. Besides that, I have gained experience abroad during my internship in Germany and my exchange semester in Norway. Furthermore, I have given a keynote lecture at the CHISA conference in Prague and was awarded a Young Talent Award by the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities in the first year of my bachelor\u2019s. \n\nDo you have an open position that fits my profile?
