    "summary": "I am a seasoned senior marketing and transformation leader with 25+ years of sales and marketing experience in the IT industry. I pride myself on my ability to get things done \u2013 within and across functional teams \u2013 by being a trusted advisor. My approach builds bridges between sales (the voice of the customer) and marketing (our value offer for customers). This is how I build teams, drive collaboration and lead growth. \n\nI began my journey as a Citrix integration partner, winning the Citrix Benelux Best Marketing Programme Award twice. That led to my joining Citrix as the Benelux Marketing Manager. Over the course of almost 20 years, I\u2019ve held various field and demand marketing roles of increasing scope and impact \u2013 from Benelux, to Western Europe to EMEA-wide.  The last 6 years during my Citrix tenure, I headed up the Citrix EMEA field marketing organisation \u2013 a world class team of modern marketing professionals where data and metric driven behaviour creates digital marketing generated demand. \n\nToday I am Head of Check Point Field Marketing EMEA as a transformational leader and apply the business values in my daily work whilst migrating the field marketing team to a full service oriented business unit embracing all instruments available to the modern field marketer.\n\nOver time I learned what is important to me. My career journey made me experience the values of integrity, humility, respect and conviction. Those values are important for me and are a guide through my professional journey. As a passionate team player, I love to work with people sharing the same values and achieving goals together. Additionally, I need an environment where being curious, taking ownership and accountability are in the organisation's\u2019 DNA. \n\nKey to my success is optimizing and accelerated contribution to our sales pipeline by developing and executing an aligned field marketing strategy and operating budget across EMEA.",

The WPT with participants from Cura\u00e7ao, Cuba, Taiwan and the Netherlands and media coverage in these countries as well as in the USA and Japan, offered a great opportunity to bring business and sports together and raise awareness for the Citrix brand.
