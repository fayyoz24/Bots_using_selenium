    "summary": "One of my big passions, for over 20 years now, has been (Roman) languages and cultures. I have a bachelor's degree in ITALIAN, one in SPANISH and SPANISH AMERICAN language and culture and a master's degree in WESTERN LITERATURE and CULTURE. I worked and studied for long periods of time in ARGENTINA, ITALY and SPAIN. In the period 2012-2014 I completed two courses of PORTUGUESE at a language institute and in september 2015 I followed an intensive two weeks course in Lisbon.\n\nMy experience of TEACHING foreign languages taught me about presentation and education. During my internship in Argentina and years of VOLUNTEER WORK for Erasmus Student Network I learned about organising and (intercultural) communication and my internship at a PUBLISHING house and work as a freelancer for one are good first experiences in the book industry. They also improved my ENGLISH and DUTCH, the latter also by teaching Dutch at a Roman university.\n\nAt my first job as a PROJECT MANAGER at a translation and interpretation company, I learned to work under a large amount of stress and in a (time) EFFICIENT way. 1,5 years later I started working at a wholesaler of consumer electronics where I SUPPORTED the subsidiaries and clients in the south of Europe. Here I found out my strenght lies in my PRECISE way of working and SERVICE ORIENTATED, PROBLEM SOLVING and PROACTIVE attitude. During these first three years of my carreer I loved being an INTERMEDIARY. Being the key figure between clients, colleagues and third parties. Furthermore, I discovered that I don't have a commercial nature, I can only be a sales talent when the enthousiasm of a product or service comes from my heart.\n\nLast year I have been a 'buddy' for The Salvation Army, a special and enriching experience. Because I want to put my aversion towards intensive animal farming into actions , I recently applied as a volunteer at 'Varkens in Nood' ('Pigs in distress') who fight for better living conditions in the meat industry. \n\n \n\n\n",

In this job it is important to achieve a certain revenue and margin. To produce this margin negotiation was often necesarry. Besides working with a commercial and a problem solving attitude, being able to cope with stress is key in this work.
