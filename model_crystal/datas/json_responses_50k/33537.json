    "summary": "I am a global health and public health professional focused on health policies. I combine my expertise in the private, academic, and public sector to bring forward sustainable solutions and recommendations in public health. \n\nA former boss said I'm stubborn...well, I say I'm persistent and determined. Either working independently or collaborating with a team, I am committed: I am resourceful and I get things done with a goal-driven and problem-solving mindset. With strong analytical skills and problem-solving sensitivity, I can analyze any given situation, problem, or setback to address issues in processes and projects in a pragmatic manner. I can plan, organize, and manage projects to complete tasks in a systematic manner and achieve expected results while mitigating any issues coming my way.\n\nI have a very mixed background after working in the private and public sectors. I have managed and monitored clinical trials, researched and analyzed health policies and initiatives to provide policy options and/or recommendations, and I have coordinated, managed, and carried out research projects. Transitioning from one sector to the other required resilience, flexibility, and adaptability. \n\nWorking in very different sectors and different countries has also introduced me to people from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. As a result, I have learned and enjoyed working with people from different cultures with different views on life and work styles, with people that have shown me new values and new work perspectives. All these experiences have enriched my life and my work ethic with strong interpersonal and intercultural sensitivity, cultural awareness, and openness to new ideas.",
