You can adjust the energy flow between cities, adjust energy production, and change the energy price for the four cities. Will you succeed in balancing supply and demand and thus keeping your citizens happy and energy grid healthy? \n\nExhibition game that was on show during the Wetenschapsnacht in 2015 and Summerlabb on Eurosonic/Noorderslag in 2016 and 2017. Currently the game is permanently exhibited in the main hall of the Energy Academy on the Zernike Complex in Groningen.",

Projects Abroad was officially awarded the Reserva Ecologic\u00e0 Taricaya in 2004. A technical report is produced every year to demonstrate this impact and justify the work that is done. The data for these reports comes directly from the volunteers\u2019 daily observations.\n\nAnother aim is to help local people avoid potential damage to the environment. They help with the conservation projects and in return they are assisted with their farming. On a model farm ideas and techniques are tested. This knowledge is passed on to local farmers. Afterwards they are supported to help them sustain the projects - for example  growing mahogany, coffee and cocoa along with livestock management and crop rotations. \n\nThe activities done at the Taricaya reserve are taking part in biodiversity studies and wildlife observations, including:\n\n- Observing birds from a canopy platform.\n- Studying mammals with motion-sensitive cameras.\n- Researching reptiles, amphibians and butterflies.\n- Working on an animal release program, including:\n- Feeding the animals.\n- Building and maintaining cages.\n- Helping to grow crops such as coffee, cacao and chillies on a pilot farm.\n- Helping staff with the butterfly and turtle breeding programmes.\n- Working on trail maintenance.\n- Listening to talks and presentations by local staff and guest experts."
