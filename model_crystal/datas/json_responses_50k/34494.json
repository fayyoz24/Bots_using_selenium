    "summary": "A Master's degree student at Tilburg University with a great interest in studying Strategic Management and Consultancy. I have a deep passion for problem-solving and supporting organizations in dealing with challenges in the fast-changing, dynamic, and complex business environment. My area of interest is in the fields of strategy and sustainability. In line with my interests, I have worked as a business analyst intern in the past at a waste management consulting firm in Jakarta, Indonesia. I also received an Outstanding Thesis Award for my Bachelor's thesis at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan, which focuses on Indonesian Millennials and impact investments. In addition, for my future research in my Master's degree program, I would like to explore more the area of sustainability in small and medium enterprises. During my studies, I have also experienced working with clients on several projects as a consultant. I worked as a consultant for IHI Corporation in Japan on a Global Management (Capstone) Project and was awarded the Best Proposal and Best Speaker Award. \n\nThroughout some blessed life experiences in different countries and continents have broadened my perspective and trained me to deal with diversity. My study in Indonesia, Japan, Norway, and the Netherlands have allowed me to obtain a global perspective and in-depth insight into the management system from different parts of the world. I also have a lot of experience working with people from various countries and it trained me to be able to adapt to a highly diverse community. Studying in a very diverse environment has accustomed me to respect and work with various cultures. All of these experiences shape me and maximize my strengths, especially in being a leader and working with other people.",
