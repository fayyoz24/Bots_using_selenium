    "summary": "During high-school times I have succeded in both academic and extracurricular programmes. I have managed to score a bronze medal in the British Biology Olympiad (2018/19), score top 8% in the Chemistry Avogadro Exam (2018/19) and score twice in top 25% in the Math Fermat Contest. One of my passions is playing football. It has been an important part of my life, during which I often undertook different roles in the team, including team captain and coaching a team of StGIS students age 11-16. During my life I have taken leadership and active participation in various charity projects, for example \"Reverse Advent Calendar Collection For Pfotenhilfe, and Animal Shelter in Lofen, Austria\", \"Donation to Warmestube, Austria\" and \"Wielka Orkiestra \u015awi\u0105tecznej Pomocy, Poland\".  Some of the experience I gained during my university time are design and development in laboratory of gelatin based network that is stable and holds olive oil, research on fungal effector genes in different lilly phenotypes and explorations of different ways of side stream valorization techniques for the Ynsect company, which specialises in creating insect-based protein isolates and fertilizers.",
