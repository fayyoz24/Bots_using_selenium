We investigate the transport of colloids and bacteria in a heterogeneous porous medium engineered in microuidic channels featuring complex grain structures. Using microfluidic experiments and numerical simulation, we investigate the velocity fields and the breakthrough curves of transport of such particles in a model porous medium by emphasising on the effects of dead-end pores.",

The two primary objectives are:\n\nObjective 1: Experimental study of perturbation effects on drop coalescence\n\n\u2022  Designed a Tomographic PIV setup to study drop coalescence at a liquid/liquid interface.\n\u2022  Investigated the effects of a neighboring particle under multiple wetting conditions on 3D flow evolution during various coalescing stages.\n\nObjective 2: Experimental study of drop motion through a confining orifice\n\n\u2022  Designed and performed PIV and visualization experiments on buoyancy driven drops\nimpacting and moving through an orifice.\n\u2022  Investigated the effects of orifice edge geometry and surface wettability on drop passage through an orifice.\n\u2022  Proposed a non-dimensional criterion based on scaling analysis for drop capture on a round-edged orifice.\n\u2022  Designed a simple table-top experimental method to determine interfacial tension for liquid/liquid systems.\n\u2022  Developed an automated image processing program to track liquid/liquid interfaces.",
