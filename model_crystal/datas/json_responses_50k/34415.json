In addition to this, lingerie retailers struggle with up to 50% returns online. The main reason for this is the mere 20% size consistency between brands.\n\nTo solve this, we are building CurveCatch: a conversational sizeless marketplace that matches people to undergarments through intelligent recommendations.\n\nSo far, we've served over 3.000 users with an NPS of 95. We received a $10K grant from Y Combinator and raised our \u20ac650K pre-seed.\n\nFind us at www.curvecatch.com or reach out to kimia@curvecatch.com in case you'd like to know more!",
