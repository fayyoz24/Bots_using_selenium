I was focused on the positive electrode (cathode), as well as on the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte. The project includes a full independence on the development, but also on the characterisation (I am familiar with a full range of techniques, such as XRD, SEM-EDS, AFM, IR, cycling systems, electrochemical testing and assembly of complete cells, EXAFS, XPS, Synchrotron experiments).\n\nPhD position in the european project EuroLiion.\nhttp://www.euroliion.eu/\n\n- Materials synthesis using various techniques (solid state synthesis, sol-gel, spray,...)\n- Creation of protective and catalytic coatings (CVD, Electrospray, Atomic Layer Deposition)\n- Materials and surface characterization (Electrochemical processes, SEM, DSC, TEM, AFM,  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry,)\n- Entire production of a Li-ion battery including material synthesis, characterization, creation of  electrodes, assembly and testing.\n- Powder properties, particle analysis\n- I also got to develop my managing and leadership skills by supervising 15 students at MSc level in the course of 4 years.",

Creation of a hybrid ( polymer-inorganic material) membrane to obtain a PEMFC working in a range of temperature of 130-300 degres celsius. As I was the only lab member to work on the fuel-cell topic, I had to gain knowledge very fast regarding the state of the art of this energy source and also how to manage the whole conception of a fuel cell, from scratch to the achieved cell, as well as the characterization steps ( NMR, FTIR, TGA, DSC,...). I remember this project as very challenging and rewarding.",
