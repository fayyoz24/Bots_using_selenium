    "summary": "Someone once asked me: 'What's your claim of fame', and in all honesty it's my teams. \n\nOver the years I've become more and more pationate about building teams that work together effectively as a unit, but also connect on a personal level (as much as possible). For this I've participated in trainings for team building, coaching, management and communication.\n\nApart from that, I'm an analytical person driven to optimize processes. I have extensive experience in stakeholder / project management and IT, so I love to interact with engineers as well as the business. I take decisions and set priorities based on business value and metrics and do so in a strong collaboration with my stakeholders.  \n\nThrough my career I have learned to function well in a team and to act as a pivot between various departments. I am eager to learn and like to immerse myself in new matter. ",
