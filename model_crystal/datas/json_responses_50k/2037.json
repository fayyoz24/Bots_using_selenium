    "summary": "Research\nAs a cultural psychologist as well as a scholar of religion, my academic interests are scattered across both the social sciences and the humanities. They include religious and aesthetic experiences, mysticism, meaning-making, creativity, rituality and magical thinking, and also cultural transmission, evolutionary psychology, ecological approaches (embodied embedded cognition), identity construction, consciousness, religious self-legitimation, and human atmospheres.\n\nI also have an interest in psychoanalysis, philosophy of science, theory and method. My research skills range from quantitative methods in general to qualitative ones\u2014such as interviewing, participatory observation, and content analysis\u2014in particular. I am currently involved in two research projects: one on religious self-legitimation (together with Leonard van \u2018t Hul), and one on human atmospheres.\n\nTeaching\nI have extensive experience in teaching, developing teaching material, and coordinating courses in both the social sciences and the humanities (most notably cultural psychology, psychology of religion and religious studies). I have taught both undergraduate and graduate students at university and at the first, second, and last year at college (\u2018hogeschool\u2019) level. I have taught regular students as well as adult learners and have done so in Dutch and English.\n\nThe teaching formats of the courses I participated in range from individual supervision (more than 120 undergraduate and graduate theses) to practicals, seminars (of 10-30 students), and lectures (up to 120 students). Apart from the development of course material, I have constructed and validated exams, edited readers, wrote syllabi and for several years coordinated two courses of some 450 students each. As part of these activities, I have supervised teaching assistants and junior lecturers and offered them didactic training, intervision sessions, and personal guidance in the form of class visitations and one-on-one coaching.\n\nStyle\nCo-workers and students describe me as (see testimonials):\n\u2022\tenthusiastic and energetic\n\u2022\tknowledgeable\n\u2022\tapproachable and reliable\n\u2022\tloyal and critical",
