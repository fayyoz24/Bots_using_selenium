    "summary": "I am an experienced analytical chemist with a history of method development and validation in the pharmaceutical industry in early development and end stage drug development.  I have worked in and outside of a GMP environment and been certified to work with controlled substances up to DEA Cat 1 and 2.  I have also worked on Paragraph 4 submissions.  I enjoy the challenge of analytical development and working with different techniques and instrumentation.  I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and do some of the more complicated maintenance such as total pump rebuilds.  I love to learn new things and am constantly searching for ways to improve my work process. I also hold a NT2II certificate.",
