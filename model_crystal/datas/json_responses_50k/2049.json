I branched out to specialize in model portfolio studio shoots from where my work was recognized by a Cape Town based media publication. From this point I became a freelance photographer covering various editorial shoots, fashion spreads and commercial spots.  \n\nUpon leaving South Africa I was contracted as a freelancer to write a five part travel issue covering the Cape to Cairo journey, South East Asia trip and general travel advice. All articles were published.\n\nOnce settled in Amsterdam I continued with WARNARS Photography again working on model portfolios. From this activity, and some marketing interest was generated by upcoming Fashion designers. I am currently work closely with the Dutch based fashion brand JMADE.\n\nSee me in action: http://youtu.be/1gDpvO7pVzQ\n\n2015 Update | I still work as photographer on an ad-hoc basis - but am currently more focussed on the work / EMBA combination.",
