    "summary": "Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Applied Physics department . I am part of the CONSENSE network, which is a project funded by the European Commission, and gathers scientists, as well as companies into one common aim: The development of the next generation of biosensors for continuous biomarker monitoring.\n\n\nMoreover, I am a bachelor in Materials Engineer graduated from the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and a Master of Science with a double-degree Physical-Chemistry and Materials Science in collaboration with three European Universities: Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay (FR), University of Genova (IT) and University of Porto (PT).  I was awarded a full scholarship from the European Commission to be part of the SERP+ program, an International Master programme in Surface, Electro, Radiation, and Photo-Chemistry with elements of Management, Business, Innovation and Valorisation, Communication and Patent law. \n\nWorked at Ontex, developing business insights based on data intelligence, also producing novel reports.. Dealed with data extraction, treatment and modelling, used softwares as Access (Design mode and SQL language) and Excel. Previously was a Supply Chain intern at BASF S.A., position which I could experience the corporate environment and also learn about operations, financial analysis, SAP, different KPIs, etc. I also took a technical internship in 2014 in materials development, which I was responsible for maintaining all the experiments of the lab running properly. Hard-worker, proactive and I have passion to learn.",

Besides producing the biomaterial, I also characterized it with various methods (SEM, Raman Spectroscopy, DSC, etc) and tested it in simulated-body fluid, corroborating that the material was bioactive and could be used as a biomaterial.
