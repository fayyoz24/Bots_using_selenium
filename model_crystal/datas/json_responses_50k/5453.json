    "summary": "Discovering new things gives me energy. During several internships in IT, it became clear to me how important it is to develop good contacts/ good communication with clients/ users. Developing this link is crucial to optimize quality of usability, resulting in user friendly IT solutions. A business process in which I am eager to further train myself in.\n\nI like starting projects and seeing them through till the end. I like taking responsibility and preparing things well, qualities that help me in IT projects trusted in my hands as well as when I scuba dive. I prefer working in a team, but I also perform well on my own.\n\nI take care that my personal finances are always in good order. Part time working in catering and a restaurant for me is a nice way to earn enough to sustain and save. I also enjoy the many contacts with a lot of different people. It\u2019s hard work mostly in the weekends but it enables me to reach my career goals.\n\nShortly after finishing my studies, I booked a single flight to Sydney Australia, to broaden my horizon. Within the first week in Sydney I applied and got a well-paid job in a high-end restaurant. This journey was a valuable learning experience in different cultures, during this time I did not only work I also travelled the east coast of Australia and travelled throughout South East Asia for several months.",
