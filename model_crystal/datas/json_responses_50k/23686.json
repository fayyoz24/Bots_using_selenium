While looking at space as a creative element it asserts that creations create spaces which establishes self's relationship with lines, colors, chords, words etc. That is to say, space is a gateway into creation. This relationship manifests via the unknown, chaotic, grammarless, timeless, contextless space of experience towards which our creations or created spaces created in a particular context, in particular time with a particular grammar move after creation which extends the limitations of the self. Building up on this observation, the dissertation further hypothesizes that self is born as a creation with an innate space into a contextual space interaction between which leads to meanings which can further lead it to limitlessness. It concludes with the observation that certain forces from the market can vacuum the created spaces, erase the meanings nipping in that interaction which also implies that certain forces can modify our sensibility by altering our spaces.",

While looking at space as a creative element it asserts that creations create spaces which establishes self\u2019s relationship with lines, colors, chords, words etc. That is to say, space is a gateway into creation. This relationship manifests via the unknown, chaotic, grammarless, timeless, contextless space of experience towards which our creations or created spaces\u2014created in a particular context, in particular time with a particular grammar\u2014move after creation which extends the limitations of the self. Building up on this observation, the dissertation further hypothesizes that self is born as a creation with an innate space into a contextual space interaction between which leads to meanings which can further lead it to limitlessness. It concludes with the observation that certain forces from the market can vacuum the created spaces, erase the meanings nipping in that interaction which also implies that certain forces can modify our sensibility by altering our spaces.",
