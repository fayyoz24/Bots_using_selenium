Combining two of my passions: Senegalese Music and Haute Couture fashion (from Rama Diaw) this evening was exhilarating.  Omar Ka & Fulani Groove curated this evening musically. The production was a co-effort of people who flew in from Dakar, local people from Rotterdam and a lot of other people from the Benelux and France regions.",
