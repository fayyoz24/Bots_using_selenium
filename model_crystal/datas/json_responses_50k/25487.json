    "summary": "\u00dcwe, an avid coastal engineering researcher and climate resilience expert with Royal HaskoningDHV. She is currently specializing in bio-geomorphological modelling with special application to muddy coastlines.  Her research aims to investigate the dynamics of mangrove coasts under scenarios of storms and sea level rise; and to develop building-with-nature engineering strategies to maintain coastal resilience and limit vulnerability.  \n\nGuided by a 5-year background in civil engineering and a curious mindset, Uwe has strived towards contributing to the understanding and protection of vulnerable coastlines with high climate risks. The experience gained supervising infrastructural works for flood mitigation  and organizing field campaigns has allowed her to work in diverse multidisciplinary teams (private and public sector) in several regions globally (South America, Caribbean, Europe, USA and West Africa) . Moreover, her specialization in bio-geomorphological modelling approaches for vegetated coasts uniquely enables her help organizations identify sustainable and innovative mitigating measures.  \n\nHer work has utilized modelling approaches with Delft 3D, Delft3D-Flexible Mesh, MATLAB, Python, Mflat and AutoCAD among others.  Throughout her years in the civil engineering industry, she has worked on a wide range of projects spanning roads (both primary and secondary) and bridge (local and capital projects) construction, and sea and river defence projects ( local and foreign funded).  This gave her a strong footing with regards to managing projects to their timely completion as she maintained a high level of professionalism and integrity in her work.",
