The insights gathered are used to iteratively improve designs. The final user tests was a global moderated user interview and usability test that I conducted in Norway, Germany, Dubai, Singapore and the UK. Based on this test the project was launched.\n\nI was the user researcher for this project but was also involved in setting up the information architecture, reviewing the interaction and visual design and helping with the content structure and life cycle management of the content.

The insights gathered are used to iteratively improve designs. The final user tests was a global moderated user interview and usability test that I conducted in Norway, Germany, Dubai, Singapore and the UK. Based on this test the project was launched.\n\nWhat the client said: \n\"Miranda is self-going with little need for steer, but she has a great ability to work together where needed. She is great in organising big meetings or events. She is especially good at untangling complex situations and driving changes in ways of working.\"\n\n- UX Strategy\n- User research\n- Usability testing\n- Design reviews\n- Information architecture\n- Content strategy\n- Lifecycle management process \n- Workshop facilitation\n- Projectmanagement",

Based on these insights I proposed improvements and work on optimizing (amongst others) the navigation and search experience.\n\nWhat the client said:\n\" Building bridges.
