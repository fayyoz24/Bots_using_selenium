    "summary": "With nearly 25 years of experience in the international event and conference industry, I am a seasoned professional who can connect events to Rotterdam's innovative ecosystem, driving change and creating impact. As an Account Manager International Congresses at Rotterdam Partners, I offer free, objective, and professional advice to organisers of congresses or business meetings about the opportunities and benefits of hosting their events in Rotterdam, a dynamic and vibrant city with a strong focus on life sciences and health, IT and tech, and agri-food sectors.\n\nI have a unique understanding of how to translate the needs and goals of an international event across borders and cultures, thanks to my multicultural background and extensive network of partners and suppliers throughout the city and beyond. Having organised conferences in various sectors and cities in Europe and the US, I have learned that any successful endeavour begins with a timely and relevant idea, supported by a well-defined plan of action and a talented and dedicated team. I am passionate about building legacy in Rotterdam, a city that inspires me with its innovation and experimentation.",
