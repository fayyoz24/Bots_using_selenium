    "summary": "A hard working and proactive team player with a passion for the humanitarian sector, with experience working and living in post-conflict contexts like Iraq and Burundi. I gained experience in the NGO sector by working in multiple teams at different NGOs in Iraq, Greece, the UK and the Netherlands, volunteering in Peru, and by performing my Master's research in Burundi. This has resulted in excellent interpersonal and cross-cultural communication skills. Moreover, I am organised, have an eye for detail along with strong planning and writing skills. \n\nI aspire to further apply and develop my knowledge of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and social interventions in the humanitarian sector.",
