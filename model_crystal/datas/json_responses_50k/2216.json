In most examples the orientation of the design has been to feature historical and archeological sites with direct address to incoming tourists while in other cases, what has been under scrutiny is the upgrade of the city\u2019s profile in everyday life. \n",

The initial goal of equality in education as introduced by Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has been extended beyond the rise in the number of learners to the actual consideration of them as individuals of equal intelligence who are aware of this fact and therefore, emancipated from the traditional forms of education by instruction. The new subject these courses refer to is not simply accumulating knowledge; it is creating it. And by doing so, it is creating the intellectual tools it will be using in the future not just in the educational context but in the real world problem posing and solving. \nKeywords\u2014 Education; MOOCs; Online learning collectivities; equality; emancipation; equality\n",

Placed at the ground floor of a small-scale office building in Marousi, the company that engages in the production of animated TV commercials needed a new and highly equipped conference room. Due to the long meetings usually held between the various parties responsible for such commercials, this room needed to provide a calm and relaxing environment while equipped with multiple high tech sound and vision systems to ensure the best possible conditions for the presentations of the company\u2019s projects to its clients.\nApart from the main premise that can host up to 16 people, two additional workstations were needed as mush as a separate office for the manager and coordinator of the meetings. The basement was also occupied by the company as extra space but the ground floor needed to be self sufficient so a kitchenette and a small bathroom were added. The stairs that connect the two floors are hidden behind the colored lacquered panels adjacent to the main entrance while all materials used in this project remain as subtle and neutral as possible like the pvc flooring also used in its continuity as wall covering. Instead of solid walls, two gliding glazed partitions separate the conference room offering the possibility to open and use the room\u2019s space in its entirety when needed. \n",

The original building consisted of two levels -almost identical in plan-, the basement and the ground floor. The need was to increase the surface by adding two more levels. This way the vehicles would move in the lower floors while the upper floors would serve as storage space for the facility\u2019s needs. Office space was also needed for the appropriate personnel supporting service as well as space for leisure for those guests waiting to pick up their cars. The permits were issued at the beginning of 2010 and construction was concluded in the spring of 2011. \nThe building is approximately 70m long and 50m wide and it has been covered with two different kinds of insulation panels in grey and white. The circumscribing eaves of the building has been also covered in etalbond panels in blue and grey -the company\u2019s identity colors-. \nThe oblique covering is used as a means to decrease the sense of enormity of the monolithic volume and the differentiation of color of the panels stands for exactly the same purpose. \nOne can enter the building from all sides but clients are meant to stay in just one part of it, the one that is parallel to the main street and where all the offices are situated. \nGlass walls in the waiting area instead of solid partitions allow the client to watch the cars being fixed in the inner area where all the machinery and equipment are held. \n",
