The calibration was perfomed using measured data from a\npilot plant in Groningen and was implemented using the software of Matlab Simulink.\nAmongst the calculations performed was the modelling and dimensioning of a shell and\ntube heat exchanger and flow orifice designs.\nAfter the intership period had ended, I was offered an graduation assignment which\nrequired the previously obtained knowledge on cooling models to be applied for a\ncooling simulation of the compressor motor used in the previously named system. The\nresult was a multi-functional mathematical cooling model which would be used for sales\npurposes. This model was also validated using data from the pilot setup in Groningen.",
