    "summary": "With over 16 years of experience in people and operations management, I am a solution-driven leader who thrives in challenging and fast-paced environments. I have successfully built and led teams, delivered projects, and exceeded targets for start-ups and large corporations across Europe and Africa, in the #renewables, #nuclearenergy, #FinTech, #banking and #consulting sectors.\n\nAs the People Operations Manager at VELI I leverage my knowledge of employment law, HR policies, and talent acquisition to support the company's growth and performance. I partner with hiring leaders and team members to evaluate staffing and team needs, onboard top talent, improve work relationships, handle disciplinary cases, manage change and increase productivity and retention. I also manage the relationship with outsourcing agencies, law firms, and other service providers, ensuring that compliance and quality standards are met.\nAdditionally, I work as an independent head-hunter, executive coach and HRBP for FinTechs and green energy businesses, providing my services across Western and Eastern Europe, and Africa.\n\nI hold a dual master's degree in managerial communication and human resources management, as well as several certifications in executive coaching, project management and leadership from INSEAD, Harvard Business School, and CIPD. I am fluent in English, French, and Romanian, and I adapt fast to different cultures, geographies, and roles. I enjoy connecting with people on- and off-line, and I am always eager to learn new things and explore new opportunities. When I am not at the office, I use my creativity to decorate houses, hold yoga classes, invent recipes in the kitchen, go out with friends, lead charity projects, and indulge my love for discovering new cultures through traveling and networking.",
