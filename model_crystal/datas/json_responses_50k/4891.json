I presented comprehensive reports based on research and data analysis. My role also included management of comprehensive field research studies involving surveys, interviews and focus group discussions to assess communication needs of target groups. Additionally, it also involved conducting end-end research where many national policies related to education (such as RTE act, 2009) and health (HIV & AIDS Prevention and Control Act, 2017) were translated into actionable communication research models. \nFollowing is a description of some of the projects I worked on: \n\n1) Mixed-methods joint research study conducted with Dr. Shyam Sundar of Penn State University, USA and WhatsApp India on understanding the mechanism behind Fake News and misinformation dissemination on Social media in India. The study tried to ascertain which modality (audio, video or text) would be most successful in spreading fake news on social media. The study was conducted in two territories - New Delhi and Bihar\n\n2) Communication Needs Assessment study conducted with people living with and at highest risk of contracting HIV AIDS. This study was conducted for the National AIDS Organization of India, in collaboration with FHI 360. It was a year long study, conducted across 10 states in India using a sample population of 1000 respondents. \n\n3) Formative research study to assess existing climate resilience communication networks of populations most vulnerable to climate change across the Bay of Bengal region (including India and Bangladesh). The study was conducted for the Internews Earth Journalism Network.\n\n4) A Communication Needs Assessment study conducted for UNICEF India to help improve the reach  and messaging of their in-house, radio program-Jan Pahal-an educational show targeted towards empowering primary school teachers as well as parents in Uttar Pradesh, India.",
