    "summary": "What gives me energy first is creating value with people who are each an expert in their own synergistic field. Preferably a field I know very little about so that everything becomes a learning opportunity. Next is presenting on any stage about the wonderful value that has been created and how this is best applied to the customer so that they gain maximum benefit. Last is teaching, training and mentoring. Knowledge is meant to be shared and not hoarded and should be used to arm the next generation so that they do not envy but surpass us.\n\nMy core beliefs are authenticity, justice and mutual respect for one another.\n\nI am accustomed to work in dynamic, close-knit teams of young professionals and high potentials. My strengths include leading by example, create cohesion among professionals and an ability to translate strategic, tactical and operational vision for any level of technical accumen.\n\nMotivation comes from creating order in chaos. This expresses itself mainly when there is a leadership void and I feel a magnetic pull to fill the position for the greater good of all. I actually get up earlier for a proper (technical) challenge and I welcome the opportunity to meet new people with different points of view in order to enhance my own frame of reference.",

Since this is a predominantly Redhat Linux environment, I am a fully certified RHCA and this is where my expertise lies. However, I am still more than capable on other Linux distributions such as SuSe, Debian and Ubuntu. Other operations systems such as SUN Solaris and VMWare ESX are also well within my scope.\n\nAn example of daily activities are:\n- Server installation, management and administration for Redhat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6, SUN Solaris 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10 and ESX VMWare 4.1\n- Incident management within the landscape and with shared competences such as Windows, storage and network.\n- Life cycle management in regards to hardware, Operating Systems and application software\n- Managing a 1000+ monitoring environment for all Linux, Solaris and VMWare servers\n- Implementing changes for server upgrades and problem resolution\n\nAside from day-to-day operations, IT specialists are called upon for their expertise in supporting internal and external projects. These projects could be anything ranging from large-scale life cycling of hardware and/or software, security projects, and the implementation of new hardware and software technologies. IT specialists provide advice, proof of concepts, build PoC's and eventually take on an architecture role in order to assist with the designing of the high-level, low-level and detailed design\n\nExamples of these projects are:\n- Redesigning the server provisioning platform with Redhat Satellite\n- Upgrading central authentication and authorization services to LDAPS, RHDS, IPA and Kerberos\n- Building a new software build environment for migrating from SPARC to X86_64\n- Worldwide deployment of a secure encrypted custom-built application\n- Migrate Solaris and Linux servers to a central print environment\n- Migrating existing landscape to a unified FlexPod solution",
