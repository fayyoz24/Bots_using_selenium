    "summary": "I am excited to start a new stage in my academic career as Assistant Professor at the University of Twente.  Building on my design background, practice-based research and experience with creative forms of engagement, I will contribute to innovative teaching and research on sustainable innovations that bring together different forms of knowledge and expertise. I will do this using the lens of 'gluing', a conceptual  and methodological framework that I am currently developing as a critical and creative approach to transformations towards sustainable futures. \n\nOriginally trained as an architect, I have urban planning experience (London), a PhD in sustainable development (Trinity College Dublin) and postdoctoral research expertise in urban resilience (University of Sheffield) and creative forms of civic engagement in smart cities (Utrecht University).",

                    "description": "In my PhD research, I examined the relationship between city inhabitants, decision-makers and their cities, and the potential role of digital technologies in enhancing this relationship. Moreover, I identified barriers to a more sustainable city and explored potential solutions. Building on an experimental and multi-layered study conducted in Dublin, Ireland, which employed a dynamic everyday mobility lens and included quantitative, qualitative and spatial methods, I proposed a conceptual map-based interactive platform entitled \u2018Urban Spacebook\u2019. The platform offers a framework and also examples of tools that can facilitate the creation of alternative spaces for engagement between city inhabitants and city decision-makers. Reflecting the collaborative process through which it emerged, the platform allows inhabitants to be involved not only in data generation (as emphasized in many citizen-sensing initiatives), but also in the co-production of knowledge about current urban spaces and their future development.\n\nI presented my work at a number of international conferences:\n\n\u2022 Global Conference on Mobility Futures, 4 - 6 September 2013, Lancaster University, UK.\n\u2022 Governing Mobilities (joint conference of Mobilit\u00e9s spatiales et fluidit\u00e9 sociale \u2013 MSFS \u2013 and the Cosmobilities Network), 30 October - 1 November 2012, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\u2022 Local and Mobile: linking mobilities, mobile communication and locative media (the 3rd joint international conference of the Pan-American Mobilities Network and the Cosmobilities Network), 16-18 March 2012, NC State University, Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThe project is trans-disciplinary, at the exciting crossroads of urban studies, mobilities research and locative media art. It was selected for Interactivos?'12 Dublin Workshop - Dublin Hack the City Exhibition 2012. More at: http://mobilecityscapes.wordpress.com/ and https://www.facebook.com/InfiniteCity12",
