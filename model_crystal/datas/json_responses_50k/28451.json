    "summary": "I am a passionate mechanical engineer specializing in Thermal and Fluids Engineering. I learned about my passion for studying fluids during my first experience working in a laboratory during my bachelor's degree. I started doing simulations and experiments with refrigerator compressors, and at that moment, I figured out what I wanted to do for the next years: research.\n\nBy the end of my bachelor's, I also discovered another great passion of mine: traveling and meeting new people and new cultures. At that moment, I dived into the most difficult but at the same time the greatest adventure of my life: start a new life and continue my education abroad. I was awarded the Orange Tulip Scholarship, which financed my Master's degree in the Netherlands.\n\nMy Master's degree allowed me to meet people worldwide, specialize in fluid mechanics and discover myself personally and professionally. At the end of my Master's, I had the opportunity to do an internship at the Netherlands Aerospace Centre and do my Master's thesis researching laminar-turbulent boundary layer transition at the Wind Tunnel of the University of Twente. At the end of my Master's, I was invited to continue as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Twente. Currently, my research involves aerodynamics and aeroacoustics. I experimentally investigate turbulent flows and noise generated by the interaction of turbulence with airfoil wings. The goal of my research is to understand and analyze the physical phenomenon behind the aeroacoustic noise generation in an effort to subsequently improve noise prediction models. These models are of great importance in the design of silent propellers, wings, and fans.",
