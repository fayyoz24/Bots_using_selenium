This platform is focused on young people between 20 and 30 years old from around the world who visit the capital of Spain interested in a more economical and sustainable tourism.\n\nIn the first place, multidisciplinary research was carried out in order to collect statistical data related to the interests of young tourists, analysis of the major cultural resources in Madrid and, finally, the development and importance of new technologies in the field of tourism and its relationship with our target audience.\n\nAfter the analysis of this first part,we propose the creation of the virtual platform in response to the needs of young people. The platform consists of different menus that provide potential tourist information that interests you. It includes menus as a guided tour with downloadable maps, information on Madrid's cultural resources, photo gallery, parks and gardens of the city, suggested visits in the Community of Madrid, cultural activities, among others, that will be discussed during the development of this project. \n\nTo conclude, with the analysis of these two parts, analysis and proposed virtual platform, we fill the gap between young people and cultural tourism, thereby achieving the objectives and helping to encourage young tourists in the city of Madrid with all the advantages that this entails.\n",
