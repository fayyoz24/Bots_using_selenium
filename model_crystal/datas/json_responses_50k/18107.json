            "description": "The purpose of this article was to investigate teachers\u2019 attitude about e-learning; it attempts to investigate the current teachers\u2019 opinions and awareness about e-learning, their activities pertaining to e-learning, as well as their motivation and initiative, or lack of them. The target group were the teaching staff of the faculties of the University of Zagreb who were sent a link to the online survey. By looking at the results of SRCE\u2019s annual survey, which was sent to UNIZG\u2019s faculty administration, it was assumed that teachers show motivation and interest in using e-learning, however, they lack support of their respective faculties, as well as technological prerequisites to implement e-learning in their teaching. Another assumption was that some faculties would have bigger and some a smaller need for e-learning, depending on their field of study. To test these hypotheses, a survey was sent to each UNIZG faculty with instructions to pass it along to members of their teaching staff. There were 315 participants in the survey, and data analysis confirmed great majority of the authors\u2019 hypotheses; it was concluded that the majority of participant teaching staff at UNIZG, irrespective of their age, is motivated and interested in the idea of e-learning, but lack the incentive and support to engage with it.\nhttp://infoz.ffzg.hr/INFuture/ConferenceProgram.aspx",
