    "summary": "I am an industrial designer conceptualising developing and managing the production of objects. Focusing on research-based collaborations across craft and high-tech industries to materialise narratives.\n\n- About me \n     Industrial Designer \n     Design Brand Manager\n     Freelance filmmaker \n\nI've been a multidisciplinary Industrial designer for eight years. My work began in Mumbai in building a bespoke object brand collaborating across traditional crafts and contemporary technologies. Supporting local craft collectives to realign aesthetical perceptions to produce work of lasting value. \n\nI believe in the power of materials to shape experiences and transform the way we interact with the world. With meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of the intrinsic qualities of materials, I strive to create designs that evoke emotion, challenge conventions, and inspire meaningful connections.\n\nNow based in Europe and having recently graduated with a Geo-Design Master from Design Academy Eindhoven, my work extends beyond aesthetics, as I aim to address pressing social, environmental, and cultural issues through my designs. By collaborating with diverse industries and experts, I seek to materialize ideas that address urgencies.\n\nIn addition to my design pursuits, I also pursue freelance filmmaking, allowing me to explore visual storytelling and further enhance my creative capabilities.\n\nLets connect\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tanaykandpal/",
