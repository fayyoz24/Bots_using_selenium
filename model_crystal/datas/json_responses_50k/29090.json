    "summary": "In one sentence: I am a geologist and experimentalist who enjoys sharing knowledge and likes to work in a team.\n\nDuring my master and internship at TNO I developed a distinct set of skills by doing tectonic modelling in the TecLab and by performing high pressure experiments in the iM4Rocklab. These skills allow me to obtain and process data with different types of apparatus and to find practical solutions to experimental challenges. \nI have a passion for geological and tectonic processes at a large range of scales, from earthquakes at the microscale to deformation in mountainbelts and subduction zones. Being able to share this knowledge as well as having social relevance motivate me to learn more about the earths interior. \nIn my future career I hope to be able to use my geological and experimental skills to gain and share more knowledge and to play my role in the energy transition.\n\n",

            "description": "Cyclic hydraulic fracturing techniques are suggested for the stimulation of tight geothermal reservoirs, as they might lead to a larger fracture disturbed zone than conventional fracturing techniques, whereas formation breakdown pressures may be lowered. Good physical explanations for these effects, however, are still lacking.\nThis study investigates the effect of injection pressure path to failure on the breakdown pressure and fracture permeability of tight Triassic sandstones targeted by an actual deep geothermal well (NLW-GT-01). Three different hydraulic fracturing schemes were applied: (1) conventional hydraulic fracturing (HF), (2) slow cyclic hydraulic fracturing (SCHF), and (3) cyclic hydraulic fracturing (CHF). After failure, permeability tests were performed on the fractured samples within the same experimental setup. Accordingly, the permeability measurements are directly linked to flow over the initiated fracture and the fracture microstructure is caused by pure tensile fracturing due to fluid injection. Fracture properties are therefore considered to be closely resembling those of fractures in hydraulic fractured reservoirs. The results in this study show no direct correlation between injection path to failure and breakdown pressure or equivalent hydraulic permeability. Variability of samples of the tight sandstone along the well has a stronger influence on these fracturing properties than injection scheme. However, visual inspection of CT scans of the fractured samples seems to indicate that SCHF leads to more complex fracture networks with larger mechanical apertures than HF. If the relation between injection scheme, fracture complexity, and apertures is confirmed in additional experiments and CT scans, cyclic stimulation might be used in future deep geothermal operations, provided that reservoir analysis and long terms cyclic stimulation techniques can be cost-effective.",

Deformation at and above\nthe subduction interface can be categorized in di\u000berent stages, which are part of the so-called\nsubduction seismic cycle. This cycle includes a stress accumulation phase, a seismic event or\nearthquake, and a subsequent phase of relaxation. An ideal model thus takes tectonic loading, rate\ndependent friction, and viscoelastic stress relaxation into account.\nThis study aims at a better understanding of the interaction between frictional behaviour in the\nseismogenic zone and long term deformation structures. Hence, this study focuses on part of the\nvelocity weakening section of a subduction zone megathrust and the overlying wedge. The approach\nincludes physical analogue modelling of the upper \u001810 km of a subduction zone and a quantitative\nstudy of frictional behaviour of analogue granular materials at experimental conditions.\nResults show the formation of splay faults (linking subduction fault to the surface), frontal\nthrusts, and backthrusts. The geometry of the accretionary wedge, is determined by the number\nand the location of faults being (re-)activated. The di\u000berent models of this study show that\nloadpoint velocity and frictional properties of the plate interface a\u000bect the slip size and size of\nthe force drops. This consequently in\nuences the location of fault (re-)activation and geometry of\nthe accretionary wedge. It therefore implies that overriding wedge geometry could be used to put\nconstraints on the earthquake behaviour at the subduction zone megathrust.",

The differences in these settings can lead to the formation of a distinct set of geometric characteristics. It is important to have a better understanding in the processes that lead to these differences for e.g. the exploration of hydrocarbon resources. In this study, the effect of vertical load and therefore brittle strength on the structural style of asymmetric rifting is tested. This is done by analogue modelling of two-layer models that represent the upper brittle and lower ductile crust. All parameters except for the brittle layer thickness are kept constant during the experiments. From the results in this study, it can be concluded that: 1) Brittle-ductile models of asymmetric extension always show a symmetric geometry, 2) rift zones in brittle-ductile models are always wider than pure brittle models, 3) rift zone width increases with decreasing brittle layer thickness and is not determined in the first stages of extension, 4) the number of faults increases with decreasing brittle layer thickness and 5) narrow rifts develop when a relatively large part of the crust behaves brittle. Wide rifts develop when a relatively small part of the crust behaves brittle. Both natural examples and models show this trend.",

It is important to know key characteristics of these faults such as geometry, lithologies of the surrounding rocks and composition of the material within the fault. Unfortunately, we cannot descend to the faults in the Groningen gas field, located at 3 km depth. Therefore, we use an innovative integration of physical analogue modelling, rock physics experiments and (micro)structural analysis of field outcrops in the UK and Sydney Basin to determine the mechanical properties of faults similar to those in Groningen. \nThe knowledge we will gain, is not only applicable to Groningen, but can also be used for future projects aiming at utilization of the Dutch subsurface. This includes geothermal and hydrogen storage projects to meet our climate goals.",
