The goal of our interdisciplinary team was to develop a modular, quantitative and cheap paper-based rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies applicable at the point of care. The test was based on the self-cleaving principle of aptazymes. These aptazymes were in vitro evolved to stabilize when bound to a certain vitamin, but self-cleave in the absence of a certain vitamin. This cleavage principle was applied to regulate lacZ expression in a cell-free system on paper support.\n\niGEM prizes (2021): First Runner Up (2nd place overall), Best Diagnostics Project, and Best Supporting Entrepreneurship in the Overgraduate category.\n\nWiki: https://2021.igem.org/Team:TUDelft",
