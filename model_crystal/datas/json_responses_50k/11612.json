    "summary": "I\u2019m specialised in looking at website usage data, specifically at how consumers complete their goal on a website. I help the business translate this data in order to optimize customer satisfaction/NPS in the short and long term. I\u2019m not afraid to question what\u2019s already in place and operate with clear intent and a determined thoroughness. I thrive in team settings and am able to balance pragmatic thinking, sharing expertise and finding the perfect pun, meme or GIF for the occasion. Over the years I\u2019ve been awarded many nicknames (Kennalytics is the most treasured of them all) and I will always promote team cohesion, sometimes blessing my cohort with its own tailor-made brand, slogan and logo.",
