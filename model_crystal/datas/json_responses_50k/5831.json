    "summary": "I consider design as an opportunity for public empowerment and skill sharing, as a tool for everyday political engagement. Behind production and consumption lies a fundamentally subjective use value, a subjectivity of relevance, be it of a cultural, ideological, political or other personal nature. These, I explores through my practice.\n\nMy practice follows a research-centred methodology. Experimental research through dialogue, empathy and observation, as well as a passion for thorough theoretical research result in unique analysis and original research outcomes. I'm fluent in expressing myself visually and verbally and in applying research insights to the fields of contextual, socially engaged art and design.",

            "description": "\"With 2013's theme, The Nature of Things, The Great Indoors responds to a wider cultural debate about the rise of social, sustainable, and process-oriented designs. (...) The return to nature as 'the source' is a clear development within the discipline of (interior) architecture.The growing interest in nature is seen first and foremost through the choice of materials in response to the scarcity of raw materials and the utilising of local products. There is also a continuous search for the linking and organising of waste streams and other processes (think: sustainable energy use, recycling, upcycling). (...) By using this conceptual framework as a starting point in the education programme, participating students are expected to work to a specific method. In addition to aesthetic and functional aspects playing a role in their designs, integrated and sustainable solutions should also be considered during all phases of the design process.\n\nStudents acquire relevant work experience within the education programme, while simultaneously building a (knowledge) network. They are confronted with the possibilities and limitations of a physical location and with the wishes of the client, as they work on a topical task in a meaningful context. The education programme gives young designers the opportunity to show their talents to a wide audience of professionals and interested parties.\n\nThe international nominees of The Great Indoors Award 2013 voted and appointed a winning student project. The winning group receives The Great Expectations Award, which consists of airline tickets and a hostel during the Salone del Mobile in Milan in 2014!  The winning project of 2013 is the assignment for an exhibition concept for De Ridder, developed by a team of the Design Academy Eindhoven.\"\n\n- http://www.the-great-indoors.com/2013/EducationProgramme",

The Seeker Project is a worldwide series of collaboration of interdisciplinary teams of artists, designers, engineers, students and enthusiasts, who design and create DIY starship sculptures that evolve over time. This initiative is a community project in which the work is realised through co-creation.\n\nThe work explores in an experimental way the integration of the technological, ecological and social systems that enable long-term survival in a spaceship. Instead of keeping the various functions connected to living, working and technology separated, the Seeker community sets out to create hybrid, closed systems that favour sustainability and stimulate interconnection.

Some things about the Peninsula, its people, culture, wildlife and economy are very obvious. Others are far less obvious. The presence of \u2018the border\u2019, for instance, and the awkward relationship Lithuanians have with their Kaliningrad neighbours.\n\nThe key element is to tackle a project on the basis of research and analysis \u2013 not as a direct answer to a specific design commission. It is about \u2018why\u2019, not just about \u2018how\u2019. It is about process, not just about product.\n\nThis exhibition presents four projects, emanating from that week of research. The participants spent four days in the workshops of the Academy, putting all this together.\n\nThe Nida Project was initiated by Koen Kleijn and Vytautas Gecas. It was made possible by a generous grant from the Lithuanian Cultural Fund and the generous hospitality of the Vilnius Art Academy and the Design Innovation Centre.",

The \u2018loophole\u2019 I\u2019ve chosen to explore within this project revolves around the distribution system of supermarkets and making unsold produce accessible. Rather than working closely with distributors I am exploring methods and strategies for individuals to become active taking advantage of freely accessible materials to transform them into objects of use value. Through the discovery of value in \u2018low quality materials\u2019 which are currently discarded, this project counters the economic logic we, as consumers, producers and distributors have gotten used to.",

At the same time, squatting has seen a rebirth as a tool of radical praxis in movements fighting against the rising number of evictions and foreclosures during the financial crisis, facing the policies of racism and creating open spaces for refugees, migrants and people of colour. The collected essays, first-hand accounts and photographs in this book do not intend to offer an over-arching narrative of where the squatters movement is heading. Instead the book provides glimpses into a diverse and multi-faceted movement, with accounts from local struggles, experiences of repression and stories of collective forms of life which have grown out of squatted spaces in various cities and countries throughout the world, including accounts from Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Seattle and Australia.\n\nEditors:\nSqEK (squatting everywhere kollective) is a network of radical activists and researchers from diverse social and political movements around the world. The primary aim of the collective is to produce reliable and fine-grained knowledge about squatters\u00b4 movements as a public resource, especially for squatters and activists. Critical engagement, transdisciplinarity and comparative approaches are the bases of this project.",
