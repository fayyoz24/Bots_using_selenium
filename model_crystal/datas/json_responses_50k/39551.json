    "summary": "Currently Marketing Manager at Dyanix in the Netherlands, where I'm responsible for marketing their extended solutions brands including Apty, ScaleHub, Legal Pilot and more to come. \n\nI began my career in Marketing as an Intern at the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 2010, putting my music degree to good use and getting to enjoy lots of concerts. This was followed by a 5 year stint at Askonas Holt, an artist management agency representing some of the top classical music artists in the world - pretty exciting! During this time, I met and married a (sometimes flying) Dutchman and ended up following him to Los Angeles, where I soon found an awesome marketing role at the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl. \n\nA couple of years later, Europe, rather than London, was calling, but would have to wait until we took an 8-month sabbatical during which time I volunteered for El Sistema Greece and spent half a year travelling through North and South America from Alaska to Patagonia (which you can read all about here: https://jomirko.travel.blog/). \n\nLanding in the Netherlands, I focused on learning Dutch and finding a house in the most densely populated country in Europe. A short diversion to working in Sales at Tesla made me realise my passion definitely lay in marketing and I found my first role in the Dutch software industry, before switching to Dyanix.\n\nOver the years I've developed strong skills in marketing communications and strategy, project management, budget planning and management, event management, sales analysis, and market research. I also have a Professional Marketing Diploma from the Chartered Institute of Marketing and a Music degree from the University of Leeds. \n\nOutside of work I love hiking, yoga, nature-watching and travelling.",
