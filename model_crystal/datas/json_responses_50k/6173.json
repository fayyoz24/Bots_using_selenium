            "description": "In this project, we are maintaining and enhancing complex mobile app which controls the lights. Philips Hue is a line of color changing LED lamps and white bulbs created by Philips. The Hue system was marketed as the first iOS controlled lighting appliance. It uses the Zigbee lighting protocol to communicate and can be controlled via smartphone apps over Wi-Fi via a Zigbee\u2013Wi\u2011Fi bridge.\n\nThis app interacts with a lot of hardware like bridges, switches, sensors, remote control etc. and hence is challenging to test end to end functionality. I am involved in sprint planning, test estimation of testing stories for the sprints. I & product owner review the enhancements requests and write the acceptance criteria for the stories. I then create test cases and do the impact analysis. I am responsible for functional test execution on iOS & Android devices, iOS watch etc. Also, I verify that the correct request is being sent for each action on the app using \"Charles\" tool. For regression testing, we are using Calabash as a test automation tool. I verify Calabash report and re execute failed scenarios manually. I use JIRA for sprint planning, defect management, document controls and pulling out reports like \"Burn down chart\",  \"Velocity Report\" etc. ",

I joined the team after a couple of demos. I performed root cause analysis of defects reported by the client. I found that majority of defects were because of unclear requirements. I understood all the requirements from product owner, added a detailed functional description for available tasks in JIRA and created the functional spec for the team. I explained requirements to developers and worked closely with them to implement functionality correctly. I was instrumental in understanding requirements in detail, suggesting improvement in the app and finding defects. I did functional and non-functional testing of an app on 8+ Android and iOS devices and removed defects from the system. The client was happy to see the app without defects. The client has only suggested improvements or new changes as they didn\u2019t find any defects in UAT phase.",
