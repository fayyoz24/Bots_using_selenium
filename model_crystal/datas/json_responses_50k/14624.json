            "description": "\nThis work had as main objective to make a survey of solid waste generated at the Federal University of Tocantins, Campus de Gurupi. Identification of generating sources was carried out through observations and research in the sectors present on campus. The quantitative analysis consisted of the collection of the residues during the days 25 to September 29, 2017, in which they were separated according to their typology, such as: cardboard, aluminum, organic, pruning, among others. Observations were made regarding the collection, packaging, storage and final disposal. After obtaining the data collected, proposals were made for adjustments and improvements for solid waste management. In addition, the generated generated sources comprise the administrative sectors, classrooms, laboratories and areas of common use. The data obtained from the quantitative generation show the organic residues coming from the university restaurant, which represent 75% of the solid residues generated on campus, with final destination for pig feed. Already other common residues are deposited in an open place, exposed to the sun, which are collected by the truck of the City Hall. On-site analyzes have shown that some improvements are needed mainly in the collection, storage and identification. In addition, it is necessary to raise awareness, lectures and actions of environmental education for the students and servers of the campus.\n \nKeywords: collection, storage, final destination and waste.\n\n",

The process of\nadsorption has a great applicability in the removal of these contaminants in effluents. O\nobjective of this work is to analyze and enable the use of buriti biomass for the removal of copper (II)\nin aqueous solutions. Batch tests were carried out with different solutions of CuSO 4 .H 2 O in\n1g / L of biomass, at a temperature of 25\u00baC in 30 minutes of stirring, analyzes were also performed\npH, FTIR, MEV / EDS, PCZ analyzes, granulometry variation analyzes and calculations of\nadsorption isotherms. The Langmuir adsorption model fits the data very well\nexperimental data obtained for the Cu (II) species. The value of q max. obtained for Cu (II) reflect the\nload capacity of these metallic species by biomass, where the capacity for Cu (II) exhibited\na value of 14.20mg / g. With that it was observed that the biomass of Buriti is a viable alternative for\nCu (II) decontamination.\nKeywords: Biomass; Copper (II); Adsorption;",
