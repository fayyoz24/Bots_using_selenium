    "summary": "I am a student of anthropology, art history, and museum studies with a passion for heritage conservation and field work. With a strong foundation in intercultural communication, I have experience in journalism, marketing, and hospitality, which have helped to develop my skills in communicating complex ideas and working effectively with diverse groups of people.\n\nI am particularly interested in exploring the intersection between cultural heritage, sustainable development, and community engagement. I have already gained valuable experience through internships and volunteer work at various cultural institutions, where I have contributed to projects related to artifact preservation, exhibition design, and public education.\n\nIn the future, I hope to continue working in the field of heritage conservation, conducting research and fieldwork, and collaborating with local communities to preserve and promote cultural heritage for future generations.",
