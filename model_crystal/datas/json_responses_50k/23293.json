The data source used was the Azure SQL Database, and automation was used to recreate the indexes using CRON job and Azure Functions.\n\nAlthough, now I am looking forward to a full-time job opportunity, I have personally enjoyed working with a few online project vendors--Upwork is one of them. The downside of freelancing that I believe is, that the job poster has no idea of the pain a software developer has to go through, to build their product. Which is why I do not seek freelancing opportunities unless they are interesting. \n\nhttps://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d9753b2a8b14c105",
