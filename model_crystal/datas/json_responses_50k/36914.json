A country that saw in their streets more and more children, working, picking and selling paperboard, cleaning glass, ergo looking for a plate of food on the table.\nSo we were making our way and today \"Los Pibes\" aims to assist and train at-risk youth. That is why the primary goal is the realization of charitable works that promote the integral education (religious, moral, professional) of youth.\nIn this area, adolescents and young people are trained, educated, contained and inserted, providing an alternative to those who live in a world without alternatives. Like Don Bosco, the fundamental aspiration is to lead young people to encounter Jesus Christ."
