    "summary": "Hello! I'm Allegra, and I thrive in a comfortably chaotic lifestyle, resisting excessive rules. I'm known among my friends as the go-to person for unconventional ideas, encouraging them to embrace adventure.\n\nWhile I have a clear vision of my desired destination in life, I often find myself uncertain about the path to get there. Consequently, I explore various avenues to determine what aligns best with my journey. Seeking advice from individuals who have pursued similar goals and ambitions is crucial to me.\n\nIn essence, I approach life with an open mind, eager to explore all its offerings without limiting myself.",
