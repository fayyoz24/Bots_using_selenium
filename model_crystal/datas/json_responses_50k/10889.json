    "summary": "Fueled by ambition, devoted to achieving excellence with keen attention to detail, and a firm believer in the power of collaboration \u2013 this is the image I strive to project. Over the past 5 years of my academic journey, I've been nurturing my skills and knowledge to prepare myself for new challenges and to broaden my horizons. My passions encompass technology, business, processes, marketing, and strategy, with a sharp focus on the latest trends and innovations.\n\nHaving completed my Bachelor's in Economics & Business Economics at Radboud University, I continued my academic journey in Tilburg. The past 1.5 years saw me further specialize through the pursuit of a Master's in Strategic Management: Entrepreneurship at Tilburg University. This master's emphasis on Management, Strategy, and Business Development aligns seamlessly with my interests. I have since completed the courses in this Master\u2019s in 2023 with a GPA of 7.4, with only my Thesis remaining.\n\nContinuing my academic journey with a strong drive for self-improvement and lifelong learning, I've been pursuing a second Master's degree in International Management at Tilburg University since February 2023. Holding a current GPA of 7.2, I'm actively participating in courses like International Marketing, International Finance, and Consulting Skills, where I'm integrating fresh insights into my existing knowledge.\n\nOver the past year, I had the privilege of interning at ASML's S&SC division. Given my fascination with technology, innovation, and strategy, this was an opportunity I couldn't let slip by. These five months have proven incredibly enriching. Being able to immerse myself in learning, observation, and experiences at a company as passionate and dynamic as ASML has undoubtedly been one of the most captivating chapters of my life.\n\nAs the academic year of 2023 progressed, I seized the opportunity to allocate more time to my freelance work, leading to the establishment of a sole proprietorship that underlines my unwavering commitment to delivering quality services. This strategic move aims to elevate my professional standing and underscore my determination for excellence. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, I'm enthusiastic about the prospects unfolding in both my academic pursuits and professional endeavors.\n\nI am continuously seeking opportunities for personal growth, learning, and new experiences as these are my driving force.
