The process begins with a research of the ambiguous, interrogative, paradoxical use of words, and continues by observing how translations unravelled into the materiality of language and its performative dimension,where translations surpassed verbal or written correlative of words and opened to gestures, sounds, drawings, photos, cups of coffee, laughter and anger, reinstating the variety of layers and vastness of miscommunication. \n\nI list each of these projects in several parts.\n\nOccupying Goldsmiths Library\nAt the library at Goldsmiths, during the protests against cuts in education in 2010, I researched the idea of consensus, which served as basis for the occupation of the library. Over a day and a half, I distributed envelopes and engaged in conversation about the meaning and translation of words recurrently used by those present at the occupation site. 2010.\n\n'Re-translating'\nAt the Anatolia People\u2019s Centre in Stoke Newington (meeting point for the Turkish and Kurdish community), London in 2010 and later in the Kolenkit, West Amsterdam in 2011, I distributed a set of four postcards, each containing a question: Can you write an English expression you dislike? Can you write a word you really like in any language you know? Can you write a word in your mother tongue that you feel represents you? Can you write a traditional saying in your mother tongue?",

A valentine\u2019s day project\u2019 \nTogether with artist-in-residence Pedro Manuel, we invited the neighbourhood to share a Valentine\u2019s message by sending a text message that we would then project on the roof of Cascoland\u2019s headquarters using a light box installed by artists Inge Rosenbaum and Mark Weemen. \n\n\u2018Photographing the borders of Kolenkit\u2019\nListening to a broad range of conversations across the neighbourhood, I was curious to explore how people living in Kolenkit sensed the borders of the neighbourhood. I handed out disposable cameras and asked people to photograph what they considered to be the borders of their neighbourhood. \n\n\u2018Kolenkit Gezegd\u2019\nI collected proverbs and traditional sayings among passers-by, residents, shop-owners, and people at community centres. Then, I asked people at these places to translate them from their mother tongue into Dutch, or from Dutch into their mother tongue. Traditional sayings, though clear to a native speaker, often become illogical, nonsensical, ambiguous, even absurd, when translated word by word. In a traditional saying there are underlying meanings ascribed to characters, to locations, to phonetic assemblages (i.e. the rhyme), performances of elocution. In a way, a traditional saying is a kind of verbal limit of a language within culture. It is, of course, always possible to convey the main idea, maybe even in appropriate manners, but there are always many cultural layers set aside. By trying to disassemble the traditional sayings these layers tend to unlock, slide, appear. The setup allowed observing the process of what was set aside, how meanings were negotiated between languages through descriptions, impressions, stories, and embodiments that emerged in translation.",

For this purpose I designed a workshop aimed at mapping the particularities and universals of a design project almost to the verge of nonsense, to the point of paralysed meaning. \n\u2028This workshop took place in different educational settings both in London (UK) and Rotterdam (NL). \n\nThe idea was to research practices in communication design by deconstructing, disassembling, fracturing, pulverising or, alternatively, assembling, connecting, merging, combining, moulding, attaching, and interconnecting them. This workshop first took place in the context of a short term learning activity at the MA in Design and Environment at Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2012. \n\nI later developed a similar exercise with students from the minor in Cultural Diversity part of the Social Practice course at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. There, students deconstructed the concepts and projects they had intended to carry out in a neighbourhood in the North of Rotterdam. \n\nI also facilitated the workshop with students of the graphic design course at the Willem de Kooning Academy, whose main project theme was Music. Students were asked to create a map moving from generic to concrete in order to open two levels of miscommunication: the miscommunication contained in the generic description of terms\u2014with space for multiple referents\u2014and miscommunication arising from the specifics of each personal sphere, excluding others from the contexts of interpretation.",
