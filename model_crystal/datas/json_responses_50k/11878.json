    "summary": "I'm truly passionate about the work in the proactive and continuously changing public transport sector. There are always new opportunities to improve the business and its processes.\n\nAfter a busy working day there are quite some hobbies to spend evenings and weekend on. Apart from traveling the world, organising the ICGT U19 International Youth Football Tournament is quite interesting year round. Organising this tournament with teams such as Manchester United, Palmeiras and Real Madrid gives a boost of positive energy.\n\nMy MBA and BA I enjoyed at the VU (Vrije Universiteit) Amsterdam in the area of Biotechnology. In my spare time I followed Archeology classes as a part of a side study at the Universities of Amsterdam (UvA), Groningen (RUG) and Leiden (RUL). I was lucky enough to be able to combine both these interests in a trainee period at University College in London (UCL).\n\nA few more key words that summarise me :\nanalytic | efficient | stress resistent | proactive | structured | reliable | public transport | logistics\n\nI\u2019m always interested in hearing from former colleagues and youth academies from around the world, so feel free to connect or drop me a line at asmmusee@gmail.com",
