    "summary": "Tri M. Tran is currently an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at the University of Groningen. Tri earned his doctorate in Operations Management from Aalto University (#1 business school in Finland), his master\u2019s degree in Operations Research from Aalto University, and his CEMS master's degree in International Management from Aalto University and Ivey Business School (#1 MBA program in Canada). His undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Science in Business Technology from Aalto University.\n\nAs a person, he is efficient, deadline-driven, result-oriented, organized, and disciplined. He graduated one semester early as the valedictorian with a perfect GPA with my double master's degree from the top business school in Finland. He then completed his doctoral studies at the same university in 2.5 years, 1.5 years shorter than the normative length of 4 years, and also with a perfect GPA. All of these were achieved while working approximately 25 hours per week.\n\nFurthermore, he is a reservist in the Finnish military. He completed my military service in 2020 with perfect scores (5/5: excellent) across all categories. His military training also supports his professional work in terms of discipline, endurance, and integrity. \n\nEmail: tri.tran@rug.nl",
