I investigate personal and group factors, in particular (mis)perceptions of values, and how these guide individuals' behaviours.

We will examine past experience, policy design and implementation solutions to identify strategies that can enable a successful transition. We will achieve this by addressing climate, economic, and social challenges. In order to do so, we will draw on economic methods of decision making and policy evaluation, and sociology, political sciences and psychology to capture the multidimensional outcomes and implications of different climate policy instruments. Moreover, we will produce a number of new datasets, and apply state-of-the-art methods to produce new insights on policy perception and performance. Finally, we will integrate the scientific evidence, an interactive stakeholder dialogue, and various dissemination channels including a new online policy tool as a user-oriented service for climate policy-makers at the EU, national, and local level. Taken together, the methodological and empirical advancements will provide broader evidence for desirable climate strategies in Europe, along with lessons for the rest of the world.\n\nResearch team: EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE, INSTITUT D ECONOMIE SCIENTIFIQUE ET DE GESTION, POTSDAM-INSTITUT FUR KLIMAFOLGENFORSCHUNG EV, CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS, MERCATOR RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON GLOBAL COMMONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE (MCC) GGMBH, UNIVERSITAT AUTONOMA DE BARCELONA, UNIVERZITA KARLOVA, CRIMI JACOPO, EIDGENOESSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZUERICH, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN\n\nDoi: https://doi.org/10.3030/101056891\n\nWebsite: Capable Climate \u2013 Climate Policy Acceptability Economic framework",

Yet, ECs\u2019 success is limited by two main factors: (1) grid capacity at distribution system level, and (2) the ability and willingness of people, public and private entities to engage in joint activities in the energy sector by means of forming a \u201ccommunity\u201d. This project investigates whether \u201cmobile\u201d ECs, based on electrical vehicles, can address these limitations. Specifically, electrical vehicles provide opportunities for: (1) energy transport outside the fixed grid, and (2) broadening the range of communities that can form ECs.\n\nResearch team: dr.

To achieve this, TeSoPs will connect, combine and integrate state-of-the-art insights from Engineering, Economics and Business Science, and Social Sciences in an integrative framework, which we will translate in a full-system energy model that will be validated and advanced throughout the project\u2019s duration. Importantly, our interdisciplinary and integrative approach enables us to uncover and investigate interactions, dependencies and integrations between energy carriers/grids, system components and grid levels that have been largely neglected by earlier \u2013 more unidimensional/disciplinary specific \u2013 research. Based on our models and research, we will assess how different transitions in the heating system (i.e., mainly focusing on reducing the dependency on gas) impact, interact and depend on the wider energy system.\n\nResearch team: dr.

            "description": "Smart grids promise a formation of a reliable electricity infrastructure that can meet demand with a high security of supply under possibly varying and affordable prices. While the energy is generated in a distributed fashion using solar panels, wind turbines and combined heat-power systems, it can be also stored, for example, using batteries. For such formation to be realized, an electricity infrastructure linking households, commercial buildings and industrial buildings needs control options and interventions that are efficient, intelligent and socially acceptable. Such options and interventions require an interdisciplinary approach that integrates multiple technological and social science disciplines. We propose an interdisciplinary framework that uses innovative control methods and intelligent automated techniques to improve the demand/supply matching that are acceptable to end-users. We develop distributed control methods that combine financial and social incentives with the physics of the electricity infrastructure in an optimal way. Within the electricity infrastructure, we focus on buildings where sensors collect indoor information. We realize intelligent techniques that use that information and automatically coordinate the use of HVAC and appliances in accordance to the infrastructure situation (congestion, energy prices, control signals) and end-user needs. Here, we examine which and why financial and social incentives are acceptable and effective to promote demand and supply matching among end-users. This knowledge provides the means to realize sustainable smart grids in which energy demand is matched to the local supply of energy. We first evaluate our framework in simulated and living-lab settings, and next apply the framework to the \u201cPower Matching City\u201d field lab in the north of the Netherlands.",

Specifically, we study how people perceive threats from far away outgroups, and how these perceptions of distant intergroup threats impact more local relations with for instance immigrants. We connect our research to current situations, such as the Arab spring, the expansion of the European Union, global terrorist threats, and the global economic downturn.",

There are many examples in which host-society members either welcome (e.g., link) or oppose  (e.g., link) to immigrants entering their country. What are the psychological motives behind these opinions and where are these opinions based on? We will specifically focus on how public opinion is affected by the media and politics. How can they inform host-society members about immigrants without inducing stereotypes and prejudice? And how can they report on calamities (e.g., New Year\u2019s eve in Cologne, Brussels and Paris terrorist attacks) without causing unfounded negative generalizations? Based on discussions with policy makers who deal with these kind of issues and psychological theory, we aim to develop recommendations on how to inform citizens about immigration and associated issues."
