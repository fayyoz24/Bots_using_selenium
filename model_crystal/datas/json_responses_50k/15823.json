    "summary": "I am a propaedeutic student at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Communication Technology (ICT) program.\n\nMy name is Robin Buijsen, I am 18 years old and I live in Ubachsberg with my parents and two brothers. In my spare time I spend a lot of time hanging out with my friends and going to the gym. Besides my school, I have two part-time jobs, at Shell and ITLimburg. I work at both companies one day a week, at shell at the weekend and at ITLimburg during the week.\n\nSince this year I have been following my HBO-ICT education at Hogeschool Zuyd in Heerlen, this study lasts a total of four years. During the training we are challenged in the form of casus assignments, where we have to apply our knowledge and skills to find the right solution and ultimately realize it. In addition, I get to know all the different directions in the ICT world, such as security, servers, interaction design or programming. The direction of interaction design interests me the most at the moment, so I chose this in my second year of study.\n\nI still remember whether I want to continue with a master's or start working after my education. I also like a challenge and adventure, so maybe I'll even take a gap year to make a trip. In any case, I am extremely curious and enthusiastic about what the future has to offer.",
