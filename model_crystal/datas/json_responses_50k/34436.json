    "summary": "After studying Catholic and Protestant theology in Paris, T\u00fcbingen, Amsterdam and Bonn I specialized in church history and more specifically in Martin Luther (1483-1546) and the history of Lutheranism.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Luther was controversial in many ways, he remains a thought provoking and influential theologian. Being the first reformer of the 16th century, Luther stood at the beginning of a tradition, being represented nowadays by \u00b1 74 million Lutherans worldwide. \n\nThis inspires researchers in many countries to study Luther. I have enjoyed being part of this international research community for more than twenty years.\n\nThe focus of my research is twofold:\n\nI combine Luther research with the history of the Lutherans in the Netherlands.\n\nWhat fascinates me in the research on the Dutch Lutherans is that they remained a religious minority. They had to establish themselves and survive without the protection of a Lutheran authority, opposite a dominant Reformed Church and amidst other religious minorities. Dutch Lutheran congregations owe their growth in the 16th and the 17th century to a large extent to migration, particularly from Germany and Scandinavia: Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\nThose are the countries where Lutheranism became a main confession and they provide an excellent comparative framework for my research on the Dutch Lutherans and the context of their confessional coexistence. Collaboration with colleagues working on Germany and Scandinavia is essential for my research. \n \nAs the Lutheran reformation did not only have impact on theology and church, but also on politics, economy, religious life, (material) culture, law and the arts, my research benefits greatly from an interdisciplinary approach that includes input from those disciplines. \n\nMy aim is to make Luther's theology and Dutch Lutheranism more visible within the topography of the Dutch religious and cultural landscape, as well as within the broader context of global Lutheranism.",

My responsibility is research on the relations between the Netherlands and Denmark, Norway and Sweden and their impact on the Protestant and more specific Lutheran heritage. The comparison is so interesting because Lutheranism in the Nordic countries became the dominant religion through the Reformation, whereas in the Netherlands it remained a minority religion. \nThe research uses a multifaceted approach and explores sources at the intersection of several disciplines such as e.g. (church) history, religious cultures, memory studies, art history and topography.\n\nMy output from the MEMORY project includes:\n'The Coming of Age of the Lutheran Congregation in Early Modern Amsterdam'\u200b, Journal of Early Modern Christianity 3 (2016/1), 1-29.\n\nThere have been four MEMORY panels at international conferences.

In the course of the Dutch Revolt the political leadership in the Northern Provinces changed from Catholic to Protestant. As a result the Reformed church became the public church. But even though this public church had the most rights, financial support and the highest visibility, there where other religious communities striving for representation in the public space. \n\nAmong these religious communities were the Jews, the Lutherans, the Mennonites/Doopsgezinden, the Arminians and the Catholics. \n\nWe studied source material from and about these religious traditions to get an impression of how religious coexistence functioned in the Early Modern Low Countries. \nThis included texts - in their original printed editions of the 16th and 17th century, paintings, material and memorial culture. \nMost of the classes took place on location: \n- the Special Collections Library of the University of Amsterdam \n- the Ets Haim Jewish Research Library at the Portuguese Synagoge (Amsterdam) \n- Museum Catharijneconvent (Utrecht). \n\nWe had guided tours of the Old Lutheran Church, the hidden Doopsgezinde Church, the hidden Catholic Church Our Lord of the Attic, the Portuguese Synagogue and the Old Church (all in Amsterdam). \n\nThe design of the Summer School allowed the participants to not only study but also experience the tangible footprints the various traditions left in the religious landscape of the Low Countries.",
