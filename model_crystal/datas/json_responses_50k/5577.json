    "summary": "I am a proactive and driven person with a strong background in change and transformation initiatives as well as supporting business operations. After four years of project management experience in securities services at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, I participated in the integration of TNT's and FedEx's value chains for three years as a transformation analyst. In 2021, I joined Project44 (SaaS) as an EMEA Program Manager to deliver operational business value to enterprise customers. I recently joined ING's Global Process management team in Amsterdam to help shape process standards and raise operational excellence. My main industry experience to date have been in tech, logistic and financial services. \n\nI have demonstrated the ability to combine creativity, business strategy and teamwork to drive diverse projects in both small and large organizations while delivering targeted business value. My desire to meet new people and get to know different cultures brought me to study and work across Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. I am proficient in French, English and German. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy exercising (trek, soccer) and travelling around to discover new places. Most importantly, I take time to read whatever falls into my hands even though I have a strong preference for Contemporary issues, Science Fiction and History ones.",
