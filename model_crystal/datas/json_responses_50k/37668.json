Being part of INUA team (Nokia - UN Women Collaboration that seeks to promote STEM education for schoolgirls in Kenya) and having the opportunity to connect to girls to share my knowledge to encourage and inspire them to study STEM is so precious.\n\n Within the INUA team, my main role was content creation on the topics; \u201cthe journey of IP packets through telecommunication devices\u201d and \u201cbasics of telecommunications\u201d and I created a short video and a booklet.\n\nThe creation of this video helped me to answer the question \u201cWhat does Nokia do mummy?\u201d raised by my kids. And it is being used in Kenya when we visit the schools to encourage girls for STEM education.  \n\nI hope you also watch it, enjoy it, and hare to encourage girls for STEM education.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nvJ4jhy_lWs"
