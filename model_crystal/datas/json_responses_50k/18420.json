This is what they think:\nH: Wow, this a cool thing; beautiful design; if I own it, all my friends would admire me.\nU: Looks like this phone is very intuitive to use. And has lots of functions to support my daily activities.\nG: I want a screwdriver, open it, understand how it works and modify it.\nH\u2019s attitude is called hedonistic \u2013 oriented towards pleasure and identity. U\u2019s attitude is usability-oriented, emphasizing utility and efficiency. Both these styles of product perception are well known from numerous studies and have become canonical for evaluating quality of interactive products.\nBut, is the HU model really sufficient? See how G\u2019s attitude differs. G exhibits a deeper relation with technology, being more a creator of technology than a mere consumer. The goal is to find out more about people having such an intimate relation to technology: \n\u2022\tCan geekism be thought of as a personality structure? \n\u2022\tWhat drives a geek?\n\u2022\tHow would one measure geekism?\n\u2022\tHow would one design products for geeks?",
