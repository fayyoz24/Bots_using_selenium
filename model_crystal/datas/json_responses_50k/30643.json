I gained expertise in handling advanced X-ray sources, operating 2D detectors, and building functional batteries. I programmed Python codes for automating data collection via a 6-axis hexapod stage, and analyzed time-resolved X-ray scattering data using Python modules PyFAI and PyFABIO. Additionally, I observed cathode degradation by fitting diffraction peaks with Levenberg-Marquardt curve fits.",
