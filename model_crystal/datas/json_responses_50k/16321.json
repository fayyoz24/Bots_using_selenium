    "summary": "The question of 'how to include' in governance, is now more pertinent than ever. Yet, we face new economic constraints in answering this question for the reason it is asked. How can we support inclusion during a pandemic? \n\nI research how to include vulnerable groups and ecologies in inclusiveness and sustainability policies/ projects but from the perspective of predicting and avoiding negative outcomes.  This is uniquely suited to times of new challenges with less financing. This inter-disciplinary PhD is reflective of my background as a sociologist and anthropologist and experiences in diversity, labour market, inclusive health, sustainability policy and projects among others.  \n\n\n",
