    "summary": "I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Management with a specialization in Strategic Marketing at Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Business and Economics. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in marketing as part of the International Business program at Maastricht University, which I completed in 2021.\n\nNext to my studies, I am currently a Business Development working student at Kickbase, where I have the opportunity to combine my passion for the beautiful game of football with the theoretical knowledge acquired during my studies.\n\nI have always been surrounded by a diverse and international environment. My Bachelor's degree in Maastricht further exposed me to a wide range of cultures and markets, enabling me to build a robust network and expand my knowledge in these areas.\n\nI have a strong desire to continue learning and growing, and I look forward to connecting with others in my field.",
