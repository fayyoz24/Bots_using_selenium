You might also be working on a new funding round. \n\nIn order to make the next phase of growth a success, founders and their team need copies of themselves with the same knowledge and expertise. Budgets are limited therefore you are more likely to hire junior Marketing & Sales team members. However, this does not always result in the best outcome. \n\nCurious how I can support you? https://www.sabinebeuk.nl/",
