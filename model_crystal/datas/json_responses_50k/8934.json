Main areas of my research interests include the organization of political parties, especially the new anti-establishment and populist parties, mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. Political parties in the Czech context are the main actors on the political scene, and the success of new anti-establishment parties represents a significant change in the politics of a number of post-communist countries, including the Czech Republic. That is why it makes sense to deal with their influence on ours politics and society. In this research position, I analyze the parties of political entrepreneurs. Specifically, their influence on the party system in the Czech Republic and the role of personalization of political parties and populism in Czech society in the period during and after the pandemic.",

The majority of party systems in European democracies witness a relatively recent phenomenon of new anti-establishment parties electorally succeeding at the expense of their established counterparts. My research deals with the relationship between the electoral success of anti-establishment parties and their party organization. The chief objective of this dissertation is to find the evidence demonstrating which party organizational features matter for the electoral success of these parties. To achieve this goal, firstly, I designed a single case-study of new Czech anti-establishment party called ANO, analysing three of its party organizational aspects (local party organization, party membership and the party elite). Secondly, I conduct a comparative analysis of ANO with three other parties \u2013 Austrian TS, Slovak O\u013daNO and Italian FI.\nThe findings indicate that party stability, cohesion and legitimacy (stemming from the controllable approach towards local party organization, party membership and the party elite) facilitate electoral success. This strategy includes limiting the autonomy of local branches, implementing restrictions on traditional individual membership, and the recruitment of professionally-linked party elite. The above party organizational setup is achieved partially via the existence and operation of a corporate network of individuals professionally dependent on the party leader's business. The anti-establishment party built in the way suggested above seems to be better equipped to react to the scandals and to manage these scandals more effectively to avoid a negative impact on its public image. Such an ability to attain control over the party organization helps these parties to avoid the negative consequences of their scandals.",
