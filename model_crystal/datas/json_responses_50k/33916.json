In 2005, I obtained a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering from the University of Amsterdam and since then I have obtained many years of work experience as IT consultant. From 2012 to 2021, I have worked and lived in Oslo, Norway and since September 2021 I live in the Netherlands again and work as an independent IT consultant.\n\nIn my work I am committed to find creative and simple solutions while guaranteeing high quality software development. In past projects I have taken on various roles, including senior developer, architect, and team leader. I have also worked as a technical specialist for system integrations.\n\nI am a certified scrum master and committed to ensuring that software development is carried out smoothly and test-driven.
