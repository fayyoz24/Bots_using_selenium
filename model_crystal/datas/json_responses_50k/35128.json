Full traceability of the food chain is required and is a prerequisite for invoicing. In OpenText Extended ECM a solution of related Business Workspaces was created to store relevant certificates from suppliers, shippers, etc.. Documents were distributed to customers whereby ownership could change, or be split, while products were still in transit. Using dashboards and reporting, completeness of required documentation was monitored, allowing timely availability of all relevant contract information, and expediting invoicing.\n\nFor Contracts department, a form-based solution was developed to semi-automatic generate commercial sales and purchase contracts, and have them internally approved via OpenText workflow. Barcodes were added to contracts, allowing them to be automatically filed into OpenText Extended ECM upon scanning of the counter-signed document.",

SABIC is the Middle East's largest petrochemicals company and worldwide number-four player in polyolefins. In addition, SABIC is active in chemicals, fertilizers, and metals. SABIC Europe is responsible for all SABIC activities in Europe.\n\nSABIC has introduced a new way of working that allowed staff to work independent of person, location and paper in an open office environment. To support this concept, a new European state-of-the art head-office was built. OpenText Content Server was selected as solution for Document Management, Collaboration, and Records Management.\n\nIn this project roles as Project Manager and Functional Consultant were fulfilled, managing an implementation team of 5-6 consultants. \n\nOpenText Content Server with Records Management was implemented for all departments in SABIC's new head-office and production plants, as well as in its sales office in Europe. Concepts for publishing, collaboration, authorization and records management were designed and implemented. System usage was measured against the objectives of SABIC\u2019s new way of working and departments were actively engaged to improve system usage.",
