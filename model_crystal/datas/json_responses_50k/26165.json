Glue suppliers were also interviewed, as well as internal board mill managers and food factory managers to find out the most important side seam properties in board converting.\n\nA literature research was made in combination with interview results to make a summary of all the possible issues that could cause failure of the glue seam in board converting and the following steps in the supply chain.\nBase on the finding from literature and interviews the traditional seam test done by peeling with hands was improved and more sophisticated methods developed, resulting into a fully repeatable test combining mechanical and optical analysis that can tell you almost all you need to know about performance of the side seam between the glue and the paper board.\nAfter the thesis and method development, the concept has been utilised to solve claims regarding side seam gluing issues very successfully in the company enabling to gain cost savings and more deeper knowledge regarding packaging industry as such.",
