    "summary": "After 4 years as an Immigration and Corporate lawyer I decided to look for new opportunities in the field of Sustainability and Environmental Law. I wanted to finally align my core interests (environmental protection, climate change, circular economy etc.) with my professional career. \n\nWorking in an organisation driven by the same principles I cherish was a goal I was very much set on and I was lucky enough to be hired as a Customer Support Agent at Fairphone, the leader in Sustainable Consumer Electronics.\n\nIn addition to my professional and academic training as a lawyer I bring innate managerial skills that I had the opportunity to develop as the Assistant Director of my former Law Firm and substantial knowledge about Sustainability and Environmental Law. \n\nIf you are interested in working with me feel free to message me as I am always happy to discuss new opportunities.",
