Our networking switching software, Cumulus Linux, is the only solution that allows you to affordably build and efficiently operate your network like the world\u2019s largest data center operators \u2013 unlocking vertical network stacks.\n\nInstead of focusing on siloed solutions, at Cumulus Networks, we transform every stage of the networking lifecycle \u2014 from architecture, design, build, deployment and operations \u2014 with our two core solutions, Cumulus Linux and Cumulus NetQ. Cumulus Linux is the most flexible network operating system available because it runs on Linux. Our customers access flexibility, efficiency, speed and choice with a unified stack and a feature set designed for the digital age. With Cumulus NetQ, we empower organizations with full network validation and reduced downtime and even extend network visibility into containers.\n\nThe network is a critical part of the data center that has traditionally been a bottleneck for rapid deployment of applications. From provisioning and deployment to monitoring and operations, we believe in completely transforming the industry by enabling a web-scale IT architectural approach.\n\nWe are not just defining the future of networking. We are actively creating it with our customers and partners.",
