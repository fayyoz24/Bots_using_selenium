They can also add camera to their app\u2019s database or even send it to the main database, which of course needs other users validation to get into the update list, to prevent fake data getting into database and ruining user experience and trust in app. This was a challenge which I solved by defining a parameter that a number of user must define a given point or 50m around it as a speed camera, so no speed cam with less than 3 unique users validation was marked as validated cam.

            "description": "in this project, we tried to prevent the user from going back to sleep after he/she is woken up by alarm. This is somehow a common thing that people snooze their phone for multiple times! in Walk2Wake there is no \u201cturn off\u201d button, nor \u201csnooze\u201d button!\u2028The only way to turn the alarm off, is to walk a few meter. This distance is subject to change in setting and user may change from 2m to 20m to turn the alarm off, as well as loudness of the alarm or vibrating while alarming.\nThe most valuable lesson I learnt from this project was working with mathematical filters to calculate phone moving around, but not cheating. Walk2Wake is somehow smart in this manner, if you slide your phone, or move it around yourself to fake the walking it will understand it and even alert you to stop cheating!",
