This need is only growing since the industry requires more automation, higher accuracies and additional flexibility. The increased accuracy and flexibility also requires more complex models and traditional linear, finite-dimensional models will not suffice.\n\nExtensive research has been conducted during this period on particle filtering with applications to tracking and detection of objects by radar, sensor management and speeding-up techniques in data fusion. Particle filtering is a fast growing field of signal processing that is particularly useful for filtering of signals from noise in highly nonlinear or hybrid systems. This research is done in intensive collaboration with the technology giant Thales.\n\nhttp://www.math.utwente.nl/ssb/index.html",
