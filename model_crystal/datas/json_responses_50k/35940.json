This innovative and path-breaking project will help local communities to build resilient, equitable and sustainable futures. The goal of WEGO-ITN is to provide research that will demonstrate to policy makers how communities actively sustain and care for their environment and community well-being. Ultimately, WEGO will collectively provide important guides to strategies of resilience and sustainability that are required for meeting the SDGs. \n\nThe WEGO-ITN is made up of scholar-activists working on feminist political ecology from ten institutions in five European Union countries: Germany, Italy, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom and eight institutions from six countries for training and secondments: Australia, India, Indonesia, Italy, Uruguay and USA.\n\nThe purpose of WEGO-ITN funded by the European Commission (2018-2022) is to develop a shared research and training agenda in order to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary social-environmental scientists on feminist political ecology in Europe. WEGO-ITN will research diverse economic and ecological practices that create new forms of gender relations, livelihoods and care activities, in response to growing lack of resilience of the economy and ecosystem. Through co-supervision by academics and non-academic partners, WEGO-ITN PhDs will engage in critical, practical, and creative exploration of the contribution and relationships between their individual doctoral study projects across the three interconnecting research themes: 1. Climate Change, Economic Development and Extractivism; 2. Commoning, Community Economies and the Politics of Care; and 3. Nature/Culture/ Embodiment and Technologies.",

            "description": "The social impacts of climate change mitigation strategies (biofuels, REDD+) and large-scale land acquisitions (land grabs) have captured the attention of scholars, practitioners, government and civil society actors. Most relevant research, however, investigates these processes separately and within discrete areas such as particular landholdings where dispossession or competing land resource claims occur. This project expands the boundaries of the problem to the landscape level, believing that the intersection of these phenomena can produce social and ecological spill-over effects and chain reactions which in turn ignite new or aggravate old sets of competing claims and conflicts over resources within a much larger area. Through collaborative, case study action research, the project seeks to understand the interplay between climate change mitigation initiatives and land grabs from a landscape perspective \u2013 including spatial, social, ecological and institutional dimensions \u2013 and resulting trajectories of conflict and cooperation in two fragile states: Myanmar and Cambodia.",
