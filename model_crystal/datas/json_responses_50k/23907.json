While our secondary research informs us about Tapsell and its uniqueness in comparison to other successful online student marketplaces, our primary research (surveys, focus groups, experimentations) allows us to take a comprehensive look at consumers\u2019 usages, preferences and interactions among online student marketplaces. These insights will then be deliberately taken into the derivation of Tapsell\u2019s competitive edges which will be broadly advertised and emphasizes before, during and after the launch. \n\nThis final report documents our 3 months of researching, analyzing, brainstorming and executing the I\u2019d Tap That Launch. It consists of our research strategy, our analysis with recommendations for product development as well as brand promotion and most importantly I\u2019d Tap That Launch\u2019s evaluations.",

Since its foundation, Mary Kay has broken the boundaries between buyer and seller, and has enriched women\u2019s lives with caring and personalized service. Today, Mary Kay takes on the challenge of connecting with a new generation of females that we call NOW Millennials \u2013 Generation Y females that are Networked, Open-minded, and Worldly. \n\nThrough six months of market research on various platforms, including focus groups, on-site interviews, and online surveys, we identified that the primary disconnect between these NOW Millennials and Mary Kay, was the perception that Mary Kay was not a brand that catered to the millennial generation. After thorough assessment of this problem, our team has conceptualized a solution that will captivate the NOW Millennial, a girl that we\u2019ve identified as a cultural aficionado, a creative innovator, an experience seeker and most of all, a girl who lives in the moment and for the moment.\n\nBased on these observations, our team has crafted the \u201cMake Up Your Moment\u201d campaign - a movement that realizes and embraces how each NOW Millennial defines her moment. In this targeted campaign, traditional advertisements, PR events, and social media will be utilized to shape the persona of the \u201cMary Kay girl\u201d and help the NOW Millennial imagine, create, document, and share their own \u201cMary Kay Moments.\u201d We will leverage several creative channels in our campaign, from music and video streaming to mobile applications, in order to be a part of every moment our NOW Millennial interacts with this ever-changing world.",
