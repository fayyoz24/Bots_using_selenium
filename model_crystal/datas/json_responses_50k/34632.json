In this role I am responsible for developing and leading Extrema\u2019s partnership initiatives with mainly big household names like Coca Cola, Red Bull, Unilever, Bavaria, Asics and Rabobank.\nI work closely with the marketing and creative team to identify and develop strong, mutually beneficial relationships. Not only did we have fun creating these campaigns, but we also found it rewarding to see the results. \nMy most exciting work to date was seeing these brands continuing their partnership with our festivals and to close new partnerships with not only beverage brands but also companies in the fashion, financial, telecom or other industries.\nBesides this I am also the food manager of most of Extrema\u2019s festivals selecting the finest caterers and staying on trend in snack and food development. \n\nBefore joining Extrema; I worked for Paylogic; a ticketing system for event organizations where I was lucky enough to work with event organizations like Tomorrowland, ID&T, Alda, and Awakenings. Before Paylogic I actually worked for 5 years already at Extrema; I started out as a PA for the CEO but quickly gained more responsibilities like catering, partnerships and several financial activities. \n\nI\u2019m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with colleagues or other people in the event business. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client to understand his or her business objectives. As we go through that collaborative process ideas are being transformed into a brand activation which drives consumer engagement and awareness before, during and after the festival. Working together with the caterers to make sure our visitors enjoy our hospitality and to finally enjoy the festivals after months of preparation is proof our hard work has paid off.",
