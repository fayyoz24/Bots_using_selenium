The two big metal sheds are transformed into multi-purpose halls, housing a variety of athletic venues, while pool facilities are provided in a lower concrete building.

Together with my colleagues Yusufoglu Aykut and Figas Marios, we chose to design a Hotel and spa complex, a project inspired by earlier courses. \n\nThe complex consists of two separate volumes. One houses the hotel, complete with a restaurant and secondary facilities, while the other houses a complete spa unit. \n\nOur main goal was to create emotion through design. The visitor, walking through the spa, charts a \"path towards the light\". Starting from the dark areas of the changing rooms, the light gradually guides the visitor through the spa facilities, bringing him to contact with earthy materials (cast concrete, stone, wood), with the final destination being the water and the natural environment in the outdoor pool. The light, or lack thereof, and the selection of the materials which were used, give a special identity to the design, which actively contributes to one's physiological well-being. ",
