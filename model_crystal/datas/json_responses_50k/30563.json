    "summary": "I am a commercial driven senior technical consultant with more than 26 years of experience in the Test & Measurement market.  \n\nIn my current role, as Technical Accountmanager at CN Rood, started May 6 of 2015, I serve our customers in the Benelux and Sweden with testsolutions for their measurement needs, where I aim for mutual win-win.   My expertise is the area of electrical characterization of materials, devices and submodules from research up to production.  Brands I am focussing on include Keithley ( a Tektronix company ) and EXFO Photonic solutions, and MPI probestations.   Main markets which I serve include Semiconductor and Photonics.\nIn addition, I provide customers with data-acquistion  and (industrial) datalogging applications with solutions from VTI, DataTaker, Delphin.    Finally I am also active in the market for Wireless Testing Solutions with the brand LitePoint ( a Teradyne company).\n\nPrior to my current position, I have been for more than 22 years at Keithley Instruments ( a Tektronix company ), most of the years as Field Application Engineer,  proposing solutions for the measurement requirements of customers working on material and device characterization from Research up to Production.  Other activities included after sales support, and business development, in which I actively guides sales channels on new business opportunities.  The area I served included Benelux, UK, Ireland, Nordics and Isra\u00ebl.\n\nPrior to Keithley, I have worked at Philips Optoelectronics as a research assistant, where I was responsible for one of the process steps in making laser diodes.\n\nI have a background on Applied Physics (professional bachelor level ( HTS ) ) followed by Solid State courses at Philips, and product, market and sales courses ( incl Miller Heimann ) at Keithley \n\nWin-win, professionalism, and integrity are my key motivators.",
