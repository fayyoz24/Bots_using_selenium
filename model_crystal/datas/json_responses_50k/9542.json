Designing and facilitating strategic change processes, retreats and learning journey\u2019s for global leaders and organisations is my passion. I also love conducting research and doing the analytical ground work. \n\nI worked in Egypt and the Middle East for six years, supporting civil society organisations, startups and small and medium businesses in their leadership, effectiveness and growth, providing technical training, seed grants, team development and gaining access to investment. \n\nBefore that I was an advisor to the Dutch public sector, having done projects in parliament, many ministries and educational institutions on dialogue and co-creation processes, research, strategic policy assessments and facilitating think-tank sessions. \n\nIn 2011 I co-founded Sunryse, a foundation that guides young people in their personal leadership and the courage to take their own dreams and imagination seriously. \n\nI work in Dutch, English and German, and my Egyptian Arabic is slowly but surely getting up to speed.",
