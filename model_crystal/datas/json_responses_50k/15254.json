            "description": "The thesis examines the effectiveness of firms\u2019 usage of online social platforms as an emerging and innovative corporate strategy. To this purpose, I categorized firms\u2019 online social media communication activities into paid, owned, and earned media activities, and tested their effects on consumers\u2019 purchase intention, respectively. Moreover, I analysed the effect of brand awareness on consumers\u2019 purchase intention.The project employs a quantitative approach based on binary logistic regression on survey data. The results show that users of social networking websites rely on firms\u2019 owned and earned media activities, as well as, brand awareness when they intend to purchase products/ services online.",
