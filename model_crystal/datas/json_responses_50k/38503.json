I provided expert environmental guidance during site selection. For approximately 30 selected sites I coordinated all aspects of the environmental assessments and wrote the formal assessment reports on behalf of the client in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. For each assessment I oversaw all aspects of coordination with relevant federal, state, and local agencies, Native Americans, and other interested parties, analysed potential impacts, and recommended specific mitigations as needed.",
