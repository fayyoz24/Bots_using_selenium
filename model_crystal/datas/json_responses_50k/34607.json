Established in 1990 in the Netherlands. The developed products are suitable for mass production and are targeted to the mass consumer. These products are manufactured according the specifications at the lowest cost from manufacturer [Europe and China] direct to the client. The market segments focus is mainly on houseware, appliances and specialty non-food consumer products.\nWhen I joined Meccano in 2001 I became the first in-house product designer. A structured product development process was not something which was commonplace. My responsibility was during this initial start-up to elaborate all the internal and customers requested products and projects. The elaboration contains not only the development of industrial mass production articles but in some cases even a special packaging for these products. Product analysis, competitor analysis, patent analysis, production plant communication, design, production audits etc. are scales which evolved rapidly in many different markets, materials  and products. Project examples are a toothpaste dispenser,  a corkscrew, a toothpick including brush, lunchbox \u201cSandwich\u201d and lunchbox \u201cGruitbox\u201d .\nIn 2004 the team expanded with more designers. This results in a tight collaboration of this team and clear division of product parts during complex projects such as the PUC coffee machine. Also a clear process in the development becomes more essential for project take-over.\n\nAwards:\nLunchbox \u201cGruitbox\u201d: AGF Trend Award 2005",

The head office was based in Naarden with O.E.M. factories in China, Dong Guang City and for some products in Naarden. The Wuppie is one of their best promotional products of the last decade. More than 55 million have been sold worldwide and it is still a unique promotional product. Countless numbers of models are available. \nI started as a graphic designer+ to make sure all the promotional items were provided with a  graphic design [e.g. AddClock and backer cards.] Main interpretation of this position was executive and the procedure and communicative center between customers, printers and production plant. The next stage was becoming more responsible for the development of new promotional items. Unfortunately economics  cut the available budgets for this development and my position became redundant.",
