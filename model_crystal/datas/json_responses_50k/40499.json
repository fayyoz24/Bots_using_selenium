The main focus is to explore the relevance of frugal innovation on specific health platforms such as Digital health and how frugal innovations are offered on retail platforms.\n\nThe second project was to investigate the relationship between inequality and Covid-19, or, more specifically, community resilience initiatives (CRIs) concerning Covid-19 (these CRIs are often frugal). The main research question is: How do urban community resilience initiatives emerge and develop within different governance contexts amidst the COVID19 pandemic? To broaden the research target, I translated the survey into Dutch to include local initiatives in this project. Most importantly, due to remote working, disciplines such as working independently, persistency, and problem-solving mindset were crucial skills to finalize the research.",
