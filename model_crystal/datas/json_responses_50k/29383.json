    "summary": "Proactive engineer that uses advanced computer simulations in order to improve the performance of systems and or products.\n\nWorldwide experience on CFD and Crowd modelling projects for multiple industries. \n\nOur mission is to support designers in all sort of segments that require in depth knowledge about the physics that take place in their particular discipline. The combination of your expertise and yours will enable us to accelerate and find the next generation of solutions.\n\nAs simulations are our core business we have invested in the required knowledge, software and hardware to deliver you accurate and useable results within an acceptable time frame. CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations is our main activity. For this type of simulations we have a High Performance Computing cluster of 128 cores interconnected by a dedicated network. We use ANSYS CFD (CFX and Fluent) for the simulations, which is known to be one of the best multipurpose CFD software worldwide.\n",

The simulation shows that the free falling base de-accellerates starting at about 10 m from the seabed before a smooth landing occurs. The simulation has been performed using ANSYS CFX with a 3D model containing 10 million grid cells which took a 27 parallel processor computer about 10 hours to analyse. With this run the relation beteen ballast overweight, fall velocity and water evacuation velocity over the seabed has been determined. ",
