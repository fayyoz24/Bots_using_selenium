I had a variety of duties next to sketching and modelling, including guiding of brainstorm sessions, communication with customers, managing the planning, budgeting and researching market trends. In 2018 I also officially became part-time project manager for the optic team. \nOne of my key projects was working together with Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) to co-develop a revolutionary LED/Socket system for the professional lighting market. It offers improvements in the circular economy, allows late-stage finishing, and integrated a host of specialized features that benefit the many stakeholders.
