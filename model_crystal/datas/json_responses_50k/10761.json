    "summary": "I want to contribute in the creation of tangible products and I have a passion for technology. It gives me great energy to help a product grow from just an idea towards a complete product, with a demonstrated history of working in the electronic, metal and plastic manufacturing industry. For the new product development, I use my innovative and creative skills together with my technical background to solve the puzzles. \nSolving these puzzles are team efforts, including the customer and suppliers. I'm a proven team player that knows how to align these stakeholders. \nPeople tell me that I\u2019m a passionate and wide interested person, but the end result matters me the most. Therefore I think of the final solution and I take initiatives to make it happen. ",

People use elements of the organization in their communication because they are logical and the 'right' way. These elements are actually assumptions. As these assumptions are unknown for individuals from other organization, it results in problems in the product development. \n\nAn example: your organization creates scissors. At your organization all pairs of scissors are always made for right and left handed persons, because why wouldn't they? When you collaborate with an organization that produces always right handed pairs of scissors, because most people are, you can run in to misunderstandings, errors and delays.\n\nI created an interactive workshop to improve the communication between organizations so the outcome of the product development is more successful.",
