    "summary": "As a Learning Support Assistant at The British School in The Netherlands, I supported the learning and development of students with diverse needs and backgrounds. I worked with teachers and parents to create and implement individualized education plans, monitor progress, and provide feedback. I also tutored students in various subjects and helped them improve their language and literacy skills.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience as an Early Years Teacher, I have a passion for educating and nurturing young children. I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology Sociology and a Primary school teacher qualification from the University of Bucharest College of Teachers. I have developed and delivered engaging and effective curricula, lesson plans, and assessments that align with current learning goals and standards. I have also demonstrated strong leadership and communication skills, as well as a high level of professionalism and dedication, in various educational settings and contexts.",
