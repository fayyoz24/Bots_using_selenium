In the present moment we have a sample with over 4000 Portuguese TAW and we are preparing another dada collection witch will occur in the first trimester of 2014. \nIn the end, the main aspiration of this project and of these partnerships is to accomplish a longitudinal study with different times of collection, so we can follow the same TAW over time.
