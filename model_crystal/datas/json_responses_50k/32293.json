    "summary": "Currently at work at XS4ALL with the following skills:\n- sales\n- retention\n- client service\n- technical helpdesk\n- Business to business.\n\nXS4ALL internet provider is well known in the Netherlands because it was Holland's first Internet provider. As a startup its growth became possible due to the Dutch telecom giant KPN, although this was not always a happy marriage. XS4All became famous due to their focus: Quality First in hardware and internet lines, extra attention on security and privacy. And a different approach to customer service. It is still known for its extremely high customer satisfaction ratings. We do things differently and more personally. \n\nPeter fullheartedly started working for XS4ALL in january 2017. But was already fulltime active in the customer care business itself since 2009. Worked for several companies like Xerox customer care (with clients like Eneco, CanalDigitaal and HollandsNieuwe), Randstad, Cygnific (KLM-AirFrance-Delta and other airlines) and  Customer Care Contact Center (for a multitude of clients like Vodafone, WWF, Veronica, NRC, and more). \n\nPeter has a less recent history as a multimedia & internet projectmanager, accountmanager and teamleader at online web agencies and in the dutch television industry. And ran his own small webdesign and multimedia business for more than 10 years being anything between the manager and hands-on creator.\n\nAnd before that worked in the audiovisual and television industry at Valkieser as a 3D-animator/graphic designer and as a multimedia projectleader for Philips CD-interactive programs. All that in the pre-internet ages...\n\nSo Peter has a broad spectrum of expertise in area's like internet, webdesign, interactive media, broadcasting, 3D animation. But also has experiences with the energy-market, satellite TV, aircraft industry and aerodynamics. The latter due to education and personal interest.\n\nCharacterized as very flexible, experienced, persistent, creative and empathic. \nPeter is very much an organiser and team-player, is open minded and has a technical background. And is -obviously- very customer minded.\n\nBut don't be intimidated by all this, he is also very nice and loyal person to work with...\n\nSpeaks Dutch, English, German and bits of French and Spanish.\n\nCall Peter now at +31 (0)6 1935 66 05 or mail peterpaelzinga@gmail.com",

Its integration of graphics, sound, video and software still stands as a standard of media-integrations and interactivity even internet -in essence- still has not yet come close to. \n\nYou could call CD-i the real forerunner of interactive Television (not just pause and playback).\n\nValkieser Multi Media was preferred partner of Philips and competitor of companies like Lost Boys (now LBi) and was well respected worldwide. The company was run by Erik Spin and later by Brian Hirman (now Goud  Uberconnected and eVentures Africa Fund). \n\nThe Valkieser Group became in 2001 United Broadcast Facilities (United4All.nl).",

The unique Drommedaris in Enkhuizen - a former, fat,  city defense tower of the 17th century, is a melting pot of diverse people, clubs and organisations and is well known in the region it serves. My main interest was to add some creative thinking power to help the centre modernize well into the 21st century without loosing its charm and authentiticity. After my leave the actual complex renovation took place and a lot of my ideas can be found back in the building."
