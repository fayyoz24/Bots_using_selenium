The transition towards water conservation and resource recovery via the waste(water) streams is a major challenge nowadays. To meet the high demands of urban life, resources need to be efficiently used and resource recovery from generated \u201cwaste\u201d streams should become a \u201cnew normal\u201d. Water and wastewater can provide an alternative and environmentally viable source of resources supporting the resilience of natural systems under water stress. There are many resources that can be recovered via the water path, such as water itself, energy and components such as nutrients and metals.\n\nHowever, circular solutions do not necessarily equate to sustainable solutions! The urban water system is a complex of interconnected processes which should be explored, one by one, in order to create an overall sustainable value. The case study of the research was Prinseneiland neighborhood and the wider area of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Eight scenarios were assessed in total and the environmental impacts were quantified in terms of life cycle energy consumption, life cycle global warming potential, life cycle water consumption and life cycle freshwater eutrophication potential. The first set of four scenarios involved household-level interventions only: greywater treatment and reuse, rainwater harvesting and use, usage of water efficient appliances, and food waste valorisation via wastewater streams. The second set of four scenarios added centralised phosphorus and nitrogen recovery. All the involved water, energy and nutrient fluxes, as well as byproducts and recovered materials in the urban water system were collected, calculated, assessed and interpreted. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was the methodology used to assess the environmental impacts of the scenarios under study. \n\n\n",

The EU legislation for water reuse is analysed, as well as the regimes of several MS\u2019 and their compliance with the EU Environmental Legislation. The subject of this paper is mainly the water reuse topic and the main focus is the case of Greece. The country\u2019s framework for reclamation and reuse of water is presented, with references to the national Common Ministerial Decisions (CMDs) that have been introduced. Based on the research we can conclude that the most important weakness, until recently, in the EU in what so ever concerns the regulation of the issue of the reclamation and water reuse is the lack of EU guidelines and the harmony between the guidelines developed by the MS. The introduction of an EU instrument in the form of Regulation is essential and urgent in Europe, obliging all the MS to develop similar regimes and adopt the same criteria, techniques and methods in order to proceed with water reuse and exchange knowledge relatively. For the case of Greece, this is a big challenge and the country will struggle to harmonize its legislation with a new EU instrument, while its previous obligations are still pending.  ",

The project focuses on the assessment of grey water reuse in touristic regions, as an approach to solve the intense water scarcity that all the islands and coastal regions of Greece are facing every summer. Through the innovative, for Greece, proposal for the reuse of grey water, the reduction of clean potable water use for secondary uses and the introduction of grey water reuse in toilet flushing and irrigation of gardens, will help overcome this huge problem in touristic areas. In this thesis, the pilot application of grey water reuse in a small-scale hotel located in the area of Pefkohori, Chalkidiki is studied. This area faces serious water shortages during the summer months, due to intense touristic activity, and is in a risk of depleting its water reserves and entering brackish water into the aquifer. \n\nA thorough literature review has been performed in terms of the grey water characteristics, its main applications and advantages. It was also conducted research on the several grey water reuse units that are available in the market. The thesis focused on a specific hotel, where, after a detailed analysis of the topography and the existing construction (creation of the architectural plans, inventory of the building materials used), an economical and technical analysis of new sewerage, water supply and irrigation networks was conducted. This study was completed with the calculation of the cost of the construction of the new networks and the various facilities required, as well as the purchase of the wastewater treatment unit. The goal of this dissertation was to determine whether this implementation is environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial for the owners of the hotel. \n\nThe architectural plans of the hotel were designed using AutoCAD and ArchiCAD.\n",
