Studying the economics of it can therefore help to significantly reduce the expenses. Economic dispatch can determine when to start, stop, and how much each generating unit should produce to meet the demand necessities of the consumers at minimum costs. The dispatch problem is to be solved considering several unit and systems constraints that affect the individual unit as well the system altogether. Furthermore, with limited amount of fossil fuels and the need to reduce greenhouse gases, the integration of renewable generation in the energy system has been increasing. Therefore, in addition to the traditional units such as coal, oil, gas fired units, wind generation is used in the dispatch problem. \n\nThe assignment was to develop a model in MATLAB to perform economic dispatch optimization. However, for a large scale problem, the simulation time is far from realistic. Therefore, the model was then developed using YALMIP, a language which is consistent with MATLAB for large scale smooth and convex optimization problems. It resulted in faster simulations as YALMIP avoids redefining the optimization problem at every time instant, utilizes only single set of binary variable and depends on external solver like GLPK, GUROBI to solve the problem. The end result was a dispatch schedule along with the associated costs based on generation as shown in the figure below. The effects of varying several constraint data on the dispatch schedule and thereby the costs were also studied.",

Traditionally, the transmission line capacities are allocated by the use of Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) method proposed by ENTSO - E. However, it does not take the physical flows resulting from a commercial exchange between borders into account. Therefore, a flow based allocation method allowing the integration of markets known as Flow - Based Market Coupling (FBMC) has been proposed to model the imports and exports together with the cross - border flows by using Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDF's).\n\nThe assignment was to conduct an extensive literature study on congestion and its management techniques, and allocation of capacities based on NTC as well as FBMC methodology.",

A Multi Agent - based System (MAS) is therefore considered to be a vital demand - side management tool where the devices are represented by agents (virtual entity). MAS offers several advantages such as controlling large number of devices, scalability, local decision making, peak shaving. \n\nThe assignment was to gather the forecasted demand data and data represented by the devices (agents). Using this information, a bidding curve is generated that determines the operation of the devices to achieve a power balance between generation and load. A model has been developed using PowerMatcher simulation tool, developed by ECN (Energy research Center for the Netherlands), to demonstrate this principle. The effects of varying agent data on the power matching capabilities were also studied.",
