    "summary": "I have recently obtained my International Baccalaureate Diploma, which provided me with varied, well-rounded knowledge and skills with a clear cultural emphasis. I have commenced a degree in Economics and Business Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam due to my love of problem solving and my numeracy skills. Having lived in Antigua for 7 years and debating in the youth parliament has given me necessary skills to be able to communicate with a wide variety of people. I am fully driven with a keen eagerness to learn, setting high standards as demonstrated in the achievement of the Certificate of national recognition from the Antigua & Barbuda Government for my CSEC academic achievement. I have accomplished communication skills, both written and verbal, developed through numerous essays and presentations given during my academic studies. I am highly personable, enjoy working with others, and am experienced at building excellent relations, supported by strong team working and leadership skills as demonstrated by my roles as captain, sporting achievements and tennis coaching. I have the ability to take the initiative and work well under pressure. I embrace and enjoy the challenge of new responsibilities which I meet with commitment, enthusiasm and determination.",
