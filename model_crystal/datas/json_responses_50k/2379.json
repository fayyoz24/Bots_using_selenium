    "summary": "\u2022 I've been a freelance graphic designer since graduating with an MA in 2006. Since 2021 I am working at Office Winhov.\n\u2022 My specialty is printed matter \u2013 and aligning this with online design. My clients tend to be from the cultural/social sector. These include larger institutions (e.g. Bureau Europa, Transartists, Greenpeace, etc), as well as individual artists, curators and fashion designers. I\u2019ve always combined this more personal work with design (and DTP) for the tighter deadline world of magazines and newspapers \u2013 including \u2018Amsterdam Weekly\u2019, \u2018Time Out\u2019, \u2018Elle\u2019, \u2018Knack\u2019 and \u2018Nest\u2018.\n\u2022 I work fast but with a lot of attention to detail. I believe that I don\u2019t work for my clients, but I work in collaboration with them. Yet it\u2019s my task to keep a close eye on the deadline and the overall consistency of a design. My design work is often described as \u2018clear\u2019.\n\u2022 I am originally from Belgium, with Dutch/British nationality. I finished the European School in Brussels and moved to Amsterdam in 1999 to study graphic design at Gerrit Rietveld Academy. I went on to do an MA at the Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem.",

The editorial meetings were suddenly all taking place on WhatsApp \u2013 many pings. I can be romantic about these issues we made, but truly hope that it is just an experience I can reflect upon\u2026 In June 2021, IEX moved offices once again but I never made it to that one: I left IEX to start at Office Winhov.",

In the magazine\u2019s layout I applied a strong division between text and image and ads: articles and images, split in two distinct columns, were printed on glossy stock; ads were printed on the first and last few pages of the magazine, on uncoated stock. In each issue I used a different figure or shape \u2013 circles, triangles, crosses \u2013 to number the articles; these I re-used to form patterns elsewhere in the magazine.",
