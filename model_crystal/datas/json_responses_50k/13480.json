    "summary": "Indu Sharma brings a wealth of experience, spanning a decade, in conducting research and monitoring, as well as evaluating food security and nutrition programs across Nepal, Bangladesh, and Laos. She is a proud holder of a Master of Public Health from the University of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Presently, she is on the verge of completing her joint PhD in Erasmus Mundus TransGlobal Health, with a specialization in Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture, from Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, and Barcelona Institute for Global Health, University of Barcelona.\n\nIn her current capacity, Indu is actively involved in the cross-CGIAR Asian Mega-Deltas (AMD) research Initiative. Her contributions are focused on two interconnected work packages (WP) - WP2, where she is committed to ensuring that deltaic food systems can sustain and enhance nutrition security equitably, and WP4, where her efforts are centred on the inclusive governance of natural resources critical to diverse food systems.",
