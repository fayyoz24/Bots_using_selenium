Key onshore operating assets comprise Rabi (one of the largest fields in sub-Saharan Africa), Gamba-Ivinga, Toucan and the recently discovered and now producing, Koula Field. In the past few years production decline has been arrested through employing state of the art Well & Reservoir Management technology. Recent business plans call for an expansion in the drilling and workover activities in Shell Gabon. Shell Gabon currently runs 2 rigs and 1 hoist. In addition, the maturation of the highly prospective deep offshore area offers promise of further exploration opportunities over the next few years.\nThe role also oversee the Gamba Terminal (40+ year old asset) \u2013 one of two terminals in Gabon processing >50% of Gabon\u2019s onshore crude.

Building on a very successful launch campaign and communication programme, TR has become a high profile global initiative, followed with close interest by Shell EP senior management. My personal drive and enthusiasm for this fascinating change management programme contributed to my getting this strong senior management commitment, and I established a powerful guiding coalition across the region. This enabled me to acquire the necessary resources and priority to put in place a long term, sustainable programme of continuous improvement. The role involved creating and communicating a successful strategy, working with \"Change Agents\" to manage and implement a portfolio of change projects, educating the operations workforce in new ways of working, demonstrating business benefits, and interfacing with other regions to ensure a consistent, standardized approach. During the first year of the programme we realized  tangible business benefits ( 300 KBOE production gain, US$ 200,000 cost savings realized to date, with proven potential for five times as much in 2006",
