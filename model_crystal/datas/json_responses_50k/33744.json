Our vision is that LichtBlick will be the best-known and best-loved brand for a climate friendly and sustainable lifestyle. \n\nHaving been on the LichtBlick Supervisory Board for two and a half year, I am really pleased to switch to the executive role now. Among my tasks will be the growth agenda: corporate development/M&A/partnerships and shareholder (Eneco-Mitsubishi) affairs, ao the cooperation with other Eneco portfolio companies in Germany. In addition: the Legal and People & Culture teams will report to me. \n\nKey projects for the coming years: \n- strengthening our \u00b4strategic circle\u00b4 by hiring key director positions\n- preparing for J-SOX / In control as required by Japanese stock exchange (a.o. professionalizing compliance, data privacy, risk frameworks and processes)\n- defining a robust 5-year strategy for LichtBlick towards an integrated energy company (a.o. by creating an own asset base)\n- incorporating the acquired E.on client portfolios\n- introducing the full Hay methodology: describing all functions, creating a complete salary band systematic benchmarked with relevant peers, and a new benefits catalogue\n\nI am truly excited and grateful that I was given this opportunity by the Eneco Board. Looking forward to be in Hamburg post-Corona and to a successful cooperation with my LichtBlick colleagues!",

M&A lead role at Eneco, I am please to announce that starting September 2018  I have joined Eneco as the director of Corporate Development. My engagement with Eneco over the last years has been really interesting and rewarding. Together with many talented colleagues, in 2017 and 2018 I have been able to contribute to a significant growth of Eneco's client and asset base in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. \n\nAlso given the important privatisation process ahead, it was a relatively easy decision for me to leave my independent advisory role, fully commit to Eneco and dedicate to the next phase of the company's future. In my new role, I am looking forward to lead the M&A, Venturing and Strategic Partnership teams. Also, I am exited to be part of Eneco's newly formed Executive Committee.\n\nAs a last significant project in this role I am pleased that we were able to close the acquisition of the E.on  'Heizstrom' portfolio of approx. 350k electricity contracts. This acquisition places LichtBlick in the top-5 of German energy suppliers. Please also refer to the press release: https://www.lichtblick.de/presse/news/2020/04/29/kartellamt-und-eu-genehmigen-transaktion-heizstrom-gesch\u00e4ft-von-e-on-geht-an-lichtblick/\n\nIn relation to my new position as MD in LichtBlick SE's Board of Management starting May 1, 2020 and working from Hamburg, my portfolio as Eneco's Director of Corporate Development was split up and passed on to two Eneco-colleagues.",
