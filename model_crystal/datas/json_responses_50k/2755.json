By doing so, the sports department elevated its offer, adding more value to both the business and end consumer.\n\nThose actions - together with other initiatives that my amazing teammates implemented - led us to outstanding results such as 60%+ revenue growth vs. PY, 3 pp increase in gross margin vs. PY, 2 pp increase in revenue share vs. PY, among others \ud83d\ude80.\n\nEven though I like to think that all that happened because we came up with a strong plan and had a effective execution, deep inside, I know that the e-commerce boom due to Covid had a lot to do with it too \ud83d\ude42.",
