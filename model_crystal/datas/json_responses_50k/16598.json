My employment history emulates that observation.\n\nWith the dream of forensic science, I completed a BSC in Chemistry & Computer Based Technology followed  by a PhD in Research MALDI-TOF Mass Spec.\n\nThwarted only by the fact that academia was far less collaborative than I\u2019d hoped it to be, my career started in PR, working for a small BioTech & Healthcare PR shop. \n\nI've certainly not looked back, 20 years of INTERACTIVE & INTEGRATED campaigns:\n\n\u2022 68% increase in enlistments during one of the toughest recruiting periods (British Army)\n\u2022 12% increase in test-drive conversions (Honda UK)\n\u2022 Deployment of 26-market/15-language consumer sites (AMEX)\n\u2022 Surpassed social media KPI\u2019s by 106% (Prairie Milk Marketing Partnership)\n\u2022 Helped create the Department of Health's most successful smoking cessation campaign with over 1.5 million people now having given up smoking with\n\u2022 Helped DARE launch the UK brand to the NA region (New York, Vancouver, Toronto & LAX)\n\n20 years on, Im being behavioural at Philips. For the remainder of the week, I'm creating a photographic documentary on the diversity of Drag culture and the value it gives back to the community. \n\nWith this in mind, I'll continue as is until shouted at....",
