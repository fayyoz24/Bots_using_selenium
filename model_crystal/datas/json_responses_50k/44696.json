In this function I was responsible for assuring that product requirements are met and that proper analysis methods are devised for certification.  I also provided support externally to customers (Airbus UK) on a project basis (Flight Test Instrumentation for instance) and internally with respect to the product definition during the manufacturing phase. I performed static and fatigue analysis on composite skin and riblets of A380 leading edge using Nastran and Patran programs. Also applied classical calculations to verify the results obtained from Nastran. Further justification by comparing the results with test components. Additionally performed MRB support tasks on Fokker special products, such as Gulfstream CFC elevator and Airbus A380 composite leading edge.",

In addition I performed analysis on built composite structures by incorporating the determined allowables developed from the test data and I drafted the financial analysis.",
