    "summary": "I'm Australian ex-pat resident in the Netherlands. Looking back, I have over 40 years experience working in the Performing Arts sector, both as a performer and on the business side. My track record sports some amazing successes and spectacular failures.\n\nI studied double bass at the Victorian college of the Arts in Melbourne Australia. After this I played with a number of prominent Australian Pop Bands in the 80's as well as being active in the Jazz scene. After the tragic death of Perfect Strangers vocalist, Andy Clayton Smith, (The best band I ever played with) I ditched music, went back to Uni to study business. At the time I thought this was rather useless information! As the years went on I realized that was not the case. \n\nEventually, music called once again and my wife Els and I jumped ship and moved to the Netherlands where I furthered my studies in classical music at the ArtEZ conservatorium in Arnhem. In 1996 I formed a Jazz Piano Trio that would become my main vehicle for my obsession with jazz. In addition to the trio I worked as a sideman playing bass with a shit load of people, some famous, some really famous and most you've never heard of.\n\nFor many years I was very active in the classical world where I specialized in the performance of early music. I've worked with numerous early music ensembles in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy and between 2003 and 2009 I was the founder and musical director of the Dutch Baroque Orchestra \"Il Concerto Barocco\". That's a long story - Wait for the book on that one!\n\nAfter this I spent 6 years working as an A&R Manager and marketing director for a New York based Jazz Label. I've worked as a booking agent and been involved with the management of a number of major music festivals. Currently I'm the publisher and co-owner of Jazz In Europe Media. Over the years I've built an impressive network and mentor a number of musicians on how not to do dumb things and focus on what's important in their a career.\n\nTo make ends meet I work hard at Jazz In Europe Media, build websites, apps, produce albums, make videos, take photos, design magazines, album covers and anything that needs creative graphic design.\n\nI'm opinionated, a control freak and have issues with authority. I have trouble with stupidity and find this rather ironic as I've done a lot of stupid shit over the years!!!! \n\nPolitically I lean to the left and most Americans consider me a communist. I still have an incomplete bucket list to deal with and hope, one day, to give up smoking, learn to app with my thumbs and finally act my age!",
