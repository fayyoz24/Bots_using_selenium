            "description": "The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus is gaining scholarly and policy attention. Despite growing evidence on which type of nexus governance works, little is known about the consequences of such governance for social justice. Implementing the nexus requires decision-making about trade-offs between the use and production of water, energy and food, which are particularly acute at household and community levels. This raises justice questions of whether the nexus can benefit all, and who makes decisions and at what levels. In South Africa, where access to water, energy and food are strongly influenced by a history of Apartheid and inequality, there is a need to study the challenges and opportunities of a socially just nexus implementation from the bottom up. This research introduces the concept of WEF communities, inspired by EU legislation for energy communities to produce their own renewable electricity. We study how similar communities in South Africa could be legally recognised and expanded to include water use and food production, and with what consequences for social justice, particularly for the poorest and women. Incorporation of WEF communities in South Africa\u2019s legal frameworks may enhance social justice from the bottom up, yet this is uncertain given inequalities in (legal) access to energy, water and land. The project consists of (comparative) analyses of legal frameworks in the EU and South Africa, as well as household assessments on WEF interlinkages and decision-making in two communities in the Eastern Cape and Northern Cape. Data is collected through literature review, surveys, focus group discussions, interviews and fieldshops. Through active participation in the research, stakeholders from the community to the national level will build capacity and connections, including through a training of trainers' programme targeting the poor, women and youth. Outreach happens through publications, workshops, a website, a symposium and local WEF nexus festivals.",

My thesis analyses the consequences of REDD+ for multilevel forest governance. The thesis contains an analysis of global REDD+ debates, two in-depth case studies on REDD+ in India, and a comparative analysis of seven REDD+ countries. It argues that REDD+ manifests itself differently at different levels of governance, with varying consequences for multilevel forest governance. Global policy debates around REDD+ mainly focus on results-based compensation for carbon emission reductions, to be measured by experts with the use of national monitoring systems. In line with this, many national REDD+ policy documents plan to make national government agencies responsible for REDD+. This might promote a centralisation of authority. In contrast to the global level, REDD+ at national and project level is often framed as a policy mechanism to generate not only carbon but also non-carbon benefits, to be measured by both experts and local communities. At the moment, however, countries (still) lack the capacity to monitor such non-carbon benefits and engage in community-based monitoring.",
