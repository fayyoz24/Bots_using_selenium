    "summary": "After graduation from Schoevers ESA and working for an recruiting agency  in various admin-functions, I started working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. First as a secretary, but gradually - after studying public administration in the evenings - I shifted to financial management and controlling.  Since 1996 I worked abroad at several Netherlands Embassies in 5 different African countries. In Mali I was responsible for consular and security matters, a challenging job in a low income country that suffered form a coup d'\u00e9tat. \n\nMy skills in networking, analyzing and collaborating are well-appreciated.  I a perfectionist and not afraid to work hard. I find it import\n\nI'm married, and mother of 3 teenagers. I feel privileged that I could help the Edgars Youth Program in Uganda (a local based soccer school with a vision for development) with their website and their soccer project for deaf children, and being inspired and collaborated with the National Lake Rescue Institute in Uganda. I enjoyed very much to get to know the Malian music ('desert blues') and their major musicians. It triggered me to participate at the Masterclass for Musical Entrepreneurs - with moderators coming from the top of the Dutch music industry. ",

Coordination and collaboration with the Schengen partners (Netherlands was 2nd largest in number of visa applications after France). Assured the implementation of the new Visa Code, introduction of the biometric characteristics as part of application process and transition to the Regional Support Office. A new system for appointments was introduced succesfully. As the security situation was worsening in Mali, keeping the evacuation plans updated and testing them, became more important as well as monitoring the security security and keeping in touch with the Dutch community in Mali. The international schools closed for a few months, and many embassies send back their expat staff. I was also tasked with other operational management tasks like maintenance of the office and staff houses, human resource management and finances, in order to ensure a smooth running embassy under challenging situations where part of my job. My network in Mali consisted of members of the Dutch community, Malian authorities, Malian businesses and well-known musicians, US and Schengen embassies, Dutch NGO's a.o.",

Assisted amongst others with the set-up of the financial management of a number of multi-donor basketfunds, and backstopping for a bursary scheme for former abductees and vulnerable adolescents (mostly victims of the LRA). In addition, I prepared the formation of the Emergency Response Team of the Embassy. Staff of the Dutch embassy as well as spouses where trained in the basics of first aid and fire fighting, I prepared and coordinated this pilot-training in collaboration with the Ministry's ERT coordinators and a Ugandan NGO National Lake Rescue. I was especially proud that this team of very mixed participants managed to succeed in the training and acted adequately in a real-life exercise, and we served as a best practice for other embassies.",
