    "summary": "[Carpe Diem Attitude]\nThe life quote I always try to remember is \"This too shall pass\", which means that nothing, good or bad, lasts forever. As the sentence said, I want to live the current moment valuable and passionately and want not to lose my positive mindset even though the situation is rough.\n\n[Better Society]\nThe one important standard for my decision is how it can affect society in good way. I always want to help other people and want society to be better to live. I have been teaching students for 6 years and learned how my small words and behaviors can affect their life in short and long term both. And I hope I can be the one who contributes my skills and ability to make the society better.\n\n[Out of Comfort Zone]\nI am currently a master majored in Econometrics and Operation Research, specialized in Data Science track in Vrije Universteit Amsterdam. Even though it is not the country I was born in, I want to explore new world and try not to be in the comfort zone.",
