First, we partially replicated the results of the original authors Huang et al. (2022) which showed promising results of the new method. Then, for the extension, we looked into a popular topic in PCA, how to determine the number of PCA factors you should include in a factor-augmented prediction model. The thesis mainly focused on how the existing methods to determine the number of PCA factors work under sPCA factors, as Huang et al. (2022) do not talk about this in their paper.",

We chose the societal side. \nUsing 138 years of Congress speeches, we aim to find how Congress discussed the\nissues of African Americans. We find that since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Republican and\nSouthern politicians have discussed Black people far less than Democratic and Northern politicians.\nPreliminary inference was done using graphical representation of word usage (in ratios) to describe African\nAmericans. Results were obtained using a multinomial logit model and revealed that in general, the\nmore conservative party mentioned issues related to African Americans less and was less mindful of\ntheir word choices. We also see that historical movements such as the Civil Rights Movement had a\npositive effect on raising awareness regarding issues about civil rights in Congress. The embedded media shows a graph of the ratios of speeches containing a specific word over time.",

The investigated models are picked out of the Generalised Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic models, as we assume that the stock market volatility time series is heteroskedastic. We test the models against a benchmark, which in our case was the VIX, to find that the models do sometimes outperform the benchmark in terms of out-of-sample forecasting. The data we used is a time series of daily S&P 500 returns of the last two decades.",
