    "summary": "Currently in my tenth year of teaching Mathematics to secondary school pupils.\n\nI have taught a range of abilities from 11 to 18 years old and most recently have built my experience teaching the IB MYP and DP curricula. I have been trained by the International Baccalaureate on the new Diploma Programme courses, and have taught, both Analysis & Approaches and Applications & Interpretations courses at Standard Level. My current role involves coordinating the MYP team with a focus on curriculum and assessment.\n\nOutside of the classroom, I often involve myself with volunteering and outdoor-activity opportunities, such as the Duke of Edinburgh International Award.",

This includes the International Baccalaureate curriculum as well as the British equivalent qualifications. \n\nAcademically, I have recently become more involved in the day-to-day running of the department and have been specifically supporting the Head of Department in Key Stage 3 responsibilities. I have taught a range of exam groups throughout my time at the school and I am dedicated to providing them with support so that they can achieve their highest possible grades.\n\nMy biggest extra-curricular achievement was the successful co-leading of a school trip to Tanzania two academic years running. I organised fund-raising events such as talent shows and helped the pupils co-ordinate their own money-raising efforts too. Altogether, we raised over 20 000 Euros for our link charity Seeway Tanzania and, whilst there, we helped them to carry out a range of fantastic community projects.\n\nThis year, I have transferred these skills to co-leading the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze International Award, which involves an expedition to South China. Weekly, I meet with the pupils to help them learn key skills for their expedition and also organise their activity logs.",
