    "summary": "As a change-driven and passionate professional, it is my absolute goal to link strategy, sustainability and innovation with transformation. \n\nWith a proven record of driving change programs for improving business results, I am driven to lead major transformations in multinational organizations and navigate them in environments where innovation and execution go hand in hand. I find it exciting to harmonize IQ and EQ in order to achieve the best solution. With my empathy, decisiveness and strong communication skills, I ensure that we discover and utilize unique opportunities in various businesses and international markets.\n\nResistance during change is a given because \u201ctransformation always hurts a little\u201d. I find it a rewarding task to guide and equip employees and managers in how they can deal effectively with change, business challenges and performance. I strive to inspire and encourage them to think outside the box and perform meaningful work. In this way, I like to contribute to the development of the organization, but also to the learning process of others. Change can be an intense process. However, if you do this carefully without losing sight of the human aspect, this creates room for beautiful opportunities that can take the organization to an even higher level.",
