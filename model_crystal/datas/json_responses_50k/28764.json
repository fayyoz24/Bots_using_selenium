As SCRUM Master of 3 very diverse IT Change teams in the area of Identity and Access Management. \nMy strengths are building up distributed teams and creating a good team spirit and atmosphere despite the locations where team members are working.  Besides that, I am always motivating the team members to step out their comfort zones and embrace change, improve the process and change the organization. \nI helped the teams understand and adopt an Agile mindset and work accordingly to the SCRUM framework. These teams were used to work in the waterfall methods. We started from zero and after 2 years I see 3 mature teams, delivering quality products and having fun together.  All the team members became more T-shaped and I see them always willing to learn new skills within their teams. \nIn all 3 teams we introduced CICD and DevOps practices. We automated the build, deployment and test processes and improved our time to market by at least 15 times.\nI am very proud of what we achieved together so far. Still have lots of energy and motivation to help these and other teams to get the best out themselves and feel appreciated.",
