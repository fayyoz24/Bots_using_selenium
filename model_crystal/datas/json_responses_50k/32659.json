    "summary": "Hello! I am a geospatial data analyst specializing in developing nature-based solutions for the forestry, agriculture, and agroforestry sectors. My expertise lies in advanced satellite image processing (SAR and optical data), time series analysis, deforestation detection, biomass estimation (for generating carbon credits), land cover assessment, crop classification modeling, and vegetation health mapping. I am highly motivated to learn, grow and excel in Earth Observation science with 6+ years of experience in geospatial and remote sensing analysis. \n\nMy career goal is to assume a role that enables me to hone my analytical skills, make a social and environmental impact and eventually help farmers attain maximum farm productivity in a sustainable way. This is important to me because I believe that big data can play a crucial role in our transition to sustainable but profitable regenerative agriculture.",
