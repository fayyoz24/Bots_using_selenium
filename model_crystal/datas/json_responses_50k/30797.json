    "summary": "As a Legal Officer at St. Andrew's Refugee Services (StARS), I provide legal assistance and representation to refugees and asylum seekers in Egypt, in collaboration with UNHCR and other partner organizations. I also conduct research and advocacy on refugee law and policy, and contribute to the development and delivery of training programs for legal staff and volunteers. \n\nI hold an Advanced Master of Laws (LLM) in Public International Law from Leiden University, where I focused on international dispute settlement, international humanitarian law, and human rights law. I have also completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Legal Practice from BPP Law School, and obtained several certifications in professional consulting, Bloomberg market concepts, and studying affiliate membership. \n\nMy previous internships and clerkships have exposed me to various aspects of international law and arbitration, such as UNCITRAL, PRIME Finance, T.M.C. Asser Instituut, Special Tribunal for Lebanon, and Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. I have gained valuable skills and experience in legal research, writing, communication, and presentations, as well as a keen interest in the intersection of law, development, and finance. My goal is to pursue a career that enables me to use my legal expertise and multilingual abilities to serve the public interest and promote justice and peace.",
