    "summary": "I live in Rotterdam and I'm allowed to work in the Netherlands (working permit visa stamped on my passport).\n\nMy passion for data analysis began in my current role as a Purchasing Analyst, where I handle large amounts of data daily. I have a great knowledge of Excel and I've been learning to clean, organize, and extract insights from data using Power BI and Python to benefit my future company. \n\nMy versatile professional journey began with a Social Communication and Propaganda degree, which led me to a role as marketing assistant at Brazil's first sports newspaper, Jornal dos Sports. To improve my English, I transitioned to the hospitality industry, working as a hotel receptionist and eventually joining a Norwegian Oil and Gas company. Embracing new challenges, I moved into finance, pursued a Business Management Postgraduate course, and secured an Invoice Processor position at the Treasury Department.\n\nBriefly exploring entrepreneurship, I later found my calling as a Purchasing Analyst in the food service industry, contributing to SSP Brazil's ambitious expansion plans. Throughout my career, I've demonstrated adaptability and a commitment to learning and growth, allowing me to tackle diverse challenges and industries successfully.",

In this phase \nI am responsible for finding suppliers to supply the new restaurants according to the ingredient list provided by the Head Chef, obtaining the registration documents of these suppliers, registering items in the system for purchasing, and preparing the first P.Os, with quantities according to the initial sales expectation. I also work on the store opening checklist, purchasing uniforms, PPEs, disposables, kitchen utensils, and packaging requested by the Head Chef, and other essential items for operation, aiming to have everything ready for the opening.\nPhase 2 is the adjustment of Phase 1. According to the spend analysis, I begin negotiations and search for other suppliers to reduce prices without losing quality in a joint effort with the sales department to improve the store's COGS. I also analyze purchases to verify if suppliers are complying with agreed-upon prices.\nBy phase 2, the store is already in operation, so at the end of each month, I do the inventory analysis, creating reports to help operations managers find stock problems, waste, and other issues that result in a loss of goods and, consequently, money for the company.\nWith my assistant, I also support operations in the needs raised by managers, such as replenishing glasses, dishes, and uniforms, purchasing necessary kitchen appliances, and anything they need to run the restaurants smoothly.",
