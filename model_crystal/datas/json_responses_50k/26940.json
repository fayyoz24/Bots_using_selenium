    "summary": "As integral holistic massage therapist, body-oriented coach and mediator I help people to be in touch with themselves and with others, to their benefit and that of worthy causes. All my work is pro bono and those making use of my services are encouraged to donate towards a charity or civil society organisation of their choice.\n\nWith my background in public administration in an intergovernmental organisation, facilitating contacts and inclusive processes in multicultural and multilingual settings comes naturally. \n\nFurther interest lie in reconciling the interests of motorcyclists and classic car enthusiasts with an increasingly complex societal and environmental setting. \n\nI believe in an open mind, strong ethics, transparency and accountability being the cornerstones of good interaction between individuals, in business and above all in public administration and political representation.",
