    "summary": "Creative Master Floral Designer with extensive national and international experience. After spending almost 2 years as Creative Director and Lead Floral Designer at Ultimate Planner LLC in Muscat, Oman, I am back in Holland. Ultimate Planner is a high end and exclusive Flowershop, such as Oman had not seen yet. Due to unfortunate cicumstances we had to return to Holland. from now on I am available as Free Lance Master Florist for projects, large decorations, as well as demonstrations, Masterclasses and Teaching of Contemporary Floral Design and Art. I have a large international experience in big projects and weddings, and will work well in international teams. As floral designer I tend to think \u201cout of the Box\u201d which will result in unique and stunning designs. \n\nCreative master floral designer with years experience in Holland as well as in other countries.\nWorked as floral designer in the Netherlands, Germany, UK, Saudi Arabia and other countries.\n\nIn June / July 2014, I flolowed the intensive International Master in Dutch Floral Design at the Boerma Instituut, International Floral Design School Holland. I have finished this Master Course with excellent results and earned my Diploma and Certification as wel as the titel \"Master in Dutch Floral Design, MDFD\". This Master Course has definately got my creative juices flowing again, so i am more than ready for a new challenge. \n\nAt September 2014, a TV show contest was running in the Netherlands, in search of Hollands Best Floral Stylist. I was one of the final 15 contestants in this show, chosen out of about 400 applicants. This was a great experience that, unfortunately lasted shorter than i hoped. you can check out this programm at SBS.nl/hollandsbestebloemstylist . a great promotion for a great Specialty, our Floral Design profession.",

Because the temperatures in Riyadh could rise quite high, one of our  products was combinations of dried plant materials with the highest quality of silk flowers.\nA very important part of the work I did was the designing en executing of decorations for large dinner parties as well as many royal weddings. This, of course, included all the designs as well as the calculating of costs and retail pricing. Fresh flowers used were imported on a regular, weekly basis direct from the flower auctions in Holland.\nFor the largest weddings in the upper royal family, the preparations sometimes took up to 3-4 months, including drawings, mood boards and sample arrangements. Budgets varied from several thousands of dollars to sometimes 1 million dollar budgets.\nFor the execution of these large weddings we usually recruited professional florist from Holland and the UK to assist with the work.\nDuring this time I was asked frequently to assist in the decoration of the villa\u2019s and palaces  of the upper class.
