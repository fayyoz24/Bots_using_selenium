    "summary": "Gregory Gerasimos Koutsouridis holds a Dr. (PhD) degree in Biomedical Engineering (2015) and a PostMSc degree in Medical Informatics (2009), while, earlier in 2005 he earned a Dipl-Eng (5-year) degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. \n\nHe was born on April 16th 1978 in Athens, Hellas. After graduating from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2005 with a specialization in Telecommunications on the thesis entitled \u201cTelecommunication Link Simulation of QAM and PSK Systems Under the Influence of Non-Linearities\u201d, he fulfilled his national service at the Signal Corps Arm of the Hellenic Army. In 2007, in parallel with his job in the healthcare and the construction domains, he continued his postgraduate education in the School of Medicine of the aforementioned University and received his PostMSc degree in Medical Informatics in 2009, on the thesis entitled \u201cUltrasound Assessment of the Arterial Tree Flow and Pressure Waves via Electrical Analogies\u201d, which was partly elaborated in the Netherlands, at the Section of Cardiovascular Biomechanics, Division of Biomechanics and Tissue Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology. His subsequent involvement in 2010, in a PhD at the Eindhoven University of Technology was a natural consequence. During his PhD, he was able to successfully propose new strategies and ideas for the further development of ultrasound imaging.\n\nHis main expertise covers the domains of telecommunications (wireless sensors, signal processing, link-layer analysis, non-linearity effects) and healthcare engineering (joint time-frequency analysis techniques, eHealth and Telemedicine, biomedical engineering, laboratory experiments and measurements, numerical evaluations). Gregory is member of the Technical Chamber of Greece and has been member of ASME, Dutch Society of Medical Ultrasound (NVMU) and Mechanical-Electrical Engineers Union of Northern Greece.",
