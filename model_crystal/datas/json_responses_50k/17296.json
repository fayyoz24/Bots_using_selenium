    "summary": "Since I am looking for a job as an application manager, I'll describe how I go about that. \n\nThe first phase of my work is to learn how applications are being used in the organisation. Defining the processes, critical tasks and key users, then start an inventory of user issues. \nAs an application manager it is most important to listen to the organisation, to learn what is needed and expected from the business applications. Communication is one of my most appreciated skills in this regard. \n\nApplications are often not used to the maximum of their potential. The second phase of my work is too look for quick wins, automation potential and structural changes that serve to improve the workflows of the organisation.\n\nWhen my recommendations are (perhaps partially) approved, it is time to implement the changes. Usually the changes are minor and will only effect some users. Other times it is necessary to convince the entire organisation of the benefits of change. Good communication is again important here.\nEither way, I will be happy to provide training for employees who would benefit from that. \n\nThe third phase has in fact already started once I started my work. In every step of the process, I will try to document my findings as best I can. By the time I leave an organisation, my successor should be able to pick up where I left off. \n\nI am a person who looks for diversity in his life. That's why I work project based and try different lines of work whenever I can. In the summer I like to be outside as much as possible.",
