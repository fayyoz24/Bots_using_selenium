Primarily, I was required to ensure the safety and well-being of the children, whilst aiding in the practise of their everyday lives. This involved maintaining physical well-being and hygiene of the children by washing, feeding, supporting them, as well as up keeping a good level of cleanliness in the home environment. In addition to the daily care of the children, I was expected to encourage the development of their English language skills. Working as an au pair in St Tropez, France over a three-month period allowed me to develop a very strong sense of independence, responsibility and reliability in both a personal and professional sense. \n\nTaking care of children and neutering the youth of today is an essential step in creating a future society which is strong, innovative and progressive - I pride myself upon my efforts in encouraging and furthering this.",
