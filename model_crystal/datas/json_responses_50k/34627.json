I strive after this goal by goal-oriented, methodical and disciplined working.\nBy thoroughly planning activities I work towards the desired results and make sure that the process is taken into the right direction. \nAlso I act decisively and with firmness in situations where doubts or dilemmas arise. \nFurthermore, I have a dose of perseverance to get activities done correctly and on schedule.\n\nIn situations where there is cooperation, I also work in a team- oriented manner. Here I do not only pay attention to the qualities within a team, but just as important, I think, is an open, honest, sincere and committed relationship between colleagues.\n\nSpecialties: Financial markets, Change management, Business Strategy.",
