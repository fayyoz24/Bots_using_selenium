    "summary": "The architecture realm is vast and I\u2019m constantly trying to learn as much about it as possible. Two wishes I\u2019ve carried around for long and try to realize in my work are \u2013 a. to blur the lines between design and technical phase so that from the beginning a realistic design is developed, and b. propagate the move towards a circular economy. \n\nTo achieve the first, I worked as a designer in multiple reputed firms in the U.A.E after a 5-year bachelor's in architecture. From there, I went on to specialize in Building Technology at TU Delft and gain knowledge from a technical perspective on subjects like \u2013 building physics, zero-energy design, structural design amongst others. \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve grown to become more and more aware of the damage we inflict on our surroundings by our mere existence. This is why I believe we must as a society prioritize moving towards a circular economy. As an architect-engineer, I\u2019m aware that I have the skills to accelerate this movement, thus, sustainability and circularity are important themes within my work. \n\nDuring a two-year MSc specialization in Building technology at TU Delft, I explored trade-offs and synergies between the design choices to achieve material circularity and high energy performance. I did so by creating an assessment method that measures the integrated circularity of a building using 6 indicators. I tested the method on self-built houses located in a development in Amsterdam with high ambitions for circularity and put the findings together to make a guideline for designers to follow. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about my journey (that maybe isn\u2019t covered below) or have a chat about a circular built environment, feel free to send me a message! \n",
