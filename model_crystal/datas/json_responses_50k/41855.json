    "summary": "Hello!,\n\nMy name is Oscar, photo-editor (\"the photoshop guy\"), and here is a bit of me, so you can get to know me better.\n\nI've been around for a while, more than 10 years of experience in the industry did teach me a thing or two. It all started in London, with brands as Hackett, New Look or Harrods, quickly transitioning to Net-A-Porter and Mr.Porter and spent 3 years building all the imagery for Ted Baker. Looking for the next challenge, I ended up in Amsterdam, managing teams remotely over four regions (London, Amsterdam, HongKong and Sydney) pushing our client's global campaigns and international e-commerce platforms. That was really fun but nothing in comparison with my actual position as Art & Print producer at Netflix, where I am feeling how all my years of working in this industry are been used creating stunning assets to push new shows and movies throughout the EMEA region.\n\nAlong the way, I've been super fortunate to work with amazingly talented professionals that share my passion and dedication on some of the most renowned brands. Thanks to working with them - Sony, Lenovo, Panasonic, Burberry, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein or Adidas - I evolved as professionals in a way that I will always be proud of what we archived together.  \n\nI enjoy all steps of my profession, from planning, brief creation and pre-production, to digi-op on location or simply just editing in my dark cave-like rooms, I've been part of many different types of projects but always treat each of them with the respect and importance required.  \n\nObsessed with photo editing, each day I realize how lucky I am that my path took me to this industry. Full of creativity, points of view, rules to follow and rules to bend. Nowadays, even when I feel that I may have seen it all, I still get shocked by some out of the ordinary requests, and that's fun.  \n\nIf you think that we can work together, it would be a pleasure. If you'd like to talk further, I'd love to get on the phone and answer any questions you might have.\n\nThanks again for your time and hope you have a great day!\nOscar",
