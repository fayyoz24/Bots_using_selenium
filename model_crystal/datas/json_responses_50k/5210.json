Our projects are based on helping orphanages creating this home feeling.\n\nSadly enough there are still many children in orphanages, abandoned in hospitals and forgotten by their parents and families.

Wanna'\u200b Help! raises money by sponsor activities for unforgettable moments for the children.\n\nWanna'\u200b Help raises money for several projects for orphans and abandoned children in Romania.\nThrough fundraising activities, benefit concerts and donations, we want to raise funds for these project you can read about at www.wannahelp.org.

Wij zijn een club van sociale ambitieuze professionals tot 40 jaar, die gezamenlijk een positieve bijdrage willen leveren aan de maatschappij. Daarnaast vergroten we ons netwerk op een leuke en vrijblijvende manier, die zowel ingezet kan worden op zakelijk- en priv\u00e9gebied.\n\nJCI Mergelland kiest ieder jaar een goed doel of maatschappelijk project uit om te steunen. Aan deze projecten, afhankelijk van de grote van het project, werken we 1 of 2 jaar, commissies worden samengesteld en evenementen worden opgesteld om geld in te zamelen voor het gekozen goede doel.\n\nZo steunde JCI Mergelland afgelopen jaren, onder de noemer Project DINO, gezinnen met een ernstig ziek kind die een verwenweek tegemoet gingen in de Efteling en Zorgbureau Talent die dagbestedingsprojecten organiseren voor (jong)volwassenen met een verstandelijke beperking. Meer hierover vind u onder de stichting.\n\nNaast deze 'serieuze' bezigheden organiseren we door het jaar heen ook genoeg andere social events waar we elkaar beter leren kennen en bijdragen aan een groter saamhorigheidsgevoel.\n\nwww.jcimergelland.nl"
