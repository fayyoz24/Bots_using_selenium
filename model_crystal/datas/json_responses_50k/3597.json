    "summary": "Are you, your company or team experiencing any of these issues, challenges, problems or obstacles before and during the pandemic?\n\n1. Developing and sustaining your Mental, Emotional & Physical Health and Well-Being \n2. Building and nurturing personal and professional connections, relationships and contracts\n3. Retention, productivity, growth and profitability\n4. Engagement, Empowerment & Inclusivity \n5. Finding and maintaining your Home, Work, Play Balance \n6. Learning to live with Corona\n\nIf you can relate to any of these, then I would you like to consider and imagine what lies over and beyond these walls, mountains and icebergs:\n\nCan you imagine a space, place and environment where you are still able to create, build and nurture lasting, beneficial, collaborative relationships, contracts and connections at Home, Work and Play?\nWhere finding and keeping the best people enriches your growth, productivity and profitability?\nWould you like to have access to tools, strategies, guidance and support for your mental, emotional and physical health and well-being?\n\nOr maybe you would like a practical personal and professional Balance sheet to help you ride the waves, stay in balance and reach your short & long term goals, targets and dreams despite Corona.\n\nEven better, how do you think you would feel if you knew how to find, create and maintain a new way of living with Corona that is beneficial, inclusive, healthy, encourages abundance, inspires action, is doable and fun?\n\nABOUT ME:\nI am a native New Yorker, born and raised in Queens very close to Kennedy Airport. Living close to an airport and having parents who were travellers is probably why I am passionate about travelling and experiencing new people, cultures, tastes, smells, customs and environments. \nI am curious by nature and have always loved numbers, music, dancing, learning, solving problems and figuring how things work and do what they do; especially with people!\nThis is reflected in the variety of my jobs; computer programmer, inventory planner, project manager, customer service, teacher, masseur, coach and dancer. \n\nWhen the pandemic first hit, I knew I needed to transform my company, create a space for businesses and their team members to navigate the waves of Corona & find and maintain their health & well-being; personally and professionally. \n\nWell, the transformation is complete....Welcome to the House of Balance!\n\nTo learn more about how I can support you and your company find and maintain their energy and balance click here : https://calendly.com/beingnbalance2022/blips4balance-30min",
