It was a part of the project \u201cEmotion Crowd\u201d at KTH Campus for implementing realistic human character in the scene. I developed a compatible custom shader in Unity which can be applied to any human character to get the realistic effect.\nIn my custom shader I put the following adjustment options:\n1. Specular Power\n2. Fresnel Value\n3. Curvature Scale\n4. Blur Bias\n5. Alpha Cutoff\nI started with the Head Model to see the effect of every adjustment. Next, I put the Stacy Model to examine the effects with my custom shader. In order to get a better result in Stacy Model, I had to adjust the normal map by creating from Grayscale and reducing the Bumpiness.\nAs a dynamic addition to my work, I demonstrated Image Based Lighting (IBL) effect in my human character models. I brought HDR image in my scene and then I generated Cube Maps from the HDR image using Skyshop. Skyshop takes HDR images (panoramas, crosses, or cubemaps) as input and generates diffuse and specular IBL Cube Maps from them. Along with the IBL tools, Skyshop comes with all the permutations of shaders and material types from Marmoset Toolbag. It is a very useful tool to work with.\nThis is a project work of the course DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction at KTH, Sweden under Professor Christopher Peters.\nFor more insight into the project please visit:\nhttps://portfolio-mskhan.rhcloud.com/category/dh2323/\n",

Implementing CPD in Python is novel and never done before. We compared the quality of our Python algorithm to Procrustes and ICP algorithms. The Python CPD shows good results and outperformed the other methods. We implemented the Coherent Point Drift in a pure python version without calling other programming language functions and built the excellent algorithm that can be directly used in the production level. In addition to this, we optimized our Python CPD by replacing almost all the codes in the function calculating matrix (vectorization) which highly improved the efficiency of the Python CPD and made it almost the same and sometimes even faster than the counterpart C mex function in the original Matlab program.
