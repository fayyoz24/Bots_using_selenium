I was working on topics like, what kind of products do we want to offer in both countries? And how do the processes, belonging to these products have to look like? First of all from the customers perspective, but also the technical feasibility. In-dept knowledge of the different markets, customers and IT landscape was crucial to do my job. Knowing where we wanted to go, I had to translate the vision into workable IT requirements, so that the development teams could start developing.
