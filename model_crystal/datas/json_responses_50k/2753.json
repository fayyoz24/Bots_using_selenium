After touring for a quarter of the past year, the band has developed a distinct new style, based in the tradition of Eastern European klezmer, gypsy, and Balkan music, but with their own contemporary edge. Violinist and trumpeter Dolan Jones and clarinetist Jason Alder bringing beautiful arrangements and harmonies together with interweaving lines and improvisations, and when Dolan switches to trumpet or Jason to the bass clarinet, the sonic spectrum can change dramatically. Stephan Raidl's groovy bass lines keep the energy moving, and when Andys Skordis kicks in with the percussion, dancing becomes the only option. Bringing their classical and jazz training together, their tunes take traditional melodies and transform them into a new-wave blend with elements of folk-rock, free jazz, Indian Karnatic music, and the pure trance-like state of 1960's psychedelia.\n\nTours and concert highlights include\nSummer 2012\nAustria \nIndependent research trip to Balkans: Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania\n\nMay 2012 \nHungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Switzerland\n\nDecember 2011 - January 2012\nUK and Ireland\n\nOctober 2011\nIsrael\n\nAugust - September 2011\nAustria, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Lichtenstein and Switzerland\n\nApril 2011\nGermany Austria and Hungary\n\nDecember 2011\nParadiso Main Stage\n\nJune - August 2010\nUK and Ireland including Glastonbury Festival, the Edinburgh Festival, the Galway Jazz Festival\n\nDecember 2009 - January 2010\nUK and Ireland\n\nAugust 2009\nFrance Italy and Germany\n\nDolan Jones, violin & trumpet\nJason Alder, (bass) clarinet\nStephan Raidl, contrabass\nAndys Skordis, percussion\n\nwww.payazen.com\nwww.facebook.com/payazen\nwww.myspace.com/payazen\nwww.twitter.com/payazen",
