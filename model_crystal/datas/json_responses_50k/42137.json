    "summary": "Passionate front-end developer with a lot of hours behind the keyboard writing HTML, (S)CSS, and JavaScript. Spends a lot of time with AngularJS, unit testing with Karma & Jasmine/Mocha, building with Grunt and Gulp, and loves to experiment with the new stuff like Angular and Webpack. If it's online, it's interesting!\n\nI'm also a firm believer in progressive web apps, responsive webdesign (when done correctly), offline-first and mobile-first, and CI/CD.\n\nI always try to expand and merge my interests and hobbies. Programming with an XBOX Kinect or (re)developing Chromecast as a \"DJ Experience\" are some of the things I very much enjoyed.",
