    "summary": "My passion lies in assisting pension plan boards in meeting their fiduciary responsibilities towards their beneficiaries and other stakeholders. As an advisor on investment related topics I intend to translate relevant academic insights into practical solutions for institutional investors and act as their trusted advisor across a broad range of investment related matters. In the past I have taken up this role at both for-profit (fiduciary advisor) as in non-profit organisations (pension plans), for instance at Philips Pension Fund and at AZL Fiducional (NN investment partners) as a client advisor.\n\nIn my current role as Senior Policy Advisor Investments I advise the Board of Trustees of ABP Pension Fund (with 550 bn euros in assets) in the Netherlands on Investment Strategy, ESG and oversight over the Investments that are outsourced to the Asset Manager (APG Investments).\n\nNext to that I am a Assistant Professor of Finance at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I teach the MSc course Institutional Investors, supervise MSc and PhD students and conduct research on a wide range of investment related topics. For instance, the impact of ESG on risk and return, mutual funds, active/passive investing, manager selection and style analysis. I am a fellow of the European Centre for Corporate Engagement (ECCE) at Maastricht University. The centre combines all research into ESG investing at Maastricht University. Next to teaching bachelor and master courses I also have extensive experience in executive teaching (including MBA) by blending my professional experience with the latest academic insights. \n\nMy academic research papers can be found via: http://papers.ssrn.com/author=851623",
