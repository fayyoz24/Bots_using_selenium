In my PhD research I go deeper into questions of memory politics, cultural memory, national identity, senses of belonging & home, post-memory, memories of WWII and the Soviet period. I lived in Tartu, Estonia, for 14 months, to do fieldwork and gather data (interviews, participant observation, archival research & surveys). I very much enjoy combining various research strategies, as to bring the strengths of different approaches together. Besides data collection, important tasks of the PhD trajectory include the analyses, writing both academic articles and your thesis, and presenting your research results to experts on conferences. Finally, my PhD project also entails teaching two courses to anthropology students at the VU University in Amsterdam. I had the pleasure to teach 'Introduction into anthropology' and 'Culture, power and diversity'.",

We were part of a team of 7 researchers, who all used the same 20 interviews to answer his/her own question. The idea of the project was to 'test' to what extent interviewdata can be reused and to see how many different questions can be posed to the same data. The project has resulted in a book and an open access publication.",
