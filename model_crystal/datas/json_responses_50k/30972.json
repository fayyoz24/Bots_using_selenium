    "summary": "I am a graduate of the Forest and Nature Conservation MSc program at Wageningen University & Research with a specialization in Policy and Society. I have professional experience working with the environmental policies (EU Green Deal, PPPWD, Farm to Fork, etc..) aimed at transforming Europe into a more sustainable and circular society from my internship with Natural Mineral Waters Europe (final grade: 8.5). I have spent significant time in Latin America (specifically Costa Rica and Ecuador) where I developed a deep love of nature and passion for conservation and ecotourism. I wrote my MSc thesis in Monteverde, Costa Rica on the potential of ecotourism guides as communication vectors for environmental and climate change related information. I have also worked on reforestation projects and led nature tours in Costa Rica for people of all ages and interest levels. As a result, I am an excellent communicator of environmental information, able to make difficult topics accessible to all knowledge and interest levels. Now living in the Netherlands, I am very comfortable in international settings and I hope to have a career in Europe working towards the development of a more sustainable, equitable and natural world. Outside of my professional interests, I love sports, traveling and talking around campfires at night.",
