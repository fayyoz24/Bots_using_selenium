    "summary": "\u27b8 \"\"How do we react to changing environments and markets and what should our organization look like tomorrow?\"\n\nThis is the type of challenge that I like to sink my teeth in. Change is eminent and only those who act instead of react will be able to keep a competitive advantage over others. A changing world means a need for new business models, new ways to address and bind customers and employees, but also a need for new and efficient operation models and (software) solutions that have never been thought of before.\n\nIn other words, we need new ways to run our companies and adapt to our changing environments in order to really make a difference in this world.  Doing this however requires a keen eye and experience in strategy, change management and technical- and operational planning in combination with strong leadership capabilities: the area's in which I excel.\n\nWant to know more about Omnext or just about me? Feel free to get in touch with me at any time! \n\n\u2709 bryan.de.vries@omnext.com\n\u260e + 31 (0) 6 34 73 53 75",
