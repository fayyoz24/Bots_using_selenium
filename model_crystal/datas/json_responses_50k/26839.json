Due to its high solubility in oil (higher than methane and nitrogen), it causes oil swelling, reduces oil viscosity, and also reduces IFT (dissolving in water and forming weak carbonic acid). \n\nIn my diploma thesis, I reviewed the technology of injection of carbon dioxide into the reservoir as a method of increasing the recovery in the Mullahol oil field, Uzbekistan. The minimum miscibility pressure, PVT properties of oil (gas saturation, volumetric ratio, viscosity) in contact with carbon dioxide in reservoir conditions were calculated, an assessment of the ultimate oil recovery was made, and the type of compressor for gas injection was proposed.",
