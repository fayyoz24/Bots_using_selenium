    "summary": "I have been working in international development and management for forty-five years. \n\nI have a diverse range of experience as school teacher; university lecturer and researcher; department head; education consultant; and programme and institutional manager; and latterly technical director and senior consultant. \n\nI taught and lectured in the UK from 1976-1991 working initially in schools as an English Language and Social Studies teacher and then as a teacher trainer in education and skills development in higher education. \n\nSince 1991, I have worked as both academic, consultant and manager providing technical support on behalf of the leading International Donor and Lending Agencies (IDLAS) through inputs into programmes in Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, Somaliland, South Sudan and South Africa) and Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan). Recently I have been extensively involved in and led teams, which have been engaged by IDLAs and National Governments to develop whole sector strategic plans within the context of Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks. These assignments were in Bangladesh, India, Lesotho, Namibia, Pakistan, South Sudan  and South Africa. \n\nI currently work as a Senior Consultant at Euroconsult/BMB Mott MacDonald in the Netherlands for Mott MacDonald's International Development Services, having just stepped down from  leading and coordinating Knowledge Management and the development of Professional and Technical Excellence, and  providing back office support to international economic and social development projects worldwide, to focus more on providing inputs into programmes. \n\nI am committed to a cooperative and participatory approach in all work and believe in the primacy of genuine working partnerships between North and South.\n\nSpecialties: My specific technical expertise lies in Project and Programme Appraisal, Planning and Development; Institutional Development including Public and Private Partnerships in various sectors; Curriculum Development; Teacher Training; Research, Evaluation and Impact Assessment.",
