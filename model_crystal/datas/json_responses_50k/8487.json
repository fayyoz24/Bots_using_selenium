This spanned multiple projects as we have successfully worked towards the full automation of bringing new merchants on board. All projects required full-stack development, including a back-office management tool.\n\n- Implementation of self-serve contract signing within the SFN app, including data-tracking - this eliminated a lengthy manual process of sending documents back and forth between the merchant and the company (Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, React, and Mode)\n- Technical design and implementation of a task-based onboarding process, replacing the existing linear one\n- Championed, designed, and implemented a project for the self-serve setup of shipping rates - a previously manual process that took hours for the onboarding-specialist support team\n- Championed, designed, and implemented a project for self-serve go-live of merchants with Shopify's SFN offering, making 95% of support contact redundant - now most merchants are able to onboard on their own, using the SFN app without manual intervention from the support team - designed a new manual process for exceptional cases where white-glove services are required, negotiating with various stakeholders, including the support team\n\n- Took the lead on the SFN application's on-demand cloud environment setup for development - introduced performance improvements, additional seed data, and configuration options for a smooth developer experience, saving 20 minutes per day per developer on average\n- Established testing and development principles for Shopify's in-house URL shortening tool, along with observability, allowing for production readiness and easy-to-use URL shortening for other systems",
