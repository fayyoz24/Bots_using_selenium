    "summary": "During my two years with Delta Electronic Europe, I was responsible for recruitment which involved interviewing many candidates in different European countries. I was also responsible for keeping in close contact with colleagues in differing countries in order to ensure projects and activities were being completed satisfactorily. I was also involved in other large and small HR projects including compiling job descriptions and the relevant job grades. Furthermore, I was the main contact in helping employees who were expatriated to the Netherlands in their relocation process. It was an interesting and valuable experience to be with Taiwanese company as it develops its growing business in Europe. \n\nIn my years with Unilever Bestfoods Europe Business Group, I was in charge of coordinating different projects which involved more than 20 European units. The projects consisted of implementing the Unilever Global People Survey, a 360 degree performance feedback system, and \u201cCoaching for Results\u201d, a training program for 100 key managers within UBFE. I was also responsible for different internal HR administration processes, which included salary reviews and share options, and for the user interface of an HR information system.\n\nIn my previous work experience, both as a Training Manager with Unilever Taiwan and as an HR Manager with Eli Lilly Taiwan, I managed varying compensation, recruitment and internal employee training programs.\n\nMy work experiences have provided me with a good knowledge and understanding of the HR function within both local and multinational companies.  I find that working with a multinational company suits me as I have lived in 3 different countries and accumulated a strong and sound knowledge of different languages and cultures. \n\nMy strengths are:\n- Project management.\n- Coordination and liaison among different parties\n- Management of training programs\n- Recruitment\n- Use of HR IT systems.",
