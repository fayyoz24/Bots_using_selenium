    "summary": "I have over 14 years of experience in programme coordination, administration, research and implementation, mainly in the areas of land and water management, climate adaptation, water buffering, livelihood development, agro-forestry and regreening. Most of my work focused on countries in the Global South, such as Ethiopia and Nepal but recently I realised that I could probably make more of a difference focusing my efforts on the food system transition in the Global North. \nI am passionate about tasty and healthy food and especially on making this available to everyone. I am very enthusiastic about pushing for out-of-the-box solutions and would love to explore Basic Income models as a way for improving people's dignity, autonomy, livelihoods, and access to a healthy and sustainable diet.",
