    "summary": "Passionate about human rights, accountability, and environmental justice, I'm a senior researcher and advocate at SOMO's Climate Justice team. My focus encompasses energy and extractive sectors, global supply chains, and corporate accountability. With a background in international law and human rights, I've delved into complex supply chains across industries such as mining, batteries, automobiles, electronics, and renewables. \n\nI have worked across regions, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Tanzania, Argentina, and Colombia.  My professional experience span non-profits, law firms, and high-risk areas where I collaborated closely with defenders and communities. \n\nMy academic education includes an LL.M. in International and Comparative Private Law from the University of Groningen, a Master's in Tax Law, and a Law Degree from the University of Monterrey, enabling me to effectively navigate complex initiatives and regulatory frameworks aimed at addressing social and environmental impacts, including those pertaining to human rights, labor practices, and environmental matters.",
