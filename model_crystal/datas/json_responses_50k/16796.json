    "summary": "I am currently doing my Master's in Biology: Modelling in the Life Sciences at the University of Groningen. Before coming here, I obtained my Bachelor's in Zoology degree at The University of Bristol. I am interested in animal sociality, coloration, visual ecology, and predator-prey interactions. I love herpetology and aspire to become a behavioral/computational ecologist. \n\nI just finished my first Master's research project that investigated whether differences in fruit abundance explain patterns of grouping and intersexual dominance in artificial chimpanzees and bonobos.\n\nI am currently doing my second Master's research project looking at the environmental factors influencing divorce in the Seychelles Warbler.",
