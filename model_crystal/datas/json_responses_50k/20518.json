    "summary": "Graduated from the University of Haarlem with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Naval Architecture in 2001. In 2004 I received my Master\u2019s degree in Social Sciences at the Vrije University of Amsterdam.\nAfter working in various engineering departments I worked for several years as a Research Engineer for Damen Shipyards in Gorinchem. Within the Research & Development department I later worked as a Project Manager and Team Leader for Damen Shipyards in Gorinchem.\nAfter working as the Senior Naval Architect for 3 years, I became the Engineering Manager for Vard Marine Inc in Ottawa (Canada).\nSince 2020 I am working full time as a constant after having started Rienk Terweij Engineering; a consulting naval architecture and marine engineering company.\nI am specialized in optimizing high speed craft vessels and ferries. Apart from having solid shipbuilding knowledge, my technical fields of expertise are ship hydrodynamics; resistance & propulsion, sea keeping, manoeuvring, sea trials, and secondly ship acoustics; noise and vibration on board of vessels. My personal trades from managerial perspective are my abilities to keep overview of the work and build interpersonal teams.\nI am highly motivated and enthusiastic and have a keen desire to continually update my knowledge and skills. I am an independent thinker but working together with team members to get the job well done is what gets me going. I have the ability to be flexible and adaptable in order to meet changing conditions or situations. Educated in the technical as well as in the social field makes me a flexible (project) manager.",
