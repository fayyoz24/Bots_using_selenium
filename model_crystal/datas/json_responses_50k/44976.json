We were invited to a small town in Tanzania to rebuild and paint an orphanage and school, as well as plan activities and lesson plans for the children. This project was quite unique, as it involved bringing together students from various different Nord Anglia students across the world. We were split into small groups of students and before the actual trip, we spent months planning activities and lesson plans, as well as organizing a resource pool for these activities. This involved a lot of dedication, as all of this had to be communicated and coordinated online, with pupils from all across the world. Moreover, we were tasked with raising money for our own plane tickets for the journey. This meant the students selected from our school also organized additional fundraisers, such as fairs and weekly bake sales. We ended up exceeding our fundraising goal by a sufficient amount, and this was then donated to the school for additional supplies and teaching resources. \nIt was a fantastic experience and taught me alot in terms of teamwork, especially in terms of an international, online setting with students you have not yet worked with or met beforehand. Moreover, the planning of different activities greatly enhanced my creativity and involved a lot of thinking outside the box."
