    "summary": "I am an educational psychologist with a research background in learning styles and strategies, deep level approaches to teaching and learning, and levels of learning outcome. I have considerable experience in curriculum development, especially regarding the needs of gifted children. My interests are in creative and divergent thinking, and in developing materials to promote an intrinsic motivation to learning by exploring and connecting ideas. I grew up in the  international environment of Hong Kong and have both personal and professional experience of many different cultures and educational systems. My university studies and PhD were completed in the UK. I then lived in Israel and the United States before moving to the Netherlands where I have mainly worked in establishing gifted programs in primary schools and in teacher training. I continue to develop materials which motivate children and teachers to take a deeper and broader interest in what they learn, at the same time increasing their skill and general awareness of how to learn. I give workshops and seminars to teachers at primary and secondary levels as well as presentations to other educational professionals.\nI speak Dutch and English fluently and make materials in both languages.",
