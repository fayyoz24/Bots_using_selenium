    "summary": "Although it may seem paradoxical, the main bankers for companies are \u2026 companies! Accounts receivable represent \u20ac25,000 billion worldwide (50% of world GDP) and make up #40% of the assets of a company and ...\n=> It\u2019s growing! With open account becoming the standard term of sales\n=> It\u2019s risky! The main cause for bankruptcy (25%) being the default of a client\n=> It\u2019s scary! To offset an unpaid receivable of just \u20ac10,000, suppliers working on a 5% margin will have to generate \u20ac200,000 extra sales. In the haste to do so, they may not select carefully their new clients, thus running into new unpaid receivables \u2026\n\nWe, at Atradius, believe that selecting prospects, monitoring clients, collecting unpaid receivables can consume a lot of resources that companies could advantageously share Our mission is to help our customers expand worldwide by securing their cash flows and making available at an affordable cost the infrastructure we have been building over a century:\n- credit wise, by providing the latest corporate solvency information on the largest number of companies;\n- collection wise, by leveraging through size, their efforts in their home market as well as in countries where language or insolvency laws may be unfamiliar to most people!\n\nContact me to learn more about what credit insurance can do for your company and the financial health of your business .
