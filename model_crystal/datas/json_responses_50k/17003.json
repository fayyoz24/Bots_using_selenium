    "summary": "Urban manager with a specialization in Economics and a master's degree in Urban Management, Sustainability, and Climate Change. I possess a holistic approach that enables me to analyze, develop, and address challenges in a unique manner. With seven years of experience in diverse fields spanning the private and public sectors, I have gained a comprehensive perspective.\n\nThroughout my career, I have worked on various topics, including sustainable mobility, socio-economic and financial assessment, risk assessment, project evaluation, research, urban planning, and sustainability from different stakeholder viewpoints. This breadth of experience equips me with a well-rounded approach to tackling challenges, problems, and projects.\n\nCurrently, my primary focus is on enhancing people's quality of life sustainably, while considering the adverse impacts of climate change resulting from population growth and resource scarcity. To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to develop, manage, and analyze financial tools and instruments that unlock and encourage financial support for implementing projects that address global issues.\n\nI am a disciplined, optimistic, adaptable, and creative individual who thrives on continuous learning. I am motivated by challenges, strive to achieve goals, and consistently deliver outstanding results.\n\n\n#Sustainability #Consultancy #Climate change #urbandevelopment",
