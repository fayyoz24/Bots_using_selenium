This component is currently being used on a daily basis every time a new content for RTL XL becomes available for playout.\n\nCurrently, we are 100% cloud based. We worked on integrating Videoland content to build a single platform that combines RTL XL and Videoland content and provides the best experience for all users in The Netherlands.\n\nWe make sure our microservices are rock solid by writing proper unit, integration, component, pact and e2e tests.\n\nWe work in a full Scrum team of six developers, including a Product Owner, a Tech Lead and a Scrum Master. I take over the Scrum Master role whenever it's needed by the team.\n\nAchievements: Implement code coverage checks as a restriction in our .NET build CI pipeline (for all Kubernetes and Azure Web Applications), forcing the whole .NET code base of RTL to be properly covered by both unit and integration tests, on branch, line and method coverage levels. This way we guarantee that the code that reaches a deployment phase is properly tested beforehand.\n\nTechnologies involved: .Net Core, Entity Framework Core, C Sharp Functional Extensions, RabbitMQ (using Mass Transit), Azure Storage, Azure Media Services, Azure web apps, Docker (Kubernetes), Azure SQL and Cosmos Databases (Mongo), Coverlet, Swagger, VSTS",
