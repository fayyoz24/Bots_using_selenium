During my time at Coastwatch, I coordinated and led community outings around the locality to promote and highlight the importance of local pollinators in coastal habitats. Such outings involved educational talks and activities for participants of all ages. Something that has always been of great importance to me is bridging the gap between science and the community. As science can sometimes be inaccessible to the general population, it is of great importance to inform local communities of the habitats in which they reside and how they can nurture these habitats, in turn giving agency back to the community. Working with Coastwatch allowed me to do this, while also building relationships with residents and professionals. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to attend public sector meetings and large scale events as a Coastwatch representative. The experience I gained working with Coastwatch gave me invaluable insights into the ways in which NGOs operate across spatial scales, from local to global, involving different actors and stakeholders from a range of disciplines. Most importantly, this opportunity allowed me to work in a field I am passionate about and learn more about the multitude of ways in which organisations such as Coastwatch contribute to tackling issues of climate change and biodiversity loss.",
