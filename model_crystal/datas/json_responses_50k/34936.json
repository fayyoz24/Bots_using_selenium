It is the place where employees from the different companies/tenants come together and where clients are received. Zones have been designed to support different activities. You can sit at a table with your laptop, relax at the window side, there is a bar where high quality products are served and there are variety of seats where informal consultations can take place,  as well as working with colleagues and/or visitors. A large meeting room behind the counters on the ground floor is suitable for conferences and large meetings.",

The use of geo thermal power as well as cooling the building with water from the Harlingertrekvaart and PV-cells on the roof, provide a robust saving of energy. All these durable and energy saving techniques have to ensure that the building will be both Leed platinum and Breeam-NL certified.
