    "summary": "Nothing is impossible is a slogan I really can relate to. Quickly noticing several opportunities and scenarios and looking at today as a starting point to build the future. Taking initiative in exploring new paths to reach organisational objectives motivates me the most. When facing difficulties, I rely on my intuition. My eagerness sometimes gets the better of me and this can result in impatience. I enjoy working on challenging projects with a team and feel comfortable in highly complex and dynamic business environments. \n\nLBSI 4,6,3,1\n\nSpecialties: Change Management, Organisational Development, Strategy, Management Development, Talent Management, Strategic HR Management",
