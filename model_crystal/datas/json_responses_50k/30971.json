    "summary": "Electronics R&D: During my career I have solved many real world problems that I encountered as a Laser and Vision specialist. I solved the problems designing and constructing devices and interfaces that would provide the data that led to the solutions.\nLaser Specialist: I have been working with Lasers since 1997. I started out as an IQ engineer at AB_Lasers Inc which was later acquired by Rofin Inc. After the takeover I worked a while in the Netherlands as an R&D engineer at the faculty for movement sciences of the VU in Amsterdam. Then I retuned to Rofin.\nI was stationed at several Intel Manufacturing facilities in different countries. Including Phoenix Arizona, Costa Rica and Singapore. The Intel environment is an extremely demanding environment, where strict \u201cCopy Exactly\u201d implementation and a strong emphasis on CI \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d are the key drivers. Those drivers represent values that I have picked up over the years. \nThe Rofin Laser Systems were embedded in complicated mechanical robots. These robots had 10 axes of motion and up to 5 inspection cameras. While working with mechanical robots and with tight Intel mechanical production specifications and associated product control, I gained insight into how to control that production quality is maintained.\nEnforcement of the parameters was based on lots of experimentation and getting the right numbers from real significant data. This has also given me insight into how to design the right experiments in order to obtain correct and relevant information.\nSometimes I designed special equipment with associated software using gcc or delphi for guis to perform the experiments.\nOver the years I have written many technical manuals and bulletins for the use of these machines, as well as bulletins for structural machine modifications.\nVision Specialist: At Rofin I already had a lot of experience with vision systems. At Eaglevision I gained extensive experience in the position of R&D engineer, among other things.\nTeacher: Direct after graduating I worked as an electronics and physics teacher. In that position I gained a lot of depth in the theory. My work in IT at UNICEF learned me that IT is a nice tool to get things done, but hardly a goal.",
