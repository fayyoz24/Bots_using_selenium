When they met in 2016 at the Cannes film festival, they discovered a common need. Film lives incredibly in Amsterdam, but in their neighborhood - Nieuw-West - they couldn't go to the cinema.  So they decided to take matters into their own hands and founded the Oxville Foundation. The trio has been active in distribution and production for a decade and sees with Oxville Cinema the perfect opportunity to transfer their passion for film into Amsterdam Nieuw-West.  Together with its residents, they wish to build a community of film lovers. The films that they are offering are as broad as possible so that everyone - from young to old - can be served.

Stichting Oxville from Amsterdam, Kinograph from Brussels and La Friche/ Cin\u00e9ma le Gyptis from Marseille join hands to create cinema hubs on a local level in challenging districts with poor or non-existing cinema infrastructure. \n\nThe aim of the project is to realize a new film and cultural offer in the cinema, giving the young European audience \u2013 Generation Z \u2013 dynamic, collective experiences. These experiences allow young Europeans to position themselves as more than just a spectator: as a programmer and maker.\n\nBy creating activities that help develop the engagement and commitment of a young audiences and actively exchange knowledge and experience between the participants of Generation Z and the partners, it will be better understood how the cinema can be used as a platform for creating cultural and social synergy. In particular among the young European audience of Generation Z.\n\nIn Amsterdam, eight to twelve-year-olds from the New West district discover the cinematic landscape and learn about the possibilities that the silver screen has to offer. Generation Z encourages the participants to discover talents starting from their own environment and interests and then to point out new possibilities and challenges. In a similar way, the youngsters in Marseille (twelve to eighteen-years-old) will participate in the film workshops to rediscover the silver screen. In Brussels the students of Generation Z will add a new fresh programming section to Kinograph.\n\nWe have created an online platform (www.cinemahub.eu) where all information is made available. The results and expertise that we gain during this project will be made available to others. Our focus is also to promote mutual cooperation and exchange knowledge within Europe.",
