    "summary": "Whilst working on her dissertation, she works in the capacity of researcher within the Engineering Education team of the Faculty of Engineering, Stellenbosch University. She has a clear enthusiasm and passion for teaching and is fervent about encouraging critical, creative and systems thinking. \n\nHer academic and professional expertise lies in the field of energy policy and finance, with special regards to the integration of renewables and tariff designs within municipal electricity distribution systems. She has worked on energy and local government related projects for the Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies (CRSES) at Stellenbosch University and WWF-SA. \n\nHer PhD topic concerns municipal governance models in energy transitions using Systems Dynamics Modelling techniques and Power BI for data analytics and visualisations. She focuses specifically on renewable energy policy interventions that are financially sound, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable.",
