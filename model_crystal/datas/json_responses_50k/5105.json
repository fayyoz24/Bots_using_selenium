It was a good fit for me as I had 20 years of experience in this industry. I started at the bottom of the hierarchy but was involved in every aspect of the business from on-site installations, to Welding PVC and material Sewing. Finally the steel workshop...... This was a great fit for me and I ended up taking over all-steel type operations for Buitink. We worked with mostly Aluminium and Stainless Steel (RVS) and I was responsible for the delivery of all steelwork. This was achieved after a handover process with a ''Werkvoorbereider'' where materials and manufacturing drawings were issued. It was also during this time that I studied T.I.G Welding and got certified to weld Aluminium, RVS, and Steel. Once again I found myself in charge of a large team of steelworkers from Professional Welders to Fitters and Turners. I had to monitor and evaluate my team constantly and also oversee their timekeeping and make sure they were delivering a good product.",
