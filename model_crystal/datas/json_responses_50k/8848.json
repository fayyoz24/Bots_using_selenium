    "summary": "Hi and nice to meet you!\n\nMy name is Denise and I am a coach for personal development as well as a project facilitator specialized in sustainability, cultural and social domains.\n\nI have a diverse professional background having worked on environmental, cultural and social issues across four continents. This diversity reflects my innate curiosity to explore the world, my creative problem-solving skills, and my genuine interest in people.\n\nThese qualities are especially valuable in my work as a coach and project facilitator. As a coach, I work with individuals on their personal and professional journey. As a facilitator, I accompany projects from inception to implementation, provide strategic advice, and intervene during critical moments.\n\nI started my own business in March 2023 after having worked for various state and non-state organizations, giving myself the full freedom to work on what matters most to me, to be flexible, as well as apply and continuously learn different skills as an entrepreneur.\n\nPAST EXPERIENCE\nI worked for the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs on water management, where I got trained in diplomacy and international cooperation. I worked for the Mekong River Commission in Laos with people from Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. I was part of the NGO Asia Society Switzerland working on Asian geopolitics, cultural and social affairs. I worked in Costa Rica with a local organization in Central America, focusing on women's empowerment.",

Check out my website for more information at denisestaubli.com/coaching or book a free new client info call at calendly.com/denisestaubli/coaching-info-call\n\nMy aim as a coach for personal development is to to empower people so that they can be in their strengths and live a fulfilling life at ease with themselves. I firmly believe that people are valuable as they are and carry everything in themselves to live the life they want. The answer to a problem or what to do next is, however, not always obvious. We might be stuck in emotions, complicated circumstances or our own patterns and beliefs. I support my clients by giving them a safe space to share what needs to be shared, to let go what no longer needs to be there, and to discover their own paths \u2013 be it in their personal or professional life.",
