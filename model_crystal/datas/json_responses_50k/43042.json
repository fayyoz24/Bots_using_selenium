    "summary": "Computational chemist with experience in free energy calculations and Molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structure-property relationship in various materials. \n\nCurrently finishing my PhD along with a team of experimentalists, focusing on understanding the structural factors responsible for obtaining potentially good piezoelectric and elastic properties in Metal-Organic Frameworks. Another part of the project includes the study of the rotational dynamics of linkers in MOFs which has important effects on the optical and mechanical properties of MOFs.\n\nPrevious experience in computational chemistry during Master's project includes validation of implicit electrolyte model (VASPSol) which was implemented in plane-wave DFT code VASP. Gained experience with DFT calculations on slabs and calculation of surface energies in the presence of solvent.\n\nServed as a Corrosion and Reliability Engineer in Reliance Industries for two years. Undertook responsibility for the integrity of all static equipment and pipeline in the Utility unit.",
