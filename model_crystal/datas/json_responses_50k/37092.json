    "summary": "It took me a completely different study to realize what I am capable of...\n\nI am Jesse van Arendonk and currently studying International Business Management at the Avans University of Applied Sciences. \n\nInitially, my focus was on graphic design, a field that demanded creativity and the ability to think outside the box. Although I completed my studies in graphic design, I realized that pursuing it as a full-time career wasn't my calling. However, this experience taught me invaluable problem-solving skills, using creativity to overcome multiple challenges. As my interest in International Business grew, I quickly realized that this is the field I would like to work in.\n\nKnown for my open-mindedness and pursuit of perfection, I thrive in collaborative settings. I possess excellent communication skills in both Dutch (native) and English (C1), while actively listening and engaging with others during conversations. Moreover, I have advanced computer skills, proficient in working with various professional programs such as Adobe software and Office 365, including Excel.\n\nIf you are working or studying in the same branch as I am, please feel free to connect! You can also email me with any questions or other inquiries.",

(Please, refer to the contributers below). \n\nThe concept was so promising that it officialy got adopted by the Bussines, Leadership, and Sustainability Minor of Avans, Breda. \n\nIt's a way for students to engage with fashion in a different way by providing a convenient platform for trading second-hand clothing. Students are rewarded via a points-based rewards system, which they can utilize to purchase other sustainable brands.",
