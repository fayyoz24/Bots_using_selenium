    "summary": "I'm a Global Director of Insights & Strategy with nearly a decade of experience creating narratives for brands & products to be relevant in culture. I\u2019m the person agencies and brands hire to understand the now to best find solutions for what's to come - while ensuring everyone has a good time in the process.\n\nWith experience across borders and categories, I have worked with Uber, Beats, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, adidas, Whatsapp, Zalando, Affirm & Twitter, among others in education, tech, luxury, beauty, alcohol & lifestyle, on projects with global and local reach in the US, UK, Europe, China and Brazil. My work usually sitts at the intersection of comms, brand & social, with culture at the heart of it all.\n\nMy favourite feeling to have & evoke is \"I haven't thought about it that way\", and I always, always try to leave people with a smile or a new thought, hopefully both - especially when running workshops and training sessions.\n\nSay hi, we surely have interesting things to learn from each other. I'm nomadic, working remotely and delivering workshops and presentations in person when it's best. Since starting &Ingra, I've had clients based on the West Coast all the way to Tokyo, Hong Kong and Dubai, through London, New York, Zurich and Amsterdam.  \n\n\n\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udde0 Want to work together? Learn how to make friends as an adult? Get better at asking engaging questions? Talk strategy, creativity & the future of human behaviour? Say hi.\n\n- \nI'm always keen to meet new people. If we don't personally know each other, please send a note with your connection invite. There's a lot of spam out there. \u2728",
