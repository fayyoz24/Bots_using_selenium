    "summary": "Dr. Natalie Dixon is Founder and Cultural Insights director at affect lab, a women-led creative studio and research practice based in Amsterdam.  Natalie is a storyteller, design researcher and creative place-maker harnessing technology and narrative to create more inclusive spaces. She has 20 years experience in digital storytelling with a focus on how powerful narrative tools can create more equitable and diverse public conversations. Her practice is characterised by a passion for lesser-heard stories forged through an upbringing in South Africa and her background in independent journalism. Her projects have two key goals: creating space for stories from the margins to be heard; and critically reflecting on the role of technology in community making. As part of affect lab, she holds space for international artists to collaborate and inspire networks of trust and connection.",
