    "summary": "A passionate self-starter ready to use my environmental expertise and community-minded framework to grow one's business while raising action towards the climate emergency! \n\nIt's definitely a mission to achieve so how do I do it? Here's how - either current or past achievements:  \n- Risk analysis throughout apparel supply chain: creating a risk mapping of production countries based on research and analysis + delivering risk training to staff + managing & remediating these risks throughout the supply chain\n- Packaging policy: co-creating an effective policy to reduce plastic waste and save costs \n- Marketing strategy: integrating climate science and a bit of cheekiness to activate communities + coordinating events and campaigns including public speaking \n- Development of new business models: assisting in trying new business models (rental, resell, secondhand, etc.)\n- Benchmark/ feasibility studies: researching and analyzing retailer requirements regarding sustainability to determine next direction\n\nToo familiar and nerdy about professional topics such as: the outdoor community, B Corp, environmental psychology, activism, legislation & lobbying related to sustainability, and more!",
