    "summary": "I am a highly experienced professional in establishing business intelligence & analytic solutions, master data management & data quality initiatives and the technical integrations behind those. \n\nFor me, establishing successful solutions that actually create value for organizations and individuals is the most satisfying. To achieve this I take full responsibility for everything I can do within my role to ensure customer satisfaction.  \n\nI am successful in working with both complex large global companies as well as smaller local organizations because my combination of:\n\u2022\tConsultative selling & stakeholder management skills.\n\u2022\tProject management & hands-on technical skills.\n\u2022\tPro-active attitude towards customers & co-workers.\n\u2022\tSelf-starting mentality & make things happen approach.\n\nI have been working in both external roles as internal positions. Regardless of being internal or external, my main goal is always to drive the adoption of solutions by:\n\u2022\tDesigning relevant solutions to support business value initiatives or solving hampering issues \n\u2022\tTranslating solutions to required capabilities\n\u2022\tEstablishing required capabilities through technological features\n\u2022\tEnsuring value creation by enabling the people and the organization to use the solutions\n\nI was fortunate to work with complex global organizations across the world being part of on-site and virtual teams. The core main value I display in overcoming cultural differences and getting people involved to successfully work together is building trust. \n\nBecoming the trusted adviser is not only instrumental to overcoming cultural differences but also to gain support on all levels within the organization involved in making the solutions a success. I do this by:\n\n\u2022\tListening to internal & external stakeholders to gather individual requirements and understand their \n        personal motivation to tailor my message to the intended audience\n\u2022\tActively display & demo hand-on experience with relevant tools & methods to illustrate how \n        technological features address user needs on all levels\n\u2022\tApplying consulting & communication skills to enable the organization and empower individuals \n\u2022\tBuilding, leading, managing and motivating teams & projects delivering concrete results\n\nIf you are interestred in establishing a value creating information management solution, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, send an email to frans.tolen@gmail.com or give me a call on +31 6 126 00 185.",

My role here was to define and standardize the Management Information reports and dashboards, by KPI standardization and strategy map.\n\nNext to this I designed the organizational unit, including tasks and responsibilities, that was going to drive the implementation of the strategy map and related dashboards and delivered the 3-year roadmap to be followed.\n\nAlmost all work took place in Israel Tel Aviv, but as TEVA is really spread-out across the world I also had to work with parts of TEVA in Czech Republic, UK, US, Canada and Germany. Working with so many different cultures has been an enormous challenge, but also an extremely rewarding experience. ",

They are based in Auckland, New-Zealand where I spend a considerable amount of time  for this project with them.\n\nFonterra is experiencing fierce competition from other companies. As one of the few companies I worked with, they understood consumer business was changing and visionary changes were needed in their consumer oriented processes.\n\nSo they started a really big project, completely redesigning all of their front- and back end processes but implementation should be done through industry leading software packages like SalesForce and SAP. \n\nMy task here was to bring in latest developments and best practices in consumer marketing and customer loyalty. I did this through facilitating workshops, in which Fonterra people from all countries where Fonterra is present,  discussed their ideas and thoughts on the best practices I brought in.  \n\nThe end-result was a mutual defined and thus accepted process model, ready to be implemented through SAP and SalesForce. \n",

At some point they understood that their current \"IT services for Business\" department was not capable of supporting the strategic choice to invest heavily in Multi-Channel customer management. \n\nTheir solution was to completely redesign this department and my task was to introduce and define processes needed to move towards Multi-Channel customer management.    For this I firstly organized a number of plenary workshops to explore processes needed. Secondly detail the discovered processes with the expected process owners, thirdly translate processes into individual job descriptions and fourthly assess the current employees on this job-description to do gap-analysis and prepare a training plan.\n\nAs it should be, UCB took full responsibility to develop and execute a change management roadmap crafting their way forward. During the implementation of their roadmap I was only engaged in the advisory board  to coach them on their journey.",
