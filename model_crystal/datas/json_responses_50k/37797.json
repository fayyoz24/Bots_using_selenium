Dit kun je leren, bijvoorbeeld tijdens een Gilwell-cursus. Gilwell is een avontuur waarin je samen met andere scouts stilstaat bij jezelf en jouw rol in een team of groep. In een Gilwell-cursus krijg je meer inzicht in je eigen gedrag en drijfveren, en zo leer je jezelf beter kennen. Tijdens een Gilwell-cursus kies je zelf in welke mate en wanneer jij uitdagingen aangaat en leer je aan de hand van drie kernwoorden: Ontmoeten, Ontdekken en Ontwikkelen.\n\nB525 is een speciale variant van Gilwell en trok reizend door Nederland waardoor trainingsonderdelen in treinen, op pleinen en op andere niet voor de hand liggende plekken plaatsvonden.
