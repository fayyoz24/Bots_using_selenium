    "summary": "Victor Sonna (b. 1977) is a visual artist born in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon and now living and working in the Netherlands. He graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven and St. Joost School of Art & Design in 2008. \n\nSonna\u2019s artistic practice is formed and informed by his genealogy. Negotiating between Cameroon and the Netherlands and constantly having to reinvent himself in these radically different socio-cultural contexts, means he is occupied with a struggle between holding onto his African roots on one hand, and assimilating into his European home on the other. His personal diasporic experience of being in-between cultures is always present in his work and he is deeply touched by what occurs in-between things. Much of his work is born from tensions arising in-between worlds, cultures, and styles, resulting in artworks that de-familiarise and test the boundaries. Notions of identity and belonging are questioned through his artistic exploration of the spaces in-between \u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cbecoming\u201d, past and present, and Africa and the West. \n\nRecent solo-exhibitions include: Beyond Echo (Out of the Fire, Dak'Art, La Biennale de Dakar, Senegal) and 1525 (Van Abbemuseum, The Netherlands). Upcoming: Stoel neemt Stelling (Centraal Museum, Utrecht, September 23, 2023 - January 14, 2024)\n\nGrants & prizes: Werkbijdrage Bewezen Talent, Mondrian Fund; Winner Best book designs 2020 for Victor Sonna. 1525.",

My origins and my identity are in an ongoing state of tension. Something has to crumble first before it can be built anew.\n\nIn my view, the dynamics of cultural identity do not only show through conflicts, with cultural differences also functioning as a kind of mold in which new forms are being created.

This project focused on child-soldiers in Mali, asking questions about the terrible choices and realities these children had to face. Another collaborative  project was \u201cTrue Colours\u201d, in which Sonna gave underprivileged women in Mali the opportunity to develop their artistic skills and talents",

A single five is added: one of the first transatlantic transports of enslaved people took place in 1525.   \n\nSeptember 2017 - If It Was My Imagination [Art Berlin]\nIf It Was My Imagination shows how perished glory can be transformed into a new narrative. If you close the door, development will shut down.New objects arise from various old and found parts, showing my reflections on the idea that all forms, materials and functions of objects are rooted in an earlier usage or another life. These objects are a reaction to perfection and mass production: a reflection on scarcity and abundance.\n\nOctober 2017 - Next Nature \nDay to day reality forced me to improvise , combining all kinds of materials in new ways and \ncreating new objects in the process.Everything around us is in flux and nothing is absolutely fixed. This causes everything we experience as being secure, to be actually very transitory and volatile.\n\nOctober 2016 - Anatomy of Identity [Van Abbemuseum]\nAnatomy of Identity is about the toll-taking return of that which has been pushed away. It investigates the effects of opposing and colliding patterns on identity, translating this into works which have become disturbed and disturbing not only as far as their form is concerned but also with regard to their function and use. Perhaps we are all designers who sometimes form and shape the world while being shaped and formed by it at another time.\n\n5 december 2014 - Januari 2016\nFuture Nostalgia : in Anthropocene exhibition in the Deutsches Museum.",
