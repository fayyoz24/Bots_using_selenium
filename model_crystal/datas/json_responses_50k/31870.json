    "summary": "I am a wife, mother, engineer, expatriate, planner and problem-solver.\nI am originally from South Africa and moved to the Netherlands in February 2020.  I took some time off to settle with my family in a new country, learn a new language and completed a short course in Project Management.\nI am passionate about the environment and enjoy participating in optimising engineering solutions in order to reduce and change the external impact for the better.  I have 9+ years of experience in the electrical power transmission utility environment and I enjoy working in a team alongside diverse professionals from different backgrounds and skill sets. \nI completed my Bachelor\u2019s degree in Civil Engineering in December 2010 and started my career at Eskom Holdings Ltd in 2011.  As a design engineer, I was responsible for feasibility, concept and detail design of various large substation projects up to 765 kV.  Due to my interest in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d and large complex problems, I continued my further studies in Environmental Engineering at the University of Pretoria (BEng Hons, 2013).  In 2014, whilst continuing in my work as a project engineer I was fortunate to be successfully  selected to participate in the Eskom Power Plant Engineering Initiative as researcher and engineer.  This program allowed me to further develop my skills in solving large problems and provided ample opportunities to work with various persons outside of the design environment.  As part of this program, I completed my Masters degree in Chemical Engineering and applied my research to strategic environmental projects within the organization.\nI am a dedicated, disciplined and hardworking individual that flourishes in a dynamic environment.  I take pride in my work and I am determined to achieve goals, set by myself and my superiors.  I have a logical, rational and critical thinking approach and I am comfortable with analytical problem solving.  I have a high preference for organisation and procedural approaches and also attention to detail.  I can strongly focus on the task at hand by being precise and accurate in my approach.  I have a high regard for security and safekeeping and thus find comfort in planning to be prepared for all events.  I am educated and well-read which places me in the advantageous position to communicate effectively. \nIn my free time I like to read, travel the world, do event planning and coordination and most importantly spend quality time with my family and friends.",
