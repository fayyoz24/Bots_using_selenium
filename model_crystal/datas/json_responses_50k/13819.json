    "summary": "A multipotentialist with a deep interest in a broad range of topics, who gets excited about innovation, creative thinking, and social and sustainability start-ups. In general, I like trying new things in new ways. I love to be outdoor, hiking or rock-climbing. And have a deep passion for music.\n\nPreviously, co-founded a green-tech start-up and completed an internship at a humanitarian non-profit.\n\nI have five years of experience in management consulting, advising organizations operating in a broad range of industries, both in the Netherlands and in an international context. Working as a business intelligence consultant for the past three years has strengthened my skillset with hands-on experience in data and business analytics.\n\nPeople who have worked with me will tell that I am an idealist. I have a vision of what I want the world to be, and the (business) challenges ahead getting there. With a philosophical and open mindset, my perspective on business is fresh, creative, and challenges the status quo.",
