    "summary": "I am a first year student pursuing International hotel management bachelor's degree at NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences. I have experienced a variety of cultures since I was young because I have lived in China for twelve years, 7 years in Malaysia, and now I am living in the Netherlands. China, Malaysia, and Netherlands are large countries that are popular for the variety of rich cultures and races, which I believe is crucial for hospitality industry. Also, I can speak three different languages-Chinese, Korean, and English-fluently. I believe having language skills are essential in hospitality industry as well because we must offer service to people from different parts of the world.\n\nI am studying international hotel management because I love interacting with people from various fields, which can help me to broaden my perspective. Also, I was always interested in how a place where we normally visit as a guest, like a hotel, is actually running behind and attracting the people around the world since I was young. Thus, I am pursuing Hospitality at NHL Stenden of Applied science. \n\nI am currently working part-time in one of the biggest Asian restaurants in Leeuwarden as an assistant chef. I always serve my guests as the way I wanted to be served because that is the only way I believe that I am trying my best. Furthermore, I take humility very seriously because there are a lot of people who want respect and compliment from the public but not willing to sacrifice themselves sincerely and quietly for the organization. Also, trust is substantial because I believe we cannot achieve any astounding accomplishment without trusting each other in the hospitality industry.\n\nI did not prefer the strict and limited educational system in Chinese school, so I had chosen to study most things by my own when I was in the eighth grade in school. As a result, I have become a person who is more responsible and know how to self-study and manage my time efficiently. For example, I passed the Korean GDE (General Educational Development) and I have gotten one hundred in Toefl Exam by learning english from watching dramas and memorizing vocabulary books by myself by using the schedules that I made myself. \n\nAfter I finish my bachelor\u2019s degree, I am eager to work in the marketing department of a hotel chain where I can use my language skills and cultural awareness most efficiently. Therefore, if you are interested to have a conversation about different cultures and languages and their benefits in hotel management, send me a message. I would like to hear from you.",
