    "summary": "Hello and thank you for watching my Linkedin profile. My name is Robert Kunath and i graduated from the Rotterdam Business University, Trade Management Asia. \n\nMy passion goes towards consultancy, international trade, and the financial markets (stock markets and Forex). I am a analytical person. I like to spot problems, and generate appropriate solutions around them. These solutions can contribute either in short, fast-phased projects, or for longer term revenue creation purposes. I like spotting new opportunities and trends in todays markets. \n\nWhile having traded the financial forex market since 2011, i am currently active with two websites. One website is focused on trading forex, while the other provides information and a forum related to psychedelic stocks (Shroomstocks). \n\nLast but not least i would like to mention my passion for international trade. For my study i have been to Japan for the duration of 9 months. During this time i went to a international university and worked for a non-profit organisation. The adaptation to specific business cultures played a mayor key-factor, for anything to be successful. Being in close contact with local, as well as international customers is something i am definitely interested in.",
