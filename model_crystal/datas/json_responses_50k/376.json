    "summary": "Throughout my 15+ year career I have focused on helping organizations getting more value out of IT and digital. Often this has not much to do with changing or investing in technology. It is almost always primarily about culture, leadership, and organizational transformation. In my view, in these disruptive times, digital-driven innovation and organizational transformation is urgent and a necessity for organizations to survive.\n\nI am passionate about building High-Performance Digital Organizations. I strive to make as much positive impact as possible by leading and transforming organizations, by taking sr. management and non-executive positions. In addition, I am committed to inspiring and developing as many leaders and professionals as possible. I thus actively participate in various communities and share my knowledge and experiences via training, coaching and consulting activities.",
