    "summary": "I received my Ph.D. in Social and Political Sciences from the European University Institute (EUI) in June 2018. In January 2018, I was shortlisted for the 2018 Maria Ioannis Baganha Best Dissertation Award from the International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion Network (IMISCOE). In 2015, I was selected as a promising young scholar to participate in the Academy of Urban Superdiversity held in Berlin, organized by the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity. In 2014, I was accepted at the Maastricht Centre for Citizenship, Migration and Development (MACIMIDE) as a junior research fellow.\n\nMy work has received the generous support of the EUI; the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT); and the Mexican Central Bank Fund for the Development of Human Resources (FIDERH), among other sponsors.\n\nMy research focused originally on voters and migrants. Which are the best voting systems? How migration is related to patterns of violence in origin countries? How migrant and ethnic social movements arise? What are the effects of migration policies? In the last years my focus shifted from migrants to passengers. Which factors determine their satisfaction? These are the questions that have guided my research so far.\n\nThe academic and social potential of my work can be seen in the projects I have participated in. I have evaluated electronic voting systems; under the Friedrick Ebert Foundation initiative, I drafted policy proposals about governance and organized crime to be delivered to the Mexican government; and advised the Mexican Senate on the resolution of the Chiapas conflict.\n\nBesides academia and public institutions, I also have a professional facet in the private sector. In 2019, I joined Cygnific as a Customer Service Representative for Air France and KLM. Afterward, I was promoted to Floating Trainer and then to Ad Interim Trainer. At Cygnific, I gained the skill of \u201cempathic and technical multi-tasking\u201d. This can be understood as being able to connect with customers and help them to relax while simultaneously following complex technical procedures like changing their tickets, cancellations, and refund requests.\n\nIn my current role as a Tutorial Lecturer, I am in charge of coaching and delivering interactive workshops to young students from Leiden University's Bachelor of Arts in International Studies (BAIS). In doing so, I hope they will earn skills and knowledge that will become essential for their academic and professional lives. I teach World History and Introduction to International Studies.",
