    "summary": "I have had many 'pinch me' moments in my career\u2013 most notably, watching penguin chicks hatch before my eyes on Deception Island, an active volcano in the sub-Antarctic.\n\nI am an academic researcher, specializing in biodiversity, wildlife monitoring, and behavioral ecology. My research involves developing and validating cutting-edge technology to understand wildlife dynamics. My work combines the use of trail cameras, acoustic sensors, and machine learning to collect, manage, and analyze big data. I love big picture thinking and problem solving, so working in this field with such passionate people is a dream.\n\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam, where I conceptualize, coordinate, and manage several large-scale, applied biodiversity monitoring projects. I am the principal investigator of The Amsterdam Rat Project (www.theamsterdamratproject.com), which employs biosensors to understand changes to rodent populations and how they relate to biodiversity in urban areas. I also coordinate and analyze ecological survey data to understand the effects of invasive rodent control on biodiversity as part of the multinational LIFE Mica project. I am also the senior lecturer for two undergraduate courses (Research Designs and Biodiversity & Global Change). I find mentoring junior researchers to be especially energizing and love that I get to lead a small team. Living in a historic village in the Netherlands (Weesp) is just an added perk. \n\nDuring my PhD at the University of Oxford, I specialized in Antarctic conservation, developing methods to monitor seabirds using time-lapse cameras and citizen science. My PhD resulted in 9 published peer-reviewed papers and I was one of the lead scientists in the creation of a successful citizen science website, Penguin Watch (www.penguinwatch.org), with over 50,000 registered volunteers. During these four years, I spent over 6 months conducting fieldwork in the Antarctic region, primarily watching penguins waddle across the sea ice. As a podcast and radio junkie, one of my proudest moments was being interviewed for NPR's Weekend Edition at their NYC studio, convincing people to look at pictures of penguins.  \n\nI am also passionate about hiking, yoga, learning languages, and my enthusiastic dog, Remy.\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating or need advice on biodiversity and conservation, I would love to hear from you.",
