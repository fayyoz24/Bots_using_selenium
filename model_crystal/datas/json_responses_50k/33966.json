To lift accommodation units on the K6-P platform of Total E&P Nederland BV, Conbit used an aluminium lifting construction. This unconventional method for lifting a load exceeding 40 tonnes saved using a heavy crane vessel. By completing this challenging project, Conbit proved the effectiveness of special lifting techniques. In total, approximately 120 metric tonnes were lifted during three main jobs.\n\nConbit moves boundaries in offshore lifting with Aluminium",
