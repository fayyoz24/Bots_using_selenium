I've implemented World class manufacturing together with three collegues.\n\nI moved on as a maintenance manager of the metaalwaren dept. and the Drives dept. In this job I was truly tested on the aspect of leadership. It was very tough crowd! But I managed and survived. At Drives I learned also a lot about mass production lines for making electric motors, plastic driver units for the shaver and injection moulding of rotors.",
