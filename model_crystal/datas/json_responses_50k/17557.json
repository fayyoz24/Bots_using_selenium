    "summary": "As a cultural anthropologist I have gained a lot of experience in bridging culture differences during my education and travels abroad. I have done anthropological fieldwork in Mexico; studied for six months in Poland; lived with several families in Indonesia and Greece; worked as a volunteer in e.g., teaching English to children in Indonesia and had several jobs in New Zealand. \n\nI wanted to strengthen this skill of connecting different worldviews and put it into practice with a sustainable focus. Therefore, I studied stakeholder- and process management as a master at the Wageningen University.\n\nMy ambition is to bring different worldviews together to find sustainable solutions. Creating awareness is an important focus, whereby everyone's interests should be outlined. To achieve this, I like to work in a proactive and creative way, using my organizational and communication skills.\n\nReferences (contact details on request):\n\nColleague Dr. D. Fischer (Associate professor at Wageningen University & Research): \n\n\"We brought Kim on board during the semester to support in the supervision of groups working on a campaign analysis with a case owner. It was amazing to see how quickly she immersed herself in the quite complex course. Her feedback to the students was always appreciative, but at the same time challenged the groups to improve their work substantively. As a colleague, she was very reliable, hard-working and a great team-player. It was a pleasure to collaborate with her!\"\n\nColleague R.S. Otte (Teacher at Wageningen University & Research): \n\n\u201cKim assisted in the course Communication and Persuasion, a large course with heavy workload. Kim managed to plan her work strategically and her thoroughness in providing feedback to students was much appreciated. Overall, Kim is independent in her work, but is also open to ask for feedback and input when necessary.\u201d",
