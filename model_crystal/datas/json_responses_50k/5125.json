Gaining insights into performance drivers, bridging between departments, having control over cash flows, having foresight, making analyzes and being able to prepare valuable reports are core activities of a successful finance function within an organization.\n\nI am the designated sparring partner for management for ad interim assignments, for tactical and strategic issues or projects to get your finance organization back on track and gain structural confidence in the numbers, performance and forecast.",
