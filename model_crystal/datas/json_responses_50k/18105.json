    "summary": "I help industrial chemical plants in optimizing and designing their production process, resulting in more efficient, safe, sustainable and financially profitable business operations. With my background in Process Technology and my current study in Chemical Engineering, it might be obvious that Chemical Technology is my dream ticket. When I have finished my Master's degree, I would love to work as a process/chemical engineer in the chemical/pharmaceutical industry. My dream is to have a positive impact on the global warming, making sure that our future generations can breathe clean air and can enjoy this wonderful planet. Next to my future job, I would love to be able to enthuse this future generation, in the hope that together with the future technology, they can take proper care for this blue-green ball we call Earth",

To optimize this process, a lot of in-depth engineering knowledge was developed regarding energy, mass and molar balances, thermodynamics, process control systems, safety provisions of existing equipment, safety risk analysis, interpreting data through several engineering programs, sustainability and evironment and organic chemistry & kinetics. Resulting in a new proposed, more continuous, operation of the installation.",
