Oversupply of PV power can lead to congested grids, or even worse, compulsory disconnection of PV systems from the grid leading to a reduction of the share or highly needed renewable energy in the total electricity mix.  Therefore, accurate forecasting of PV production is of shear importance particularly for the electric grid system, such as stability, reliability, planning and operation, and to enable large scale PV power integration.\n\u2022 This project will include an analysis of satellite data about what and how it should be used appropriately to predict PV performance, subsequently models for forecasting of PV power generation will be selected and combined with irradiance data sources in order to develop a consistent and reliable method for forecasting of PV performance in Netherlands. In the end the method will be validated.",
