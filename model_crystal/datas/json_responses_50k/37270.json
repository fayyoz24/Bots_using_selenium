                    "description": "The Centre for Equity studies is a Delhi-based NGO that does a range of research and advocacy work for marginalized groups in India. One key component of their work is Street Medicine; a homeless outreach program that provides medical care and support to those living under bridges, next to railway tracks, on river banks, abandoned buildings, pavements or footpaths.\nDuring my internship, I conducted a two-fold research project as part of my Master's thesis. The aim was first, to understand the challenges faced by the Street Medicine team and second,  to understand how an mHealth (Mobile Health) tool could be designed to address some of these challenges.\n\nI was responsible for managing all aspects of the research project throughout the planning, design and implementation phases. My research took a transdisciplinary (TDR) approach, in which I engaged key stakeholders in all phases of the research. Data collection methods included: conducting field observations, semi-structured interviews and a literature review of both academic and non-academic sources. In addition to my thesis, I wrote a 22-page report outlining recommendations for the design of the mHealth tool (App).\nIn addition to my research commitments, I also participated in weekly staff meetings and assisted the Street Medicine team with treating and referring patients. Lastly, I developed a nutrition survey for the team to use to help identify nutritional deficiencies among homeless children in Delhi.",
