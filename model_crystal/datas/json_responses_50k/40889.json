PPPs are used to engage in long term cooperation on the fields of infrastructure, road provision and urban restructuring, but also on fields such as health care, water management or energy.In this research program various forms of public-private (and societal) partnerships are studied. The focus is on innovative role division between the actors and clever new governance mechanisms (smart governance-practices) that are being developed and employed to improve the functioning of the partnerships.\n\nThe program is financed through the Smart Governance Research Fund of the Dutch Science Foundation (NWO) and has several co-financing organizations (NSOB, Rebel groep, Twijnstra Gudde, ResetManagement en Deltares). The program runs from 2015 till 2020.\n\n",

Cross-national lessons in dealing with opportunistic behaviour\u201d \nOver the past fifteen to twenty years, the world has seen a proliferation of innovative approaches for the delivery and financing of public services, such as Public-Private- Partnerships (PPPs). Expectations in the road sector are high: more contract flexibility, more innovation, higher performance and consequently lower costs, while keeping up service levels on mobility, safety and the environment. But how successful have road authorities actually been in implementing such innovative arrangements?\n\nThis research answers the question by investigating how different national road administration authorities have implemented innovative arrangements and with what consequences. In addition, by developing and playing the serious game \u201cRoad Roles\u201d, the introduction of innovative arrangements was simulated multiple times in various settings. \nLessons are drawn for road authorities around the world that are considering to implement innovative financing and project delivery approaches. \n\nDeveloped and implemented case study research protocol, field research, and institutional and market analysis of the road sector in Finland, Netherlands, and Spain.\n\u2022 Analysed technical and institutional dimensions of road procurement strategies and road reform.\n\u2022 Analysed project cycle, contract structures, payment schemes, and project finance of large transport PPP projects.\n\u2022 Developed \u201cRoad Roles\u201d simulation game. Pioneered the use of experimental economics methods to study impact of contract incentives on cooperative behaviour.\n\u2022 Developed community of practice on road innovative contracting.",
