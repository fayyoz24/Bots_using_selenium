    "summary": "Climbing the Pareto distribution.\n\nBorn and raised in Bucharest, Romania with a lifelong interest in mathematics, literature and philosophy. Initially dreamed about being a computer scientist, migrated towards math but settled on Theoretical Physics after trying to wrap my head around Piskunov's Differential and Integral Calculus in senior highschool. \n\nAs a freshmen in undergrad I heavily gravitated towards real and complex analysis. Later on found a passion in semiconductor physics and did research into BCS theory and modelling of phonon behaviour in various geometrical shapes.\n\nEnded up doing my research project into the simulation of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV and the analysis of discovery channels of the Higgs Boson.\n\nBack into theory for a 2 years Master's at Leiden University with an interest towards statistics and quantum information.",

We explored the basics of Spin Mechanics, the double-slit experiment and the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and then proceeded to study qubit measurements. We learned about quantum gates, quantum states, and finally we studied Grover\u2019s Algorithm. For the computational part of the course,we utilised the SU2 and CPX packages for performing some measurements on the HYBRILIT supercomputing platform and plotted the results using ROOT and Origin. Finally, we used IBM\u2019s Qiskit platform in order to study and code quantum circuits.",
