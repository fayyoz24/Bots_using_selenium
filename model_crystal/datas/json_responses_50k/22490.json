    "summary": "A young researcher in the circular intersection between our food systems, the environment, and climate change.\n\nClark previously consulted with the World Bank Group, where he worked to create climate-smart livestock systems via targeted policy and investment interventions. \n\nHe is currently a joint Ph.D. candidate at Wageningen University and Cornell University, where he researches circular food system economics. He recently finished dual MSc degrees in Resilient Farming and Food Systems and Agroecology at Wageningen University and ISARA-Lyon, respectively. His MSc thesis was recognized as one of the top MSc theses in the Netherlands when it won the Unilever Research Prize for its contribution to the UN SDGs. His education is built off of his undergraduate experience at the University of Chicago, where he gained a BSc in Environmental Science and a BA in Biology, with a specialization in Microbiology.\n\nPrior to the World Bank Group and his Ph.D., Clark volunteered as a Peace Corps Agricultural Extension Volunteer for two years in Ghana, where he lived in a rural agro-pastoral community in the Bono-East Region. \n\nHe serves on the Global Secretariat for the Climate Smart Agriculture Youth Network and the Selection Board for the AtlasCorps Fellowship. In his free time, he enjoys cooking, baking, and running marathons. He won the Blue Ribbon Prize in the layer cake category at the 2017 Monmouth County Fair.",
