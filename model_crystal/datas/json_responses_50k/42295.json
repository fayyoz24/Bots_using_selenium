    "summary": "I am an ambitious, tenacious and cross disciplinary professional with a root in life science, MSc in social sciences and experience in international development.\n\nI am gifted in planning and organizing, coupled with an analytical mindset and the ability to envision processes and to keep things in order.\n\nI plan, implement, coordinate, monitored and evaluate interventions. During my time with the World Bank-assisted Fadama Development Project in Abuja Nigeria, I was able to bring groups and communities on board, facilitated their inclusion, participation and ownership of development projects, leading to sustainable socially inclusive and tailor-made solutions.\n\nAn ardent learner that I am, research and academics are also my comfort zone. I have strong qualitative social research experience having recently completed an Msc in Development and Rural Innovation (Communication and Innovation track) from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. There I learnt the processes of communication among stakeholders towards solving societal problems, having understood that sustainable innovation does not happen in a vacuum; it begins where innovation processes are aligned with the sociological contexts.\n\nI stepped out of the workforce after my MSc for childcare reason and to deal concurrently with a life-threatening health condition but suffice to say that I have been able to overcome the hurdles. \n\nRecently I got trained and have now been Scrum and Mendix certified.\n\nIf you are looking to hire someone with agility, passion, resilience, total commitment to tasks, and an ability to bring excellence to duty, then I am your candidate.",
