Liquefaction of natural gas reduces the volume of gas by approximately 600 times thus making it more economical to store and transport over long distances and between continents in specially designed ships. Shell is also developing LNG for transport businesses where LNG is used as a fuel for road transport and marine vessels thereby targeting applications in fuel market.\n\nThe aims of this project were:\n* Analysis & evaluation of the possible process routes.\n* Provide the basis-of-design for the most promising routes.",

Although there are studies being performed on the role of senior managers in an organisation; most of them relates to the financial or business outcomes and few focuses specifically on safety leadership. The organisation\u2019s goals and objectives are often specified by the senior managers (Chief Executives, Directors, and Mangers) and to go from good to great requires strong and appropriate leadership. This thesis focuses on the concept of safety leadership and analyses the influence of senior managers with respect to the safety, business and performance of the organisation within the oil & gas industry. 11 senior managers from different organisations gave their invaluable input to this study. Significant overlap was encountered as a result of findings from the literature and questionnaire study on the role of senior managers with regards to safety. One of the extensive findings of this study is the gap between the knowledge, realisation and application of the key safety leadership functions which correlates to the inadequacies of how leaders are prepared (or not prepared) for their roles as safety leaders. This study also highlights that authentic leadership and mindfulness can be of great importance for the safety leaders to setup and achieve high safety standards in an organisation.",

Some of these actions involve developing or improving technical solutions or involve further study of the problem and identifying what is the Industry Best Practice.\n\nThe main objective of the work includes:\n* Technical recommendations to reduce the risks associated with the handling of flammable liquids (eg. Acetone, Ethanol, etc.) and their impact on the waste water treatment.\n* Technical recommendations to close the potential safety gaps that were identified in the PRA and focusing on fulfilling the required independent safety layers (ISL\u2019s) for the system handling Chlorine (High Hazard Process, HHP).\n* Review of the Emergency action plan to minimise the exposure of ammonia storage at a nearby facility to Cargill's personnel.\n* Review the impact of Hydrogen storage on the location planning of the new facility.",
