Environmental restoration projects through invasive species control and removal, native planting, trail work, and volunteer outreach to improve the health of Puget Sound by returning urban forests, shorelines, and salmon streams back to thriving, self-sustaining ecosystems. Invited to be one of the speakers at our fundraising event, where I had the chance to relate the deforestation and fires in the Amazon with our environmental work in the US, for 500 supporters and donors, and where we were able to raise $280,000.\n\nMy current research aims to explore and map tourism diversification in the Antarctic, particularly considering the magnitude of integration of less tangible concepts of the ATS fundamental principles and values in the development of new, novel, or particularly concerning activities, as part of an NWO project funded by the Netherlands Polar Programme.",
