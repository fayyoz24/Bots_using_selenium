    "summary": "I am a Bachelor's student of liberal arts and sciences with a focus on neuroscience and psychology. However, my interests are more expansive and include education, child development, public policy and sociology. In the future, I hope to use my knowledge about the brain to better understand children's education and how to improve it on a global scale. I have experience working with youths from many different backgrounds, including those with refugee backgrounds, as a tutor in high school and a teacher for Right2Education in 2021. Additionally, in 2021, I did an internship at the Vrije Universiteit looking into the relationship between motivation and achievement and the development of prosociality. My goal is to use theoretical research such as this and real-life experiences to improve education globally.",
