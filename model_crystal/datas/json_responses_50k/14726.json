    "summary": "I have extensive experience working in the residential security space as a strategic advisor and experienced market analyst, with detailed operative knowledge of Verisure and a working knowledge of its closest peers (via extensive benchmarking exercises), in particular Sector Alarm, Alarm.com and ADT.\n\n\nFurthermore I support C-level managers of international consumer goods / services companies in mapping out their unique strategic smart products and recurring services options. I help them identify potential partners and / or acquisition targets and support the evaluation of their investment decisions. \n\nThey often add me to their team to enhance their capabilities.\n\nI  keep my clients updated on topics like: \n\n.     Why subscriptions are key to the future of smart products and how the residential security recurring       \n       model can serve as a reference. \n\n.     The impact of DIY installation on the market for professional \n       monitored residential security;\n\n.     The size and dynamics of the residential security markets in \tEurope and the US;\n\n.     The smart front door and its impact on the residential security market;\n\n\n.      The deployment of new smart home standards;\n\n.       Potential acquisition targets.\n\nClients value my in depth market knowledge, my independence, my network, my thoroughness and my ability to translate my findings into operational options for business deployment / development.\n\nPrior to working as a consultant, I have worked for nine years for Securitas Direct and 8 years at KPN, the incumbent telecommunication company in the Netherlands. \nWithin Securitas Direct I have fulfilled several senior management and business development roles. Within KPN I worked two years as a senior business consultant towards key accounts and almost six years as a managing director of a KPN subsidiary - SNT Connect.\n\nI began my career within Philips Electronics in the Netherlands in 1982. During 15 years I held several senior innovation business development and business consulting positions within Consumer Electronics International. I hold degrees of two universities of applied sciences - Electronics and Business Management and a Master of Business Economics from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, The Netherlands.",
