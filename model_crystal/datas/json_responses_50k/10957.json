    "summary": "Hi there! I am Beltr\u00e1n, student of dual Degree in Business Management and Laws with a driven profile, working at Europe's biggest tech company, ASML. With determination, I constantly take the initiative to find effective solutions to our daily challenges, ensuring efficiency and success within the team.\n\nWhile studying I am also a sportsman (kitesurfing) since the adolescence, having achieved several championships and podiums and fascinating experiences. \n\nAlso, as an enterprising person, while spending considerable time in Tarifa and building connections with many people, I managed several properties on behalf of their owners. My responsibilities included coordinating housekeeping and reservations and handling daily troubleshooting. This taught me responsibility as well as attention to detail.",
