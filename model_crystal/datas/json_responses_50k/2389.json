    "summary": "Nice that you have discovered my LinkedIn profile! You're stuck on my LinkedIn to know a little more about me. This is what I can tell you briefly about myself:\n\n\u272aWho am I?\nI am described by others as enthusiastic, caring and independent. I am not going to take a quick view of others, but rather form my own vision by sharing knowledge and ideas, and creating a plan from there. I am getting energy from others helping or guiding. If there is to be achieved what we had in mind, it gives me a huge kick! I feel at home in the care and in the services. Are you looking for a performer who is in her own power? Then you can read further.\n\n\u272aWhat makes my heart sing?\nI like to accompany others in their way, to give them that one step in the good direction so they can get more out of themselves. Because I really listen, I can really help too. It's my mission to make sure that someone at my door runs out with the feeling that he/she is really helped. I am also taking the time in my work. That is why I'm well in service and care. I keep curious about people. And I keep getting energy from it when I get someone that step further. Whether this is in finding a job, in rehabilitation, or in something else: that mission is paramount to me.\n\n\u272aWhat do I search?\nA new challenge to Aruba in HR, job placement, care or service what suits my qualities. Can you help me a step further?\n\n\u272aContact\nBecome curious about me? I'm also happy to be in contact with people. A connection request is a small step away. Who knows what we can do for each other!",

In addition to these departments, I also see clients in primary care. At these locations and departments of Charim I have completely found my way as an Occupational Therapist again. \n\nCare that goes beyond. That's the spirit of Charim and it's in line with my ambition. As an occupational therapist I come up with creative solutions in practice to help clients to be self-reliant. The variety of the various target groups I meet within Charim challenges me every day to make best of it. Collaboration with different disciplines and external parties, switching quickly and patiently coaching the elderly towards their goals are required.
