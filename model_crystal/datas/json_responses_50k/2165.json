    "summary": "Teaching eurythmy to children from 4 till 13 years for over 13 years gave me the possibility to see  growth in people and how that can take place. It serves me now in my work as movement therapist in my private practice. \nEurythmy helps people move themselves to a healthier condition both physical and emotionally. It can awaken creativity.\nTrager Approach helps people feel themselves form within, feel what soft is, how relaxation can feel. And remember what the natural state of ease in life is. It very often softens pain. \n\nSpecialties: To lead  someone to a better and healthy condition, both fysical and metally. \nTo live in the body in a pleasant way, being inwardly active and creative and be ablo to grow as a person both in private life and on the workfloor.",

That is a good starting point to teach a Eurythmygesture, which is a qualitative movement, and not something done automatically and  mechanically or even as a sport movement.\nWith Trager I love the playfullness of the movement, the feelingquality, and  the combination of moving myself and being touched with the tablework.",
