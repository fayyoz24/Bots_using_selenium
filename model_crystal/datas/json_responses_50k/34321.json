The WUR Budapest consultancy group consisted of 27 students that executed an 8-week research in both Wageningen, The Netherlands and on location in Budapest, Hungary. The report provides data and recommendations per district and also several scenarios and action plans to create a greener living environment in Budapest in cooperation with specific stakeholders. \n\nThe aim of the project was to examine the current situation of UGSs in the city of Budapest, and to provide scenarios to promote the social value of green areas. In the analysis, different tools have been used: questionnaires to citizens (570), expert interviews (21) and observations in parks (28). The data collection focused on five specific districts of Budapest - VII, VIII, IX, XI and XIII. The information collected has been analysed in specific geo-reports.\n\nDifferent expertises used during this course were; spatial, policy and stakeholder, environment and public health, and scenario analysis.",

Because the management of these densely populated and vulnerable areas is complex, Deltares works closely with governments, companies, knowledge institutes and universities at home and abroad. \n\nMy work at Deltares mainly involved brokering Deltares' researcher knowledge and solutions internally and externally.  I worked with a variety of stakeholders to close the gap between research and practice, and facilitate the development of relationships that are critical to effective knowledge translation. Main topics I worked on: renewable energy from water and subsoil; dike safety and corporate sustainability. Furthermore, supporting researchers in effectively communicating their research to stakeholders and facilitating internal processes aiming at increased cross-disciplinary research.",
