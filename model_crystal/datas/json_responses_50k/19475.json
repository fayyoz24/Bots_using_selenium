    "summary": "M. Matias was born in Cascais, Portugal, in 1985. His stage experience starts at kindergarden in a children play and since then he's been developing his stage skills. \nIn 2006 he completes a professional course in theater as an actor and in 2013 a BA in theater and performance arts. His debut as a professional actor takes place in 2007, working as such in several theater and cinema productions in Portugal for the following years. \nAlongside his theater carreer he develops an interest for the study of movement and body expression, exploring areas like contemporary dance and burlesque, but mostly aerial acrobatics in the subjects of aerial silks, aerial hoop and trapeze. \nIn 2015 he opens his own performance arts studio in Lisboa, Portugal, a space dedicated to the intersection of stage arts - theater, dance and acrobatics - where he discovers his passion for teaching.\nMost recently he has found a new interest in gender performance, a matter that has been an important catalyst on his carreer since 2016 and where he found the ultimate possibility to convene all his passions.\nHe's also a certified makeup artist and he creates most of the outfits and accessories for his performances.
