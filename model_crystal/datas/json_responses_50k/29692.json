PRACE aims to facilitate excellent research and science in academia and industry with the most powerful supercomputers, to the advantage of society. The PRACE Council is the highest decision-making body in PRACE. It oversees the HPC Research Infrastructure and sets the policy for access to the resources.\nAnwar Osseyran has been active for several years already in PRACE and more generally in HPC and the supercomputing community. His most important goal has been to improve the competitiveness of Europe through advanced IT solutions in the race against the United States and East-Asia. One of his most important tasks as Chair will be to guide PRACE into its next phase. This means that a future-proof model has to be designed in which financing of and access to the top-level Research Infrastructure is guaranteed by all participating countries, based on the principle \u201cwho computes will need to contribute\u201d. It is expected that France, Germany, Italy and Spain will continue to open their systems to excellent research through this model, as well as that Switzerland will join in the effort and become a Hosting Member as well.",
