    "summary": "I believe that any kind of sustainable development requires converting inspiring ideas into realisable plans, as well as effective implementation. I work in the area of logistics, transport policy and infrastructure development and see these as crucial enablers for businesses, countries and cities to prosper. \n\nCurrently I am translating that belief in building a sustainable and reciprocal floriculture brand. We aim to provide a better, more predictable quality to consumers. at the same time we strive for continous improvement in the supply chain by harnessing the power of sharing. I am responsible for the formulation and implementation  of our strategic projects.\n\nPreviously, I manage a team of experienced (junior) consultants and students conducting a thorough analysis of the processes in the floriculture supply chain. We work with entrepreneurs and managers from the industry as well as researchers to achieve this.\n\nPrior to this, I have worked with a University/Research Institute and a Consultancy. Clients included businesses, the Dutch government, several European Institutions and national/State-level governments in emerging countries to strengthen the quality of transport policies and projects. This gives me a deep and thorough understanding of both the commercial, political and social aspects of business and policy.\n\nBoth during my studies and my job as Consultant I have lived and worked in Canada and India respectively. These stays have shown me that I am able to achieve results, even under challenges circumstances.",

The means to achieving this goal is by researching innovative, responsive logistics concepts supported by new IT applications. As an industry with a long history in cooperation between independent companies, we expect those concepts and applications to still be based on cooperation. Therefore, we are also developing business rules for cooperation specific to those concepts.\n\nAs project manager I am responsible for the development of the business aspects of the projects. For example by linking practice (leading entrepreneurs from the industry) and theory (PhDs and post-docs, as well as students). In part thanks to my involvement, the number of students part of the project has increased from around 10 a year to around 30 per year. Moreover, around 30 companies have been or are involved. A number of the projects have resulted in recommendations actually implemented by host companies.\n\nThis was a 3 year contract position. I am officially employed by Wageningen University, but am reporting to managers at Wageningen University, FloraHolland and VGB.\n\nAchievements:\n- Doubled consortium size to around 35 SMEs (not an explicit target)\n- Managed around 55 sub projects (from initiation to closure)\n- Involved and coached around 55 students (target: 20)\n- No project budget overruns\n- Initiated and supported around 5 spin-offs\n- Developed a well-appreciated series of Masterclasses with a small operational profit",
