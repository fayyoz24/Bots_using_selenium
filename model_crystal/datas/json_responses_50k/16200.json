    "summary": "My name is Gerbrand Spaans and I have finished my master's degree in Biomedical Sciences - Neurobiology. I have a huge fascination for technology and science, especially but not restricted to neuroscience. I also have a large interest in technology, from hardware to software and love to tinker with programs, interfaces and hardware. My passion lies in empowering people to utilize technology and work smarter, better and hopefully less.\n\nCurrently I am teaching students at a Community College level about databases, application developement and user interface design.\n\nApart from my professional interests I also love working and playing with children at the \"Humanitas Kindervakantieweken\", making and listening to music with friends or enjoy a nice beer with friends.\n\nIn my former Microsoft Traineeship I have worked as a Technical Evangelist, helping developers to be successful and talking with people to better understand the opportunities of technology, data and cloud. In my traineeship I started as a Business Intelligence Consultant, working with SQL Server, Excel, Azure Machine Learning and other solutions from the Microsoft BI stack to make data work for you.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with questions about working at Microsoft or the MACH programme or any other questions you might have about science, technology or my personal opinion on the taste of lemons.",

However, new evidence suggests that not the figure per se, but the boundaries of the figure mediate the segregation. \nWith an 'n' shaped figure and psychofysiological measures we devised several tests to assess this hypothesis. Following the results from these tests, we used eye-tracking to measure the effects of attention on the segregation of the complex figure.",
