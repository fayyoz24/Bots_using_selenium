    "summary": "Hands on executive with 20 years of experience and a proven track record of driving strategic plans and delivering strong results in international business environments and cultures (Northern Europe, France, UK, Germany, Central Europe, Middle East and Israel, Russia, Turkey). \nStrong believer that personal development and empowerment lead to greater team success and individual well being.\nJoined a scale-up company to enjoy the thrill of developing the strategic vision of an hyper-growth business and building a team and developing people.\nFrench native, fluent in English and conversational in Dutch. Married to Albane and proud father of Nils and Eline. Passion for sports (running, tennis, football, cycling), hip hop, cooking, learning about other cultures and geo-politics.\n\nCareer Highlights:\n- Drove the repositioning of Sidestep (Footwear retail chain owned by Foot Locker) to a digitally lead Women\u2019s concept focusing on the active 21 y.o+ women customer. Sidestep was on the verge of disappearing due to an undifferentiated positioning leading Nike to stop its support. Thanks to an absolute focus on customer and strong convincing skills (to Nike and to the retailer) Sidestep is now a leading Women\u2019s account in Europe, driving 30% growth year on year and expanding to the entire of Europe.\n- Lead a pivotal move for Foot Locker Middle East. From a lack of investment and an average consumer experience to a best in class experience driven by consumer insights, engaged local team and Nike support. Highlighting the evolution of the consumer\u2019s expectations in the region and building a strategic plan based solely on 3 objectives rallied Nike and Foot Locker to agree to invest in the biggest Foot Locker stores in EMEA and opening Footlocker.com in the region.\n- Empowered Nike local teams in Central and Eastern Europe (Poland, Russia, Turkey, Israel, Middle East,..) to adapt the Nike Global Football assortments to the reality of the local consumer expectations. It happened through careful listening to our employees knowledge and passion for their customers as well as in depth data analysis. It lead to 90% forecast accuracy, 50% stock reduction and margin increase with 2 years.\n\nSpecialties:\nLeadership & Team Building \u2022 Cross cultural awareness \u2022 New Business Development \u2022 Planning and profit margin management \u2022 Go getter personality \u2022 Consumer insights",
