    "summary": "I was always fascinated by foreign cultures and languages, and this insatiable desire to explore the world brought me to China, where I was immediately taken by the Chinese language and culture, which easily impressed a 17-year-old me.\n\nFrom then on, I started my professional journey in the field of tourism. For the past 8 years, I have been actively studying and working in the tourism and hospitality fields.\n\nI have experience working for big enterprises in both Asia and Europe. Skilled in communicating and offering top-notch customer service. In an effort to combine research and education, I am looking for an opportunity to apply my experience to tourism and hospitality research projects.\n\nI consider myself a highly organised young professional who is always ready for a new challenge and can come up with innovative solutions. My ultimate goal would be to leave an impact on the tourism industry, to make it more sustainable and inclusive.",
