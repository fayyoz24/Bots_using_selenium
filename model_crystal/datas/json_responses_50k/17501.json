    "summary": "Hello! Looking for someone who is organised, process- and goal-oriented, enjoyes making new connections and has a heart for people? Let's connect! \ud83d\udce7\n\nLast year I made the switch from private to public sector. I am happy to now combine my gained leadership and operational skills, and the anthropologist in me, in my role as senior policy officer at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. In this role I help to find ways to ensure people who loose their job are able to return to the jobmarket or how they can receive the required social benefits if needed. I focus mainly on the prevention of fraud with unemployment benefits. \n\nFrom a young age, I have been interested in making connections with others and explore the world. After I completed a bachelor's in Sustainable Tourism Development, I wanted to learn more about the cross-cultural subjects I studied. So I completed a master's in Cultural Anthropology and graduated by completing 3 months of fieldwork in Mauritius researching the social-cultural impact of tourism. \n\nOver the last 10+ years, I have gained strong leadership and coaching skills, while working in a fast-paced international environment in a variety of finance operations roles \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83d\udcbb within the financial service industry. My can-do attitude and down-to-earth personality enable me to get the job done. I am client-focused, efficient, very dedicated, and loyal when working on the right cause. Next to that, I have strong influencing and problem-solving skills by applying emotional intelligence. I am a good mediator because of my communication skills and intercultural sensitivity. I completed various strategic initiatives by using my analytical mindset and have worked with clients and colleagues worldwide. I value strong work relationships and enjoy working with, in, and coaching diverse teams. \n\nI have heart for and drive to focus on employee engagement, well-being, diversity, and inclusion. \nInterested in exchanging thoughts? Please feel free to reach out for a chat or coffee \u2615.\n\nThank you! \ud83d\ude4f\n\nSpecialties:\nPolicy making | Cross-Cultural Awareness | International Work Experience | Employee Health & Well-being | Diversity & Inclusion | Qualitative Research | Strategic Initiatives | Sustainable Tourism Development | Cultural Anthropology | Financial Services | Factoring | Accounts Receivable & Payable | Syndication | Analytical Analysis | Financial Planning & Analysis | Customer Relationship Management | Global Team Management | Coaching & Mentoring |  Adaptive Leadership |  Employee Engagement",

The results of my research are presented in my Master thesis: \u201cMauritian melting-pot: act of fact? The social-cultural effects of tourism development\u201d. \n\nThis thesis gives more inside in the social-cultural effects of tourism under the population of small islands such as Mauritius who are economically heavily depended on tourism. Tourism has both positive and negative effects on the local population of a tourism destination. Mauritius is promoted by different actors involved in the tourism industry, as a melting pot where past and present are smoothly blended together. By promoting the country as a melting-pot of cultures, people can act upon this image by turning culture into a commodity or by staging authenticity. We can conclude that in Mauritius people are both united and divided. At one side there is a clear nationalistic \u2018melting-pot\u2019 policy. Hereby the goal is the formation of unity and identity across non-ethnic lines. At the other side, we can speak of a \u2018cultural mosaic\u2019 where symbolic expressions of ethnicity are being recognized, celebrated and encouraged by the government. Tourism has become one of the main economic resources in Mauritius, next to the sugarcane, financial service and textile industry.",
