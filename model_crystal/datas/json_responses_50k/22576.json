I decided to work with nature while understanding the simple but subtle details that most often we overlook...like simple joys that keep us happy. \nIt has been over 6 years and I am getting stronger by the day as an individual and my work and attitude inspires Thousands of individuals from all parts of the world.....! \n\nThese reflections are timeless but contemporary for all ages....like our belief in Truth and Co-existence as being connected to NATURE.....Nurturing and Feeding on it....! \n\nCome Discover the SPIRITUALITY of Our Inner Self, Elements of Earth and the Universe at Large.\n\nConnect to Water...Connect to Nature.....Connect to Self.",

Everyday is New and I am surprised like a little child.....this keeps me going.\nThis knowledge and understanding has come from people nature and Energies from close and far away in the day & the night and I appreciate GIVING AWAY in Equal Measures what I RECEIVE.......Everyday I am a Student and Teacher.......a Trader.......a Happy Being.\n\nI am a Light Traveler.....One Bag and Tonnes of Memories.",
