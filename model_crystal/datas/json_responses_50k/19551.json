In 2008, a Scapino Ballet (Rotterdam) production showed in the Leidse Schouwburg. Only two minutes in I was blown away. By the end I had landed again, and become determined to see any show as soon as I could, to find out more. Within days I attended a smaller NDT2 (The Hague) production, in the now defunct LAKtheater. The choreography was linear, analytic. And to my eyes tangential to polymer rheology. The bond was definite. Of the many choreographers that challenged me since I started dacing then, worthy of special mention are Helen Pokrovskaia, Heather Ware and Antonin Comestaz. Likewise worthy is Korzo artistic manager production house dance Stacz Wilhelm. How I ended up in tango soci\u00e1l is different story altogether. Suffice it to say here that from 2011 to date, Libertango owner and milonguera Jessica Bijvoet has her part in grooming the steps my fellow milongueros and I take.",
