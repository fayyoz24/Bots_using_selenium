My primary goals were to initiate and lead projects aimed at reducing avoidable calls (resulting in a 15% decrease in calls and a cost reduction of 1 million euros, achieved mainly through enhancing online tools and self-service environments), and improving online sales and conversion rates (resulting in a threefold increase in online leads, driven by a redesign and extensive multivariate testing on key product pages).\n\nIn addition to optimizing the existing business, I played a crucial role in developing an online strategy to further increase online lead generation, involving several business units within PostNL. This strategic plan led to the allocation of budget for launching key IT projects and centralizing e-commerce activities by consolidating all specialists into a single e-team.\n\nIn my final three months, I served as a project leader, tasked with developing a business plan for a new business unit, PostNL E-commerce Solutions, which primarily focuses on enhancing e-commerce activities in the Netherlands. This project was executed in close collaboration with stakeholders from various internal business units and with the assistance of external consultants from McKinsey. As a result of this business plan, the new business unit commenced operations from January 1st.",
