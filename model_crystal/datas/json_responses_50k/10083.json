    "summary": "Hello to everyone! I am lawyer with more than 12 years in law. I am a dependable, flexible, resourceful, stress resistant and very useful person. Helping people to solve their legal problems (by the way not only legal) inspires me to move forward and I enjoy when really I can help to them. Futhermore I am excellent at collaboration, open-minded, attentive to details and I try to find individual approach to everyone. As a result of my work, I have a lot of clients and still give legal advices for free being in Netherlands. Also I try to be useful for Ukrainian refugees in Netherlands and sort boxes with humanitarian aid (food, medicines, clothes etc.) for Ukraine and sometimes translate from English into Ukrainian language for Ukrainian refugees and I am volunteer in food bank. I also want to add that for me is very important to develop myself and it is the main reason taking part in Erasmus+ projects in different countries. One of my hobbies is singing songs and I take music lessons at music school in Maassluis and also organize some performances with Ukrainians for Dutch public. If you are really interested in me I will try to do the best and be useful!",
