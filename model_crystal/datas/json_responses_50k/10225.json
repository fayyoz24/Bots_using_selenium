People, data, knowledge, services and goods are moving faster across borders than ever and before you know it, the world is at your doorstep.\n\nEducational and research institutions often operate on a global scale and need to be prepared to cope with the many challenges of a fast-changing world. This requires a strategic vision and a sound strategy not only based on theory, but also on real-life practice. \n\nStrategic partnerships are becoming more essential to deal with a fast-paced and complicated world market and to become better connected with and prepared for international students, researchers, partners and other stakeholders.\n\nMy personal ambition is to make internationalization of education and international (research) partnerships easier and more effective for your organisation. I am able to achieve this by increasing your understanding of the needs and demands of international students and partners, and by supporting your organization to develop a future-proof internationalization and partnerschip strategy. \n\nTo accomplish this I can rely on 20 years of diplomatic experience and relevant experience with national educational agencies, governments and higher education institutions in the EU and Asia. I\u2019m ready to connect with the world. Are you?",
