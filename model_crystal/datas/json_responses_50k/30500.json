The XY point size is around 22 micrometers, 10 micrometers in the Z axis.\nThe gearbox poses a real challenge GD&T wise, it is really tricky in such a small scale using a common resin 3D printer.\nThe brass tubes are used as bearings.\nFor the sizes I\u2019m printing more precise printer would be better but it\u2019s out of my reach at the time being.",

It\u2019s a resin, poly jet printer, using support material for printing complex models. The resolution of 600DPI XY is not the best for this kind of project but yet enough for the decent effect.\nIt was also a test of this printer, and the 3D print in general for this kind of work.\nAll the original parts were modified for the 3D print purpose, some re-designed, dimensions and corners corrected to make the joints.\nI have made several trial print outs to determine the limits of the 3D printer before continuing with the design.\nI was continuing slowly as I was able to make 1 print per week only.\nI was using my models for the maintenance prints of the printer. The maintenance prints had to be made every week, and this was my window of opportunity to build my model.",

One boat was in a terrible state, on the edge of collapsing, taking scans from the deck was hazardous. We only had a few spots to place the scanner. As a result I had to improvise, basing on the pictures. There were areas on one side not covered by the scans. Points were copied/pasted from the similar areas from the other side, together with portholes and details, and adjusted accordingly based on the pictures of entire boat.\nThe job pushed the point cloud editing really far.",
