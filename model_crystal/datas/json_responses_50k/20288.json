    "summary": "As an undergraduate student, he has always been interested in old cities and the regeneration of old architecture. Up until now this has been his main interest and it has determined him to participate in various workshops and competitions that cover these topics. During his working period, he mainly worked on dwelling design and exhibition planning. More specifically, traditional style housing was his main design job. He was also the organizer of an Urban Research group in Korea, which currently still exists. He is an expert when it comes to Korea. Currently, he is in the Netherlands because he is interested in studying about old cities' problems and finding solutions for urban people living in such cities. Mr. Choi graduated from the Berlage (TU Delft) in January 2015.",
