Judges account for differences among literary, feature and specialty magazines and score accordingly. For example, if photography is not included in a literary magazine, the score will not suffer since the artwork and graphics will be evaluated for the score in this section. Marks of Distinction will be given for accomplishments of extraordinary merit.\n\nTo receive the highest All-American Award, the magazine must earn at least four Marks of Distinction and 450 points out of a highest point total of 500 points. About five percent of all entries receive the coveted All-American Award.\u201d",
