We need a systemic change, and I believe that everyone will benefit when we extend our care to these children.\n\nVia storytelling and network weaving I'm creating awareness and attention for the experiences of children in international migration. Through change management efforts I turn these words into action, aiming to make the most positive impact in the lives of international children as I can for the rest of my career.",
