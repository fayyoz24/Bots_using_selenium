The results of this study could be useful for the protection of biodiversity and prediction of natural disasters. For instance, the results can show the shelter preferences of species in terms of evolution of a natural event (fires, hurricanes, tsunamis, etc.) In addition, detecting anomalous movements of certain animals could also improve the detection time of certain disasters.\n\nThe application was developed using Python (including Flask, Bokeh, netCDF4, pyhdf, pandas, xarray and other libraries), JavaScript and HTML and is deployed on Heroku. In addition, the satellite based data was fundamental for our project giving us the possibility of performing the correlation between events such as high precipitations and fires which can be detected through Earth observation satellites and animal movements on the land.\n\nThis project was developed as part of the NASA International Space Challenge 2020.",

            "description": "Current flood monitoring systems generally rely heavily on model-based forecasting such as Ensemble Forecasting (Wu et al., 2020), while active monitoring is limited to human/aircraft reporting and static sensor measurements. All of these methods have the disadvantage of not being able to track both the live movement and the conditions of the flood waters directly.\n\nOur UVP addresses this with \u201cTransparent Emergency Awareness through Distributed Geolocation Data\u201d. This refers to the capability of our solution to track and process both the flooding and water quality evolution in real-time from our beacon system using machine learning algorithms, giving a more complete picture of the flood event as it develops than currently available and allowing for better decision making during the event.\n\nOur solution architecture allows the movement characterisation of the flood including its velocity and direction by using GNSS from Galileo, GPS, and QZSS constellations while receiving and processing EWS messages broadcast by QZSS (and Galileo in the future).\n\nSGNAVI has already created a successful PoC for this solution and has been awarded the Michibiki prize in the MGA RPD Challenge 2020 Extended and 2nd finalist for the Galileo Masters Comunidad de Madrid Prize 2021.\n\nMore details can be found here:\n\u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcSKIlAAP7Q\n\u2022 https://qzss.go.jp/en/events/rpd-challenge_210917.html\n\u2022 https://www.madrimasd.org/notiweb/noticias/detektia-cetra-base-ganadores-copernicus-galileo-masters-comunidad-madrid-2021"
