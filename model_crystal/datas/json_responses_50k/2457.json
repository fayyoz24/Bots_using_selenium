During 5 months, I had worked with another 5 fellow students on the creative process of writing a business plan in order to market the Oikimus \"5+5\" Led Lamp as if we had our own business. The first step of the project was to conduct deep scale research on the Dutch market using several methods such as quantitative & qualitative desk research, interview, and online surveys. After collecting enough information, we analyzed the features of the Dutch lighting market and assessed the relationship between risks and return. We finally came up with the idea to launch the \"5+5\" Lamp as a decorative lamp and to target the middle and higher income class. The last step was to form a wise marketing and financial plan in order to convince the potential investors to invest in our business in the Final Presentation.\nThis project offered me the chance to show and develop my team- work skills in a multi- cultural setting as well as inter- personal skills and time management skills. Furthermore, as a Finance Manager of the project, I have gained valuable experience in the field of Finance, which is my main phase at the HAN.",
