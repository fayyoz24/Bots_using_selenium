Flavanoids compound from green tea, cinnamon can lower the risk of those diseases. There are few direct studies of the link between flavonoids consumption and abnormal tissue caused by ectopic fat accumulation. \nResponsibility: When insulin-stimulated glucose using ability of muscle decreased, muscle fibres tend to utilize the fatty acids, rather than glucose, as its primary energy source. During insulin resistance, the heart will also change its energy metabolism tending to increase lipids and decrease glucose consumption. The alteration of cardiac metabolism can lead to develop into cardiomyopathy. The skeletal muscle and heart may be essential sites for understanding the mechanism changing by ectopic fat. Therefore, in this study, I will investigate how the quercentin and hesperetin as bioactive ingredients contained within diet affect mitochondria density and activities in heart and skeletal muscle of mice fed by high fat diet.\nSkills: DNA extraction, RT-PCR, Citrate Synthase Assay, Agarose gel electrophoresis\nLocation: the molecular lab of Human and Animal Physiology Group in Wangeningen University",

My main job was to complete the factor of oep, from making sure the location of it to producing its protein. \nResponsibility: During the program, I read a great deal of literatures related to the project. I tried to find the best PCR conditions of oep, subcloned it into pET-22b(+) and select positive clone. BL21 cells were transformed with the expression vectors encoding oep and oep protein. And the oep / pET-22b(+)/BL21 express the target protein with ITPG exutory. Finally I got the oep/pET-22b(+), which was an expression vector and successfully constructed. And then oep protein was ideally expressed in BL21 cells. This project let us know the best conditions of oep\u2019s protein expression, and obtained a certain amount of target protein. It also provided reliable experimental material and data preparation for the depth study of oep\u2019s mechanism.\nSkills: DNA & RNA extraction, PCR, Subclone vectors, Cell transfection, Protein characterization\nLocation: The world-famous pharmacology lab in Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College",
