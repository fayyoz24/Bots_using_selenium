    "summary": "Hello! I am Sonali and I am a PhD Researcher at Tilburg University. In my PhD, I examine the practices of and motivations for adults re-reading children\u2019s and YA books from their past. My overarching aims is to renegotiate what it means to read in the digital age that is characterised by the attention economy and a growing influence of nostalgia. In the lead up to my doctoral research, I have researched literary discourse on TikTok (aka BookTok) and will continue to be engaged with the topic.\n\nBefore starting my PhD, I was a lecturer at Tilburg University and taught courses related to Translation, Life Writing and Literary Sociology in the Erasmus Mundus International Masters in Children\u2019s Literature, Media, and Culture. As an Erasmus Mundus scholar, I graduated of the same programme and studied at the University of Glasgow, Aarhus University and Tilburg University between 2019 and 2021.",
