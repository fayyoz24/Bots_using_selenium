    "summary": "I\u2019m a full Professor (hoogleraar) at the Department of Governance and Organizational studies (USBO), Utrecht University. Also, I\u2019m board member at PSV Foundation.\n\nI study the value of sport in and for society with the intention to contribute to better functioning organizations and managers who in turn contribute to a vital, resilient and inclusive society. Central topics in my research are: public value creation in and through sport organizations; societal impact of mega sport events; good governance and integrity in (international) sport organizations. \n\nAlso, I lecture in the Master's programme Sport Policy and Sports Management, the Bachelor\u2019s programme Governance and Organizational Studies and in various sports management and governance courses at national and international universities. I am a member of several advisory boards (e.g. FC Utrecht and NOC*NSF) and used to be trainer/ coach of youth football teams. \n\nI consider both academic output and societal impact as my core business. Therefore, I publish in academic journals, professional magazines, my blog 'Frank about sports' and on Twitter.",
