    "summary": "PhD Researcher at Amsterdam UMC, loc. VUmc | MPhil Political Sciences, University of the West Indies, Barbados | MA Sociology, Western University, Canada\n\nThrough utilizing my expertise in education and sociology, I am dedicated to contribute to the promotion of equity in society. I use my skills in qualitative and quantitative research, network building and collaboration with various stakeholders to strengthen my current PhD research goals; the development of equitable admissions policy for health professions education in the Netherlands - something I believe will prove to be of great value to our future healthcare sector and higher education.\n\nYou can find my publication \"Selection for health professions education leads to increased inequality of\nopportunity and decreased student diversity in The Netherlands, but lottery is no solution: A retrospective multi-cohort study\" here: https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159X.2022.2041189\n\nand \"Influence of social networks in healthcare on preparation for selection procedures of health professions education: a Dutch interview study\" here: https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/10/e062474\n\nForthcoming publications focus on the inequality of opportunity in all selective higher education programs in The Netherlands; on the institutional and societal support to address this inequality of opportunity; and on the loss of diversity in the route from medical student to medical specialist in The Netherlands. \n\nArticles about our research can be found here: \nhttps://www.scienceguide.nl/2022/03/terugkeer-loting-geneeskundeopleiding-divers/\nhttps://www.scienceguide.nl/2022/04/kansenongelijkheid-toegenomen-na-invoering-selectie-wat-gaan-we-eraan-doen/\nhttps://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/2022/09/09/kansenongelijkheid-medische-studies-gestegen-met-een-migratieachtergrond-minder-kans-op-toelating/\nhttps://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/2022/09/13/artsentekort-op-de-antillen-en-toch-ongelijkex-kansen-voor-antilliaanse-studenten-bij-medische-opleidingen/",

At the moment, student populations are not representative of their future patient population. However, a diverse population of healthcare professionals is essential for excellent healthcare. That is why my research aimed to investigate the support for equitable admissions policies which are applicable and appropriate for the Dutch context. I also investigated the inequality of opportunity in selection for higher education programs, and studied the loss of diversity in the route from medical student, to physician, to medical specialist, using Statistics Netherlands Microdata.",
