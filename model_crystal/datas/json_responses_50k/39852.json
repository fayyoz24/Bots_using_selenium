Additionally, as a learning coach, I facilitate students' learning journeys by providing valuable feedback and engaging activities that encourage reflection, strategic planning, and goal-directed development.\n\nMy commitment extends to serving as the Chairman of the Assessment Expert Group and as a digital assessments advisor. In these roles, I assess and find solutions for the assessments within the Tandprothetiek Bachelor Programme, ensuring alignment with the vision of the HU and the demands of the ever-evolving world of innovation.\n\nIn collaboration with my colleagues, I am dedicated to creating an environment where students take active ownership of their education and shape their path to future success.\n\nUntil July of 2023 I was also working at the Management in Heath Care Bachelor Programme as Education and Innovation Advisor.
