We believe that the mystery of the creative power of life, God, can come closer in people as the power of love. We wish to express solidarity with creation in our thoughts and actions, thus giving meaning to our lives. \r\n\r\nIn our communities we reflect on vital questions. Here we find possibilities to come to self-development, and to share each other\u2019s feelings under all of life\u2019s circumstances. For apostolic people the community is a place where they feel at home. The development of the apostolic range of thoughts is established in a close and inspiring relationship with the Apostle, who has first responsibility for the spiritual care. \r\n\r\nThe Apostolic Society wants to stand in the middle of society. New and valuable views we take to heart. Together with other people, we want to contribute to loving relations and peace in the world. We feel a moral responsibility with that, to give more significance in our own lives first of all, to compassion, a forgiving disposition and more humanity. \r\n\r\nSee for more informatin on The Apostolic Society: http://english.apgen.nl/who_are_we/our-ideal/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
