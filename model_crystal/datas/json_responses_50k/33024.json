    "summary": "I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning enthusiast with a Master's degree in Econometrics with a Specialization in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing at Erasmus University Rotterdam and a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (Sao Paulo State University - UNESP/ 9TH Best University of Latin America).\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f A \u200blittle about me:\nI am originally from Brazil, where I spent most of my life. But because I have European grandparents, I am also a European citizen, which allows me to live and work here.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in 2014 and concluded that to not miss the human touch as an engineer (at least in Brazil), I decided to work for DIA, a global supermarket chain strong in Spain/Portugal and the Latin American world. I have been employed there as a Private Label Product Manager, where I managed the supply chain for bakery products and built reports that the head office used for analysis. \n\nWhile I love Brazil, almost four years ago, I decided it was time for a change and moved to Europe. After reflecting on my drivers and ambitions, I decided to go to university here in the Netherlands, where I have moved since. I felt that my past experiences showed that I thrive and excel when I can use my technical mind to answer exciting questions with the full support of an equally motivated team. \n\n\ud83c\udfaf Goals: My primary goal for the near future is to learn and develop myself as a data scientist; be part of the machine learning revolution, and bring a feminine touch to this primarily masculine field. \n\nFollow me on Github --> https://github.com/gyovanaferreira\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Achievements:\n\u25ba  Founder of the project Alimente-me dedicated to distributing food and other needs to homeless people in Sao Paulo;\n\u25ba  1st place in the IAESTE Brazil Ranking 2011 for mechanical engineering;  IAESTE provides young science and engineering students globally with paid, course-related work experience.\n\u200b\n\ud83d\udcaa Areas of Expertise:\n\u25ba Intermediate Python & R\n\u25ba Entry-level SQL but eager to learn\n\u25ba Business Analytics & Market Research\n\u25ba Machine Learning \n\u25ba Strong Analytical and Mathematical Skills\n\u25ba Econometrics Modeling\n\u25ba Product Development\n\u25ba Data Science\n\n\ud83d\udec2 EU Citizen | Right to live and work\n\ud83d\udce7 Do not hesitate to contact me\n\ud83d\udccdLocation: Rotterdam - The Netherlands\n\nArtificial Intelligence | Customer Focus | Machine Learning | Team Player | Data Science | Business Intelligence | Strategy | Innovation | Technology",

The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.\n\nIn this project, you will apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas.",
