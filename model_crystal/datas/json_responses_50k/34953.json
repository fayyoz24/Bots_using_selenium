From an artistic, academic and sociopolitical perspective we looked at issues of hybridity, performativity and food as these seemingly unrelated topics have a very strong influence on how we perceive the Other and each other in modern society. I interviewed the artists Guy Ben-Ary, Maria Verstappen and Erwin Driessens and designer Chlo\u00e9 Rutzerfeld.",

The second context is the care for people with an intellectual disability.
