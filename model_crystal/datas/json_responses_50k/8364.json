The first implementation was in 2003 in Greenville, NC USA.\n\nThe scope of the project was to implement the SAP template business processes:\n- Order To Cash (OTC)\n- Purchase to Pay (PtP)\n- Finance and Controlling (FICO)\n- Plant Maintenance (PM)\n\nand the business group specific processes (not part of the template configuration):\n- Quality Management (QM)\n- Warehouse Management (WM)\n- Production\n- Project Systems (PS)\n\nNouds role within the project is SAP Consultant for the domain Order to Cash.\nSAP Consultants assisted with the definition of the functional requirements, carried out the technical customization of the system, updated the system documentation (both functional and technical) and assisted the key users with executing the testing.\nAdditionally he:\n- Explained global template processes and system configuration to local business users.\n- Identified gaps and corresponding solutions. These could be local workarounds, local developments or changes to the global template system.\n- Created interfaces designs for integration with existing local systems\n- Trained end users\n- Delivered\t After go-live support\n\nResults: \n- No significant changes to the template were required because Noud defined workable work-arounds and could explain the rationale behind the global template. When changes to the template were required, Noud could define a solution that benefit the template, also for other business groups.\n- Local developments were kept to a minimum, but still fulfilled all local requirements. This supported the goal of the company to reduce IT maintenance costs and at the same time contributed to the corporate IT strategy to have 1 global consolidated ERP system.",
