    "summary": "Dynamic and ambitious, promoter of well-defined goals and responsibilities ownership. A multidisciplinary engineer who enjoys working with international teams and pro-actively steps beyond the comfort zones.\n\nRaised in Spain, Belgium, and Germany, I have become synonymous with adaptability to varied environments and multi-cultural cooperation. This exposure has also given me an adaptive leadership that thrives most notably in interdisciplinary challenges and international environments.\n\nSpace science had always fascinated me and I took every chance to pursue this field throughout my engineering education. My thesis in low-thrust trajectory optimization led to an award-winning novel approach and, besides my passion for software engineering and simulations, I've actively participated in small satellite developments for Earth Observation. On the professional domain, I've had the honour to work at three space agencies on state-of-the-art subjects such as space surveillance and awareness, and global navigation satellite systems. This latter experience as aerospace engineering consultant has additionally given me a proven affinity for relationships management and foostering cooperation under high pressure. \n\nMy ambition is to combine my all-rounded technical skillset with my passion to empower the people around me while never settling and taking on innovative challenges. Moreover, my personal interests also include scientific outreach, education, phylantropy, and sports. Feel free to also reach out to me for social causes, entrepreneurship, and investment opportunities too.\n\nTalk to you soon!\nDavid",

The team identified a poorly understood but important region in the atmosphere: the Upper Thermosphere and Lower Stratosphere (the UTLS), that has a significant influence on both weather and climate. They proposed to investigate this region and to complement observations made by operational missions. The mission will bring a better understanding of the processes in this region, and also in the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere.\n\nThe jury was also impressed by the clear structure of the presentation and the consistent deduction of mission objectives, mission requirements, and the stated mission objectives including the needs of international bodies like IPCC. The clear and detailed presentation of the payload and mission design including budgets and technology readiness was supported by a range of media resources. The jury also witnessed engagement, spontaneity, and responsiveness to the audience\u2019s questions.\"",

A main element of the water cycle is precipitation, and it is only very sparsely observed at high latitudes. We propose a new satellite mission, PoPSat, to observe snow and light rain at high latitudes, as well as snowfall at mid latitudes. The satellite shall be equipped with a dual band (Ka and W bands) phased array antenna radar and provide 3D information about precipitation and clouds. The horizontal resolution of 2 km shall exceed all other observations, and the measurements at high latitudes, together with the capability to monitor snowfall, shall complement the GPM mission's observations. By filling this gap, PoPSat shall provide essential data for improving global weather and climate models.",

We propose the WAter Vapour European - Explorer (WAVE-E) satellite mission to monitor water vapour in the UTLS. It consists of three small satellites that will be put in sun-synchronous low earth orbits. The main instrument is a limb-sounding and cross-track scanning mid-infrared passive spectrometer (824 cm -1 to 829 cm -1 ) providing measurements over the UTLS region at a 1 km vertical resolution and 25 km horizontal resolution. Synergistic use of WAVE-E and MetOp-NG operational satellites is identified. Data fusion retrieval algorithms can provide water vapour profiles from the surface to the lower stratosphere.",

As the systems engineer, I was responsible for the mass, power and \u0394V budgets. Additionally, I designed the propulsion, power, and on-board computer subsystems and performed the mission analysis. My team, whose \u201cWAVE-E\u201d concept received the best presentation and science proposal awards, also elected me as team manager and co-presenter. \n\nThe positive feedback from teammates and tutors, who praised me for being an empathetic leader, as well as the advice from jurors, who deemed my contribution outstanding, is what encourages me to pursue a career in space-related projects.",
