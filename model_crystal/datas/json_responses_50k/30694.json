A main focus of the consortium is to provide services through easy-to-use web interfaces, while retaining customization features to handle requests by expert users. Various programs relevant for structural biology scientists are grid ported and already available through the e-NMR web portal, including HADDOCK, XPLOR-NIH, CYANA and CS-ROSETTA among others. The e-NMR community is currently the second largest virtual organization (enmr.eu) in the Life Sciences.
