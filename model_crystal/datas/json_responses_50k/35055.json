Not to actually manage the construction activities themselves, but to organize all activities on behalf of the eventual homesteader AkzoNobel Decorative Paints. \nFor this investment of almost 7M Euro I lead and collaborated with a broad team of specialists like purchasing, finance and controling, enginering, publicity, HSE as well as representatives of the future \"inhabitants\"\u200b, local management, the constructor and the steering committee. \nI was pleased and felt very honnored with this role as it offered me lots of experience in an entire new area of expertise. The culture, language and people's interactions in this enginering-wold were quite different from my originally worlds of Research, Development, Production and Marketing which made this job a great learnful experience. The project was by all means a huge success as it was finalized in time, well within budget and the inhabitants were excited with their new work environment!",
