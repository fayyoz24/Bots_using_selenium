    "summary": "LION & LinkedIn superconnector. Accepts ALL invitations. \nNever hit the 'I don't know this person'- button. NEVER SPAM. \n\n\nHi,\n\n\nWHAT I DO: I see health issues and energy blocks up to 20 years before you become ill. \nAnd teach/advice you to turn your illnesses around. Yourself.\n\nYou know how difficult it is to PRE-diagnose, prevent or cure diseases like pre-diabetes, fatigue,  burn-out, hypoglycemia, etc.? I solve this.\n\nHOW: by looking at your aura and reflex points in your face.\n\nPatho-phrenologists read the colors, bumps & wrinkles at reflexpoints on your head to 'read' which organs have little or big difficulties. And what latent or chronic diseases you have.\nWith kinesiology (muscle-testing), healing food for YOUR typology & temperament, EFT tapping, aura-healing, Sch\u00fcssler cell-salts, I find out what works best for you to prevent or solve discomforts.\n\nWHY? It took me & my hubby over a decade to figure out how to get healthy again, after doctors could no longer help us. We didn't take \"You've got to learn to live with it\" for an answer and found solutions ourselves.\n\n\nWorked as a trusted person for very ill people since 1983.\n\nPeople find me through word of mouth.\n\n\n\n>>>  Early retired since 2020 to take FT care of a fam. member <<<\n\nMessages only on LinkedIn because I hate telephone terror & my email inboxes are full.\n\nThanks and have your best week ever! :)\n\nWarmly,\nIvy\n\nPhrenology scientist\ndouble certified Big Money Business Coach\ncertified Free your Time, Free your Life Coach\ncertified NLP Master Practitioner",

Cold calling banks to find out if my father happened to have an account there.\n3. Visiting banks in Spain, where he lived in the wintertime. (Trust me, you never ever want to have an account in Spain, as you only need someones PASSPORT to empty out an account - no other legal document asked! Only 1 bank refused even my legally translated document, saying I had to get a lawyer, looking at me like I was a crook). My notary said a bank isn't allowed to TELL if anyone has an account there. Well the girls answering the phones, having acces to a computer and telling me everything I wanted to know (in Spain I sat down together with them BEHIND their computers) didn't know that! By the way, I'm very grateful for the few lessons in private LAW I got at the MEAO, as a small DOMESTIC bank (headed by my uncle) tried to disinherit us (saying he could only pay us money if we DECLINED the inheritance - you've got to be kidding, and he was stupid enough to put this in writing!).\n4. My legal insurance (DAS) could NOT confirm if my half-brother is legally my full brother. According to dutch law, after a devorce, a man is still responsible for a child born within exactly so and so days (about 9 months)! The fact that my uncle had to pay a bastard child caused a lot of stress in HIS family (my father's 10 brothers and sisters, who had given no-one sole power of attorney and were suing each other). Because I read a lot, I found ANYONE WHO DOES A SINGLE ACT (e.g. ending a houselease or contacting an undertaker, has a JOINT AND LEGAL LIABILITY - is HOOFDELIJK aansprakelijk met zijn priv\u00e9-vermogen)! When my uncle denied to pay us, or see me, I confronted him with this in a single letter, which quickly made him pay us. Notaries hardly gave me any information. Anyone still interested to accept an inheritance for the family?",

                    "description": "Hi,\n\n\nWHAT I DO: I see health issues and energy blocks up to 20 years before you become ill. \nAnd teach/advice you to turn your illnesses around. Yourself.\n\nYou know how difficult it is to PRE-diagnose, prevent or cure diseases like pre-diabetes, fatigue,  burn-out, hypoglycemia, etc.? I solve this.\n\nHOW: by looking at your aura and reflex points in your face.\n\nPatho-phrenologists read the colors, bumps & wrinkles at reflexpoints on your head to 'read' which organs have little or big difficulties. And what latent or chronic diseases you have.\nWith kinesiology (muscle-testing), healing food for YOUR typology & temperament, EFT tapping, aura-healing, Sch\u00fcssler cell-salts, I find out what works best for you to prevent or solve discomforts.\n\nWHY? It took me & my hubby over a decade to figure out how to get healthy again, after doctors could no longer help us. We didn't take \"You've got to learn to live with it\" for an answer and found solutions ourselves.\n\n\nWorked as a trusted person for very ill people since 1983.\n\nPeople find me through word of mouth.\n\n\n\n>>>  Early retired since 2020 to take FT care of my dying hubby <<<\n\nMessages only on LinkedIn because I hate telephone terror & my email inboxes are full.\n\nThanks and have your best week ever! :)\n\nWarmly,\nIvy\n\nPhrenology scientist\ndouble certified Big Money Business Coach\ncertified Free your Time, Free your Life Coach\ncertified NLP Master Practitioner",
