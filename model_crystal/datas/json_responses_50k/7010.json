    "summary": "\u2756 Coming from an internationally diverse background (dual French/American citizenship) I've lived and studied in an international atmosphere throughout my life, studying in an international section from middle school to high school in Paris. \nThen going abroad for my Bachelor's degree at Erasmus University of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and finally having the opportunity to go on exchange for half a year at the University of Monterrey in Mexico.\nThese experiences allowed me to gain a greater open-mind and creative thinking on several aspects. \n\n\u2756 Dedicated to better my crafts I am always keen on discovering new things and fast to learn them. It is always with motivation and curiousness that I am pursuing my hopes of starting a career in the field of marketing and communications. \n\n\u2756 In the midst of my studies (set to graduate in June 2023), I interned at Tech Rise People in the marketing domain for 2 months where I am now a part-time employee as a creative assistant. \nFor the time being, I am working remote from Monterrey, Mexico from where I am engaged in my university exchange program.",
