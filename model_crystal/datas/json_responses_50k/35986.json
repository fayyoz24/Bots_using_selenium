For the language learners, on the one hand, the exchanges aim at improving their communicative skills and their intercultural competences in such a way to prepare them for their stay abroad. The teacher trainees, on the other hand, benefit from the fact that they have real students with whom they put digital tasks in practice as part of their curriculum. \n\nWe presented this project at \n- EuroCALL 2014, University of Groningen \n- UniCollaboration Second International Conference on Telecollaboration, Trinity College, Dublin (April 2016)\n",
