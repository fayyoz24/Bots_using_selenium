    "summary": "I am a cross-cultural human-centered design strategist based in Amsterdam. I believe in the power of collaborative discussion and am passionate about delivering impactful solutions for society. I assist in achieving clients\u2019 business and organizational goals through user research, service design, human-centered design training, and co-design workshops.\n\nAlso, I am internationally rounded with experience living and working in the USA, Japan, and the Netherlands. I have been fortunate enough to have worked with innovators in various types of organizations, such as traditional corporations, startups, NGOs, and a city government across the continents. \n\nTo develop strategies with multiple stakeholders, I often host service design workshops with one of many proven frameworks, such as Design Sprint, value proposition canvas, and lean canvas. As a bilingual who has multicultural experience, I have also translated language and cultural contexts between Japanese and English-speaking stakeholders.\n\nI am always very excited to participate in envisioning lofty dreams and developing ways to make them realities! \n\n---\n\nPlease find out more about myself and previous case studies: https://www.yunamie.net/",
