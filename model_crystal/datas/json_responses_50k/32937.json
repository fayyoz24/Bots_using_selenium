    "summary": "My main interest lies in supporting businesses and society on the transition pathway to a low-carbon economy. Inspired by Al Gore's and David Blood's concept of Sustainable Capitalism, my work focusses on formulating strategies and policies in which fighting climate change and economic growth go hand in hand. Carbon pricing is a key focus area of my work. By putting a price on carbon, greenhouse gas emissions are given a direct monetary value and can be linked to financial decisions. \n\nMy achievements include:\n- Leading the World Bank's authoritative State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report 2016 - 2020 and a main author since 2013\n- Developing the widely adopted 4D framework for best practice internal carbon pricing and step-by-step how-to guide for internal carbon pricing in corporate decision making and procurement\n- Supporting numerous companies and governments on the design, implementation and impact evaluation of the EU emissions trading system and other carbon pricing systems around the world",

The assessment revealed that in the period 2021 \u2013 2030 the electro-intensive industry requires approximately 2,300 million allowances to be fully compensated for indirect carbon emissions costs up to the level of the current EU ETS benchmark. In order to compensate these costs in a harmonised manner across the EU ETS, the study assumes that allowances from the auctioning volume could be channeled towards the electro-intensive industry to form the basis for a new hybrid compensation mechanism. Ecofys has evaluated several scenarios regarding the size of the EU compensation pool and the effect on member state auction revenues.\n\n\nhttp://www.ecofys.com/en/publications/indirect-carbon-emissions-impact-of-a-hybrid-compensation-approach/",

Furthermore, the Dutch Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth aims at 100% free allocation compared to a realistic benchmark for best performing installations in the EU ETS. The choices made with respect to the proposed benchmark updates, as well as the various options for the carbon leakage list, will determine whether the resulting allocation is compatible with the Dutch Energy Agreement. Against this background this report investigates the likelihood that the CSCF is needed for a variety of scenarios and provides a feasibility check on the proposed default benchmark updates for two important sectors in the Dutch industry: the steel and refinery sectors.\n\nhttp://www.ecofys.com/en/publications/feasibility-check-on-correction-factor-and-benchmark-updates/",

The study was commissioned by ENECO. The study concludes that the direct waterbed effect under the EU ETS, where emission reductions in the Netherlands automatically result in more emissions elsewhere at most takes places only partially. The waterbed effect related to the emission cap through time does take place, but the MSR dampens this effect and furthermore, this effect will be impacted by future political decisions about the surplus in the EU ETS. This exploratory study aims to give further insight into the effect of additional measures, like the closure of coal fired power plants, on the net CO2 reduction as well into the functioning of the EU ETS and the MSR.\n\nhttp://www.ecofys.com/en/publications/the-waterbed-effect-and-the-eu-ets/",

The resulting carbon costs to energy-intensive sectors, like the steel sector, are still poorly understood. As the carbon costs impact the competitiveness, the European steel sector is interested to get a better quantification of the carbon cost impact in the period 2021-2030.\n\nCommissioned by Eurofer, Ecofys developed the Ecofys EU ETS Carbon Cost Calculator (E3C3) to assess future carbon costs under different scenarios. An important design criteria was to have all sources and assumptions as transparent as possible. With this model Ecofys provides the first transparent impact assessment of EU Commission proposal for ETS revision post-2020.\n\nhttp://www.ecofys.com/en/publications/carbon-costs-for-the-steel-sector-in-europe-post-2020/",

In addition, Ecofys and SEI investigated if and how the activities could stimulate scaled-up mitigation by creating a domestic environment (technical, regulatory and institutional) that can support a range of climate policies.

A new report prepared by Ecofys and commissioned by Greenpeace finds that the EU 2030 targets can be set in a way to also accommodate the surplus expected until 2020.\n\nGiven the currently expected surplus, the 2030 target or the trajectory towards it would need to be significantly more stringent than otherwise. If the entire surplus of allowances from the ETS were to be used after 2020, the 2030 target has to become around 7 percentage points more stringent to compensate for that.\n\nhttp://www.ecofys.com/en/news/adjusted-2030-targets-may-revive-the-ets-and-put-eu-emissions-back-on-the-2",

The scenarios differ in their assumptions regarding the energy and climate policy environment in Europe and the rest of the world, in their outlook regarding the development of energy and feedstock prices and with respect to the speed of innovation.
