In addition to motivating students to become involved in countering violent extremism, the Challenge also builds a community of interested and engaged young people living shared values to counter violent extremism from across the United States, Canada, the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.",

Through short-term visits to the United States, current and emerging foreign leaders in a variety of fields experience this country firsthand and cultivate lasting relationships with their American counterparts.\n\nThe IVLP focused on countering violent extremism and conducted both professional meetings and cultural activities in Washington D.C., New York and San Francisco. It included an invitation to the White House to meet with representatives of the National Security Council to present our projects and discuss topics including challenging violent extremism in schools and online radicalisation.",
