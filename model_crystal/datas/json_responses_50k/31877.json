I provide emergency support sessions to beginner students in the form of pull-out/parallel lessons and then, as the students\u2019 English abilities develop, this support generally changes into in-class support. In developing materials, I work with the ELA team and alongside and other classroom teachers. The students\u2019 ages range from 8 \u2013 11 years old.
