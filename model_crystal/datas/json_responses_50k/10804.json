    "summary": "Currently working as a System Integration and Test Engineer (Proto) on DUV systems at ASML within the System Integration department. \n\nAcademically, I\u2019m a Mechanical engineer with a Master's specialization in Engineering Systems (focus on Automotive) from the HAN (Arnhem).  I successfully completed and defended my Master\u2019s thesis working within the ASML Bolt Competence. The key focus areas of my thesis were experiment design, testing and predictive modelling. \n\nDuring my time as a Mechanical engineering undergraduate student at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST), I was a proud member of a team that designed and built a drone that came 3rd in the National DBFC (Design Build and Fly Competition) in 2017. In my final year, I had the chance to work on designing novel soft-robotic actuators finding potential application in rehabilitation of stroke patients. \n\nI was also a proud member of AIESEC in Islamabad and worked as a team member in Team iGV(Incoming Global Volunteer) and worked to introduce international students to volunteer work in Pakistan. \n\nI enjoy working in multi-cultural environments and being an active, outgoing member of the community. I also enjoy painting (watercolors and acrylics) and reading!",
