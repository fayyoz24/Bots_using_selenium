            "description": "Girls Day is an initiative of VHTO to bring young girls in touch with science, technology and ICT. It is an annual national event and several companies or departments related to these topics are open on that day to receive girls of an age of 10-15. At ECN, there were several workshops and presentations organized, as well as a quiz where the girls participated in. \nThe role as a guest lecturer is to: (1) help girls at an age of 13-16 orientate themselves on the different type of jobs and eventually help them decide on their study path and (2) raise awareness of gender stereotyping at primary schools since children already at a young age define career opportunities as male and female."
