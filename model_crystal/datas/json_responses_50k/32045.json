    "summary": "My hometown is Texel, where I grew up with lots of green and water. Therefore, I have been fascinated by nature and landscape for a long time. Ever since my childhood, I am collecting minerals and other interesting items, and try to identify flora, fauna or whatever is coming along my path. My secondary school profile was a typical beta profile with Physics, Chemistry, Geography, Mathematics and Biology. After I graduated on secondary school, I was looking for a study in Earth\u2019 Sciences. In Wageningen, I found a study where I was looking for: Bsc Soil, Water & Atmosphere. The first year was more focused on the basics, such as Mathematics and Physics. The study became even more interesting over time, due to a lot of excursion and more specialized courses. After I finished my bachelor, in which I spend one semester abroad, I decided to continue my masters in Wageningen. Basically, there were three fields of study: Meteorology, Hydrology and Soil Science. My main interests were in Hydrology and Soil Science, therefore I specialised in the field of hydrogeology. I went frequently into the field with excursions to France, Germany, Iceland and Spain as highlights. During my master thesis and internship, I could put theory into practice and specialized even more on groundwater/hydrology.  Both were graded with a solid 8.0. In July 2020 I finished my master programme and I am now looking for a job as a hydrologist/hydrogeologist.\n",

With my internship I wanted to become more familiar with groundwater modelling software such as MODFLOW.  Arcadis offered me this opportunity and I started in November with my internship. The people were really nice and from day 1 there was always a nice working atmosphere. I worked mainly on my own project, but was always interested in other's work. A couple of times I helped with small tasks, which gave me an idea how projects are carried out at a consultancy firm. My internship project consisted out of two main topics: (1) assessing the new possibilities of MODFLOW 6 compared to earlier versions and (2) looking at the possible benefits of intermittent abstraction over continuous abstraction at a dutch abstraction well field.  It was a nice project to work at and I learned a lot during the 4 months at Arcadis. Unfortunately, no jobs were available at the time I finished my internship. Also the outbreak of COVID 19 at the end of my internship, was far from ideal. Nevertheless, I am really satisfied with the results and with the final mark for my internship.",
