    "summary": "I am a joyful, open, and sociable young professional passionate about Earth measurements and eager to develop my Remote Sensing career.\n\n        My BEng in Geodesy provides advanced knowledge in Topography, Geodetic measurements, Engineering Topography,  Photogrammetry, Cadastral Systems, GIS and Cartography. I have experience with GNSS and total station measurements as well as laser scanning and leveling. \nI was always intrigued by how much we can learn about our planet from the sky, so it came only natural to do astro-geodetic measurements for my BEng thesis \u201cAstro-geodetic leveling in Geoid determination\u201d.\n\n        As a master student in Geo-Information Science at WUR, I attended advanced courses in Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems as well as Data management and Programming. Furthermore, in order to develop a better idea about the surrounding world from an economic and environmentalist perspective, I followed Advanced Management and Marketing and Trends in Forest and Nature Conservation courses, as well as Project Planning to better develop my time management skills.\n\n        I am passionate about research and I take every opportunity to expand my knowledge. In November 2014 I participated in a research campaign for REDD+ in Guyana\u2019s tropical forest, where we took LiDAR and UAV hyperspectral and point cloud measurements before and after selective logging was done.\n\n\u25cf I am an analytical thinker that is very detail oriented; \n\u25cf I can successfully complete tasks that require physical effort, I work efficiently in a team and under stress conditions;\n\u25cf I quickly learn from other people, but I am also self-taught;\n\u25cf I am a reliable person willing to take responsibility and challenge",
