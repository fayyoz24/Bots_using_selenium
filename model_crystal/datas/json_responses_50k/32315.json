    "summary": "English teacher at a preparatory vocational education school for children with ASS.\n\nMultilingual professional with extensive front-line experience in hospitality & customer service industry.\n\nMost of my career has been in an international environment.  I was an expat for 16 years until 2011.  My working life has been mainly directed towards dealing with customers and colleagues and their well being and well functioning.  I am punctual, reliable and able to work enthusiastically under pressure, either within a team or alone. I am a positive and fair person with a friendly disposition and a good sense of humour.  This has aided me in extensive dealings with passengers, clients, hotel guests and in the supervision of staff across different cultures.\n\nHence my preference for a position which emphasizes contact with customers and colleagues, with possible growth to a supervising position in the future.\n\nSpecialties: Multicultural, great sense of customer service, excellent listener, dealing with and effectively resolving unusual situations.\n\nI'm fluent in English, Dutch, Spanish and German; rusty French skills.",
