    "summary": "I enjoy working with entrepreneurs and companies to execute on their ideas, to guide them through the digital transformation. In good times and in bad times. I'm not the creative guy with the bright ideas and new strategies. I'm the quartermaster, the program manager, the operational director, the COO. My focus is the execution of a digital business case or to solve a crisis. I solve problems at the crossroads of technology, content and marketing. With a no-nonsense approach and a proven track record on restructuring and leading complex businesses.",
