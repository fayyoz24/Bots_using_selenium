The main focus of my work is to train ML/DL models either on data coming from application monitors, system metrics, or log messages. Those models will in turn, predict whether something will go wrong or is going wrong with an application that is used either internally or externally by clients.\nCurrently the majority of the work done is on unlabelled data which bring an additional layer of challenge. My role is thus to also be very close to application owners to make sure that what is being detected as an anomaly/outlier is relevant to them.\n-Unsupervised anomaly detection on monitor and system metric data using Isolation Forest\n-Unsupervised anomaly detection on log data using NLP pipeline and Bert for text embedding and either Isolation Forest or Autoencoder\n-Similar log clustering using Bertopic to generate clusters of similar log messages, follow by time series anomaly detection.\nMy role is also to take care of the entire end to end pipeline, from the moment the data are being ingest, up to the models deployment and output serviced to my clients using Palantir Foundry with Spark and MS Azure as platform, as well as collaborating with various other teams and functions.",
