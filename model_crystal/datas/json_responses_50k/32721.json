    "summary": "I am an assistant professor in aeroacoustics and aircraft noise, especially working on acoustic imaging techniques, and a research consultant. I have extended experience in aeroacoustic experiments and modeling. My ambition is to make aircraft and wind turbines as silent as possible to reduce the annoyance experienced by the affected communities. I am currently diving into the field of psychoacoustics to obtain perception-based guidelines for the design of low-noise aircraft and wind turbines. \n\nI have a strong analytical and theoretical background and I enjoy working in collaboration projects with other researchers as well as individually. In general, colleagues and friends see me as energetic, open-minded, and extrovert. While being detail-oriented, I also like to keep the \"bigger picture\" in mind for producing socially-relevant, high-quality research.",
