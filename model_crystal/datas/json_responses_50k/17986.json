Tasks include for example collecting and analysing data, preparing surveys and interviews, conducting interviews, approaching participants, writing literature reviews, writing reports, developing tools, and communication with stakeholders. \n\nApart from the fact that these themes interest me greatly, this work appeals to me so much because it has a direct impact on society. That is because the projects are carried out on behalf of, and in collaboration with, external stakeholders. In addition, I get a lot of energy from the variety of projects and the combination of research and practical implementation.",

            "description": "The Honours College of the Social Sciences is a faculty program in which students of anthropology, educational sciences, psychology and sociology participate. This program focuses on challenging, small-scale and interactive education. Thanks to this program, I have been able to immerse myself in my own field as well as broaden myself by looking beyond the borders of my own field. In addition, I was able to develop myself here by working on my own talents and ambitions.\n\nThe activities of the Honours program are very varied. For example, I conducted a qualitative research into the later clinic of the Princess Maxima Center, for which I also created an advisory report and podcast. In addition, an Honours component has been added to some of my regular bachelor courses. Finally, I attended various lectures and other educational activities, such as a study trip to Ghent."

By means of weekly lectures, discussions and assignments I have become acquainted with different sciences and scientists, and I also gained greater experience in collaborating with students from other disciplines.\n\nThis program taught me the differences and similarities between sciences and also provided insight into the dynamics between science and society. I further also discovered how scientists from different disciplines work together to solve contemporary issues, and how we as students can do that ourselves."
