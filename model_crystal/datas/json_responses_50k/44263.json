    "summary": "I love to explain things normally deemed too complicated to communicate.\n\nMedical writer and editor with over a decade of experience specializing in molecular medicine: a fancy phrase for my joyful witness of cell biology and biochemistry applied to therapy areas such as oncology and rare disease (including genetic and post-infectious conditions). In medicine, as in medical communications, the small impacts the big.\n\nI've worked with audiences from preschoolers to PIs to cover pivotal research\u2014from basic science to phase IV clinical trials. Biomarkers. Targeted therapy. Clinical guidelines. I'm a professional nerd. \n\nEvery job I've ever had has involved explaining science. A researcher to be a part of it, and before that a teacher bubbling over about it. Technical experience in hospital pathology and biochemistry research. Recruited to the leading healthcare communications agency in Asia. I can't help but share what scientists are doing to combat disease, now.\n\nBecause science is beautiful, and I appreciate when it is described excellently.\n\n\n\u25ba \"Agile, considerate, and supportive,\" \"proactiveness and dedication ... out-of-the-box thinking and energy,\" \"marvelous working with\"\u2014MIMS\n\u25ba \u201cAnalytical, reflective and compassionate nature,\u201d \"maturity, independence, and flexibility,\u201d \"a rigorous teaching practice characterised by clarity and enthusiasm,\u201c \u201cwell-planned and creative\u201d\u2014Melbourne Graduate School of Education\n\u25ba \"Persuasive and outspoken in communicating her scientific ideas ... passionate about her work ... clearly has the talent and desire to succeed.\"\u2014The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n\u25ba \"Highly intelligent, hardworking \u2026 extending her analysis of results beyond what would be expected\u201d\u2014Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute\n\u25ba International BSc (Honours), MTeach (Secondary), MPhil (Life Science) | First class\n\n\nI'm good with copywriting, KOL interviews, layout checks, and getting small things right. You'll get enthusiasm, reliability, research, attention to detail, streamlining. \n\nMy superpower seems to be subject lines; doctors tend to open what I send them.\n\n\u25ba Digital deliverables; advisory boards; congress coverage\n\u25ba Writing and copyediting for scientific journals and their magazines, biotech companies and their blogs\n\u25ba Contract research for philanthropic societies\n\n\nFave authors: Tolstoy, Okri, Woolf, Sebald\n\nAnd, yes, you can reach out for freelance writing and editing.\nLinkedIn DM or renaecrossing@gmail.com\nLike molecules, we can start small.",

We designed and built a floating vegetable garden using aquaponics, to combat malnutrition and provide a source of income. (How does aquaponics work? We had tanks on the side of the garden with fish; the fish would poo in the water and a pump transported the water to the top of the garden to flow through and fertilise the plants.) We presented our work to judges and gave public demonstrations, being awarded 'Best Technical Solution'.",
