    "summary": "l have always been fascinated by the rapid growth and development of protected agriculture, as it might be the key to solving food and water scarcity in the near future. Additionally, l'm also eager to explore how plants exquisitely respond to different environmental parameters and how they interact with each other. During my bachelor's and master's studies, l learned preliminary knowledge about protected agriculture (especially greenhouse cultivation) as well as plant physiology and morphology respectively.\n\nMy research interests include plant growth and development in controlled environments, (dynamic) photosynthesis, soilless cultivation, and plant modeling. My master thesis focused on the interaction between CO2 and relative humidity on dynamic photosynthesis, l also conducted and designed several trials to select a superior substrate for improving the yield and qualities of hydroponic leafy greens in my master internship. Thereafter, l realized that it would be interesting and challenging to unknot some mysteries in the plant world and consequently apply theories to practice in the horticulture industry. So, l decided to continue my research and study.\n\nMy PhD project is about how plants efficiently utilize green photons for growth and development. There is always a misconception that plants do not efficiently use green light or do not use it at all. Therefore, academia and industry tend to avoid this photon in the PAR range. However, a growing body of recent research revealed that plants do use green photons! I hope my research will contribute to how light spectra affect plant growth and development,  the choice of light recipes in the CEA, and perhaps improve plant resource use efficiency by using green light.",
