            "description": "Entered the biggest blockchain hackathon in the world in 2018. We came third based on our ability to actively run code at the end of the hackathon that demonstrated the utility of our solution.\n\nWhat problem did we want to solve? \nWe want to enable farmers in rural areas in Zimbabwe to claim an identity and corresponding entitlements to farming goods, services and subsidies, with a lot less of the risks and overhead expenses associated with microfinancing in rural agriculture today. \n\nI was born in Zimbabwe, and two others in our team with comparable backgrounds witnessed how hard it is for people in rural areas to gain access to the economy of developing countries. Our entire team shares this concern. Through our small, but hopefully scalable solution, we demonstrated a solution to improve farmers\u2019 ability to participate in emerging economies. \n\nHow can Blockchain help with this? \nBlockchain can verify information about your identity that says, for example, \u201cI am farmer X, and I need Y amount of seeds (to sustain my seasonal crop yields) through subsidies of government (or NGO) Z\u201d. This can help farmers in three ways: \na)\tBuild transparency and decrease risks of corruption. Because a blockchain is decentralized everyone can verify a farmer\u2019s identity and the goods/services s/he receives from the government or NGO;\nb)\tMake it easier for farmers to claim a legitimate identification because creating an identification on a blockchain yields less overhead than producing and maintaining paper-based identification;\nc)\tImprove the trustworthiness of the identification of a farmer because on a blockchain, identification is extremely difficult (near impossible) to forge, unlike with paper documents.",

This research project addressed issues related to how cloud computing services can be accountable to SMEs with little leverage to negotiate the terms of use. I researched legal issues, stakeholder concerns, and conceptual modelling related to cloud contracts. And I contributed to the development of the A4Cloud Offering Advisory Tool (COAT). I have contributed to two peer-reviewed computer science publications as a result of my research at TILT. \n\nIn particular, I contributed to COAT with 2 lead scientists from HP Labs and a professor from Tilburg University. This tooling served as a brokerage tool for SMEs/users who need a more transparent way to find appropriate cloud services online. A paper publicising the benefits was presented at an IEEE conference in Singapore and a beta version of the COAT was developed (completed a few months after my internship was completed). \n\nSecondly, I co-authored an early version of a Data Protection Impact Assessment methodology (before the General Data Protection Regulation was in force) that was appropriate for cloud computing services.",
