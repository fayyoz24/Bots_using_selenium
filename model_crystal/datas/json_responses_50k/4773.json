I worked frequently with internal partners from other departments including the client services, communications and program delivery units, and worked as well with external partners, including the provincial government, the Office of the Fairness Commissioner of Ontario, and other regulatory bodies such as the Technical Standards and Safety Authority. I produced numerous decision and briefing notes, submissions to government in response to regulatory consultations, and documents for members such as a \u201chow to apply\u201d guide.",

I reported to the Deputy Ministers on progress of this funding as well as to government central agencies, including the Department of Finance and the Privy Council Office. I provided secretariat support for the Deputy Minister\u2019s departmental committee for the Economic Action Plan. More recently, I provided policy support to labour market program in preparation for federal budget announcements, and prepared several key documents to support this work, including budget proposals and analysis, strategic and operating review proposals, memoranda to Cabinet, and submissions to the Treasury Board.",
