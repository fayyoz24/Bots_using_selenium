I was staying alone in Tokyo, while family was back in India.\nAfter the disaster, I could see the immense effort put in by the people of Japan to restore the normal way of life. I joined NADIA - a group of volunteers who used to travel to the Miyagi perfecture - the most affected area of Japan, and help people there.\nWe used to travel by bus to those areas over the weekends, and help general public. For e.g. cleaning up slush from houses, cleaning up schools, donations, interact with people, arrange for blankets, food etc.\nThat was one of most enriching experience of my life."
