    "summary": "\u267b\ufe0f I started my career as a chemical engineer in the mining industry in sunny Western Australia. While the work was interesting I always had a passion for sustainability and given that mining isn\u2019t exactly the most environmentally friendly thing to do (and frustrated with how slowly the Australian government was taking action on climate change at that time), I decided to come study renewable energy in Europe where climate change was being taken seriously. After travelling through many countries (and picking up a MSc in Finland and PhD in the Netherlands along the way), I\u2019m now at TenneT - the Dutch and German Transmission System Operator (TSO)- where I work on paving the way towards a reliable, affordable, and sustainable power and energy system. \n\n\u26a1\ufe0fA key focus of mine is security of supply, and I\u2019m part of the team conducting TenneT\u2019s annual security of supply analysis for the Netherlands (the Monitoring Leveringszekerheid), as well as the European Resource Adequacy Assessment (ERAA) in collaboration with other TSOs as part of ENTSO-E. I also (co-)led our Adequacy Outlook study exploring long-term resource adequacy in a net-zero emission Dutch and German energy system, and the important role firm capacity resources such as demand-side response, cross-border transmission, storage and low-carbon energy carriers like hydrogen could play in the future energy system, alongside solar and wind. \n\n\ud83d\udd0d Another aspect of my work involves analyzing the economic viability of capacity resources to ensure that the scenarios we consider for the future power system are as robust as possible, and identifying potential risks to resource adequacy amidst challenging market conditions. I\u2019m also heavily involved in the ongoing Bidding Zone Review and other market-design related topics.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Decarbonizing the energy system is a massive challenge, especially given we may only have a little over 20 years to do it. Every country on the planet is facing the same issue and while they may have slightly different ways of solving the problem, I\u2019m convinced that by sharing our insights and thinking out the thorny issues together, we can get there faster and avoid making the same mistakes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here on LinkedIn, so feel free to reach out. I\u2019m not the most active poster nor timely replier myself, but I\u2019m working on it \ud83d\ude05",
