    "summary": "I achieve ambitious IT and organizational goals with my teams and promote a comfortable and safe organizational culture. As Head of ICT I manage at operational, tactical and strategic levels and develop robust IT strategies that benefit the success of the organization.\n\nAt renowned companies and organizations such as the Ministry of Defence, Experis Manpower Group, Royal Schiphol Group, ABN-AMRO Bank, Eurailscout Inspection & Analysis B.V. and Ventus, I received and shared a lot of knowledge and experience in the field of IT, business operations and organizational culture. A snapshot of my accumulated knowledge and experience includes:\n\n\u2022 Expertise on working and developing various IT infrastructures, ranging from data centers, ERP and CRM systems. Proficient in a broad spectrum of applications.\n\u2022 Refining work processes using frameworks such as ITIL\u00ae and ISO\u2122.\n\u2022 Managing ICT and security projects of various scales, from modest to complex projects ranging from \u20ac200,000 to more than \u20ac900 million.\n\u2022 Developing forward-looking strategies that focus on both organizational and ICT areas in sectors such as defence, aviation, banking, secondment and railways.\n\u2022 Effective management of departments and Agile teams, including HR tasks;\n\nDriven by my curiosity and perseverance, I obtained a Masters degree (MSc) ICT in Business at Leiden University (2018) and a Bachelors degree (BSc) in Business Informatics (2012). My characteristics also led to following competence-oriented courses, education and training and obtaining various certifications.\n\nGood examples where I learned a lot are a leadership training at the INSEAD Business School in Singapore and courses in Financial Management & FinTech at De Baak and Intuition.com. The certifications I obtained are Agile Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO), Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, Prince2\u00ae Practitioner and ITIL\u00ae IT Service Management Practitioner.\n\nMy most valuable and difficult certification to obtain was in 2020 at the Dutch Academy for Psychotherapy where I was prepped to be a Professional Coach within 7 months. Highly recommended for anyone who is open to self-reflection and wants to help people in an effective way.\n\nFeel free to contact me by phone or e-mail if my knowledge and experience can help you further.\nI'd love to work with you on your success!",
