    "summary": "Director and project developer on strategic and operating studies on food, health, environment and sustainability of a private-sector company, Glen Eastman Food & Health Limited.\n\nI'm a Functional Medicine Certified Health Coach trained on leading, guiding, informing and educating clients on health by supporting and motivating lifestyle change using positive psychology.\n\nI'm an Amen Clinics Certified Brain Health Professional.\n\nI completed a Ph.D. on understanding the physics emerging when an ultra-intense laser pulse interacts with solid materials. Over this project I manage and delegate the work. This involves conducting experimental measurements at national laboratories. I develop 3D CAD drawings with Autodesk Inventor for experimental components to engineer. For data analysis I develop and apply Python and Matlab codes for concise interpretation of the results. In order to understand the results I link these to theoretical predictions as well as computational models using large-scale computer clusters.\n\nFor my interests I am a music composer as well as play guitar, piano, taiko, shinobue, shakuhachi and percussion. I am a health-focused whole-foods cook, sustainability advocate especially for agri-food systems, skilful photographer, lifelong learner, outdoor attic, and interested in language and culture.",

This was achieved by measuring polarised spectral X-ray emission from a warm dense plasma generated using the Vulcan Petawatt Laser. This was achieved by studying the impact of the laser parameters when irradiating polysulphone micro-foils.\n\nA secondary objective to the experiment was to test laser-driven ion acceleration using ultra-thin graphene foils by measuring the energy spectrum using radiographic imaging and solid state nuclear track detectors. By using a range of target thicknesses by effectively stacking individual graphene foils we probed for a range of proton and carbon ion energies distributions.",

This project received funding from the internal collaboratory budget of the Fusion Centre for Doctoral Training program, University of York.\n\nThis project is an independent and personal project conducted upon the acceptance of a successful project proposal, project plan, risk assessment and agreement with the institutes. The tasks in this laboratory astrophysics research area were to investigate the laser-based particle acceleration schemes achievable through laser wakefield acceleration in the bubble regime and ion acceleration using ultra-thin graphene film, as well as the formation of collisionless Weibel instabilities. The primary objective, on which the budget and final project deliveries of a report and presentation were focused on, was on EPOCH particle-in-cell modelling of the graphene as target materials for laser-driven ion acceleration.\n\nThis project was an opportunity to expand and develop on academic and research skills in an international and interdisciplinary context. My knowledge of the EPOCH particle-in-cell code led to me leading a short lecture-style workshop on using the simulation tool to master students at the National Central University. The project extended into my PhD as a new research area and me becoming a leading collaborator of the continuation of the work.",

This laser-solid interaction creating the radiation field is radiation dominated and suggested to emerge via nonlinear Thomson scattering and Bremsstrahlung. We studied this X-ray field using focusing spectrometers with high spatial resolution and radiochromic film to characterise the emission to target thickness, composition and micro-structured topography as well as the laser intensity, contrast and induced energy.",

The work was conducted using the long-pulse laser beams of the Vulcan laser to bombard plastic foils. The bombardment ablates the foils and shots two plasma jets. The jets are magnetized and interact with a mesh grid to transmit magnetic shock waves from opposite directions onto each other for a head-on collision. The collisions amplify the carried magnetic field which replicate astrophysical turbulent systems near the vicinity of supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies. The amplification and shock waves is also believed to drive charged particles to highly relativistic energies comparable to cosmic rays, specifically protons in the experiment. The mechanism for the acceleration is described by second-order Fermi acceleration.\n\nPrinciple Investigator was Prof Gianluca Gregori, University of Oxford\nThe group leader of the experiment was Dr Thomas White (Target Area Operator), University of Oxford.\nThe team consisted of Paul Mabey (Deputy Target Area Operator, University of Oxford), Matthew Oliver (Oxford), Marina K\u00fchn-Kauffeldt (Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr M\u00fcnchen) and Leonard D\u00f6hl (University of York).\nSupporters include Robert Heathcote, Youichi Sakawa, Michel Koenig and the CLF staff.",

This involves conducting and managing experimental investigations at national laboratories, such as the Vulcan Petawatt Laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), in a team and as a team leader. The project has two primary objectives: interpreting the impact of enhanced laser absorption using surface micro-structured silicon targets using X-ray and electron spectroscopy; and development of laser-driven high-energy carbon ion sources using ultra-thin graphene foils and ion radiography and spectroscopy. \n\nOver the course of the project I have co-led experiments at national laboratories and managed my independent computational project abroad with the completion of a successful project proposal and close-up report. I am trained on experimental techniques using sophisticated imaging, alignment and spectroscopic techniques. I successfully completed many experiments in interdisciplinary and international teams. Furthermore I apply EPOCH particle-in-cell simulations as well as atomic modelling on FLYCHK and PrismSPECT codes in order to interpret the physics in experiments. For concise data analysis and diagnostic modelling I develop and apply my own Python and Matlab codes. I present my work at international conferences and institute visits, while networking and leading discussions onsite and via electronic communication.\n\nMy project is part of a collaboration communicating with institutes in UK, Germany, USA, Russia, Taiwan and Japan. This work is funded by the Central Laser Facility, Science Technology Facility Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Doctoral Training.\n\nAmongst extra-curriculum I am a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant supporting undergraduate teaching in the Department of Physics. My role involves leading problem classes, lab demonstrator and assessing student work.",

Experimental work was in a laser hazard zone, for which I became a registered laser user and underwent laser safety training. Used an Andors Classic DX440-BN in a vacuum chamber, imaging x-rays from target interaction with class 4 laser pulses. I employed alignment lasers of class 3B for building optical paths between target to detectors and plasma diagnostic tools. I programmed Python and Matlab codes for the single photon counting analysis, where the Matlab code evaluated the ideal filter thicknesses for peak detection of spectral x-rays from target. The python code evaluated the analysis to determine the temperature at laser-target interaction point, with the aid of importing data through ImageJ.\n\nFurthermore, I worked with Ocean Optic HR2000+ Spectrometer to record Argon gas spectra and compared data against Argon data from the NIST database. The analysis indicated that spectral and intensity calibrations were required. Independently, I used a HG-1 Light calibration source for spectral calibration to reset the wavelength calibration coefficients of the spectrometer using Python coding with the linear regression method to determine the coefficients. I employed a LS-1-CAL-220 calibration source to install an absolute irradiance reading to the spectrometer's memory chip to process and measure intensity in physical units for the intensity calibration. A document about the calibration procedure for future post doctoral training was written.",
