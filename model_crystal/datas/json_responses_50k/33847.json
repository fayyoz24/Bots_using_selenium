    "summary": "Biogeographer and conservation ecologist with a strong practical and academic background in research that aims to better understand how Arctic ecosystems and species respond to climate change and how to protect them. My master\u2019s research contributed to a project of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and used a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in habitat use in Arctic marine mammals as a result of climate change to inform management and conservation efforts.\n\nI am now a PhD candidate at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development and the Center for Complex System Studies for the project 'Tipping the iceberg: leveraging a food transition for Indigenous communities in the Bering Sea'. The project seeks to identify and initiate pathways to a sustainable future food system for Arctic Indigenous communities.\n\nI have extensive field experience, including small boat and ship work and worked in different countries including Germany, Iceland, Finland and Svalbard.\n\nWhen I'm not researching Arctic SES, I'm involved in the climate justice movement - preferably as a climbing activist with Greenpeace.",

At the core of her work stands the belief that discovering the most effective paths to such a future is a bottom-up process, as countless projects worldwide explore how nature and humans can best collaborate. She has collected 500 such examples and assembled them into a hopeful narrative pointing toward an Anthropocene Epoch in which all life thrives. Instances of the good Anthropocene are already here. They just need to be examined, distributed, and connected up to a working whole.",

We take a highly participatory approach and establish a Transformation Lab on St. Paul and St. George Island that involves and empowers community members to identify transformation pathways towards a sustainable future. To gain a systemic understanding of the food system's current structure, we construct a multiple-layer social-ecological network model and analyze interdependencies between key actors of the system and prevailing sustainability issues. We then combine natural and social sciences and explore how the food system is influenced by changes in people's values and paradigms from the past until today. In close collaboration with the local community, we develop positive scenarios of the future food system and pathways towards a more sustainable system state. These pathways are then tested using agent-based modelling to capture the system's dynamics and inform the community's actual interventions. The project aims to gain a holistic understanding of the social-ecological system to identify interdependencies and feedbacks between humans and nature and find key leverage points for sustainability transformation.",
