    "summary": "First and foremost, I'm passionate about biology. Ever since starting to study life sciences in school and understanding how scientific breakthroughs today and in the coming decades will transform the world, I have wanted to be a part of this persistent progress towards discovery and the mastery of health. \n\nAs part of 10x Genomics, I'm daily helping researchers to find the best answers to their scientific problems. Working hand in hand, we are understanding how to get actionable insights into infectious disease or autoimmune disorders, unravel the complexity of tumor heterogeneity, discover new biomarkers, fasten the development of new drugs, etc. Our solutions at 10x combine hardware, chemistry, and software to give single-cell and spatial views of biological systems. Cited in over 2,500 research papers, we have enabled discoveries across multiple fields such as oncology, immunology, and neuroscience.\n\nFinally, I am a proud 10x-er. I have the chance to work side by side with talented and brilliant people who are driven by the same ideals as mine. Together, we work every day on building a strong and effective workplace, while growing an inclusive and caring environment that reflects the goals we serve. The discoveries we make now, as a team, will lead to better technologies, better treatments, and a better future.",

We elaborated training materials (PowerPoint presentations, interactive pedagogical games and activities) in order to make an exhaustive review of GMPs, but also to introduce food handlers to food micro concepts. At the end of the project, we used statistical tools to evaluate the progress of all participants and certify their ability to work in a food facility.\n\nI really appreciated this project because it gave me a deep insight of the food industry requirements in terms of food safety, and helped me improving my communication skills. Working with Laura was a great experience thanks to her commitment and implication in all our common projects!\n",
