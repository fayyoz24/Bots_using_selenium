    "summary": "I am a multidisciplinary researcher in the field of arterial biomechanics, aiming to integrate clinical and engineering research. I am committed to disentangling the problem of arterial stiffening by combining pre-clinical and clinical research. Combining state-of-the-art measurement techniques \u2014 computer controlled bi-axial mechanical testing; high-frequency ultrasound; two-photon microscopy; arterial applanation tonometry; and echo wall tracking \u2014 with constitutive computer modelling enables me to mechanically understand the changes occurring in the ageing artery wall.\n\nWhen I have some time off, I am a passionate traveller, whether it be for hiking, skiing, or simply exploring the world.",

Although the existence of these mechanisms has been shown, their quantitative regulatory role remains largely unknown. The cerebral regulatory system expresses two regulatory properties: cerebral autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. Cerebral autoregulation ensures that, while mean arterial blood pressure changes, cerebral blood flow is maintained at a constant, demand-based level. Neurovascular coupling increases cerebral blood flow with increased brain activity. I aim to develop a mathematical model of cerebral blood flow regulation based on physiological mechanisms to gain insight in how these mechanisms contribute to cerebral blood flow regulation. In order to do so, I performed measurements on healthy volunteers using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and finger plethysmography. In these measurements, autoregulation is stimulated using repeated squat-stand manoeuvres whereas neurovascular coupling is evoked by visual stimulation.",
