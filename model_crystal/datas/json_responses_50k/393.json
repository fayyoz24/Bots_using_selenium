            "description": "Conventional fixed-wing aircraft nowadays encounter the separation of airflow around the wing. This is because the fixed-wing airfoils are optimally designed to cope with only one flight condition parameter, such as altitude, Mach number and aircraft weight, while these parameters normally vary during the flight. As a consequence, these flight conditions are sub-optimal in a whole range of operating flight condition. Flow separations around the airfoils in sub-optimal conditions during flights can be reduced or delay by the application of smart actuators. \n\nThe smart actuators within this project are piezoelectric composite materials-based actuators. The actuators are manufactured through the composite manufacturing concept and statically and dynamically tested.  \n\nApart from the static and dynamic experiments, finite element models have been developed to predict the static and dynamic behavior. The finite element models were developed from COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2.",

                    "description": "My research has focused on developing morphing actuators (thermoplastic surfaces that are able to change their shape by the controlled contraction of embedded SMA wires).\n\nThe first part of the research consisted of finding the maximum working frequency of the SMA wires when actuated cyclically. This working frequency depends on the electric power applied to the Joule heated SMA wires and on the forced convective airflow used to cool them down rapidly. Afterwards, a novel method to increase the working frequency without increasing neither the power supplied nor the cooling rate was developed. This novel method was the greatest achievement of the first part of the research.\n\nThe second part of the research focused on the design, manufacture, assembly and control of the SMA based actuator. A mould was designed and manufactured to create the morphing surface. The wires were embedded into empty channels that allowed to drive a controlled airflow around the SMA wires, which were embedded in such channels as well. Finally, two types of controllers were applied to the actuator, PID and Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs). Both controllers (especially FLCs) showed the potential of the SMA based actuator to track properly reference signals up to 1 Hz. Actuation frequencies of 1 Hz were achieved with a relative low error (<10%). Actuation frequencies up to 10 Hz were achieved with higher error. These actuation frequencies were the greates achievment of the second part of the research.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nDescription of the PhD topic: http://goo.gl/mAvTq6 \n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nDuring my PhD, I have supervised:\n\u25ba 2 Master Thesis students.\n\u25ba 1 Bachelor Thesis Student.\n\u25ba 2 Internship Student.\n\u25ba I have also tutored a group of 8 students in the course AE2222-I, \"Test, Analysis and Simulation\", in which students analyze real experimental data by means of MATLAB, draw conclusions and write a scientific report.",
