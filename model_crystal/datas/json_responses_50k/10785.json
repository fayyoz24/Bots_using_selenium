    "summary": "Since 2000 I am working as a sales professional in the software industry. Through roles in partner management, sales operations, key account management and strategic customer programs, I have gained experiences in various elements of the IT software business. During my years as Global Account Director I have focussed on building strategic partnerships with companies like Unilever, Philips, FrieslandCampina, Heineken and ASML. In 2018 and 2019 I was part of the Platinum Customer Unit (PCU) at SAP as the Sales & Strategy lead. The PCU has a clear focus on building mutually beneficial partnerships with our (20) most strategic (global) customers. This to become a true business partner and trusted innovator for these leading global brands. Since January 2020 I have joined the SAP Netherlands Management Team as Sales Director Strategic Accounts. In this role I am responsible for managing a team of Sales Professionals that take care of customers like Shell, Unilever, Philips, Heineken and ASML.\n \nBesides my business interests I am currently focused on my Master (MSc) program at Middlesex University in London. As part of this program I am exploring the value of purpose driven partnerships and how Millennials and GenZ look at companies as potential clients and/or employees. Furthermore I enjoy coaching my daughters hockey team and playing golf and hockey myself.\n\nSpecialties: Purpose driven, Shared values, Growth mindset, Digital, Marketing & Sales, Operations, Demand Generation, Board Sponsorship Program, Strategic Partnerships, Account Management, Coaching, Managing the eco-system, Cloud, Unilever, ASML, Philips, SAP, High Tech, Consumer Products, SAP Masters MsC.",
