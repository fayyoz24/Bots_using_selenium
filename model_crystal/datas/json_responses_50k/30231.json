This means supporting and troubleshooting the optical alignment as well as the amplification and metrology system to ensure the laser beam has the right properties when reaching the tin droplets. \n\nBeing first line support also means I become owner of the technical issues and escalations when a system is blocked from progress, meaning I take the lead and become the central party amongst all stakeholders. Coordinating escalations is therefore a central part of my job.\n\nThe position has given me good and hands-on knowledge within: \n\n\u00b7        Laser optics and laser metrology\n\n\u00b7        Being in the lead and coordinate escalations for systems being blocked from progress in production or during customer installation\n\n\u00b7        Troubleshooting under pressure",
