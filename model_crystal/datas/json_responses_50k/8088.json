    "summary": "I\u2019m an experienced Senior Researcher with a demonstrated history of working in international affairs and sustainability. My passion for socioeconomic development has driven me to assess the world's leading technology companies as part of the world's first Digital Inclusion Benchmark. I lead company engagement and curate a list of the world's 2000 most influential companies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Before this, my journey included leading randomised control trials with J-Pal in South Africa as a Senior Research analyst; and traveled through Southern and East Africa profiling and showcasing the work of youth entrepreneurs with the Building Bridges Foundation. Through this experience, I have honed my skills in sustainability research, quantitative economics, data analysis, policy analysis and project management in Africa and Europe.",

At the end of each country visit, a multi-stakeholder event was held where entrepreneurs presented their lived case studies and discussions were held to propose better youth-focused policies. \n\nI worked as a Project Manager and Researcher where I conducted country level desk and field research in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. The outcomes of the study were presented at the Second High-Level Meeting for the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in Kenya. The research output was published as a book and a research report in collaboration with the UN SDG Action Campaign.",
