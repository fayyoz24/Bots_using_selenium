    "summary": "Employer Branding has it all. During a summer course in 2017 I figured it out. 'This is it'. The combination of strategy, data, experiences, brand, content. A perfect balance between marketing and HR knowledge and skills. And today, I enjoy working in this field of expertise even more than I could imagine. \n\n8+ years in HR but at least 6 years in Employer Branding, Recruitment Marketing, Talent Attraction, Employee Experience. Each company, and industry, has it's own challenges and opportunities. Never a dull moment and there's huge potential for companies to improve and create exceptional experiences - for candidates and employees. \n\nFor me, finding the right partnerships (internal and external) is key to create a long-term, positive impression to attract the right talent. I have experience in medical devices, automotive and retail industry. And I'm not done learning. So, are you in the same field or like to share experiences, I'd love to connect.",
