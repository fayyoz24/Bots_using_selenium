    "summary": "Hi! My name is Myrthe, I am an HR professional with 10 years of international experience and a master degree in leadership & management. I like being close to the core of the business, understand strategic objectives, and translate this to people topics. I like to work together with colleagues and build strong relationships with the business, which makes it easier to advice, challenge, and influence. Naturally I am energetic and I bring a \u201clet\u2019s do it\u201d attitude to work.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nMy personal values are empathy, justice, and freedom. I am passionate and knowledgeable about DEI. It\u2019s a continuous learning process, I am always curious to learn more and confront my own biases and actions. Last year, I wrote my master thesis about gender representation in the technology industry. In my HRBP role at TomTom I grew into a DEI advocate and became a linking pin between HR teams and the business. I took action to ensure that DEI is part of the HRBP scope, using people data to analyze the HR cycles (promotions, 9-box calibrations, and pay delivery) and confront biases where needed. I also wrote data-driven and evidence-based proposals for company-wide OKRs (objectives and key results), pitching and launching a sponsorship pilot program to grow careers of women in tech (with senior leadership buy-in and active participation), and actively advocated for DEI actions with senior leadership e.g. about their use of inclusive language (with positive results).",
