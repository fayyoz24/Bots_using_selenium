Through our research on Sri Lanka, we put out one of the most comprehensive documentations of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelams\u2019s forced recruitment of child soldiers. For both these reports, I had to travel through areas which were still in the midst of armed conflict.",

I have covered the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Nepal extensively, and have led research into allegations of sexual violence during the armed conflict in Nepal. Our research on this topic led to the publication of the first international report covering sexual violence during the Nepali conflict.

I was the primary investigator and researcher in the \u201cFoca\u201d cases, a landmark case which resulted in the indictment, prosecution and eventual imprisonment of 8 paramilitary leaders and supporters from a town in eastern Bosnia. This was the first such prosecution and conviction exclusively for sexual violence crimes under international criminal law. I worked closely with victims and witnesses through all stages, from the recording of their experiences through their eventual testimonials in court. There were many difficult processes along the way, from the more mundane steps of finding the victims (many of whom were scattered refugees by the time I began researching) to earning their trust, earning their trust in the justice process, and standing by them as they testified in court. I worked closely with victims and witnesses protection units through the entire process, and am very familiar with the range of issues involved. \nI also worked with the victims and witnesses of sexual violence as they testified in command responsibility cases, based on their testimonies in the \u201cFoca\u201d case.\nIn addition to the sexual violence cases, I also worked on other cases at the tribunal, including the case against President Slobodan Milosevic. \nThe work of our \u201cFoca\u201d team has been the feature of a documentary entitled \u201cWomen, War and Peace.\u201d",
