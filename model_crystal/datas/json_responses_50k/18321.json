            "description": "I designed an intervention for dementia caregivers in Germany which aimed to reduce their risk of enduring physical aggression from their patients. \nTo achieve this, with my group, I first performed a literary review and a problem analysis of the current caregiver experience in Germany. Then, I did a behavioral analysis and an analysis of determinants to establish the causes of a caregiver's maladaptive coping with aggressive behaviors from dementia patients. The causes found were caregivers having low self-esteem, having low levels of empathy, holding a negative attitude against dementia patients and having low levels of perceived self-efficacy in coping with dementia patient aggression. Next, I chose the methods and strategies to use in the intervention, targeting each of the causes found. Finally, I developed a multilevel training program for dementia caregivers named 'AiCope'. The program included emotion-focused communication training, coping mechanism training via virtual reality, and large-group capacitation sessions.",
