    "summary": "After my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering in Hong Kong and my PDEng degree in Instrumentation  in TU Eindhoven, I have gained solid background on Research and Development (R&D) of production processes for packaging of photonic chips. My projects are combinations of experimental work and modelling. That leads to my capabilities on Design of Experiment (DoE), data analysis, proposing design algorithms and simulation with various tools like ANSYS and Matlab. With good analytical thinking, I can break down and study technical problems systematically. In the past five years, I have been working on the developing of photonic chip packaging technology, covering the scope from packaging design to transferring to production, both photonic and electronic parts of packaging. That involves taking existing and potential packaging technologies into account, bringing in equipment and machinery at the right point of time. That also involves optimization of corresponding photonic chip packaging processes. The technologies have been implemented in the packaging foundry of Photonfirst. With deep insight into packaging capabilities, I take proactive actions regarding various packaging requests from external customers, evaluate the packaging feasibility and formulate statement of work for packaging projects.",
