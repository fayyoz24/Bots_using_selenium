    "summary": "I was a research assistant at Amsterdam UMC, where I worked on a project collaborated between AUMC and CLTL for improving the performance of existing classifiers for patient's functioning using medical notes and electronic health records. I have a master's degree in linguistics and text mining NLP from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nMy expertise lies in applying natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as prompt engineering, data augmentation, and machine learning, to unstructured data. I have hands-on experience in creating, developing, and testing methods for generating synthetic data using GPT-3.5 through API, and fine-tuning two RoBERTa-based models along real data sets. I also have skills in data engineering and data analysis.\n\nBefore joining Amsterdam UMC, I was a director and senior manager of store design at Gap Inc., where I managed a team of designers that expanded the business from 8 to 20 clients with a growth of over 300+ retail stores in 5 years. I collaborated with other functions to achieve project completion expectations, supported teams by providing innovative approaches on strategic planning and on-site challenges, and led global design guideline review that resulted in 30% cost savings.\n\n\nMy goal is to leverage my interdisciplinary background and experience in NLP and AI to solve real-world problems and create value for society. I am passionate about learning new technologies and methods, and collaborating with diverse and talented teams. I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to challenging and meaningful projects in the fields of healthcare, education, or social good.",
