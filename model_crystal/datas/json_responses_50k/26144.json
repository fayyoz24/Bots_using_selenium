During the study trip, you come into contact with foreign (chemical) companies and universities and get an insight of their activities.\n\nI gained the opportunity to work on a case study for Cabot Corporation Rotterdam about CO2 capturing technologies which was very interesting and subsequently funded the study trip partially.\n\nThe study trip itself went to North-America. We traveled from Boston to New York, Washington, Toronto, Montreal and Quebec. Visits were arranged at Shell Techworks, DSM Coating Resins, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, LyondellBasell - Equistar Chemicals Newark, BASF Canada, McGill University, HydroQuebec, Cascades Engineering.",
