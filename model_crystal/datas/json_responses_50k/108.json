As a group, we created Lucy's, a family-owned fast food chain inspired by the American diner concept, with a healthy and ecological menu. According to our project, the company has a solid establishment in the Netherlands and Germany and will expand to Chile in the near future.\n\nThe expansion plan had to focus on the logistics, marketing, law and financial aspect of the company, both in the Netherlands and Germany as well as in the expansion plan designed for the Chilean market. \n\nMy role in this group was the \"operations manager\", which meant I did not have an assigned department, but rather supported group members where necessary and was responsible for creating the meeting minutes and the final deliverables.
