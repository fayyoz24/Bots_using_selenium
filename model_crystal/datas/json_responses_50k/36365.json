    "summary": "Holding B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and over 28 years of professional experience.  \nFirst 9 years as a structural/bridge engineer involved in design,  inspection, and rehab of highway bridges in the US (states of NY and UT).  Acquired his PE license in 1998 (currently expired).  \nSwitched to Oil & Gas and petrochemicals in 2000 as a pipe stress engineer.  Employed at FLUOR's Amsterdam office since 2009 as a lead pipe stress engineer.  Involved in numerous large scale Lump Sum Turn Key and Reimbursable type plant design projects.  Most projects based on ASME B31.3 and EN 13480 codes.  Working knowledge of WRC, BPVC, API, and NEMA codes pertaining to static, fired, centrifugal and reciprocating type rotary equipment.  Fully proficient in usage of CAESAR II software and also working experience with Autopipe 9.6 version. \nHe is quite experienced in generating project specifications for FEED and EPC projects on Flexibility Analysis and related subjects such as Pipe Support Standards, Spec. for Allowable Loads on Equipment and Vessel nozzles.  Other duties as lead Stress Engineer included providing man-hour estimates for the task force, scheduling of Flexibility Analysis based project deliverables, allocating tasks within Stress team and overseeing activities.\nOther strong points as a pipe stress specialist are experience with pipework in vibrating services, generation and implantation of technical bulletins for Screening of piping for Acoustic & Flow Induced Vibration (AIV/FIV), mitigation of piping systems at risk of AIV/FIV, field trouble shooting, theoretical knowledge of sources of vibration in piping systems, handling construction queries, Transport analysis of piping in Pre-Assembled Modules, and developing practicable engineering solutions by relying on his diverse background in both piping and structural engineering.",
