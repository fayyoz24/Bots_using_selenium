    "summary": "I am a motivated and passionate Master's student specializing in Economic Development and International Relations, currently in the final stages of completing my research thesis in Development Economics. Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of studying and working in multiple countries, including Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, which has broadened my perspective and enriched my understanding of global issues. As a result, I am adept at navigating diverse cultural contexts and collaborating effectively with individuals from different backgrounds.\n\nBeing raised in an Italian-Filipino household, I have also developed since a young age great adaptability skills and a deep appreciation for multiculturalism. While growing up, I was as well exposed to multiple languages. Thus, I have developed perfect fluency in Italian, English and Filipino. Moreover, I have good knowledge of French and Spanish, and basic knowledge of Norwegian. This linguistic versatility enables me to communicate and connect effortlessly with individuals from various cultures, facilitating cross-cultural collaboration and understanding.\n\nDriven by my natural curiosity, creativity, and passion, I approach my academic and professional pursuits with enthusiasm and dedication. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of development and international relations. In particular, I am passionate about development economics, sustainability, education and culture, migration, and international cooperation. I am excited to leverage my diverse experiences and expertise to contribute meaningfully to organizations and initiatives that drive positive change on a global scale.",
