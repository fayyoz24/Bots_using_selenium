    "summary": " Gordon has 20+ years\u2019 experience in risk modelling, data science and machine learning. He currently works at Stater  with focus on developing machine learning and AI  models for the mortgage industry.  He worked more than 15 years on risk modelling such as IFRS 9, Basel and Solvency II compliant models (PD, LGD and EAD), credit risk scoring model, prepayment model, fraud risk model. These models are used by a number of leading mortgage lenders. \nGordon has deep knowledge in machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms. His publication 20 years ago on neural networks is still referenced in present day research. His experience in data science covers the full life cycle of modelling including model conception, model design, data preparation, statistical modelling, validation, annual review, model update and monitoring and model governance.\nGordon has worked at Norkom Technology, Shell and the University of Leiden.  He has developed a number of machine learning algorithms, models and business applications in the area of customer behavior modelling and pattern recognition for industrial data. He has published a total of 16 articles in leading scientific journals in that period.\nGordon holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Washington.\n",

My publication on the effect of adding noise to neural networks is still being referenced in today\u2019s scientific research.\nDeveloped and prototyped several pattern recognition applications of neural networks including the automatic recognition of events from seismic signals.\n Pioneered research of convolutional neural networks applied to the inversion of well log signals. Convolution neural networks form the basis in present time deep learning applications.\nManaged extramural neural network research projects at Leiden University and Radboud University Nijmegen and supervised several M.Sc. thesis projects of students.",
