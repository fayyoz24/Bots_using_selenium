    "summary": "Mahda Foroughi is an urban planner, data scientist, and researcher who combines digital technology, public participation, and cultural heritage to create inclusive and sustainable urban solutions. She pursued a Ph.D. in Architecture and Technology at Technische Universiteit Delft, where she explores how big data analytics, machine learning, natural language processing, and information repositories (e.g., social media platforms) can facilitate consensus-building and public involvement in heritage management.\n\nShe has over four years of experience as an architect and urban designer, working on various projects in Iran that involved participatory tools, analysis-based design, and text mining. As the head of a participation project in a historic neighborhood in Tehran, she used focus group meetings, interviews, and gamification techniques to involve residents in the design and management process.  As a PhD researcher, she identified collective cultural values and attributes for the conservation and development of energy-efficient ventilation systems in urban neighborhoods in Yazd, using social media posts, literature, and policy documents as data sources. She is passionate about applying her skills and knowledge to address urban challenges and foster social inclusion and cultural diversity.\n\nCheck out my personal website for more details about me: https://mahdaforoughi7.wixsite.com/mahdaforoughi",

My Ph.D. currently entitles \"consensus building and public participation in Cultural Heritage Management. \" It aims to facilitate public inclusion in heritage management using available unstructured textual data sources, namely, social media, literature, and policy documents. In this study, digitalization is accrued in the data source, analytical tools, and data management. As the data source, this research uses social media posts from Instagram and Twitter. As analytical tools, various Natural language processing techniques are also used for the analysis of the study. The central part of the research is adopting the Bert model, a pre-trained neural network model, to code the posts' content  (sentences and hashtags) to extract the heritage attributes and values and their typologies. The codes are implemented in Python through PyTorch. Lastly, a relational database is created in SQL, and data analytics are implemented there.",
