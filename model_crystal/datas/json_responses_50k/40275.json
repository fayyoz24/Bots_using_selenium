    "summary": "Starting out as a ship refrigeration engineer, bringing tropical fruits from the Caribbean to Europe, I got more and more interested in refrigeration and food technology. Now around 25 yrs later I am still in this dynamic and ever changing industry. After more than 15 yrs consultative selling of large industrial refrigeration installations in the food and leisure industry world-wide, my focus increasingly is pointing towards advising about energy efficiency and total cost of ownership. For me this is an integral approach towards designing a refrigeration installation, ranging from the (food)production process, logistical food chain to the refrigeration installation and heat recovery. This approach I have applied successfully in beer breweries, malteries, ice cream factories and a range of other food applications. The solutions entail refrigeration installations working on NH3 or CO2 (Sub/Trans critical) and where appropiate heat pumps, with the main aim reducing the operating costs, CO2 foot print and assuring food safety. I also train colleagues from the Asian offices in refrigeration and consultative selling and I have written several booklets explaining the basic theory of refrigeration and compressors and best practises in food technology, cold chains and in meat cooling and freezing.
