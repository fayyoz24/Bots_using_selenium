Our goal was to identify how the behavior of C. elegans changed during aging and then test whether lifespan-altering mutations affect the 'healthspan' of C. elegans, as measured by their motile behavior. I supervised a bachelor student (Jana Koers) who performed the first pilot experiment and a masters student (Esther Lohrmann) who extended the work to develop a story for publication. Since this experiment generated terabytes of raw data and millions of data points each day, it was necessary to automate the data analysis I had previously done manually and modify the custom data processing software I wrote to run efficiently on high-performance computing systems.",

Although many studies have provided insight on lifespan extension, how behavior is altered during aging remains poorly understood. Therefore, a quantitative approach that examines both lifespan and behavior is necessary to give more insight into the aging process. To study behavior with age, we chose Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. We analyzed wild type and three insulin/ IGF-like signaling (IIS) pathway mutants, all with the same genetic background. Here we report a method that analyzes the behavior of individual worms on E. coli. This method has no influence on lifespan expectancy and gives highly reproducible results. This data indicates that behavioral changes during aging are occurring in the same time frame for these four strains independently of lifespan. Furthermore, feeding these four strains B. subtilis, that is considered healthier, results in a similar decay in behavior but increases the mean speed at day 1.\nThis suggests that behavioral changes during aging are an independent process from the traditionally considered lifespan extension by mutations in the IIS pathway.\n\nTechniques: C. elegans maintenance, Lifespan analysis, Imaging, Python, Quantitative analysis",

                    "description": "Peroxisomes play an important role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. The importance of peroxisomes in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation is emphasized by the existence of a number of peroxisomal genetic diseases, in which the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation is impaired. Recently a new peroxisomal disorder has been identified, which is caused by mutations in the ABCD5 gene. The protein involved, called ABCD5, is a member of the acyl-CoA bindings protein (ACB) family and located on the peroxisomal membrane. Although the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in ABCD5 deficient cell line suggests a role for ABCD5 in the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation, no experimental evidence is available to substantiate this. To study the function of ACBD5, we choose Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model system. An important advantage of such study is that peroxisomes are the exclusive site of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Earlier work has shown that uptake of fatty acids into peroxisomes may occur through two routes, either as free fatty acid via diffusion or as an acyl-CoA ester. Here we report that expression of ACBD5 has no influence on the \u03b2-oxidation activity in wild-type yeast cells. The mutant phenotype of the homologous of ACBD5 in yeast, Acb1, shows an impaired oleate \u03b2-oxidation activity, which can be partially rescued by ACBD5. This data indicates that ABCD5 can function as an acyl-CoA binding protein in the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation, with a metabolic role in the acyl-CoA transport route. Next to that, expression of ABCD5 in yeast promotes the proliferation of peroxisomes not only in wild type cells, but also in cells deficient in peroxisomal proliferation, pex11\u0394. This suggests that, next to a role in fatty acid metabolism, ACBD5 also has a function in the peroxisomal biogenesis.\n\nTechniques: Recombant DNA techniques, plasmid transformation, sequencing, PCR, Beta oxidation with radioactive label, Nycodenz gradi\u00ebnt (sub cellular fractionation), SDS page, Western blot",

However, failure of medical devices caused by adverse immune reactions due to bio-incompatibility and biomaterial-associated infection (BAI) forms a serious problem for an increasing number of patients. Biomaterial-associated infections are predominantly caused by two major pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These bacteria are able to colonize the surfaces of indwelling or implanted biomaterials eventually leading to biofilm formation, shielding the bacteria from host immune cells and severely impair antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the biomaterial-dependent local impairment of the immune response allows the bacteria to colonize the peri-implant tissue where they are able to reside inside macrophages, thereby forming a reservoir for reoccurring infections. In order to combat these infections a fundamental understanding of the molecular processes involved in the host-pathogen interaction in the course of a biomaterial-associated infections is crucial. Here we describe the development of an in vitro assay for the co-analysis of host and pathogen transcriptomes. As proof of concept we set up a phagocytosis assay using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells in combination with Staphylococcus aureus. RNA of intracellular bacteria was successfully isolated and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of selected genes demonstrating the feasibility to perform transcriptome analyses on intracellular bacteria.\n\nTechniques: Cell culturing of macrophage, Phagocytosis assay, Primer design Real Time PCR,\nImageJ",
