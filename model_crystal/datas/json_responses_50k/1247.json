    "summary": "Being an engaged scholar, I strive to connect research, education and practice of entrepreneurship. I teach and research entrepreneurial processes and thinking, both in new ventures and in existing companies. I also stood at the origins of the UG Center of Entrepreneurship and a business accelerator VentureLab North at the University of Groningen. I am actively involved with startups and existing (family) businesses in the region and internationally, both directly and through various committees (NWO, King Willem I Prijs).\n\nMy teaching is currently focused on entrepreneurship for non-business students - medical sciences, biomedical engineering and PhD students of the Univeristy Medical Center. In the last 10 years I've taught courses on Technology based entrepreneurship, New venture creation, Business Diagnosis, Small business, International entrepreneurship, and Strategic management. This experience allows me to be confident with both, large and small groups, at Bsc, Msc, PhD and executive levels. Both, online or offline I strive to deliver an interactive and enriching experience. I mentor individual Master and PhD projects and project assignments on business diagnosis and creation. I have experience working with entrepreneurs and existing businesses - I continue to work with the Venturelab North as a trainer on entrepreneurial process and thinking. I also love working with business development teams and with MNE executives helping them understand the organizational culture for entrepreneurship and apply the concepts to the specifics of their organizations.\n\nI am an experienced speaker on entrepreneurship, yet my love for teaching it is not limited to just being in class. I design and (co)organize various educational & research-oriented events. This can be on demand workshops (e.g. Entrepreneurship for Precision medicine network or Corporate entrepreneurship for managers), short bootcamps (e.g. Health VentureLab Weekend), week-long programs (such as Summer Schools), as well as scientific conferences. I bring my knowledge of the topic of business development and entrepreneurship, organizational skills, ability to learn in the new environment and a network of speakers and coaches to the table. I also have a broad international project experience with Latin America, Europe, India and China. I've worked within EIT Health & Erasmus+ both as a participant and as a work package leader.",

Corporate entrepreneurship: How do large companies organize new business creation and what are the systems that can be put in place for employees to develop their initiatives and business ideas. \n2. Healthcare entrepreneurship, especially orphan drug development.\nOur latest publication can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120333 \n\nMy teaching is currently focused on teaching entrepreneurship for non-business students at Graduate School Medical Sciences, International Master in Innovative Medicines, and MSc Biomedical Engineering.\nSince my start in 2013, I've taught such courses as Technology based entrepreneurship, New venture creation, Business Diagnosis, Minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Small business and entrepreneurship, International entrepreneurship, and Strategic management. I've mentored numerous master thesis projects and co-supervised a PhD student. \n\nApart from my teaching responsibilities, I co-organize various educational events, such as, for example, Health VentureLab Weekend. I also have a broad project experience with international projects, such as EIT Health E-train,  Thapar University (India) \"teach the teacher\" program, and Erasmus+ LISTO project with 10 universities in EU and LATAM on developing an International Virtual Classroom on Innovation and Entrepreneurship.",
