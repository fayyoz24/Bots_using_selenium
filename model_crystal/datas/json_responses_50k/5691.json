    "summary": "I have graduated with a Masters in Public Policy and Human Development, specializing in climatic risks/vulnerabilities in September 2022. My research involved mapping and predicting the factors that contribute to human-wildlife conflicts with large mammals in six Canadian national parks.\n\nTo gain practical hands-on experience, I pursued a wildlife conservation internship in Costa Rica and later volunteered at a nature reserve in my hometown. From May 2023, I am working as a Policy Officer for Spatial Planning and Nature at Natuur en Milieufederatie Limburg. In this role, I represent the provincial interests of Limburg in promoting sustainable practices, nature, and biodiversity in the constant fight for space. Ultimately, my goal is to ensure that protecting nature, and wildlife is a self-evident and valued consideration in the actions of citizens, administrators, and entrepreneurs. \n\nAlongside my work, I am an active communication/event volunteer at the European Young Rewilders Network, and a local nature reserve where I promote and raise awareness for wildlife and nature conservation.\n\nI am passionate about conserving natural resources and wildlife. Please feel free to connect with me to learn more about my work or to discuss potential collaborations.",
