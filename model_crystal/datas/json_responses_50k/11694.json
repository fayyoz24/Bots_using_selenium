    "summary": "My name is Yohn Cheung, a young professional working in the Netherlands. Currently working for Evoke. \n\nSince 2019 working as a Front-end engineer, namely working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, and Quasar. \n\nBesides my front-end knowledge, I have experience in back-end development and UI/UX design. If you find yourself coming up short in these areas, I can bring my capabilities. I have an analytical approach to make sure that every step in the process is well thought-out. If there is a new trend emerging that can benefit web development and/or a new technology is emerging, I can dive in and learn about the subject and share it with the team.\n\nMore info: https://github.com/yohn-cheung",

WeChat Mini Programs are \"mini\napplications\" built within the WeChat ecosystem, eliminating the need to download a separate program.\n\nTo ensure success, I first familiarized myself with the WeChat Mini Program style guide.

After consulting with the manager, the WeChat\nMini Program for Dezan Shira & Associates was developed.\n\nWeChat Mini Program development involves the use of WXML, WXSS, which are specific markup and\nstyling languages used to define the structure and style of the mini program's interface. WXML and WXSS are the counterparts of HTML and CSS. Additionally, JavaScript is also utilized in the development\nprocess.\n\nOverall, my involvement in this project showcases my ability to adapt to platform-specific guidelines,\ndesign user-friendly interfaces, and implement features using appropriate technologies within a Chinese\nwork environment and in compliance with IT regulations.",

My task was to develop a dashboard\nthat automatically generates reports based on the measured data.\n\nSince the project involved working with measured data, it was crucial to present the information in a way\nthat coaches and players could easily understand. I conducted a study to find the best data visualizations\nfor displaying the measured data.\n\nBased on the result, I created a clickable prototype for user experience (UX) interviews, following the\nDesign Sprint methodology by Google Ventures. The valuable feedback received from these interviews\nallowed me to iterate and improve the initial design of the dashboard.\n\nNext, I built the dashboard using Bootstrap and Laravel frameworks. To make the data visually appealing,\nI used the D3.js library, which allows for dynamic and interactive data visualizations. The measured data\nwas stored in a database, using phpMyAdmin and MySQL for store management and getting the required\ndata.\n\nRecreational club coaches have found this product valuable as it enables them to make better\nassessments of players by combining the measured data with their own insights.\n\nOverall, my involvement in this project allowed me to apply my skills in UI/UX design and web\ndevelopment while contributing to the enhancement of performance monitoring in the sports domain.",
