In my role as Press Officer, I actively helped the board to convince local municipalities to give financial aid. When those negotiations failed, I designed the 'Word Held' (become a hero) campaign. After I presented my concept and proposition to the board and getting a 'go', I designed pamphlets, posters, and online imagery. In collaboration with my brother, the website wordheld.nl was designed. On this site, donating was easy and people received tips, tricks and materials on how to set up their own charity event.\n\nThe campaign and the activities of many passionate volunteers have had succes: the shelter re-opened on the 1st of July 2017. After my two years as the Press Officer, I've continued to volunteer every saturday with all the hands-on work in 't Julialaantje.\n",

'Babana' meaning 'Brothers' in the aboriginal language, my brother and I joined forced in this company. Through Babana we've met a diverse group of clients, each with their unique wishes. \n\nBabana continuously forced me to step up my game, learn and evolve. With success I must conclude, since most of our clients learned about us through word-of-mouth. However, as of 2015, Babana Media is solely used as platform for cool challenges we want to tackle in our spare time.\n\nAmongst things that I've created are:\n\n\u2022 Accessible and appealing infographics about complicated subsidies\n\u2022 Animated music videos for headliner bands\n\u2022 Company logos\n\u2022 Many, many flyers and print adverts",

I often also photograph their pets with my DLSR camera and shoot videos of them. First impressions counts, so a good photo or video really helps them to get adopted sooner.\n\nFurthermore, from October 2012 to Februari 2015 I was part of the shelter's PR-team (also on voluntary basis). I used my knowledge on communication and graphical skills to help promoting our animals. During this period of time I also took the role of Press Officer on me. This meant I was a first point of contact for media and continuously supplied stories from the shelter to media."
