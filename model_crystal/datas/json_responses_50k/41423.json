    "summary": "It is my aim to create a high-quality technical product or service that has a concrete added value for the world, in close cooperation with a professional team. I have wide experience with applied science, software development, system integration, project management and technical account management in an international setting. My contribution to converting a research department into a commercial company has been significant. Preferably I work as a technical project manager in a multidisciplinary environment with a focus on software engineering and product development.\n\nMy background in applied physics proved to be of value in other work areas as well, such as software development, image processing and machine learning. I am able to acquire quickly a profound understanding of a complex system, product or technique \u2013 high-level or in detail when necessary.  I combine these analytical and scientific capabilities with empathy and communication skills. Moreover I am both quality aware and results-driven: I have an eye for detail while keeping an overview of the big picture.\n\nI am the bridge between the sales and engineering department by translating scientific content into added value for the customer, while keeping an eye on both business requirements and human aspects. I accomplish synergy in cooperation within a team and between parties. My deliverables are of high-quality, on-time and the result of team work. I follow and define quality procedures, but I can also be pragmatic when needed. Moreover I establish sustainable account relationships based on customer satisfaction. ",
