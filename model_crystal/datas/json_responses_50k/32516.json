    "summary": "An MBA and a Chemical Engineer who is passionate about Sustainability. With a rich experience in Project Management, Business Development and Operational Excellence, I have designed and delivered strategic projects for both private and public sectors. Set-up and expanded a US multinational in India by implementing end-to-end technical projects for Oil & Gas Upstream and Downstream customers. Have designed and set-up plants, improved process efficiencies and executed large-scale change-management programs.\n\nHighly perseverant to succeed in fast-changing and ambiguous situations. Skilled in collaborating with cross-functional teams to execute projects timely, within scope and budget. Practicing empathy has helped me in better collaboration, leading teams and effective conflict resolution. \n\nI am an optimist and believe that one should live in the circle of influence (things that we can control) rather than in the circle of concern (things that are beyond our control). I love traveling and exploring unexplored places.",
