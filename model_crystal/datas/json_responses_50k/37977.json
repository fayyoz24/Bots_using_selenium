    "summary": "I am a former producer of theatre festival hosting international festivals for children and young people at ASSITEJ KOREA. In less than 1 year, I have learned and worked on organising performance arts festival for children and how to plan, produce, re-create, and continue it during this pandemic period, and especially transformed into online festival.   \n\nMy interest is to organise performance arts festivals for everyone and produce novel and innovative theatre plays which the audiences can engage. After experiencing pandemic crisis, the online and distance festival or performances became very important part in art sector.  Thanks to my academic backgrounds and experiences such as arts management, social science, and filming, I can open a new chapter and new normal in performances arts sector by combining digital skills and artistic values.",
