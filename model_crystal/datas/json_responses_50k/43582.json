Such phases can be used in integrated optics. \n\nMoreover, I worked on the thermal anisotropic properties of twist-bend and ferroelectric nematic phases. This could help in better understanding of such exotic phases.

Liquid crystals are best known for their application as displays (LCD: liquid crystal display). These liquid crystals can change their properties depending on factors like temperature and pressure.\n\nIn my research work, I focused on a specific type of liquid crystal called bent-core liquid crystals. These materials can naturally form periodic patterns without any surface engineering, making them useful for creating diffraction gratings that can be used in beam steering devices and integrated photonics. This project was done in collaboration with the University of Maribor in Slovenia, where I did mathematical modeling, and the University of Warsaw in Poland, where I conducted experiments.\n\nThroughout my research, I worked closely with various teams, both within and outside my organization. I also had the opportunity to work on a related project involving Langmuir-Blodgett films at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, within their soft condensed matter group.",
