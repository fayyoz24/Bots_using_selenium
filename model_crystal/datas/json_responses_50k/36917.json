    "summary": "I'm passionate about what I see as my mission: to help transform our global economy to a truly sustainable one. \u2028\u2028Though I won\u2019t deny the size of the challenge, I do get inspired by the increasing number of people who recognize what is necessary, and push the boundaries of what is possible. \n\nOver the last 25 years, I have been privileged to work on sustainability across the globe. I worked for almost a decade in various management positions at WWF (the conservation organization) and three years for IFC (the private sector investment bank of the World Bank Group) in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA biologist by training and background, the last two decades have made me a more rounded sustainability strategist. I've gained expertise on the financial sector, supply chains and social issues, and my work on different continents and three years in Dakar have opened windows to other cultures. Biodiversity is a hot topic now, which I see as inextricably linked to climate and other social and environmental issues. \n\nDo contact me if you seek guidance on your sustainability strategy, want to build up capacity in your organization or are wondering how to meet reporting requirements on sustainability and due diligence.",

Natural and social capital are taken into account. True prices include \u2018externalities\u2019, taxes shift from human to natural resources (including pricing carbon). Allowing the natural system to replenish its gold: fresh water, clean air, nutrient-rich soils, carbon-capturing forests, natural areas rich in biodiversity, healthy fisheries. I see it as my job to illustrate why, and show how this can be done. \n\nI continue my focus on the financial and agribusiness sectors, where I am mindful of the need to \u2018translate between sectors\u2019. Different professions can speak very different languages. Think of traders who need to make large volume decisions in split seconds, speaking to NGO\u2019s who want the trader to take into account multiple variables. Or policy makers who look at what is possible, working with scientists who look at what is needed.\n\nI enjoy building bridges, working in multidisciplinary teams towards a shared goal. Do contact me if I can be of assistance to your organization, or if you want to explore new ideas.\n\nRead more on my website: www.ecovalue.nl",

Since 2015 the landscapes work of IDH has evolved and grown under the leadership of Global Landscapes Director Daan Wensing.\n\nIn 2014, we identified several landscapes that were all sourcing areas for one or more commodities, and were presented with major environmental and/or social challenges. IDH worked with local stakeholders towards sustainable management of these landscapes, aiming for each stakeholder to see beyond their own land borders, beyond their own sector and interests, at the shared interests in the bigger landscape picture. Fascinating work. \n\nFor more information about IDH's current work on landscapes see https://www.idhsustainabletrade.com/landscapes/",
