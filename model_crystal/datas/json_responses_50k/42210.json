Reason for that is that I don\u2019t let go of my goal before it is reached, combined with guts and courage that I show to finish a project or assignment. When a project or challenge becomes my responsibility I am persistent, purposeful and committed to find a solution for the owner, the customer, my employer. I am open, direct and service oriented and I won\u2019t evade any issues. I am sincere, able to energize others and myself and my passion is travelling.",
