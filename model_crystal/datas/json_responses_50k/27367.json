    "summary": "I am a mechanical engineer with a keen interest in mathematics and programming. During my studies I have found numerical methods for solving engineering problems to be a wonderful blend of the these two disciplines. \n\nI take pride in a certain degree of perfectionism and first-principles understanding that has served me well in my academic career, graduating cum laude for my bachelor's degree and taking part in the University of Twente honours program. I completed my master thesis on multigrid methods for the simulation of heterogeneous anisotropic material in contact problems with a 9.0. \n\nCurrently I am continuing my career in the field of computational fluid dynamics with a PhD project in which the lattice-Boltzmann method is used to develop a computational model for studying and improving particle transport in radioembolization therapy for liver tumours.",
