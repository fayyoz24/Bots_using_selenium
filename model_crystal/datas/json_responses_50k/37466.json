    "summary": "In February 2020 I investigated a software company in Rwanda and advised on improvements in product, processes and organization.\n\nI'm proud to have been a part of the team that build two brand new Academies for Associate degrees for Avans in Den Bosch and Roosendaal. I have moved on to a sizzling challenge at The Hague University of Applied Sciences as teamlead for the Functional Managers of educational applications such as BlackBoard and Osiris.\n\nTogether with ZoMaarten I've developed a new workshop: Splendid Learning. It's all about the vast number of Apps and internetsolutions that are available to lecturers, that they're not aware of. After the lecturers fill in an questionaire, we show them, hands-on, some possibilities that are of interest to them.\n\nI am a certified Prince2 Practitioner and recently I've added Certified ScrumMaster to that.\n\nIn April  2015 I've been to Palestine to develop a curriculum for Software Engineers.\n\nFurthermore I made a new product. SCRUM workshop. Where a team actually builds a website in 3 to 4 hours going through the SCRUM-process. So we don't just talk about it, but do it! Which fits my Rotterdam style excellently.\n\nIn Februari and April/May 2014 I lectured a module Project Management at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. This is part of the post-bachelor Businessprogram. I will combine theoritical lectures about Project Management with mini-trainingsessions on managerial skills. \n\nAt Zadkine I've assisted in organizing the Centrally Developed Exams for Dutch and Maths. Now the software used to managed the logistics will be implemented to manage all exams.\n\nI have coached several (Project) Managers and Directors.\n\nOff course, I always love to help out with my vast experience as a Project Manager. Contact me if you need help, hands-on or in helping (junior) Project Managers. Just like 3PO, Zadkine, PUM and Zicht recently did.\n\nSpecialties: Project Management, Training and coaching on personal skills, intercultural cooperation.",

There where four schools, two from Indonesia ( one from Java and and from Sumatra) and one from Tanzania an one from Ghana.\nThe main objective was to demonstrate to them what we where telling them about blended learning, asynchronous learning and the use of open source in education. Being at their schools in their own country we where able toe explain what they may have improved in their way of teaching. But being here an seeing how there methods look like in real life helped them to understand the challenge they have to undertake en the goals they are aiming for.",

But it is mostly due to the own unfamiliarity with other customs and uncertainty about the own competences and interview skills.\n\nTo improve the cooperation between schools and parents I provide for a one day training. We start at 10:00 am and end at 18:00 hours, so you can travel after the rush hour.\n\nBefore the training participants complete a questionnaire, via internet, that measures basic skills in intercultural cooperation. The morningsession is centered around the basic elements for successful collaboration and the competences of the participants. In the afternoon we apply our own competences and practical skills in practice sessions with professional actors.",
