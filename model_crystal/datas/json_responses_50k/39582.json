    "summary": "I started my career in a role to liaise between the business and the IT department given my mix of a Chemical Engineering (MSc) and IT background. After a few years my second passion came into play: people management and getting most out of my team through applying proper management styles and motivation (or as Strengthfinder calls it: Maximizer). Just over 10 years ago my team became a global team which needed to support a variety of teams in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, China, the UK and the USA. The cultural aspects of management have since fascinated me and I'm still learning.\n\nIn 2010 I was asked to setup a new department and create an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) vision and strategy to move this topic well into the 21st century (nicely links to my other Strengthfinder strength: Futuristic). Next came an opportunity to become the (Agile Scrum) Product Owner for our Corporate Social Intranet based on Office 365, an opportunity I embraced fully. The latest change/challenge is to build and shape the End User Services team of Solution Architects. We create roadmaps and design solutions around (mobile) workplace, productivity, ECM, communication and collaboration services. Our purpose is to increase productivity across the company ranging from office workers to first line workers in our factories.\n\nSpecialties: Process plant document and data management, process engineering to IT service providers liaison, change and people management, Agile Scrum Project Owner.\n",
