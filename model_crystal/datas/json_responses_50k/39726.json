    "summary": "Welcome! \n\nLet me tell you something about me and the Women Fund Tanzania (WFT).\nSince 2006, I have been investing my time and energy in building WFT together with Mary Rusimbi, my Tanzanian sister and colleague. I do this because I stand for a world where everybody is welcome and where human rights are basic rights for everyone. The major part of my adult life I have stood with my feet \u2018in the African mud\u2019 as  a practical doer, pioneer, innovative bridge builder and social entrepreneur. The African notion \u2018Ubuntu\u2019 (I am because we are) has grown into me. All along I have been touched by local women: their resilience, vitality and zest for life. I have experienced that they are the fabric of society, holding daily life in their hands and therefore the key to the future. This is where their chances are such as having a say over one\u2019s own life and access to basic rights.\n\nWhether it is about women\u2019s rights in the new constitution, abolishing any form of violence against women, inheritance and land rights, rights to representation, land, property, sexual or health rights, WFT supports local women all over Tanzania.  Our success is growing. Our approach is working and responds directly to a big and urgent need. We are transitioning from a pilot phase into a fully fledged women\u2019s rights fund by 2014/15. Our practical results are our best business card. See also our website: http://www.womenfundtanzania.nl",

WFT provides a funding mechanism to accomplish this.\n\nWFT taps into and strengthens women\u2019s potentials for strong women\u2019s movement building through contributing to new and ongoing initiatives, and through contributing to active movement building in Tanzania and beyond.\n\nHaving lived and worked within the women\u2019s movements in Tanzania for many years, my co-founder, Mary Rusimbi, and I started WFT back in 2006/07 on a 100% voluntary basis. Through years of practical experience, we realized the major challenges local women face in accessing funding. This is despite good intentions and big amounts of aid money and philanthropic funding which comes to Tanzania but never reaches them in a significant way. Thus we want to make sure that money reaches where it is supposed to reach i.e. with the often unseen and invisible local women heroes. \nActivities and Results: together with my co-founder, Mary Rusimbi, we have been building a reliable, transparent, not for profit funding mechanism for promoting women\u2019s rights in Tanzania: \n \n\u2714 We make grants by providing innovative funding to community based women's rights initiatives combined with mentorship before, during and after grants;\n\u2714 We strengthen capacity through strong mentorship programs and by providing feminist leadership collaborating with and supporting Tanzanian women's rights organizations and networks;\n\u2714 We build strategic alliances with like-minded women's funds, women's rights organizations and networks in Tanzania, Africa and beyond;\n\u2714 We mobilize resources and raise funds; \n\u2714 We develop an institutional setting for WFT to enable us to deliver on our vision and mission.",
