    "summary": "I recently graduated with my Masters in Computational Science and am looking for the next challenge and learning opportunity. My main goal at the moment is to grow. Grow as a person, as a software engineer, and as part of a team. Because I believe and have learned, that in order to grow and thrive, we need an inspiring environment that challenges us. \n\nMy passion lies in unraveling behaviors of complex systems. I prefer using a top-down approach to answering questions. Instead of zooming into the details of the problem, I am more interested in how pieces of the problem interact. The first complex system I studied was the human brain, during my bachelor's in Psychobiology. Afterward, I broadened my view during my Masters in Computational Science. Even though I enjoy the freedom of the academic world, I am really looking forward to working on projects that actually have a direct impact. \n\nIn the last three years of my studies, I have become very comfortable coding in Python, which has given me a good foundation for switching to other coding languages. I have done small projects in R, C, and Javascript. In my master courses, I have learned a wide range of techniques including large-scale data engineering, basic data mining techniques, and some more advanced machine learning techniques like Natural Language Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks.
