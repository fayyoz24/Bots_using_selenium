    "summary": "I have been passionate by nature and agriculture since I was a kid. My family roots are in the countryside where generation over generation they have dedicated to agriculture. Soon I also discover the enthusiasm for science and technology. When I was child, I was one atypical kid. I enjoyed when my electric toys broke so I could disassemble it and fabricate my own robots.\n\nI am happy that I was able to combine both passions and that today I am contributing for a more sustainable world with the help of robotics technology.\n\nI love to meet people and collaborate with colleagues from around the world. Often that even ends up in submitting a Horizon Europe project grant together. \n\nMy research interests lie within Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have focused all my career on combining these technologies to develop robust solutions for Precision Agriculture and Ecology Management. I have always aimed to design autonomous flying machines that could perform close range sensing and interaction. \n\nSince technology should be designed for people, I am also working in giving special powers to UAV users in order to transform them in super heroes and ease the interaction with UAVs - The Cyborg Farmer.",

The selected drone applications represent the most important sectoral and societal drone usage purposes in Europe and cover multiple applications that are interconnected within the complex rural European landscape. The ICAERUS vision is to explore opportunities and provide a more complete and interconnected account of the potential and impact of drones as multi-purpose vehicles in EU agriculture, forestry and rural areas. The aim is to showcase and support, through application, the effective, efficient and safe deployment of drones as well as, identify the risks and added values associated with their use. \u201cTaking off\u201d from the current state-of-the-art in the drone ecosystem, ICAERUS will \u201crise up\u201d by advancing existing software technology, platform components and knowledge in regard to drones, to exploit the potential of drones and strengthen capacities to reduce their risks, achieve better informed decision-making, enhance sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture, forestry and rural areas. This will be showcased in two directions: fundamental applications representing an \u201ceye-in-the-sky\u201d, using the drone as a positioning system for optical observation and recording, and a \u201chand-in-the-sky\u201d applications, for spraying and goods delivery. ICAERUS plans to scale-up through research, technology optimisation, demonstration and education about drones to create an efficient, trusted and safe enabling environment for the EU drone services market to achieve the EU\u2019s decarbonisation, digitalisation and resilience ambitions. ICAERUS consists of a balanced, multi actor, cross sectoral and well-experienced consortium, including research organisations, SME technology providers, associations and non-profit organisations.",

            "description": "Agricultural robotics solutions can integrate a variety of robots for a variety of monitoring and targeted intervention tasks, to increase farm productivity, efficiency and sustainability through support of automated precision farming operations. Despite the rising farmer investment in farm/agricultural robots, most deployable robotic systems are meant to automate only specific tasks. The wide variety of tasks that need to be fulfilled in a single precision agriculture operation or mission makes it extremely unprofitable to address its automation with task-specific robots. These challenges result in a lack of flexibility of current heterogeneous multi-robot systems that poses low returns on investment and high risks for farmers. In order to become cost-effective, heterogeneous multi-robot systems needs to become more flexible by employing more versatile (e.g. multi-task) robots which collaborate to accomplish complex missions; ensuring scalable human oversight and intervention through adaptive mission control mechanisms (e.g. without information overload /overwhelming effort from the farmer); allowing the farmer to profit from robotics operational data. FlexiGroBots proposes a Platform for developing heterogeneous multi-robot systems and applications which allows for i) more versatility by using the same robots for different observation and intervention tasks, in different missions, throughout the crop life cycle, ii) more cooperation between heterogeneous (ground and aerial) robots to accomplish more complex missions; iii) more valuable data to generate accurate insights into the fields, crops and robotics operations by combining data from IoT sensors, satellites and data collected by the robots; iv) more autonomy for real-time adaptation of mission plans as well as robot behaviour at the crop level, given operational conditions and real-time insights; v) more precision to carry out specific tasks in a very localized way, gaining accuracy and lowering costs.",

The resulting soil compaction results in increased fuel consumption, higher greenhouse gas emissions and reduced yields. Fields2cover focuses on the accurate planning of workflows for a relatively light self-propelled vehicle in order to reduce environmental pressure while increasing efficiency. The project develops functionality for complex plot shapes, hilly terrain and routing for multiple implements simultaneously. The developed methods will be implemented in an open-source software library and extensively tested with an autonomous agricultural vehicle developed by AgXeed.

The following breakthrough is tele-interaction, \"hands in the air\". The MARS4Earth project aspires to develop the first autonomous and modular aerial manipulator that interacts physically with the an outdoor operational environment in a safe, autonomous, efficient and cost-effective way.\n\nThe research mainly focuses on the question of whether it is possible to develop a prototype of a modular and completely autonomous aerial manipulator that can physically interact with a realistic outdoor environment. In essence, the aerial manipulator acts as \"arms and hands in the air\", which can be used for both active and passive aerial interaction. The applicability of this technology will be demonstrated in three chosen application domains , inspection and maintenance (maintenance of offshore windmill and cleaning solar panels), agriculture (selective treatment of plants and sample picking) and Safety and Security (active fire-fighting).

The interest of life science students in drones is growing fast. Several students that study at Wageningen University & Research (WUR) want to customize drone missions and process drone data in real-time. However, there are few courses that teach students how to develop software to program a drone mission, to process drone data in real-time, and to transform the data acquired in useful site-specific information. To meet this demand, this EP proposes the development of a training centre for teaching how to program drones with ROS for life science domain applications, e.g., agriculture and ecology.
