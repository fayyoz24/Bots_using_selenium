    "summary": "I\u2019m a Mechanical Engineer working in the High Tech Industry with a Master degree in High Tech Engineering. My focus was on Mechatronic System Design, and Micro & Nano Engineering. I developed the skills needed to design, optimize, and fabricate machines for high speed and high precision, at the micro-scale if necessary.\n\nFor my thesis, I designed, optimized, and used 3D printing to fabricate a flexure out of mechatronic metamaterials to damp unwanted modes. As an engineer I have worked on tooling, endurance setups, and liquid transport lines,  I did the concepting, calculations, modelling, FEA, design for manufacturability, GD&T, and tolerance analysis. I coordinated the mechanical design between several products, and also conceived and carried out testing. \n\nI love working in multidisciplinary teams, as I love learning from others and I am curious about the various theories that govern our universe. I want to understand systems at the fundamental level and use that knowledge to push the bounds.",
