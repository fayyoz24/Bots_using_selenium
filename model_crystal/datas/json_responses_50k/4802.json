    "summary": "I am a Data & Analytics Manager with 10+ years of experience in leveraging data and analytics with proven technical and functional skills, and a demonstrated focus and vision on advanced analytics. I have a background in consultancy with proven track record in data analysis & business intelligence, with expertise in using and managing extremely large and complex data sets to gain insights and support business decision making, effectively communicating findings with both technical and business stakeholders.\n\nI hold a bachelor's degree in economics and started my career as Business Analyst and decided to develop my skills in the analytical direction. I worked as a BI consultant in both functional and technical roles for 8+ years.\n\nIn 2013 I joined Amgen as Data & Analytics Specialist and gradually grew into a Data & Analytics Manager role in the commercial domain, being responsible for managing overall operations for the EU region initially, and currently for the ELMAC region (Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Africa & Canada), including mentoring and coaching of all technical team members and managing client expectations.\n\nA few things I am passionate about: \n\n-Delivering high quality data & analytics results to support our business processes and deliver high business value.\n-Being people-oriented, trying to help the organization with data & analytics deliverables where and when I can, or connect them to those who can.\n-Leading and guiding the team, continuously improving to become the best version of ourselves.",
