    "summary": "Hi! My name is Nathanael Bayu and my journey started at Universitas Gadjah Mada in Public Policy and Management, lean toward public policy creation, governmental systems, economic development and environmental studies.\n\nI consider myself an enthusiastic, self-motivated person, and team player as well as an independent thinker. Hoping in the future to be able to help in creating policies or direct action that support  sustainability socio-environment sphere,  build economic stability and support the most disadvantaged in our society including marginalized communities.\n\nI studied Public Policy and Management and hold a Bachelor\u2019s in Political Science from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. I also attended a student exchange program in 2017 at The University of Agder, Norway for one semester, where I specialised in Political Ecology. While studying, I obtained more perspectives on the conflicts and disputes of understanding, explaining, and maintaining an equilibrium between society and the natural world.\n\nI have decided to pursue studies and research in regards to social stability, either through sustainability or economic development. This experience introduced me to a wide array of social sciences that taught me a global perspective which I found as an invaluable asset to my studies and will allow me to bring that knowledge to the workplace.",
