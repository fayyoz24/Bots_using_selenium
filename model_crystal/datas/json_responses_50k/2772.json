They laugh of Bluebeard and dedicate their music, songs and dances to Susana Chavez, the Mexican journalist who coined the phrase, \u201cnot one more death,\u201d in order to fight for the right to live of those women who have now only become statistics. The stories recall times of war and peace, and the love and sagacity required to keep a family together. The three sisters follow a stone path made with the silent stories of countless women searching for their names.\nThe performance combines music and theatre in a black and white space. The images prompt the spectators to rediscover their own history and remember the \"anonymous\" women who have forged their existence.",
