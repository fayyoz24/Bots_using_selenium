    "summary": "I am an architect and computational designer, interested in the combination of technology, art, and utilitarity. \nAt the moment I perform as a computational designer at External Reference Architects, working in the field of algorithmic design, digital fabrication, and 3d-modeling. My main competences and responsibilities include complex geometry rationalization, digital fabrication and multi-objective optimizations. \n\nI have experience of work in international and interdisciplinary teams, for both academic research and professional projects. I am also passionate about new fields and ideas, therefore I participated in a broad variety of architectural projects and competitions. \n\nI constantly work on the improvement of my capabilities and knowledge and never hesitate to learn something new. Here is the list of professional skills I have obtained so far:\n\n- Rhinoceros\n- Grasshopper\n- Grasshopper C#\n- AutoCAD\n- Revit\n- SketchUp\n- Photoshop\n- InDesign\n- 3d-printing + CURA\n- CNC + RhinoCAM\n- Model-making\n\nI am also constantly improving my communication skills and, being a native Russian speaker, am also fluent in English and progress in Spanish.\n\nPlease, reach out to me if you are interested in parametric architecture & design, or would like me to work on your projects. I will be happy and interested to offer my skills, ideas, and performance.",

The limitless cosmos will serve as an endless source of inspiration. While the new generation of space-shuttles is being prepared to explore space, we decided to start speculating about the other-world architecture.\n\n\"Cosmic Congregations\" is a computationally-driven architectural project, exploring the potential of subdivision loop operations for design of complex shapes. It was developed as a part of Python scripting seminar during the Masters in Advanced Architecture (2019-20) at Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.\n\nThe developed code allows to create almost endless number of iterations, by altering parameters such as attractor curves, subdivision aspect, offset depth and displacement. These intricate forms developed have been imagined as the new functional aesthetic for extra-terrestrial cohabitation.",

In this project we worked on refurbishment and development of Worli Koliwada neighborhood of Mumbai, India. \nOur concept was build around the process of \"reincarnation\", when the typologies, colours, materials and logic of traditional indian architecture is recreated using contemporary technologies, materials and strategies, creating a more qualitative living environment, at the same time preserving the local spirit and atmosphere. \nWe considered demands of the local community and analyzed future benefits, while developing our strategy, organizing new centers of interest and residential development in the neighborhood. \nThe entire project is divided into 3 main parts: the urban zone, the cultural/touristic zone and the fishermen village. Each part has unique functions and centers of attraction, but all of them are united  by common style, concept and physical connections, such as pedestrian routes and aeration corridors. \nThe pre-installed 3d structural grid can be filled by different residential modules, according to the demands of local citizens, and flexible layout enables potential growth and development of the area with time.\nSeveral dozens of residential typologies and floor layouts were developed by our team, in order to fulfil all the personal preferences any dweller of Worli Koliwada could have. \nThe coastline is elevated and reinforced to protect the area during the monsoon season. \nThis project was also awarded the 3rd prize of Tamayouz 2018.",
