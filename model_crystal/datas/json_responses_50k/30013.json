    "summary": "With a diverse background in Web3 as a professional research analyst and user of various projects (primarily DeFi), I bring a unique perspective to the table. My familiarity with a wide range of analytical services and my skill set allows me to approach challenges from multiple angles, bringing added value to any team or project. \n\nMy area of interest includes, but is not limited to, the application of fundamental analysis to assess the potential of crypto projects. The new web3 space offers a wealth of possibilities for data-driven investments, and I enjoy learning about them and putting them into practice.\n\nIn addition to my work in crypto, I'm also interested in equity research and occasionally post my own analysis online. I am a problem-solver at heart and take pride in building value and helping others whenever possible.\n\nI strive to be a \"Swiss Army knife\" in my professional life, constantly expanding my skillset to bring value to any project or team I work with. Please feel free to contact me via Linkedln. I'm always looking forward to an insightful discussion and collaboration!",
