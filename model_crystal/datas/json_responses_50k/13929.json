Optimisations of signal and control regions, as well as studies of physical observables, were performed using Python and C++. The worldwide CERN computing grid allowed for the execution of high performance computing tasks involved in running the analysis.\n\nBesides my technical skills, I have learned key project management, time management, and communication skills during my PhD.
