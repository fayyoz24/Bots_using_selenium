(2013) and the \u03b413C record reveals the occurrence and dominance of C4 plants during at least 4 episodes of the last glacial times at 28.0\u201326.0 kyr cal BP, 31.4\u201330.0 kyr cal BP, 53.4\u201344.5 kyr cal BP and 86.8\u201366.1 kyr. The C4 plant development is interpreted as a specific atmospheric circulation pattern that induces short and dry summer conditions. These episodes are suggested to be caused by Dansgaard Oeschger events. It is not quantified how the Dansgaard Oeschger events influence the \u03b413C record, because \u03b413C is influenced by various factors, among which temperature and precipitation. By using the MBT-CBT proxy, paleo temperature and past soil pH can be derived from the Surduk loess sequence and quantification of temperature-induced changes in the \u03b413C record can be made. Past soil pH is used as an indicator for the amount of precipitation. \n\nThe research question of this study is: Are the Dansgaard Oeschger events expressed in temperature- or in precipitation variation in the area of the Surduk loess sequence in Serbia?\n\nResearch goals:\n- To acquire knowledge about branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (BrGDGTs) and their application in loess sediments,\n- To acquire knowledge about the climate from the Surduk loess sequence in Serbia using the MBT-CBT proxy,\n- To get a better understanding of the changes in climate during D/O events.\n\nIn this study I will gain experience in:\n- Preparing and conducting a scientific research project,\n- Gain experience with different analysis techniques (e.g., preparation of the samples for brGDGT-analysis, measurement of brGDGTs) in the organic geochemistry lab at Utrecht University,\n- To write a scientific report and give a scientific presentation ",

Previous work by Van Breukelen (2009) revealed a shift in the \u03b418O record in both stalagmites, dated around 340 000 years BP. This study zooms in on this shift, as both stalagmites seem to show the same pattern and the spatial resolution in the study by Van Breukelen (2009) was not sufficient. \n\nResearch goals:\n- To investigate if the \u03b418O record of both stalagmites correlates with a transition from glacial to interglacial climate,\n- To investigate if secondary effects on the oxygen isotope composition of fluid inclusion water have taken place,\n- To obtain an estimate of paleo-temperatures using \u03b418O values of the speleothem carbonate and the fluid inclusions.\n\nIn this study I gained experience in:\n- Stable isotope analysis of carbonate samples with a Finnigan Delta plus mass-spectrometer equipped with a gasbench II, located at the stable isotope laboratory at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,\n- Stable isotope analysis of fluid inclusions using a modified ThermoFinnigan TC-EA (Vonhof en al., 2006) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,\n- Reconstruction of paleo-temperatures using equations by Kim & O\u2019Neil (1996) and Coplen (2007),\n- Writing a scientific report and giving an oral presentation.",

I work in an organic geochemical lab where I have developed a novel analytical method to detect levoglucosan in complex sedimentary matrices using different UHPLC-MS systems. I have worked up different types of sediment samples and applied this novel analytical method. I have written multiple papers in this project and presented the results at international conferences where I have given both oral and poster presentations.",
