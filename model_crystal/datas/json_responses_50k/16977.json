After the creation of the 3D dress, they approached Stephan Duquesnoy to use the digital archival version, and portray it using his own vision.\n\nThe final artwork is an unique NFT that shows the gown in a romanticized version of the Netherlands in 1905. Throughout the day we can subtly see the colors and light changing as time progresses.\n\nThe artwork was exhibited at the Central Museum in Utrecht from the 23rd of April 2022 until the 19th of June 2022 as part of the \u201cFrom Pattern to Polygon\u201d exhibition.\n\nThe original velvet gown, with a generous train and trimmed with gold lace, was originally worn by Lady Henriette van de Poll (1853-1946), who was lady-in-waiting to Queen Emma from 1880 to 1934. This velvet gown was created by the famous Madame van der Taelen from Bruxelles.\n\nOne of the special qualities of the dress is that the fabric color is susceptible to light changes. It can go from a dark forest green dress, to a bright green dress depending on the light conditions. So seeing the dress once, doesn\u2019t really do it justice, the context that the dress is presented in matters.\n\nThe actual gown is ageing, and requires specific conditions to be displayed, there will be a point in the future that this small part of history will vanish. But the dress can keep existing on the blockchain in its own frozen time bubble.\n\nView the original dress on the Centraal Museum archive page: https://www.centraalmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/10726-001-002-tweedelige-avondjapon-bestaande-uit-japon-en-sleep-mme-h-van-der-taelen#/",

We also believe we have a development process and methodology that inspires creative teams to constantly develop new and exciting content for their fanbase, increasing brand value.\n\nIn general we have four types of clients:\n- Clients want a world developped as a starting point for their own team.\n- Clients come to us with an already developed game idea, but feel that the design and story are lacking interest or visual appeal. We supply them with guides that show alternative stories and visual styles.\n- Clients need extra development power in a short time. \n- Clients do not have an inhouse art and story team, and hire us to provide the entire visual and story development for their project.\n\nOur services include (but are not limited by)\n- Style guide documentation\n- Entertainment IP Bible and Worldbuilding\n- Art Direction\n- Visual Art and Narrative production\n\nCurrent clients include: Ketnet, Codeglue, Kactus Games",
