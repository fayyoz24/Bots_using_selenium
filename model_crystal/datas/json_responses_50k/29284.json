    "summary": "During my master's thesis, I discovered my passion for researching and solving complex problems with real-world applications. With a Master\u2019s degree from Eindhoven University of Technology, I have a strong foundation in computer science and engineering. As a project manager, I successfully guided a team of 10 students, demonstrating my leadership capabilities. Moreover, my experience as a student assistant allowed me to help students understand and explore the fundamental concepts of physics, aiding their comprehension of physics and engineering. Now, I am eager to transition into a career in the software engineering field where I can further enhance my skills and contribute to cutting-edge advancements. If you're seeking a motivated professional with a passion for research, problem-solving, development and working on the forefront of innovation, feel free to reach out to me.",

Software developers typically compare execution logs obtained from system runs to detect, mitigate or prevent software regressions. However this is error-prone and time consuming since the amount of logs to investigate can be substantial and they can produce irrelevant differences which makes it difficult to isolate the useful and redundant differences. One of the methods that has been proposed to help developers comprehend system behavior differences is to infer state machine models of the system behaviors and compare them at the model level. Even though comparing models locates differences in system behavior, it does not relate these differences with one another. Without such relations, software developers still need to invest considerable time and effort to comprehend the differences. Providing software developers with actionable insights such as relations of system behavior differences reduces the amount of the manual investigation required. In this work, we contribute a framework to automatically capture and visualize relations of behavior differences between state machine models for two versions of the same software.
