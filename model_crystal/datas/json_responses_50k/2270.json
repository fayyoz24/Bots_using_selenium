The two first stages of the European Flood Directive 2007/60 i.e., flood risk assessment and flood mapping were implemented. Tools of weighted Multiple Criteria Analysis were used for the first stage, while hydrological and hydraulic HEC models were used for the second. GiS software was used as well in both stages. The final results of the study, included spatial vulnerability maps (for the different aspects of flood hazard), hydrographs, flood area maps, quantified flood risk tables and conclusions for both findings and followed methodology.\n\nSupervised by Prof. Dr. Nikos Theodosiou",
