For instance, they become aggressive even when they risk a high cost (e.g., retaliation or ruining a relationship) and they engage in unhealthy behaviours such as smoking. The accumulating evidence that human behaviour is one of the leading causes of climate change furthermore renders environmentally harmful behaviour suboptimal. Traditional theories have attributed these so-called suboptimal behaviours to a stimulus-driven process in which a stimulus activates a response based on the person\u2019s prior learning history or innate wiring. This response can be regulated by a goal-directed process, which compares the values and likelihoods of the outcomes of different action options, but only when the person has ample opportunity to engage in this process. Within the current research, we propose an alternative theory in which goal-directed processes do not merely play a regulatory role, but are also at the heart of the emotional, unhealthy and environmentally unfriendly behaviours. The project challenges the traditional theory by testing whether seemingly stimulus-driven behaviour might be due to goal-directed processes after all. Support for the alternative theory has important implications for behaviour change in clinical practice and society.",
