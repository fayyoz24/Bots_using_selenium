Located in Amsterdam and currently supporting Philips in launching and localizing the main NPIs at a Global level. In 1 year with Philips, I created a performance Dashboard from scratch and deployed it for the main E-commerce markets, roll-out OneBlade NPIs globally, roll-out more AB tests globally, roll-out a CRM project globally which contributed to the increase in CVR and OR. Before I joined Philips, I led a team of seven people who are in charge with the execution of the online marketing strategy. I contributed to the growth of the E-commerce\u2019s share in the company's revenue in the last 5 years and to the growth of the E-commerce business by developing its online communication & marketing strategy and managing its execution. I graduated from an Executive MBA program at IEDC Bled School of Management in Slovenia, in 2019.",
