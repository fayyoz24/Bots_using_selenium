This was done with a thorough internal campaign on Service Level Agreement (SLA) . The SLA is the document that builds trust and accountability between sales and service departments as well as the end user/customer.\nAdditionally one of the main task in this project was to ensure the process of establishing an SLA offer, is an simple and easy task that everyone understood. This was done with various tools I created and an internal site with all the info and tools available to employees.\nLast but not least, due to the many companies that were incorporated in the group, it was important to ensure that they all offer SLA's in a manner that shows the unity of all companies under one name. \nAlthough the project is still ongoing since I left, my work ensured that:\na) everyone was aware of SLA's and their importance\nb) I laid the foundation for a unified/one face representation of the company to the customers.\nc)a  standardized process of  generation of an SLA was made\nd) introduced e-Training in Service\ne) Increased income in service products.\n",
