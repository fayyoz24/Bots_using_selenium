    "summary": "G'day and thanks for visiting. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a Health Data Scientist at TNO in the Microbiology and Systems Biology group, in the Healthy Living unit. I'm really into medical devices that offer interventions and diagnostics to provide individual patients with personalised treatment - I believe this is the future of healthcare - and a common theme of throughout my research career. My focus is on the translation of medical devices, from conception to (pre-)clinical trials and commercialisation. I'm interested in the data that these devices generate, and careful analysis, identify trends and correlations that lead to tailored and precise treatments. I also have extensive experience in lab/experimental work, data processing and analysis and reporting our findings in academic publications.\n\nIf I\u2019m not at work I\u2019ll probably be cycling and/or racing and also a bit of running \u2013 I really like to ride my bike \ud83d\udeb4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I also love travelling (usually to go cycling) and perhaps as a result I like to learn languages too. I speak English and Mandarin fluently, intermediate Dutch and French and basic Spanish. I was born in Taiwan (Taipei) and I grew up in South Africa (Pretoria) and Australia (Brisbane), so everywhere I go, I end up looking and sounding like a foreigner \ud83d\ude09",
