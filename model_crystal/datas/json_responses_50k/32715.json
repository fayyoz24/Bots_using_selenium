    "summary": "I'm 22 years old and am currently following the Nanobiology Master at the TU Delft. I chose this study because it combines many different types of science. This is a fitting study for someone like me who has broad interests and is fascinated by biology at the cellular scale. \n\nDue to my broad interests I am currently taking an extra year in my master to do extra subjects and expand my knowledge on new fields like machine learning, quantum mechanics and application of differential geometry in physics. However, currently, I am most interested in the topic of (epi)genetics, in particular in simulating the processes of gene regulation. For this reason, I will start my Master end project in September on regulation of transcription of the gap genes in fly embryos.\n\nI expect to graduate in July 2024 after which I probably want to do a PhD project.",
