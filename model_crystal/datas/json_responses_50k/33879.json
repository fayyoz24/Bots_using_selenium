    "summary": "With my research projects I aim to contribute to understanding innovations in crisis and disaster management and emergency response. \n\nI see crisis and disasters as out-of-control situations in society as a result of natural hazards, conflicts, human or technical failure, and/or a combination of those root factors (complex emergencies). In such situations, external help is needed to cope with the situation, and the characteristic of the aid is that it comes from different, professional and non-professional parties and organizations. \n\nMy research focusses on organizational and technological innovations to improve coordination and collaboration. The underlying question here is whether and how societies are able to cope with complex societal challenges of today and the future and how innovations can help to improve resilience. I use the term societal resilience to refer to the adaptive responses and strategies at the level of groups, organizations and society creating the capacity to deal with current and future challenges.\n\nIn my research I adopt a multidisciplinary approach, working with experts from various social scientific sub-disciplines, computer science, law, development studies, earth and life sciences, and where possible in collaboration with professionals from the field including civil servants, police, fire service, medical service, iNGOs, Red Cross and UN agencies.\n\nMy research is embedded in various projects with academic and non-academic partners, funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), the European Union (Horizon 2020 and COST Action) and by public and private institutes. Currently I am the Project Leader of the EU Horizon 2020 project \"LINKS: Strengthening links between technologies and society for European disaster resilience\" (16 partners), and Work Package leader of the EU Horizon 2020 COVID-19 project \"HERoS: Health Emergency Response in Interconnected Systems\" (11 partners).",

The overall aim of the LINKS project is to strengthen links between technologies and society for improved European disaster resilience, by producing sustainable advanced learning on the use of social media and crowdsourcing (SMCS) in disasters.\nIn order to reach the core objectives of LINKS, the partners follow an integrative research approach, starting from an assessment of the three complementary knowledge domains: Disaster Risk Perception and Vulnerability, Disaster Management Processes, Disaster Community Technologies (DCT).\nThe project will develop the LINKS Framework which consists of scientific methods, practical tools, and guidelines addressing researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to understand, measure and govern SMCS for disasters. It will be developed and evaluated through five practitioner-driven European cases in Denmark, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, representing different disaster scenarios. Furthermore, LINKS sets out to create the LINKS Community, which brings together a wide variety of stakeholders, both online (LINKS Community Center) and in person (LINKS Community Workshops).",

As authorities and responders are struggling to contain the spread, news about mass quarantine camps or shortages of personal protective equipment threaten the health systems globally, fueled by rumors and misinformation. The disruptions of (medical) supply chains, the lack of capacity to treat patients and the spread of rumours fuel an atmosphere of uncertainty and mistrust, hampering an effective response. While traditional models of disease outbreaks largely focus on infection rates, new methods are needed to integrate behaviour from the bottom up and integrated in macrolevel models to coordinate the response worldwide.",

Jeroen Wolbers is the project\u2019s postdoc researcher; Femke Mulder and Arjen Schmidt are the project\u2019s PhD candidates.\n\nIn the project we identify disaster response practices and conditions that can lead to net-centric governance. We define netcentric governance as the organization of a response to disasters by making use of self-directed networks of heterogeneous stakeholders, in an environment enabled by shared technological and organizational infrastructure. We study whether net-centric governance offers an alternative for formal top-down command and control practices, by drawing on the potential of community networks.\n\nNetcentric governance is studied in two different social contexts. Humanitarian work represents weak governmental response structures, but ample experience with social media. The Dutch context represents an over-regulated governmental response structure, but less experience with the use of social media in disaster response. Net-centric governance in these cases can support heterogeneous response networks, building on interconnected goals and ensuring better cooperation.\n\nWe combine ethnographic/fieldwork studies with network analysis and semantic analysis, to understand response practices and to chart patterns in information streams among and between heterogeneous networks. The Safety Regions\u2019 project \u2018Netcentisch Werken\u2019 for crisis response in the Netherlands, and Ushahidi and CrisisMappers, citizen-based social media platforms in humanitarian relief as used by NGOs, provide the cases.\n",

The research is part of the Amsterdam Research on Emergency Administration. Other researchers involved: Jaap de Heer and Jeroen Wolbers.\r\n\r\nNetcentric work means that the emergency response professionals (police, fire fighters and ambulance services) together with administrators (e.g. representatives of the municipality) collect real-time information about a crisis situation and about each others\u2019 actions in order to create a common operational picture. The aim of the research is to understand how the \u2018colors\u2019 or specific cultures of the professional organizations enable or constrain the multi-disciplinary cooperation during netcentric work.

During the 1990s these systems have been introduced as very promising. However, these systems also became associated with new organisational problems and side effects. They can consequently be characterized as highly demanding technologies. Our project evaluated theoretically from a critical cultural studies perspective, and methodically through discourse analyses, the tensions between the promises of the virtual and the demands of everyday user practices regarding integrated business systems. The outcomes of this research was of value to the debate on the virtualisation of organisations and the new economy. I carried out this this project with dr.ir. Sytze Kingma. It resulted in various publications in journals and books.\r\n\r\n",

Aksant Academic Publishers, February 2002, Amsterdam and in various academic papers.\r\n\r\nI have shown in my book that the Nat.Lab. history in the first decades of the twentieth century can be seen as part of a broader development internationally: the commodification of research. During the first decades of the twentieth century, the function of the industrial research laboratory became institutionalized. The institutionalization process of industrial research involved an intentional structuring of the research organization in the company, in which various persons worked together in specific business contexts. At a local level, Philips people headed by Holst (re)invented structures that enabled them to do inventions.\r\n",

LINKS is a consortium with 16 public and private partners from 8 European countries and 1 partner from Japan. LINKS sets out to understand and assess the effects of social media and crowd-sourcing (SMCS) on European disaster resilience. The project will develop a framework which can be used to understand, measure and govern SMCS for disasters, taking into account the diversity among disaster risk perception and vulnerability (DRPV), disaster management processes (DMP) and applied disaster community technologies (DCT) across European communities. The LINKS Framework consists of scientific methods, practical tools, and guidelines addressing researchers, practitioners and policy makers. It will be developed and evaluated through five practitioner-driven European cases, representing different disaster scenarios (earthquake, flood, industrial, terror, drought), cutting across disaster management phases and diverse socioeconomic and cultural settings in four countries (Italy, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands). Furthermore, LINKS sets out to create a community of stakeholders, the LINKS Community, which brings together first-responders, public authorities, civil society organizations, business communities, citizens and researchers across Europe dedicated to improving European disaster resilience through the use of SMCS.",

HERoS consists of 10 partners from 7 European countries. It assesses the Corona-virus outbreak of 2020. By beginning of 2020, numerous people all over the globe got infected, and the death toll continued to rise. As authorities and responders are struggling to contain the spread, news about mass quarantine camps or shortages of personal protective equipment threaten the health systems globally, fueled by rumors and mis-information.\n\nThe disruptions of (medical) supply chains, the lack of capacity to treat patients and the spread of rumors fuel an atmosphere of uncertainty and mistrust, hampering an effective response. While traditional models of disease outbreaks largely focus on infection rates, new methods are needed to integrate behavior from the bottom up, and integrated in macro-level models to coordinate the response world-wide. HERoS\u2019 is a multi-disciplinary project and focusses on disaster logistics, modelling, social media analysis and crisis and disaster governance.",
