    "summary": "I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Passau with a research focus on digital platforms and competition issues. I also work as an academic consultant for Compass Lexecon. \n\nPreviously, I was an Economist in Compass Lexecon.  \n\nPreviously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Duesseldorf Institute for Competition Economics where I also obtained my Ph.D. in Economics.\n\nI work mainly on competition issues in digital markets. In particular, I work on online platforms and looked at the impact new emerging trends on the digital economy as a whole. I also focus on supply chain contractual agreements, partial ownerships and merger and acquisitions. \n\nAs an economist, in all of my works, I prepared reports where I provide the policy implications that may help policymakers as well as industrial clients such as digital platforms. Moreover, I explain complex market mechanisms in a simple and intuitive manner so that it is understood by a wider audience. \n\nI also worked on multiple collaborative projects which strongly signal my qualities as a team player as well as my experience in meeting deadlines.",

                    "description": "Examples of my recent work:\n- I have been the author of several works concerning firm strategic behavior.\n- My work in the digital economy looks at the impact of exclusive deals on the industry and consumers. I show that exclusive contracts can be good for the industry and consumers which is in contrast to the current view held by some of the industry stalwarts and policy makers. \n-My work in the retail industry mainly focuses on the impact of buyer power in the presence of consumer shopping costs. I show that buyer power is detrimental to consumers as well as the industry as a whole. This counterintuitive result recommends policy makers to be circumspect when making policies to enhance competition and improve consumer welfare.\n-My work on partial ownership qualifies the bleak view policymakers have towards partial ownerships. I show that partial ownerships of firms in their suppliers can be a strategic tool to facilitate technology transfer and enhance supply chain collaborations. In another work, I look at partial ownership as a synergy learning device in a merger control setup. I provide policy recommendations on merger control regimes for the antitrust authorities to make efficient merger decisions. \n-I gained invaluable experience in teaching relevant modules in economics at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.  \n-My communication skills, ability to clearly present and respond to criticism have been enhanced by regular attendance to seminars and participation in international conferences.",
