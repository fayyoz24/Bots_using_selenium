However, the Studentdesk Red Cross was not existing in Wageningen. Early 2014 I approached the Red Cross in the Netherlands and together with a fulltime employee, I was able to establish the Studentdesk Red Cross in Wageningen. My main activities:\n\n- Collaboration with the national Red Cross and the regional Red Cross. \n\n- Creating brand awareness through word-of-mouth, design of posters and advertisements on social media. \n\n- Interviewed and selected board members.\n\nThe result: Five students from Wageningen University started their board-year at the Studentdesk Red Cross Wageningen mid-2014. They received their own function/role (chairperson, secretary, treasurer, PR and HR) and found volunteers for three committees (one committee helped to raise money for a good cause; one committee supported the Dutch \"Food corner\" with feeding the poorest people in the Netherlands (www.voedselbanknederland.nl) and one committee committed to help elderly people with becoming self-reliant.",
