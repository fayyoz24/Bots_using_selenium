    "summary": "I consider myself a 'global citizen' (Born in Switzerland but raised in Dominica, and living in Europe since 2015). With a strong passion for environmental sustainability, circular systems, and healthy nutrition, I'm currently looking for an opportunity to make a positive impact in the sustainable food-/agro-industry while completing my Msc in Global Business & Sustainability at RSM.\n\nI thrive within forward-thinking, high-energy teams, but also enjoy taking on leadership and responsibility. I like to approach problems from a systems-thinking perspective, and truly believe that only through innovation and the breaking down of our current systems, can we really change the world for the better. Aside from that, you can find me painting or looking for cool new places to hike through nature!\n\nIf you share my passions or are looking for a new addition to your team, let's connect!",
