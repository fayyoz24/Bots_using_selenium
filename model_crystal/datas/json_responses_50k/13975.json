    "summary": "What a long strange trip it\u2019s been. Born and raised in New York City, I became formally educated in physics, fine arts, economics, geography and dropped out of law school, twice, while living in Boulder, Boston and Amsterdam and working as a firefighter, soccer referee, game designer, caterer, high school instructor, real estate executive and handyman. The unique combinations of materials, technologies and techniques used to design and construct my artwork are a clear reflection of this diverse background. I am inspired by the limits of what is possible, creating motion with candles, mixing fire with ice and using surprising materials to move energy to where it can become truly beautiful.\n\nWe are inventors of art;\nart the likes of which the world has never seen.\n  \nWe are makers of machines;\nmachines which will achieve what no human hand can ever attempt.\n \nWe are developers of technology;\ntechnology which will expose the imperceptible.\n\nVisit LuxVortex.com",
