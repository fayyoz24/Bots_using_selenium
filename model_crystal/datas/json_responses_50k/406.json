Providing free menstrual products are twofold: it will contribute to a more inclusive environment at UM as it will help to break down the period stigma and support people who have difficulties affording menstrual products. Period products are basic and essential healthcare items, therefore, we believe it is necessary that UM provides these free of charge for those in need.\n\nWith the D&I grant, we will carry out a one-year pilot study. This includes providing menstrual products in selected restrooms at several UM faculties.  Next to providing menstrual products, we will create an educational campaign on the menstruation stigma. This will include workshops and discussions on the menstrual taboo, the need for increased awareness on menstruation, and the issue of period poverty. A monitoring and evaluation component is also part of the project, aiming to identify the long-term implementation possibilities at UM.\n\nTo bring this project to success, Feminists of Maastricht will create a task force and I have the honour to be the head of it.",

I also had a look behind the scenes at other social (youth) organizations by working on projects. In March and April, I worked on an English briefing for the sustainaBul of Studenten voor Morgen. This to help other organisations outside The Netherlands to also organise such ranking. After that, I joined NJR in the yellow track about education, politics and work. With a small team I will helped to organise an event for the Rainbow Academy."
