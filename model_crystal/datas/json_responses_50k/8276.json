    "summary": "Expatriation has always been an essential part of my life. As an Adult Third Culture Kid (ATCK), I grew up in France, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and England. I then went on to work and live in the USA and Canada before moving to the Netherlands with my family. This experience has shaped me into a highly-adaptable and dynamic individual, open and attuned to change and cultural differences.\n\nAfter a master\u2019s degree in Business, Management and Marketing followed by a corporate career, I decided to fully embrace my personal experience and started my own relocation support business, Tips4Expat. I now advise and support companies and individuals in all the stages of the relocation process with tailor-made services. A skilled networker, I partner up with other professionals and cover a wide array of topics such as relocation packages, housing, education or the integration of the spouse and children in the new country for instance. I offer my services for relocations to the Netherlands as well as to other countries.\n\nWhat I love about my work is its human dimension. Each client is unique. My empathetic nature is at its best when building and nurturing a relationship with them. I focus on understanding their mindset, their values and their priorities. I anticipate their needs to offer them a customized support and guide them throughout the often-stressful relocation process.  \n\nThe need to create and nurture human connections as well as the desire to give to others is also what drove me to create Course Kids4Kids, a solidarity run organized once a year in Amsterdam that enables kids to raise funds for kids in needs. The goal is to raise children\u2019s awareness of the importance of caring about others. I love the enthusiasm of kids and parents alike when they participate!\n\nIf you are thinking of relocating, or would like to know more about Course Kids4Kids, don\u2019t hesitate to connect with me.\n",

From their action, they support kids abroad who haven\u2019t had the same chance in life\u2026\nFor the first edition in 2017, 69 kids ran for their peers in Togo. It was a great success!\nIn 2018, 100 kids ran for children from Sri Lanka and in 2019 100 kids ran for children from Vietnam. Both also were a huge success.\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty timelines, we had to postpone the 2020 Course Kids4Kids edition.\n"
