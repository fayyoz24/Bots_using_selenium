Green Dossier\u2019s main goal is to educate people, especially youth, by providing knowledge in humanities, environmental issues and sustainable development. \nThe centre was working on an Environmental Management System (EMS) and certification scheme for (small and medium size) enterprises, especially small and medium size hotels, in Ukraine. Together with the Green Dossier staff involved, the expert conducted a comprehensive review of the draft EMS.  This resulted in a shift in focus to make the management system more attractive to the hotel trade by highlighting the potential economic and business benefits of joining the scheme.  To test these ideas, Green Dossier staff and the expert interviewed the management of three small hotels in different parts of Ukraine.  \nThe expert also provided advice on the certification procedure, exploring different models.  And he gave guidance on a possible business plan to set up a consultancy on EMS and EMS certification.  \nQuote of the expert after his mission: \u2018I was delighted to be asked to help develop an Environmental Management System and a certification scheme for hotels in Ukraine. Hotels can make great steps in improving their environmental performance and by doing so improve their financial performance as well\u2019. \nThree years later, the system is up and running.  Until now EMS certificates have been awarded to five hotels, of which three achieved the highest grade (of three).",

We also provide specialist support on conservation issues in the different areas of The Hague in relation to municipal policy and practice and in support of community initiatives.  \n\nIn 2012 AVN organised a symposium on the future of Green Belts around The Hague, that the Dutch national government established in the 1950s but withdrew its protection in 2011.  The symposium explored options for sustainable protection by the Province of South-Holland and the relevant municipal administrations to preserve these Green Belts.  \n\nIn 2014 AVN organised a symposium on Biodiversity in the city, which provided significant input for the review of the Municipality of The Hague's Green Policy Plan in 2015.
