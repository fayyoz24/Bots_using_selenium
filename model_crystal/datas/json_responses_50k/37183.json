At present the foundation is actively engaged in fundraising for projects of partner organisations such as the Bushman\u2019s Society and the Kaja Mzuri Society, in Zanzibar, Tanzania, both are locally registered NGOs. Besides fundraising, the Foundation Board of ZALA is also actively involved in implementing the projects of both partner organisations and works closely with the board members of these NGOs. \n\nAccording to the Zala Foundation, sustainable development and cooperation is crucial for the establishment and successful execution of projects.\n\nIn the areas of Zanzibar where the partner organisations are developing projects, more than 50 per cent of people are living below the poverty line. These areas also have limited employment and the level of education is low. Zanzibar also has a unique flora and fauna that are threatened by rapid development in Zanzibar. It is important that this is maintained for future generations.\n\nThe goals of the foundation are quite broad, but focus mainly on poverty alleviation and conservation. Poverty reduction is to be tackled first by setting up educational projects at various levels. Conservation goals will be worked towards through the establishment of education programs for young people. The aim is to raise awareness of the importance of conservation. Other projects are in development to enhance our conservation efforts."
