    "summary": "I'm passionate about how professionals connect their work challenges to their personal leadership; how they alternate speeding up and slowing down and tap into wisdom to guide their personal and professional life. I'm trained as an organizational psychologist, executive coach, trainer, and facilitator and I'm working in the field of (personal) leadership, career development, team learning, and innovation. \n\nI have been working for more than 25 years with highly skilled professionals in a variety of sectors such as the Financial sector (Rabobank, ABN Amro, ING Bank), Science and Technology (TU Delft), Judiciary (European Commission Projects), and University Medical Centres in Rotterdam, Leiden, Amsterdam, and Groningen. Among them are many professionals such as (beta) scientists, judges, policymakers, and financial- and medical specialists.\n\nIn my style of working, I value equality and  transparency and I intend to make explicit my own assumptions and approach. I value true dialogues and therefore encourage my business partners to speak out on their own thoughts and lived experience. \n\nIngredients of my work\u2028\u2028\n* co-creation in implementing new programs, concepts or ways of working\n* state-of-the-art scientific evidence and theory in psychology, leadership & learning\u2028, group dynamics\n* the connection with nature, intuition and mindfulness in development\n* (professional) language, discourse, metaphors, paradoxes in leadership and learning issues\u2028\n* feedback on behavior, usage of role plays, in order to increase social impact\n\nI'm living in the Hague, with my wife Dana and our  11 year old daughter Daria.",
