    "summary": "Biotechnologist by education, specialized in fungal isolation, taxonomy and biochemical characterization. My doctoral and postdoctoral research focused on the identification of fungal communities associated to marine habitats and their bioprospection for novel bioactive natural products. I curated a collection of marine-derived fungi and applied automated high throughput screening technology to explore the potential of fungal compounds to influence stem cell differentiation and inflammation. This project was carried out with generous support from the Irish Research Council, the Fulbright Commission of Ireland, and the Irish Marine Institute. \n\nCurrently, I am part of the Delft Aerospace Structures and Materials Laboratory at TU Delft, providing my expertise in microbial manipulation to support the development of bio-inspired materials and their manufacturing using 3D printing. Here, we design and create composites that include living fungi, with the final goal of crafting structures with advanced properties provided by the living myco-contributor.",
