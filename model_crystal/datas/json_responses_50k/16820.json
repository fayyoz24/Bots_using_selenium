    "summary": "I'm an interdisciplinary spirit with a passion for the wellbeing of humans and nature. Following these passions means to me that I apply my talents for a world where we are closer connected to one another and practice care for each other. After all, from the basis of that connection we can treat ourselves and our environment better.\n\nMental wellbeing and human rights are deeply important to me. I am engaged in creating more awareness and care between people and across generations, including within heavier themes such as sexuality and trauma, and mental health regarding the climate and ecological crisis. I describe myself as empathic, calm, communicative, driven, and always curious. I deeply enjoy connecting with and guiding people (or groups of people) and will find a creative solution for every challenge. Following this passion, I am in the right place when I can directly support people and relations: within communities and going outward.\n\nI have a background as an ecologist and during my education focused on knowledge of plants and their functioning within ecosystems, but also focused in particular on nature connectedness and the role this plays in our behaviour and wellbeing. I am fascinated by the way knowledge of and feeling at home in nature influences how we act. Beside my knowledge of ecosystems and my feeling for connectedness and wellbeing, I possess a strong skillset in the field of geodata and remote sensing and am a spatial thinker. I especially like to take on work which allows me to further share this knowledge.",
