    "summary": "As the youngest child of a music family, I was raised in a multi cultural environment in Holland.\nMother was born in Austria and father came from the Netherlands.\nGerman was our native language, later dutch as well as the basic of the english language. From both parents we were educated in piano, woodenfluit, fluit, singing- and music lessons.\n\nFrom the age of 15 I was guided by 2 men for my energetic skills.\nAlthough I was a HSP (high sensitive person) personality with artistic roots, I choosed to study Hotel Management at the Economic College at Heerlen.\nDuring the years I worked in very renomated hotels in leading functions in Holland and Austria.\nIn that periode I followed studies and courses in sales in the broadest sense of the word such as networkmarketing, Time Share, hardselling and accountmanagement.\n\nI focused on salesfunction most of in American Businesses as Treadegar and GBC where at last  I was responsable for the French and Italian speaking market worldwide.\n\nAfter 12 years of working in the international profit businesses, I followed my heart to create my own practice.\nAt the same time I became ill in a sudden and got the diagnoses as known as MS.\nEnding up in a whealchair at the age of 34 I took the illness as an opportunity to put all in practice what I had learned during my psychology studies and energetic educations avoiding to get dependant of medications and be restricted in my future life.\nI used my own theory of combining the mental, physical and energetic aspects together and changed my foodpatron with the result of walking on my own strength after 5 months again and I am not using any medication up untill today.\n\nWith this experience I felt even more stimulated to guide people to discover their own power of selfhealing whether in mental of physical way. \n\nIn my practice SANANDA I cooperate with high educated and experienced people as a  Psychologist, Osteopathic and Homeopathic.",
