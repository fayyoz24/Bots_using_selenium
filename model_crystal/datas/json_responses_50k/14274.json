    "summary": "Years ago, the wonderful world of Talent Acquisition and Recruitment stole my heart. Fascinated by how hiring the right talent can help organizations to remain sustainable, I have always been focused on finding that right match. The sweet spot, where person and company are an amazing fit. Recruitment is about getting to know people, about understanding the person behind their resumes, and additionally about advising the business, defining working strategies and being able to bring those two together. \n\nIn my conversations with the business I want to understand what really matters to them, and that same high quality conversation I am striving to have with each of the people I am talking to about a role. And I believe that\u2019s what makes me \u2018me\u2019 and also very good at my profession. \n\nI am a firm believer talent is the key driver of any organization. Yes. Intellectual property, data, the newest installations are all great examples of other indispensable items for an organization. But us humans are the driving factor. And I believe the right match starts with the right right fit. In my opinion knowledge can be taught, skills can be trained and experience can be gained. But overall one needs to be able to feel \u201cat home\u201d when at work. And that\u2019s were diversity and inclusion come in too. \n\nI started my recruitment career at Olympia, and afterwards moved on to IBM where I worked in several international roles over the scope of 3,5 years. When it was time for me to move on, I joined Korn Ferry and Diversey - two amazing companies - where I now further built upon my EMEA and global experience in recruitment. Throughout the years I have held several Senior Recruitment Business Partner, Talent Acquisition Partner, Lead and Project Management roles. I am at my best when I work in an international environment, have a strong advising role, can work on strategic/visionary projects and help an organization to improve by thinking on both the long term as well as translating it to a shorter term action plan. \n\nPeople value me for my writing skills, my ability to strategize and plan, to take action and book results.\n\n** The views expressed on this LinkedIn, any posts or any comments made are solely my personal opinion **\n\n\u2666 Recruitment Business Partner \u2666 Talent Acquisition \u2666 Agile \u2666 Ex-IBM \u2666 Global \u2666 Employer branding \u2666 Design Thinking \u2666 Strategy \u2666 Leadership \u2666 Goal oriented \u2666 Driven \u2666 Entrepreneur \u2666 Innovation \u2666 Motivation \u2666 Employer Branding \u2666 Candidate Journey \u2666 Talent Development \u2666 Change \u2666 Coaching \u2666 Servant Leadership \u2666 Training \u2666 Pro-active \u2666",
