Nokia led the revolution while Samsung and Sony Ericsson continued to build their legacy in this rapidly-changing field. Unsurprisingly, Facebook's exponential growth gained everyone\u2019s attention as they found themselves increasingly attached to small handheld screens! \n\nIn Sweden however, three tech savvy entrepreneurs had a different vision - one that extended beyond simply listening music; if only you could watch movies directly from your phone? This was THE spark of inspiration needed \u2013 allowing these Swedish innovators to create something truly cool!!\n\nArash Pendari, Christer Hernestig and Maddox-Rudolf Burhall had extensive knowledge in game development, streaming services and mobile marketing - all they needed was the resources to make their dream come true! \n\nFrom Stockholm\u2019s southern suburbs the trio took up an ambitious challenge: create Mobile TV with such cutting edge technology it would revolutionize content consumption for years to come. In 2007 this revolutionary concept finally became reality, and becoming the worlds first service to stream movies to mobile devices. Whilst Netflix had just began offering subscribers the option to stream directly to their homes through the internet, these entrepreneurs were three steps ahead and launched \"Film i Mobilen\" for the Swedish telco Tele2/Comviq in 2009. \n\nDespite having small screens with low resolution - those early entrepreneurs embraced headphones as primary accessories and; ingeniously devised surround sound technologies that provided users exceptional entertainment experiences. The first iPhone came later that year \u2013 changing our lives as we know it today!",
