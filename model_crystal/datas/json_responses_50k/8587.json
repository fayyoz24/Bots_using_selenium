    "summary": "Originally I have an academic background in Marketing & Sales and have an international experience working as a Brand Marketing Manager both in start-up and large corporate structures. People would describe me as a dynamic and enormously creative person with a can-do, positive attitude at all time. \n\nWithin the last 2 years I started to re-orientate my career and life path to focus on a happy heart and mind that benefits not only me but also the people around me. I realised that people are diverse and every person possesses a diverse spectrum of interets and talents. We are multifaceted human beings and I want to live my life accordingly, not only in my personal but also in my professional environment. For me those additional interests and passions lie in movement and creativity. \n\nI found out that my body is my temple. Movement is my medicine. Dancing and movement are part of my life since I was 12 and I pursued dancing (especially hip hop & Streetdance) classes at different studios in Austria and the Netherlands and participated at national and European Championships. To include movement into my career path, I therefore followed a teacher training in 2020 in Vienna/Austria called \"Mindful Body\", which is a holistic body & mind workout experience. It combines strength, cardio, mobility, dance and coordination for a overall fit body and works on deeper levels on the emotional state of mind. It helps release stress, blockages that are stuck within us and negative believes we might have about ourselves and the world we create. I now teach Mindful body lessons and organise (yoga) retreats around Europe to share my passion and help people to benefit from a deeper understanding of body, mind and soul. \n\nIn addition I am aiming to express my creativity in different ways like Marketing, finding creative solutions for clients, helping them to promote their businesses in a fun and effective way. Moreover I express my love for creativity with children. In my opinion it is beneficial to express one's inner child to get in contact with your FULL creative potential. I therefore love to work and play with children and teach them valuable lessons through movement, art, nature and mindfulness. It is important to teach our young generation from an early stage on what it means to truly be alive and seek what makes them fulfilled and balanced. My dream is to create an environment where they feel seen and heard and are able to grow and blossom every day.",

                    "description": "MINDFUL BODY is a 60-75 minute holistic body & mind workout experience. \nIt was founded 2017 in Vienna, by Verena Hoflehner.\n\nBy combining strength, cardio, mobility, dance and coordination it works the body in ways that lead to a leaner & overall fit body. But it is far more than that. It works on much deeper levels on the emotional state of mind. Through the body we access the mind. MINDFUL BODY helps giving our emotions a voice and understanding how strong we are. It allows us to connect with our inner Superhero. Understanding that this is our life. That we can either live it out of a place of fear or out of a place of love. That it is our choice.",
