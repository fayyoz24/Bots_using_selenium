    "summary": "Currently, I am working as an electrical engineer in the motor design section of Praxis Automation Technology, B.V. Prior to this, I worked as an embedded software engineer in the same company for over one year where I was involved in grid modelling. I completed my M.Sc. in electrical power engineering specialising in power electronics and electrical machines from TU Delft. I enjoy coding, simulation and modelling. I am eagerly looking forward to a career that involves research, programming, modelling, and simulation in the area of electrical engineering.",

The model was built in MATLAB and COMSOL with LiveLink to interface between them. Codes to calculate motor performance from the model was developed. The results were compared with existing data and validated. ",
