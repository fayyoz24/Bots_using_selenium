    "summary": "When I was a kid, all I wanted to be was an astronaut. Fortunately I didn't wise up. I am still aiming for the stars - and I get things done with the speed of a rocket. \n\nI am a true believer in win-win - creating transactions between people where alle parties benefit. \n\nI like to enjoy a good glas of single malt and to drive motorcycle. Though not at the same time. \n\nSumin' it all up: \n\n-- I am a fun guy to be around\n\n-- I don't care if I get credit, just as long as stuff gets done and I get paid\n\n-- I rarely get angry, but when I do ... it has the impact of a sledgehammer. In the good way (I hope). \n\n-- When I see a fire, I run toward it. \n\n\n\n",
