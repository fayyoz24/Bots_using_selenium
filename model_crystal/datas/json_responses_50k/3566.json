We want to improve the Vocational Education and Training and adult training fields in Europe by forwarding innovative and creative approaches that will make for more attractive classes, better employment chances and more active people. Our goal is to give you, the trainers or educators, the right tools to create the right environment for your students to thrive both in the classroom, but more importantly, on the labor market, after completing your classes. So we want to promote the development, testing and implementation of innovative practices/methodologies in VET. First we\u2019ll need to research good practice examples about innovation in VET. Then we\u2019re going to transfer the knowledge about the methodologies through a series of interactive guides. To promote and encourage extensive exploitation and dissemination we will create a website integrated with Wiki, a Blog and we\u2019ll do our best to share it all on Social Networks. Our educational resources will be available through open licences. We will organize multiplier events and get stakeholders involved to ensure the dissemination of our intellectual outputs. So our main output will be our knowledge. We will try to make it available to as many people as we can. We will create a series of guides that we will freely share on all our communication channels\n\nEntrepreneurship education,\nWork-Based Learning,\nCreative Problem Solving Methodology,\nWeb 2.0 tools for VET,\nGamification, Simulation and Digital storytelling,\nOpen Educational Resources,\nECVET implementation.\n\n\n\n\n",

It is evident, that without an active implementation of innovative forms and methods of education, and above all, distance learning at all levels of education these objectives cannot be successfully achieved. At the same time we should identify an existing problem - the fact that e-learning methodology is not yet fully developed and specified, both within the EU and in Ukraine. Developing and implementation of the system designed to develop IT competences of contemporary specialist, in particularly the future teachers, current teacher, leadership, based on the systematic use of selected Internet technologies, such as some LCMS systems (as Moodle), Massive Open Online Courses, \"virtual classroom\" technology, social media, other selected Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. technology positively contributes to the development of skills in the area of IT and intercultural competences. The IRNet project aims to set up a thematic multidisciplinary joint exchange programme dedicated to research and development of new tools for advanced pedagogical science in the field of ICT instruments, distance learning and intercultural competences in EU (Poland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia) and Third Countries (Australia, Russia, Ukraine). The programme will strengthen existing collaboration and establish new scientific contacts through mutual secondments of researchers. The main objectives of the project are: 1. to exchange expertise and knowledge in the field of the innovative techniques of education between EU and Third Countries and suggest effective strategies of implementing new tools in their profession; 2. to analyze and evaluate social, economic, legal conditions, as well as methodologies and e-learning techniques being developed in the European and Third Countries involved.",

During the 2 years of project implementation, project partners will collect good practice examples of ICT tools for a better ageing, volunteering and active European remembrance in their countries which can be transmitted to other places as well as compare their local backgrounds in the field of employment, health care, social services, adult learning, volunteering, housing, IT services and transport for aged people. Project activities will allow partners to generate some guidelines to teach the elders a conscious approach to ICT resources and to give them an opportunity to have a dialogue with younger generation using Open Space Technology. By the end of the project E-book of guidelines will be published and shared with stakeholders.",

The network society rests upon the more dynamic relationships among persons who all function in several networks at the same time. It results in accepting the notion of heterarchy rather than hierarchy; One person can be an authority in one sense and an early beginner in another. As a consequence it stimulates societies to accept that there is no such a thing of absolute leadership; We can only  contribute from our specific blend of experiences, expertises and temperaments. Education in the networked society needs to coach young persons to let them develop blends of skills, memorization and problem solving. The essence is that learning is accepted to be a highly individual process that needs a large variety of situations and a focus on the growing of one's self-organisation and efficacy.",

His doctoral research explored methods for hypertext and concept mapping in learning. Since 1982 he developed educational technology as an engineering approach for learning and teaching.  His main thesis is that technology is catalytic for human ambition and awareness. His main function is associate professor in the University in Twente, The Netherlands and adjunct/visiting professor in various countries. He taught more than fifteen bachelor-, master- and PhD courses and supervised more than 30 PhD students. \nHe instigated and coordinated the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Cognitive Technologies in 1990 and a large series of Joint European Research Projects in: authoring multimedia, web-based learning, teacher education, virtual 3d worlds, constructivist learning, social media, web-based communities and international student exchange.\nUNESCO awarded his work in ICT for Education in Eastern Europe with the title of Honorary Professor. The Capital Normal University in Beijing awarded his work with the title of Honorary Doctor. He is member of advisory boards in ministries of education and academia of sciences in Singapore, Finland and Russia. \nPiet Kommers is the initiator of the international journal for web-based communities and overall chair of the IADIS conferences on societal applications of ICT. Since the late nineties he gave more than 40 invited and keynote lectures at main conferences in the fields of education, media and communication. \nHis books and journal articles address the social and intellectual transformations at each transition from \u201ctraditional\u201d into the \u201cnew\u201d media. Instead of regarding media as extrapolating, supplanting, vicarious or even disruptive, Piet\u2019s view is that new media elicit and seduce both individuals and organizations to reconsider human nature and challenge existential awareness at that very moment.",
