    "summary": "Assistant professor at Utrecht University in the methodology & statistics department. I run the ODISSEI Social Data Science team -- we help social scientists in the Netherlands with data science and computation, from data collection to answering research questions with novel digital methods.\n\nI also teach various courses in programming, statistics, and data analysis.\n\nMy PhD research was on extending structural equation models for modern data problems. Graduated from the Methodology & Statistics research master at Utrecht University. Before that, I also obtained a master's degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2014, studying Organisational and Social Psychology with an interest in group dynamics and organisational decision-making. My BA is from University College Utrecht, with majors in psychology and economics and minors in neuroscience and statistics. \n\nNext to my main occupations as a statistician and a programmer, I enjoy photography & squash. In the past I also obtained a Snowboard instructor licence and taught at a ski school in Austria.\n\nI am fluent in Dutch and English, and possess a medium level of German and Italian.",
