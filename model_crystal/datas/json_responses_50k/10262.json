The participants came from a variety of disciplines, giving the NAHSS a unique multidisciplinary character. The summer program has not only expanded in the number of participants, but also geographically: 40 students attended the International Summer School at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 15 students attended the summer school at the National Chenghi University of Taiwan, and 15 students followed courses at the National Taiwan University. In addition to the summer school courses, the students worked on four distinct projects. The students reunited in Shanghai to attend a business week where they conducted business visits at Dutch companies and entrepreneurs.\n\nAn important element in this Summer school was participating in a project called Chinese Top Ten. In this project, the candidates worked as a consultant for several Dutch multinationals to help solve the issue of gaining and retaining Chinese Top Talent. This way the companies get valuable research and students get a unique insight in the day-to-day operations of Dutch companies in Asia.",

Just like a real library, where books provide an insight to unknown worlds, the Human Library offers its visitors the chance to step into the world of another person. In a very simple way: by providing a space for a nice conversation.\n\nSee for more information: https://www.thehumanlibrary.nl"
