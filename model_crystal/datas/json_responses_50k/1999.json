    "summary": "I am a lecturer in the department of Literary & Cultural Analysis at the University of Amsterdam, where I currently teach courses in critical and cultural theory, decolonial studies, and gender & sexuality studies.  \n\nI obtained my PhD -  a study where, through the work of Sylvia Wynter, Raymond Williams, and Laurent Berlant, I investigate genres of spatialization and their affective and political function in popular cultural imaginations of non-urbanized geographies \u2013 at the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis (ASCA) as part of the ERC-funded project \u2018Imagining the Rural in a Globalizing World\u2019. I work across transnational and interdisciplinary fields of decolonial and queer studies, and my research interests are mainly concerned with the relations between knowledge-production/epistemology, affect, and politics as well as the comparative cultural analysis of settler colonialism, non-urban space, sexuality, race, genre, and pop culture. \n\nYou can find my writing in PhiloSOPHIA, Collateral Journal for Cross-Cultural Close Reading, Junctions, Armada: Tijdschrift voor Wereldliteratuur, and my latest writing appears in the edited volume Planetary Hinterlands: Extraction, Abandonment, and Care (Palgrave 2023). Currently I am co-editing a forthcoming volume with Esther Peeren on cultural imaginations of the rural (Thamyris), and am working on a monograph titled Genres of Rurality: Unsettling Affect in Popular Imaginations of the Globalized US Rural.",

Fonds on Tour vormde ruim anderhalf jaar een letterlijk en virtueel platform (www.fondsontour.nl) waarop het Fonds Podiumkunsten in gesprek ging met heel veel verschillende betrokkenen-bij-de-podiumkunsten. Startpunt vormde de vraag wat er nodig is voor een bloeiende en gezonde toekomst van de podiumkunsten. Het 'Supplement Fonds on Tour' is de weerslag van verhitte discussies, enthousiaste pleidooien en nieuwe inzichten. Naast de evaluaties van subsidieregelingen, onze jaarverantwoordingen, het advies van de Raad voor Cultuur en de uitgangspuntenbrief van minister Bussemaker is het een pijler onder de denkrichtingen voor de periode 2017-2020.",

My study engages these understandings as determinately affective in their function and, as such, I provide an analysis of what kind of divergent feelings dominant genres of US rurality manage, and investigate how such feelings inform political mobilizations of the US rural in a contemporary moment that is marked by a supposed increasing rural-urban divide. This interrogation of imagined US ruralities is not merely important to the national context, as particular desires and anxieties managed by dominant imaginations of the US travel globally. By turning my attention to critical reframings of US rural and non-urbanized space, I ask what happens when, for example, queer, Black, and/or Indigenous subjects, experiences, and histories interrupt dominant historical and contemporary imaginations of US rurality. At the same time, while critical and subversive rearticulations of US rurality can certainly misalign rural-urban binaries and divides, redirect normative feelings that stick to US rural geographies, and potentially inform different political futures, such texts also often fall back on some of the insidious and exclusionary promises dominant genres of rurality exude. This suggests that it will take a great deal of imaginative and affective labor to radically unhinge the popular imagination of the globalized US rural from the good-life promises it has articulated since the early days of settler colonialism and prompts my main question: what kinds of collective and ambiguous attachments, fantasies of belonging and moments of discontent, affective investments and disinvestments, and political stakes do contemporary imaginations of US rurality manage, and for whom?",

It is open to anyone interested in careful close readings. ReadingRoom is meant to create an open and inclusive space for substantial and meaningful conversations in the humanities, the arts and beyond. ReadingRoom holds one thematic series per year, with 4-6 meetings per series. Each time we base our conversations on a few key texts (including films & artworks) from a wide range of disciplines. Thematic series include: speculation & fabulation (critique in the SF mode); relationality - envisioning new wor(l)dings; Who Cares? - Politics and Poetics in the Affirmative; un/learning: the p/re/distribution of knowledge.\n\nAbout Terra Critica:\nTerra Critica is an international and interdisciplinary research network in the critical humanities. It provides different platforms that bring together scholars specializing in critical and cultural theory, as well as practitioners in education, activism and the arts. The network aims to reexamine critical theory and practice under the conditions of the 21st century \u2013 in light of our terran existences that are globally entangled across flows of capital, people, and ideas. Given the persistent need to decolonize knowledge and institutional practice, as well as the fact that we are living in interdependent ecological and economic systems with growing inequalities, our critical vocabularies and practices also have to be refined and revised.",

My main fields of work include assisting the director and head of policy & development in researching what socio-economic changes are impacting the national performing arts industry and how to adjust the organisation's policy to those changes. Research includes topics like diversity issues (changing audience demographics),  (increasing) collaborations between producing and presenting parties in a regional/national/international context (supply and demand issues), (new) financial and organisational models used by performing arts organisations, and interpretations and measurements of quality. As a project leader on 'Fonds On Tour' I organise smaller expert meetings and national meetings on these topics and co-write, edit and produce on- and offline publications.",
