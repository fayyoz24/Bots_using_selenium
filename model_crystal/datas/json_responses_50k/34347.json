    "summary": "\u201cThe biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams\u201d. Born and raised in the city of the \u201cdeeds, no words mentality\u201d, I practice what I preach in following my dreams. Being a global citizen and passionate about people, I thrive on making connections among people of different cultures and backgrounds \u2013 all around the world. \n\nThe core of what I do has always been People. I thrive on the human component in change, development and growth. Started my career as (digital) global change manager, helping international companies in translating complex executive strategy into practical operations. I developed not only the implementation plan, but stayed involved till the full adoption. From the executive to the operational level, I keep all stakeholders in mind and I'm experienced in executing on all levels. \n\nWith this experience in my backpack, I fully focus now on People Development. As Head of People Growth for the Dutch scale-up Secfi, I am responsible for the development of our own Leadership Program, all Training & Development projects, the creation of a future-proof Progression Framework and Company Culture projects. Letting others grow and simultaneously growing myself, brings a big smile on my face.\n\nMy way of working is passionately learning by agile doing, together with a team, turning complexity into simplicity, crossing borders of all kinds. Key words: people \u00b7 growth \u00b7 creative \u00b7 strategy \u00b7 global \u00b7 start small - grow big \u00b7 celebrate milestones & enjoy life.",
