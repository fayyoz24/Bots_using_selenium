In addition to that, I took part in the filming procedure and was one of the students, my role was the smart, well prepared and easy talker student , who participated in the tutorial sessions that will be used in the training. \nI enjoyed being able to use my skills in organization and group work in this project. Moreover, I learnt more about the different aspects that tutor should focus on and how we as students could help tutors in improving the whole dynamic of the group.",

I participated in arranging different activities and met locals to speak up against violence and promote equality. I was also able to gain a lot of knowledge about gender issues and how to stand up for my own rights and the rights of others. \nDuring the project, I enjoyed making presentations, video's and posters to illustrate my own idea's. In addition, we organized a couple of cultural nights where we had the chance to learn about each other's culture, food, songs and languages. The participants were from 6 different countries: Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria. This mix gave me an incredible opportunity to expand my knowledge about the various people and cultures exist on this planet!",
