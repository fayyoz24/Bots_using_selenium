    "summary": "If you ask people to describe me in one word, they are probably going to say that I am a thinker.  \n\nIn my opinion, the biggest challenge of our time is the climate crisis and the transition to a (more) sustainable society. I want to be a part of this transition, so I spend most of my time thinking about solutions for sustainability issues. \n\nTo better equip myself with the skills needed to tackle sustainability problems, I decided to study the master Sustainable Entrepreneurship. This gave me the space to think up concrete, practical and innovative ideas with others. It was a discussion room to exchange opinions and a stage to share insights in one, augmenting my ability to work in a team and my aptitude for public speaking. \n\nThis year, I decided to study a second master in Identities and Cultures of Europe at Trinity College in Dublin, because I believe that the cultural transition necessary to tackle the climate crisis is greatly underexplored. Technological solutions only will not get us there. We need to collectively adopt a different mentality towards our relation with the world around us. A different identity if you will. \n\nMy dad always told me it is all good and well, talking about theory, but in the end it is about getting it across to others. He did not know it then, but involving all your 'stakeholders' is a core concept of sustainability thinking, and one I want to work on. I want to bring theory back down to the ground, so we can change our way of living from the bottom up. By rooting theory firmly in practice it becomes accesible and utile for the people for whom climate issues are a daily reality.\n\nSo if you're passionate like me to further sustainability through connection, don't hesitate to take the first step and connect by reaching out.",
