    "summary": "Growing businesses is what makes me excited - this is driven by my interest in commercial strategy covering sales & marketing, leadership, and anything that is concerning 'digital\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m currently building experience and skills as a Strategy & Business Development Manager in the European heating & cooling industry. At Vaillant Group we take care of a better climate, and I'm happy that we push the energy transition forward.\n\nSpeaking from experience, I particularly enjoy working together and leading teams. Doing so made me see and believe in the power of synergy and stakeholder value. In this process, I aim to bring value to the table by making use of:\n- an analytical and strategic skillset\n- my entrepreneurial mindset \n- project and stakeholder management with effective communication\n\nOverall, I see myself as ambitious and as a problem-solver. It's therefore not so unexpected that I always give 100% to challenge the status quo and chase growth.",
