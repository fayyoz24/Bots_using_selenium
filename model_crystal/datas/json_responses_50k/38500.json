    "summary": "My passion for fish ecology, biodiversity and nature conservation runs like a thread through my academic career. Communication, dedication, perseverance, and patience are all key parts of my work. My strengths are in conducting fundamental research, communicating with scientists and volunteers from various research fields, and providing constructive solutions by balancing the interests of various stakeholders. I'm always looking for new ways to get people and organisations to collaborate effectively in order to promote conservation. I believe that transboundary cooperation is essential for effective conservation of freshwater biodiversity and that this should be facilitated as much as possible through science.\n\nVisit my personal website http://twanstoffers.com",

For each species the relative abundance (MaxN) and fish length is measured and species richness is related to different sampling areas. Sampling areas are categorized in habitat types using a 6-point scale (A-F) to relate species richness to habitat type.\n2.\tFor the top 15 fish species (families) occurring on the Saba bank, some of the 35 ecomorphological traits are obtained by dissection. With FFM (Sibbing and Nagelkerke, 2001) the species are classified in trophic groups according to morphological traits, based on their feeding strategies. The composition of trophic groups is analyzed per habitat type and differences are related between habitat types and fishing pressure.\n3.\tFish community structures (trophic groups) on the Saba bank are obtained in areas with and without fisheries activity. In this way effect of fisheries on fish community structures (trophic groups) are analyzed. When present, further analysis of the data is done to establish the extent of the influence of fisheries on the community structures.\n",

Feeding experiments were done to study the ontogeny of eye movement (eye version and vergence) and speed of approach in relation to successful prey capture events in newborn fish. The relation between these parameters and the development of the probability of successful prey capture was used to describe the change in preying skills over time. From an evolutionary perspective, development of these parameters should result in a decreased probability of unsuccessful prey capture events. Changes in preying skills can roughly be explained by learning processes (experience) and maturation of the body (age of fish). In order to distinguish between those two processes, the parameters are analyzed both in time (age of fish) and experience (successive number of prey capture events). The probability of unsuccessful prey capture events declined with both age and experience. Decreasing eye vergence and version angles and increasing speed of approach levels were found in newborn viviparous fish during development. The change is eye movement parameters could indicate a process of automating the eye-body coordination, which is a learned behavior. Newborn fish rely mainly on visual feedback during their prey capture events, while older fish use less visual feedback and rely more on their experience. The increasing average speed levels in time could be explained by the development of more muscle tissue (maturation of the body) and better control over motor activities due to developmental programs in the brain and continuous sensory feedback. The influences of other parameters on prey capture events in newborns of Girardinus metallicus are still unknown and can only partly be extracted from the dataset of this study.",

Coral bleaching is a process in which corals expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae partners due to environmental stress factors. Both bleaching events and global temperature have increased the last decades and there has been increasingly more evidence that elevated seawater temperature directly cause coral bleaching, but there is not always a significant correlation. Other factors that cause stress in corals may contribute to the outbreak of local and worldwide bleaching events, such as: pathogenic infections; decreased salinity; exposure to low tides; sedimentation; increase in solar radiation; cyanide fishing; increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and a combination of these factors.",
