    "summary": "My passion is creating beautiful things and express myself in creative ways which can come in multiple forms. From writing a blog post to taking and editing pictures, and from helping someone to find the perfect dress to an event and do their makeups to plan and create the pages of a bullet journal or a diary.\n\nCreativity, structured work, and to find the best possible solution to a problem are significant parts of my everyday life, both regarding my private life and work or school. Being creative and organised can help me to see through multiple projects at the same time, and to keep the time frames. I am that kind of person who has a list of a list, and who considers every small detail before making a decision. But this structured work has helped me multiple times, for example by never running late with works or to try to get prepared for the most unexpected situations as well.\n\nAs the project manager of the web design team at Maastricht University, by organising meetings with the team both online and offline, keeping notes of the meetings and the works of the team members, making plans from time to time, and communicating efficiently not just with the web designers, but the other participants of the project as well, it brought the web design team a 10/10 as the final grade.\nFor a longer period, I was obsessed with the world of fashion magazines, which led me to a stylist course where I had the chance to learn from the best specialist of this field in Hungary. This course, and my passion for writing led me to my Bachelors, where I studied Communication and Media studies with Journalism major. However, in these three years I had the chance to work with the University\u2019s Instagram and blog, and to experience how it is like to be on both sides of the camera, which has become a new passion next to writing.\n\nAfter finishing my BA, I started to work, but never stopped looking for opportunities to learn and to improve myself. I took a blog writing course with one of the best bloggers in Hungary and started to create my own creative content as well.\n\nHowever, after a few years of working, I felt the need for something else, I wanted to know what I was working with more in depth. The University of Maastricht offered a course called MA Media Studies: Digital Cultures that had everything I wanted, therefore in 2022, I moved to The Netherlands, which I fell in love with immediately. This country offers so many opportunities, and I cannot wait to discover them!",
