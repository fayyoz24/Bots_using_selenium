Except for regular teaching schedule, I also assisted the headteacher with school culture constructions. In addition, I also participated in an environment protection project with the cooperation of colleagues from Nokia, especially in promoting the campaign of e-recycle in high schools.\n\nSeeing the similarity and variety of communities over countries is very interesting. And working out ways to solve local development problems and equality issues is a treasure in my life experience."
