The goal is to host an event which will become food for thought, since several fields will be covered, such as technology, entrepreneurship, culture, art, design, science and education.\n\nThe speakers will share their experiences and ideas, in an inspirational way which the audience will be intrigued to see things from a different perspective. We plan to motivate the youth to take action today, in order to build the future which we desire to live in."
