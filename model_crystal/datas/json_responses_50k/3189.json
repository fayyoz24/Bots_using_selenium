    "summary": "Experienced researcher, with a history of working in the museum world and higher education. Skilled in curating, writing for various audiences, and teaching. Scheduled to complete a Doctor of Philosophy in Art & Archaeology from Princeton University in spring 2024. \n\nMy work centers on early modern art and architecture. My current project focuses on the Hanse -a pan-European organization of merchants and cities- and the way its members employed art to build their polity. Investigating drawings, engravings, maps, paintings, and architecture, commissioned by a group of influential Hanse merchant-diplomats in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century, help us to discern the self-perception of the merchants and how they positioned themselves and their organization in an increasingly globalizing world. Ultimately, I plea for an art history of institutions. Before starting the PhD program in Princeton, Suzie worked in contemporary art as curator of exhibitions and public programs.\n\nI am keen on communicating stories yet untold, but that remain crucial for our understanding present-day societal, political, religious, and economic issues. \n\nMy research interests include: early modern art and architecture (1400-1800), relation between image and text, urban history, politics, trade, global art history, art collecting and patronage studies, historiography, cartography, artistic networks, and the history of institutions.",

Contributions explored novel perspectives on and approaches to the late life and afterlife of the Hanse. Our participants consider how our view of the Hanse, its people, and its encounters with the non-Hanseatic world changes if we focus on art, everyday life, or political and intellectual currents in the period of its supposed decline from the sixteenth century onwards.\n\nThe symposium was a collaboration between Princeton University's Department of Art & Archaeology and the Amsterdam School for Historical Studies of the University of Amsterdam.",

Graduate Students and distinguished guest speakers investigated how people and institutions adapt to changing global circumstances, not only in the economic and political sphere, but in art, culture, and society. The Symposium showcased reflections on the various transformations that took place in the past few years, which unfolded in a series of workshops and round table conversations.\n\nThe organizers of the symposium set out to inquire and analyze the ways that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dividing line between what we call a \u201cpre-\u201d and \u201cpost-\u201d moment. The unprecedented transformation calls for a re-evaluation of established methods, and demands scholars to forge new paths and strategies toward research, theory, and critical engagement of art history and the humanities. As art historians, we used to assume that looking at an object must take place in real space and time, within the three-dimensional spaces of our world. Today, such encounters are more ambivalent, as they are being increasingly facilitated within virtual or augmented settings, affecting the way we look at and think about objects. We asked, in what ways have conventional art historical narratives and methodologies been disrupted or destabilized? How has our discipline transformed or adapted to recent events? How have arts education and pedagogy been impacted by the shift toward the digital? And consequently, what is the future of art history? How can art history incorporate and engage with these new ways of \u201clooking,\u201d both sensorial and conceptual? To address this question, it is imperative that we reconsider access to objects, archives, and sites. This, in turn, leads us to grapple with theoretical frameworks and new realities and conditions, from political reckonings to racial justice to ever more marked financial disparities.",

The VNK is committed to advocating for historians of art and architecture in the Netherlands and promoting the professional practice of art history. I am serving on the board to advance and support art historical research. Within this framework I coordinate the awarding of two prizes for excellent scholarship. The Karel van Mander Prize is awarded to an author for an outstanding art historical publication -each year in a different sub-category- that appeared in the past five years. The Jan van Gelder Prize grants support to an art historian under 35 for an outstanding doctoral dissertation.",
