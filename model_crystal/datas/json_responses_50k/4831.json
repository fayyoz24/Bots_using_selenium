Sustainable Investment Framework Navigator app is an online tool that helps measure the sustainable investment outcomes of portfolios and provides insight into the impact of investments on people, the environment and society. It measures the alignment of investment portfolios with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The tool meets the demands of a broad range of investors seeking greater insight into the societal and environmental impacts of individual investments and the impacts at a portfolio level. It provides an instant dashboard on the sustainability of a fund.\n\nThe Navigator can be used for:\n- Gaining insights into the current impact of an investment portfolio, and to track changes in its impact over time\n- Reporting the impact of an investment portfolio to both internal and external stakeholders\n- Assessing asset managers according to the impact of their investment portfolio, instead of strictly focusing on the more traditional approach",
