    "summary": "I am a highly motivated International Relations and Diplomacy graduate with years of experience in positions all across the globe. For my bachelor's degree, I focused largely on Cold War history and European-Russian relations in the post-Soviet era. Now, during my graduate studies, I have developed a strong interest in the effects the globalization of far-right extremism and the digitalization of the world have on politics and am currently developing two research projects related to this subject.\n\nWhile I am pursuing a MA in International Security, I am looking to expand my experience in the practical field and am open to part time positions and internships.",
