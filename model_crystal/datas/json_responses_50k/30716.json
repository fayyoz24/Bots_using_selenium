    "summary": "Hi there! Currently following the Biomedical Sciences (Neuroscience track) Master at Leiden University. I have a several experiences working in laboratories on various projects ranging from epilepsy to behavioural research in humans.\nI have skills in communication in English, Laboratory work, Teamwork, and Research.  I graduated from Leiden University with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences. As a minor, I studied the Geo-Resources for the Future course at the TU-Delft. \nIn my free time, I am collaborating on a European culture exchange project called Philoxenia. We aim to bring together participants from 10 different countries to grow as individuals, to unite as a group, and to shape the future. \nFurthermore, I love doing sports such as climbing and cycling. In my evenings, I cook with my friends and play board games.",

We brought together participants from 8 different countries in a place where we could share our knowledge, passions and feelings in an informal manner. We created strong bonds between all participants and connected foreigners with the city of Genk and the museum of LaBiomista. Overall, I contributed to:\n- organising activities and hosting a workshop on theatre and mindfulness. \n- organising the logistics of travels, payments, and reservations. \n- generating a youthpass certificate (EU recognition tool) for participants\n\n \n\nCurrently working on the next edition of the cultural exchange and collaborating with 2 additional countries to setup an even larger network of young adults.",
