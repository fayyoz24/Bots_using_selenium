    "summary": "Dutch student at the Amsterdam University of applied sciences currently attending an International Business and Management programme.  During my academic years in high school, I followed a bilingual program at VWO level which is the highest level of high school education taught in the Netherlands . This resulted in me earning my First certificate in English Degree.  I am currently working on earning my CPE degree this year which is the highest possible degree a non-native English speaker can get. \n\nFrom 2012 to 2016 I've been traveling a lot over the world due to a professional sports career. During this time I was privileged to experience and capture the beauty of a wide variety of countries like Italy, Mexico, Egypt, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. All these beautiful experiences made it possible for me to become a social, respectful and open-minded person.\n\nAfter this period in life my the travelling lifestyle did not come to an end. I decided to combine my love for traveling with my academic career. I followed a minor called \" Building partnerships in South-east Asia\" which enabled me to study abroad in China. Next in my academic journey I did a 1 year exchange program at Chico state university which is one of the top ranked state universities in California. \n\nMy interests range from music production, traveling and art to several sports like Judo and kickboxing. I have a passion for high-end fashion and would love to see myself develop and make a career in this branch over the coming years. My current plan for the coming years is to keep on developing and improving myself and in addition to this finishing my bachelor degree. Continuous improvement and self-awareness about possible progress is the key to success.\n\nMy goal for the future is to become a successful entrepreneur in the fashion industry. I am looking forward to continue along the path that will make me more responsible and complete as a person, and therefore to embrace continuous change and development in order to deliver an added value in any situation or context.",
