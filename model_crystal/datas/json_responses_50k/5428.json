    "summary": "While my research projects are diverse in their empirical focus, they share a conceptual approach that explores three key themes: gender, violence, and protection. Since completing my PhD in 2020 I have developed 3 research projects that I outline below. These projects are all in early scoping phases, and my plan is to develop several individual and collaborative research grant proposals in 2022.\n\nProject Title: Gender and Disaster Response in Europe 2022-2023 \nRationale and Key Aims: Despite existing EU agendas to address gender based violence (GBV) and climate change little attention has been paid to the relationship between natural disasters and GBV. \n\nProject Title: Civil Society Influence and the Politics of Protection 2023-2026\nRationale and Key Aims: The study will examine how the international community interacts with civil society organizations (CSOs) in understanding when and how to respond to violence against civilians. The theoretical and empirical aims of this project can therefore be read as a continuation of my doctoral research. \n\nProject Title: Technologies of Deterrence: AI and Protection 2023-2027\nRationale and Key Aims: In a recent article Programming the Machine: Gender, Race, Sexuality, AI, and the construction of credibility and deceit at the border, my colleague Dr Clapton (UNSW, Australia) and I explored the EU\u2019s use of AI technologies as part of border and migration management practices. In this article we engaged with 3 sets of literature 1) risk and security 2) AI and ethics, and 3) race, gender, and (in)security. We are currently working to develop a proposal that will investigate how the EU and Australia use AI technologies in the areas of migration, refugee protection, and border control management. \n\nPrior to my PhD work I was employed at UNHCR\u2019s Global Learning Centre as a research and training officer. During this time I have developed particular expertise on the design and delivery of training for government counterparts and humanitarian workers on refugee law, the legal framework relating to internally displaced persons and sexual and gender-based violence.  This involves combining knowledge of the relevant areas of refugee law and developments in this field with different learning methodologies to promote the use and implementation of the relevant bodies of international law.",

Owing a significant intellectual debt to feminist scholars of International Relations (IR) and International Law who have demonstrated the gendered conceptualisation and practice of civilian protection (inter alia Gardam and Charlesworth 2000; Gardam and Jarvis 2001; Carpenter 2006; Sjoberg and Peet 2011 and Kinsella 2011) my PhD dissertation concentrates on the role of gendered logics in the discursive construction of protection norms. In armed conflict, the protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and the protection of civilians from mass atrocity crimes pose two distinct, yet interrelated, challenges to humanitarian and protection actors. During the 1990s, the failure to protect civilians and IDPs in Somalia, Bosnia and Rwanda from ethnic cleansing, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide prompted the development of a series of \u2018new\u2019 protection norms. To excavate the gendered logics of protection I analyse three normative frameworks i) The Responsibility to Protect (R2P); ii) frameworks designed to guide the protection of IDPs (the Guiding Principles and the Kampala Convention) and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. \n\nI treat these normative frameworks as case studies in order to investigate the gendered logics in the discursive construction of protection norms.",
