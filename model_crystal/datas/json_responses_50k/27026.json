    "summary": "I am going to Amsterdam in October to continue my education in Amsterdam University (Computational Science). I am actively looking for a job to combine with my education.\n\nExperienced software engineer with the passion for problem-solving. It is important for me to see the results of the work and make an impact on real people. I believe that readability and code cleanliness is the keystone to the future of any project. I am interested in big data technologies and machine learning. I have the experience in processing large amounts of data, building scalable and distributed systems. Also, I had an experience in applying machine learning to an enterprise solution. I always design and implement code responsibly and thoughtfully. I pay attention to the details and adhere to the principle: \u00abA good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street\u00bb. It is extremely important for me to share the same values with colleagues.",
