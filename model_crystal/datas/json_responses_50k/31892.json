    "summary": "Claire Staal was born on 7 March 1989, in Geldrop, The Netherlands. After highschool it was very clear that Claire wanted to travel and see more of the world. When she was 17 she travelled to Spain to study Spanish for 8 months and after to Brazil to learn some Portuguese for 2 months. \n\nShe attended the Hospitality Management School in Maastricht, The Netherlands. In the 2nd year she travelled to Shanghai (China), to do an internship with Sheriton Hotel Shanghai(Starwood) where she filled the position of F&B Manager. In her 3rd year, she did an exchange program with the University of Johannesburg(South Africa) and in her 4th and final year she did her final internship with Hilton Worldwide in South Africa where she was responsible for the marketing and sales for 14 Hilton Hotels in Africa. In 2014 Claire graduated and received her Bachelor of Business Administration.\n\nHer work career started in 2014 with Jovago.com, now called Jumia Travel, a company backed by Rocket Internet, MTN and Milicom in Nigeria as Head of Operations and Business Development. In July 2015 she was made Country Manager by launching the brand in Ghana and then promoted to Managing Director in 2016.\n\nSome achievements she made while working for Jumia Travel; signing up multiple award winning Nigerian artiste, Ice-Prince as brand ambassador for the company in Nigeria, being named among top 50 corporate business women in Ghana by the British Council and also Ghana\u2019s 60 most influential corporate women of 2016 by The Guardian Women. \n\nClaire is an example of somebody who works hard, never gives up, likes to go the extra mile and enjoys her life to the fullest. She loves passionate, positive and hardworking people but is completely put off by arrogant, loud and non-motivated people. In her free time she loves to travel and dance Salsa and Kizomba. Her goal in life is to visit at least half of all countries in the world, learn about their culture and traditions and experience the life they live.",
