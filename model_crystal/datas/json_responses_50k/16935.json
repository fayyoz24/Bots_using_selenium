The proposal suggested that their future project needed an environmental researcher to perform an analysis prior to installing a water system into a rural mountain-side village in Pastores, Guatemala. This experience enlarged my  interdisciplinary skills by attending bi-weekly meetings with professional engineers in order to participate in discussion regarding the EWB water project and assess the environmental analysis research plan. I independently created an environmental research project in order to accumulate data to better support the initial stages of the water project. I hired and oversaw a research assistant to help conduct the research once in the field. I conducted a fixed survey over 5 days amongst the residents and municipal officials of Pastores, Guatemala along with documenting and recording all environmental observations. I statistically evaluated all data and consolidated it into a report. The team and I presented our findings at the YouTube Headquarters in San Bruno, USA (November 18th). I also organized a vast breadth of fundraising events in order to raise money for the project, especially preparing and presenting to corporate donor meetings and reviewing grant applications."
