Studying this intrinsic response via uniaxial compression tests, allows us to quantify post-yield characteristics as localisation is absent. In order to provide understanding in the effect of various fillers on impact performance, Representative Volume Elements are analysed in which the intrinsic polymer behaviour is modelled with the use of a non-linear viscoelastic-plastic model. These results are subsequently brought into practice by application to impact tests of CFRP crash tubes, thereby generating the highest Specific Energy Absorption ever reported for epoxy-based composites.",
