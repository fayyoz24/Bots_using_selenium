    "summary": "Ever since secondary school, I have had a great interest in cells and everything related to them. What is a cell, how does a cell work and what can go wrong in a cell? But a future as a biologist was not for me, because there was also more that attracted my interest. Namely technology: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry were the fields that answered the many questions I had, which encouraged me to continue my studies in these science subjects.\n\nThat is why I chose to follow the bachelor Life Science & Technology at Leiden University and TU Delft. The focus in Leiden was more shifting towards fundamental research; what is a cell, what does a cell do? While in Delft we learned to apply this knowledge, as is done in the biotechnology industry. However, a career as an academic is not for me and I looked more broadly. After obtaining my bachelor's degree, I decided to take a gap year to get acquainted with the (bio) pharmaceutical industry, in order to perhaps further develop my interest there. To realize this, I started looking for an internship and I found it at Sanofi Genzyme (now Sanofi Specialty Care) in the Rare Diseases department. Which gave me a unique opportunity to get to know this industry at a young age.\n\nDuring this gap year, I came to realize that my interests converge in biopharmaceuticals. Which motivates me to choose a path that will take me further in this interesting and rapidly innovating industry. In doing so, I develop knowledge in; (digital) marketing, managing projects & working in a professional setting. These experiences are very valuable at my age, and I can take them with me when I follow my master's degree and work at my future employer. \n\nCurrently, I am pursuing my master Life Science and Technology and Business studies at the university of Leiden. By doing so I am preparing myself for the future.\n\nAt this age, it is also important that you develop further in other ways. That is why I am socially active; playing hockey, travelling, having a drink with friends, walking and getting to know new people are examples of this.\n\nFortunately, I am still young and many challenges and learning moments await me so that I can continue to shape and develop!",
