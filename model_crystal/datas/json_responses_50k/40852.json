    "summary": "\u201cJos can best be characterized as loyal, highly involved and reliable with a strong drive for motivating and managing his stakeholders and project team members in a professional, pragmatic and personal way.\u201d\n\nAs an international Telecom/IT pro I have built over a decade of experience in technical operational roles. I've managed software development and deployment projects, leading a multi-disciplinary group of people located in different teams, subprojects and geographical locations. I bring considerable experience in international software engineering/development projects, deployment projects, 3rd party integration projects, (out)sourcing and contract management including its cultural differences and challenges.\n\nIn the role of Technical/Operational Project Manager (Operational Product Manager) I managed the end-to-end process of software delivery starting with (customer) requirements definition, translating into clear statements of work for the development project manager, ensuring delivery within time and budget. My strength and passion is to develop and maintain sound working relations with (individuals within) project and/or development teams in order to get the best result \u2013 keep it simple and just make it happen! Over the past 1,5 years this is further extended in my role of Service Provider Manager.\n\nI gained my experience by working in the dynamic world of Telecommunications where performance and availability are a key factor. With systems handling extremely big volumes of traffic and data I am used to work under pressure, always committed to deliver in time.",

The customers were mainly European mobile telecom providers (e.g. Vodafone Germany, Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), Virgin Mobile UK, Meteor Ireland, Mobilkom Austria, Telenor Norway, KPN Mobile NL, etc.), but also outside Europe.\n Main activities and responsibilities:\n - Project management for a team of 2-8 software and installation engineers in several disciplines (requirements analysis, architecture, programming, testing, technical writing, installation, integration)\n - Requirement analysis and capturing\n - Risk management\n - Test management (around 1300 test cases to design, create and execute)\n - Quite often, due to the cultural differences, the challenge in these projects were to get clear agreement on the requirements of the customer \n - Despite the for sure interesting challenges and cultural differences, I managed to deliver the majority of the projects in time, within budget and in full satisfaction with customer expectations\n - Technical project lead on integration points, among others 3GPP defined MM integration points (provisioning, prepaid/postpaid charging, HLR, VAS, Inter-MMSC)\n - Organise and lead customer workshops to educate on integration points and agree on final implementation\n\n In addition, I worked on several bids for a number of international telecom operators. Main activities consisted of attending (technical) clarification meetings at customers during bid phase, assisting in completing RFI/RFQ responses, preparing offers, etc.",
