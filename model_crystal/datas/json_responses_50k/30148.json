    "summary": "From Spain, Seville, Andalucia, where I grew up and educated.\nAfter completing my university studies in human resources and later in criminology, including a year of studies in Lisbon, Portugal. I settled in Amsterdam in 2012 to develop myself personally and professionally. The first two years I worked in Tommy Hilfiger, where I reached a higher level of learning. This helped me develop my professional activity in Curvature. A company dedicated to network equipment solutions for the data center.\n\nI define myself as a positive, active person and I consider that we are surrounded by alternatives and opportunities. I know what it is to work in other countries and to surround myself with a multicultural work environment. At work, this helps me focus on results and clients. I have the knowledge and experience of adaptation. \n\nIn these past few years, I have learned a lot from the professionals with whom I collaborate and I highly value their sincerity and commitment.\nI seek to continue my professional development, if you would like to connect with me through Linkedin, I am open to everything that makes us grow together .",
