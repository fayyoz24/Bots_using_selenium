    "summary": "Do you want to have your product make an impact? Want to ensure your product is a success when it is launched? Are you struggling to \"cross the chasm\"?\n\nBy interacting with users through observation, interviews and asking the right questions, developing a product that suits the market's needs can be done in a shorter time frame, at a lower cost, and a higher rate of user acceptance.\n\nI bring commitment, energy and fresh ideas to a project. The path from a good idea to a great product revolves around learning from end users, asking the right questions and timely validation of ideas. When developing an idea into a viable product, we need technology to build it, and a way to make a business out of it. Traditionally, these were the main concerns in product development.\n\nWith technology becoming ubiquitous, ideas and implementations have become more divers and users more demanding. As a user experience designer I help to understand these users' demands, needs and expectations. Be confident you are building your product the right way before it goes to market!\n\nI aim to make things work in a way that feels obvious. To me, the greatest \u201cuser experience\u201d is when I see a design clicks with the user. More than anything I love to understand and communicate with people, work together with a team to explore ideas, and have the right ideas make it to a product.\n\nWant to see my portfolio?

Using building blocks and a multitude of integrations with, amongst others, biometrics and company data systems, there really is no limit to the security system that can be build using AEOS.\n\nBut with flexibility comes complexity. As the product has evolved over the last two decades, its power has become harder to harness. Based on a new paradigm, we went out to customers together with product management, the strategist and a UX team of two, to better understand their problems rather than their systems, and validated how well the new paradigm would fit their needs.\n\nWant to learn more?

On top of this, it was staging the development of new product, and they wanted to do things right.\n\nIn the early stages of this project, I spent time observing our products' users, mostly operator and technicians. I also spoke with support personnel and system architects, to get their goals and concerns clear.\n\nBased on this preliminary research, I created an innovative design concept to better match the goals of our customers and end-users. These principles were applied to newly added features, where they proved successful and appreciated. These principles were also applied to the preliminary interaction designs of a new system that was being built. I created a more task-oriented user interface framework, which was received very well by those involved.\n\nDecisions to cut R&D spending ended the user experience design project before it could be finished, although primary operator functions (which will be used daily) have been designed and are planned for implementation.\n\nAs part of this project, I designed a style guide that stays close to the Besi brand, specifically for the user interface of the latest Besi Packaging machines.\n\nWant to learn more?

Not only proofed this to be a perfect match between my interest in technical automation (product development), and user interfaces, also, the market had changed with more elaborate graphical (touch) user interfaces appearing on devices more and more.\n\nBacked by my education in Human Technology Interaction, I made the switch to full time User Experience Designer. As a User Experience Designer I have mostly done projects for large organizations such as Philips, ASML and Bosch. I also acted as the primary user experience design consultant for in-house projects, as well as advising teams working on projects for clients.\n\nDuring my time at the company, Philips TASS had went to several organizational transitions. A few years after I joined, the TASS division was sold off and operated independent of Philips. At the time I left, TASS was acquired by Altran Netherlands only a few months earlier.\n\nWant to learn more? Drop me a message, and I'll gladly send you a digital copy of my portfolio.",

From these insights, an innovative interaction concept was designed. Then, a conferencing systems style guide was developed, which had to stay true to the Bosch brand. Applying this style guide to each of the devices was challenging, as the devices differed in screen size (4\" and 7\"), modality (touch screen and hard buttons), and processing power (ranging from high end to energy saving).\n\n\nFor these projects I learned from and validated with many end users world wide. I interviewed them, observed similar products being used, and tested prototypes with them. The DICENTIS discussion devices and DICENTIS interpreter desk were both released with the newly designed user interface, whereas the DICENTIS multimedia is planned to be updated.\n\nWant to learn more?

                    "description": "At Philips AppTech our team worked on a prototype to share multimedia between ones personal devices. We built software for the Philips Streamium, Symbian-based devices (such as several high-end mobile phones at the time), Java-based devices and the PC.\n\nContent was shared over the internet, where it would be purchased via an online shop, or a QR-code printed on promotional material. To guard against misuse, the ownership of, and the content itself was protected by DRM (digital rights management).\n\nWe built a demo using an older Streamium, a (at the time) new Streamium, a Nokia N-Gage, a web based player, and PC application to manage the content. After content was purchased on one device, it could easily be played on the other devices. The DRM allowed for single or simultaneous playing of the content, and media paused on one device, could be continued on another. I showcased this demo at the NAB in Las Vegas, and during the IFA in Berlin.\n\nThe DRM developed for the demo became the foundation of what later would become Marlin DRM. I was the lead developer for the Java reference libraries created for this DRM system. Lessons learned from this were used to test and tune the specification, and were later used in several DRM projects within and outside of Philips.",

Living in remote villages without power, meant many students had no experience using computers. This would often be a complication when moving to the city for education or work.\n\nUsing donations from (mostly Dutch) schools, we assembled working sets of computers, monitors and power generators to these villages (at that time laptops were not as common as they are today). We installed the set-up in their classrooms and provided a teaching program that we specifically developed for these villages."
