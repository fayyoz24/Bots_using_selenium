    "summary": "I have 4 years teacher-training college experience in chemistry. After that, I have another 3.5 years laboratory experience in biology about protein interaction study during my master. Currently, I am the last year of my Ph.D. in University of Amsterdam about physical chemistry, here I am using fluorescence microscopy/ spectroscopy to study the organocatalysis reaction at the single molecule level, in which some fluorescence probes/ dyes are involved. The broad research fields in physical chemistry made me have an open mind for further scientific study and career development. I really like working with a group and interested in communicating with people. In my bachelor, I worked in the student union for 4 years. During my master, I supervised more than 4 individual bachelor student projects. In my Ph.D., except for the group teaching tasks, I also supervised 10+ individual bachelor/ master student projects. I am excited at the prospect of working in R&D center of the chemical company. ",

Applications in molecular chemistry, however, are still uncommon. In this thesis, the focus is mainly on the study of organic reactions catalysed by cinchona alkaloids. In order to monitor the reactions using fluorescence, catalysts and reagents carrying bright and photostable fluorophores were designed. For single molecule studies, reagents or catalysts are immobilized at surfaces of glass cover slips, allowing to observe single- molecule events.\n\u2022 Note: this work was submitted to Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences for publication.",

In this work, we measured the QY of 26 air-equilibrated dye solutions (15 different dyes) using the classical \u201crelative method\u201d with a set of 8 standard reference compounds. A similar set of measurements was carried out in 9 other laboratories in the framework of an IUPAC project. The results indicate that the inter-laboratory variability of QY measurements using standards is mostly < \u00b110%. Some of the dyes investigated could be considered as new standards. In some cases, pitfalls exist which can be avoided.",

Time-dependent kinetic studies of the process were performed for the first time by using static light scattering and western blot analysis, where the essential factors were revealed, offering a new biotechnical approach for virus control and/or the development of anti-viral agents. Pillarenes and calixarenes showed obvious inhibition of L1 pentamer formation via their selective binding to Arg and Lys residues at the monomer interface, which was reversible after the release of cyclic arenes.\n\u2022 Note: this work has 4 publications in international journals (e.g. Chem.
