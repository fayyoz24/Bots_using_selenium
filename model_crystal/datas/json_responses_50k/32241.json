    "summary": "I'm a Brazilian professional, based in Amsterdam.  \n\nOver the years I had the opportunity to work in several areas and positions: Journalism, Advertising, Logistics and Hospitality. \n\nThis expertise provided me with leadership skills, and strong communication and interpersonal relationships.\n\nAs a copywriter, I've worked as a Screenwriter, Head of Copy, Creative Planner and Content Manager. As a journalist, I've worked in newspapers, magazines and websites, writing about gastronomy, food, beverage, arts and tourism. \n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, I worked in the biggest communication group in Brazil: Globo Publishing/ Globo Network. I was responsible for creating campaigns, films, advertisements and spots for all products of the company. I also developed internal campaigns for the group.\n\nIn 2005, I decided to change and started working in the logistics area. Starting in a new field was a big challenge and a new lesson every day. Luckily, I had good teachers and great experiences working with amazing companies and awesome clients.\n\nUntil a new change came out to my life: I decided to move to the Netherlands. And it was what I did in 2016. But, without speaking Dutch, it wouldn't be easy.\n\nWorking with hospitality was the easiest way to start a new life in a different country. And it's what I'm doing so far. \n\nCurrently, I'm working as a Night Manager in one of the nicest hotels in Amsterdam: Park Plaza Vondelpark. A charming hotel in an amazing neighbourhood. \n\nLife is like that when you dare to look for what you want. Every day you can face a new challenge, learn something new and discover a new culture. That's what I'm doing. And I'm glad about that.\n\nMaybe the next step will be working with you. Why not?",
