A UTA is used in the offshore industry as a subsea termination point for control umbilicals used in the oil and gas industry. Due to increasing demands in operation of these terminations they have been growing drastically in size and weight for the last decade, up to a point where installation and design is become problematic.\n\nThe goal of this concept design study is to derive the essential requirements for a UTA, derive different concepts for a more compact UTA design and verify the feasibility of design in operation and installation risk analyses. Another design feature is that the UTA will be directly hydraulically coupled to the foundation subsea, saving installation time, decreasing possible leak paths and reducing costs. Evaluation of the concept is done with a multiple criteria design analyses method called Electre.",
