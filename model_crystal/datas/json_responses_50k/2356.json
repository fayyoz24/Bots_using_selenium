    "summary": "I am currently a Student at the Hogeschool van Arnhem and Nijmegen (HAN) as well as the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences (HBRS). At the HAN I study in the Life Sciences Bachelor Program and at the HBRS I am in the Applied Biology Bachelor Program. \nIn addition, I am currently in the last phases of my graduation internship, which I am doing at the Donders Centre for Neuroscience, researching the PKA/cAMP pathway in inhibitory axons. \nI started being interested in Biology during my time in Middle- and High School. Topics such as evolution have always interested me but especially in High School I started being fascinated by the processes that cause evolution or diseases. \nDuring my last year in School I visited the HBRS and immediately took interest in the Applied Biology Program due to its focus on Human Biology. \nMy biggest interest was the combination of medicine and biology, which is why I eventually decided to pursue an additional Bachelor at the HAN in Life Sciences with a focus on Biomedical Research.\nMy qualities are that I am a hardworking person that can work well both in a team and on my own. I am capable of quickly adapting to my work environment, depending on what is needed of me.",
