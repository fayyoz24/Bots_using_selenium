In this capacity, my tasks were manifold. One of the main activities involved the establishment of adaptive and performance management systems in all protected areas in Ghana, with the ultimate goal for wildlife populations to recover and to safeguard wildlife-based tourism.  Analysis shows that since 2005, in the majority of parks and reserves in Ghana wildlife recovered by 12 to 20% per year. Other activities involved the establishment of sustainable hunting strategies for Community Resource Management Areas, and the formulation of a national wetlands strategy and action plan.  From 2010 onwards I was supervising tourism activities in the West and Central African Region, using tools such as Value Chain Analysis to facilitate income generation through community-based tourism-related activities.",

LIRDP was a community-based natural resources management project, with its main objective to improve the welfare of the communities living with the wildlife resource, by gradually giving them more management responsibilities and income through sustainable resource use.  For most of the period, I was employed as Assistant Director, responsible for law enforcement, project planning, research and park management, while part of the time was spent as Acting Director and Acting Warden. Responsibilities were manifold, but included the production of law-enforcement, research and monitoring strategies for the project area, the development of annual work plans and budgets, and the preparation of a land-use plan for the Lupande GMA.  Other responsibilities included upgrading of law enforcement and park management in general. Routine activities included quarterly and annual progress reports, and, being part of the project management team, day-to-day managerial and administrative duties, as well as regular communications with relevant government, civil society, and non-governmental institutions, and donors.",
