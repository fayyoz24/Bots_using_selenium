    "summary": "I am an exuberant and process-oriented research engineer with a broad background in Nanotechnology, Materials science, and Chemistry. I have strong competences in advanced microfabrication, nanopatterning, CVD, PVD, photolithography, contamination control, plasma cleaning, etching processes. I have acquired these skills driving innovative solutions for complex applications in solar fuel devices for energy, biosensing and MEMS devices for medical applications for the past 5 years.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to working with a team of scientists, engineers and technicians to develop microfabrication processes for contamination & defect-free advanced semiconductors wafer fabrication, nanoelectronics sensor device and solar PV cells. I\u2019m interested in connecting people and knowledge to create innovations that sustainably strengthen the competitiveness of companies and the well-being of society.\n \n\nIndependently initiated and defined new process flows, architectures and platforms, and is technically responsible for the end-to-end development of integral thin film processes and microstructure device, from idea to release for volume manufacturing.\n\nDeveloped a new type of tandem solar-to-fuel (S2F) device, which showed the best oxide-based photocathode for a generation of hydrogen from sunlight known today. Which consists of 3D Si (PV) microwire arrays covered with copper oxide photoabsorber, which split water into hydrogen (H2) from sunlight.\n\n Knowledgeable and skilled in the areas of:\n\n\u2666 Processing semiconductor components in a high-tech cleanroom\n\u2666 Nano-&micro-fabrication Si and photolithography  \n\u2666 Plasma cleaning and Ultra-high Vacuum system\n\u2666 Metrology (XPS, ellipsometry, PL, SEM-EDX, AFM, TEM, XRD, Dektak)\n\u2666 Vacuum deposition (PECVD), and sputtering techniques (PVD, spin-coating)\n\u2666 Doping, Ion implantation, Rapid Thermal Processing\n\u2666 Wet & Dry etching\n\u2666 Thin-film process, Sputtering, spin-coating\n\u2666 DOE and SOP\n\u2666 Electrochemistry & Catalysis\n\u2666 Device fabrication\n\u2666 Characterization of solar PV cells and experience with PV measurement and associated instrumentation (for solid-state devices and (photo-)electrochemical cells) \n\n#Innovation #Creativity #Science & Technology #LoveMyJob #Challenges #GiveBackToTheSociety ",

While current systems run on liquid water, the idea of using water contained in ambient air in a solar water splitting device is very appealing. Capturing water from the air implies that no liquid water is needed for the operation.",
