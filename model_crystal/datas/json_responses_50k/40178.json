    "summary": "\u201cSwiss/Canadian Entrepreneur, Investor, Director, Financier who has had a lifetime of entrepreneurial projects running major multi-national corporations and initial start-up enterprises. The latest development included helping to build the first large-scale (103-600 hectares) vertically integrated, owned and operated plantation with Triniterio/Criollo/Hybrid cacao beans and fine chocolate processing factory in the Tropics. The plantation is in protected rain forest-covered land, the chocolate processing factory uses modern craft production equipment, and the supply chain uses logistics, marketing, distribution and sales worldwide without intermediary middlemen/women or contractors.  \n\nEvery piece of this enterprise from the trees on the plantation to the final bars/bricks of 100% pure, fine craft chocolate are owned, managed and operated by a small team of investor managers.  \n\nThis reverses centuries of history when only beans were exported to Europe and America. Workers on the plantation are not small landholders growing a few beans and living subsistence lives. They are highly trained, employed and well-paid employees of a major industrial operation which produces a formula of Fine Chocolate following 4,000 -10,000 years of Central American knowledge, experience and source of the finest cacao beans in the world. \n\nThere are no impoverished workers, no child slave labour and no need to affix marketing labels on packages of product which no longer contain the required amount of pure cacao from the original beans. \n\nToday's so-called 'chocolate' sold in supermarkets and food outlets worldwide (in major chains and chocolateries falsely labelling the product as +70% cacao on one side, lists an entirely different list of ingredients under law on the back side in small print. Accurate contents allow consumers to realize most chocolate contains little or no cacao.\n\nCheck out  http://www.interopag.com",

Many want to improve life for their children and those who farmed here for centuries. \n\nTo retain a quiet, recreational, village space yet grow with global acclaim and future appreciation needs some very careful planning. \n\nSeveral hidden backbones into the mix of housing, sports and hospitality are needed creating the world\u2019s most respected, integrated and sustainable villages centred from Gstaad/Saanen and extending in every direction. \n\nThe most critical projects include a regional hospital, commuter airport, power, railway and road networks to satisfy future passenger loads. These will bring more global visitors to keep the hospitality and sporting industries full year round. Add to this a permanent concert hall doubling as a conference centre hosting a dozen global summits in the off-seasons. These can range from the most advanced entrepreneurs, investors, medical science, education, sports facilities and the hospitality industry. This will fill the concert hall more than for just summer Menuhin and Country Festivals. The conferences pay for the entire infrastructural process. These will add significant advantage to the good, existing schools.\n\nRunway lights and radar to the airport will bring commuters in small, silent STOL and HAV aircraft from around the world via Geneva and Zurich. Permanent market stalls at the railway stations for the local farmers and artisans can sell their products to foreign visitors.\n\nA 20 year cash flow statement proves it will produce the most sustainable and advanced villages in the world. It lays the groundwork for the rest of the world to visit, holiday and some will copy us for another century. \n",

                    "description": "A revolution is underway in the global trade and production of quality cacao beans into nutritious, fine craft chocolate. For centuries, the raw material producers of cacao in the tropics did not process the finest chocolate-making machinery like the rest of the world. \n\nFrom January 2019, a strategic alliance between two Costa Rican professionals (a plantation agronomist - Moises Gomez) and his wife (Catalina Valeria - a processing engineer) with a Canadian multinational business executive (Robert Stewart) and Monacan investor (Machteld Schrama) join forces to create the world\u2019s first vertically integrated plantation-to-fine-chocolate processing company operating in Costa Rica. \n \nBreaking this North-South global market divide by integrating a 4,000-year-old source of traditional cacao beans with the finest chocolate production marks a dramatic departure in the world of cacao/cocoa/chocolate. \n\nIndustrial chocolate today consisting mainly of soya, industrial white sugar beet, vanilla, chemical flavours and poor quality non-Latin American cacao beans (Forestero beans from Africa, Asia) manufactured under modern industrial processes in the Northern Hemisphere. It has been sold to a global mass market without much nutritional value contributing to numerous modern diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes and obesity). This will be challenged the production of rich Criollo/Triniterio/Hybrid beans filled with healthy, nutritious, locally-processed chocolate from its own exceptional plantation cacao beans in Costa Rica. These Cacao beans are from from the genus of original trees where cacao has been grown for millennium. The nutritional ingredients have a full medicinal value of multiple vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and flavenols. \n\nThis craft product promotes a healthy \u2018Super Food\u2019. We call it \u201cLa Pura Vida\u201d, Costa Rica\u2019s contribution to a true, honest, and healthy food product coming from the finest original beans, with no man-made additives or extractions.",

Since Prince Albert I of Monaco in the 1850's, who brought the discipline of Oceanography into prominence and practise, and Jacques Cousteau who continued developing our understanding of 71% of the Earth's surface, nothing much has happened except dessimation of fish stocks, pollution of the water, destruction of the coral and plankton, entertaining documentary films, lots of conferences, a bottom-less pit of science and research with little improvements, while few have cleaned-up the mess on a global scale to address the challenges facing the seas. \n\nThe World Ocean Corporation (WOC) is not a government ministry filled with civil servants or a charity raising money from crowd funding, publicity, attending conferences, talk-fests or endless research for donations to produce piles of paper or documentary films. \n\nThe WOC is searching for verifiable, engineered results from work programs that translate all the world's information from the past 150 years into the globe's biggest data bank of oceanographic facts producing clearly-defined action projects to restore the ocean's balance with humanity.",

Today there are no legal agreements, land claims or treaties between the original Aboriginal First Nations people and Europeans who occupied Canada and settled it. They came as latter-day new owners who permanently stayed without much regard for the original settlers, owners and occupiers of the land. While Treaties and Title Agreements were promised in other Canadian Provinces since each joined Confederation in 1867, few were signed in British Columbia rendering the Province effectively no-man\u2019s-land in legal terms. \n\nThis is a lamentable cultural, legal and political disconnect between all these First Nations people (+119 communities across the Province) and the Non-First Nations peoples who have lived in British Columbia since the early 1800\u2019s. There have been hundreds of bitter disputes over these Land and Treaty Claims offered by the Canadian Government since 1867, but none resolved in the Province of British Columbia. Ultimate title ownership, occupation, stewardship, management, control and responsibility for overseeing the inherent present day or past value of the land for any socio-economic, industrial, agricultural and political use by anyone will be finally determined, negotiated, and singed into contractual legal agreements between all the parties. \n\nThe first initiative in 150 years to resolve these Land and Treaty Claims with the First Nations of British Columbia will be undertaken between July and December, 2016 with the hope that all 119 treaties will be signed giving these people their long-awaited Treaty and Land Rights in legal documentation giving them sovereignty over the land they have occupied for 10,000 years.",
