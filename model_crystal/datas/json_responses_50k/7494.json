    "summary": "Prof. Dr. Gijsbert Oonk (1966) holds the Jean Monnet Chair (ad Personam) on Migration, Citizenship and Identity. The Jean Monnet chairs are established by the European Commission as an initiative to promote teaching, research and reflection in the field of European integration studies in higher education institutions. This chair promotes teaching and research in the field of Global History, European Studies and National Identity.\n\nGijsbert Oonk is the founding director of the Sport and Nation project at the Erasmus University (https://www.eur.nl/en/eshcc/research/sport-and-nation). We employ three PhD students in this project and we collaborate with a number researchers and institutions globally. In this research we look at the correlation between citizenship, migration, nation and state. States increasingly accept \u2018imported\u2019 or migrated talent to promote the name and fame of the nation. On the one hand, this increases the freedom of mobility and options for talented athletes. However, on the other hand, if nations wish to increase their chances in sport by allowing non-nationals to earn their medals, something is lost in the nation. \nSee for example our recent publication: Nationality swapping in the Olympic field: towards the marketization of citizenship? www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13621025.2018.1477921In his earlier research Oonk was in interested in the role of South Asian (Indian) migrants and settlers in East Africa. He finalized his research project with a monograph: Settled Strangers: Asian Business Elites in East Africa 1800-2000 (Sage Publication 2013).\n\nIn 2011-2012 he is the Alfred D. Chandler Jr. International Visiting Fellow in Business History at the Harvard Business School (Boston).\n\nTeaching: Global History; Indian Diasporas; African History and South Asian HIstory; Citizenship; Migration; Inequality; Sport\n\nSpecialties: Globalization, Migration, Sport and Identity.

Highly talented athletes increasingly change their passport to represent another nation. This means that states are promoting the \u2018nation\u2019 without \u2018nationals\u2019. We aim at highlighting this paradox by emphasizing how ideas, institutions and context in this global \u2018race for talent\u2019 have changed over the past 150 years.",
