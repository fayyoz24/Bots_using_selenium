    "summary": "As a scientific illustrator, I have combined the three things that define me: my life-long love of drawing, my interests in biology and anatomy, and my intuitive communication skills. My previous work experience as press agency journalist, copywriter for the creative economy, and magazine illustrator, come together to make me uniquely apt in translating medical and surgical content into a attractive image for any intended audience.\n\nDuring the Master of Scientific Illustration program, I have dissected humans as well as animals, and have attended live human surgery at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Furthermore, I have workshop experience with plastic facial reconstruction on basis of a human skull, physical anthropology, and archeological human bone identification.\n\nHaving worked in the maelstrom of a newsroom as well as having been self-employed, I am able to meet deadlines whether in a bustle or when left to my own devices. I have demonstrated my organisation skills as assistant editor-in-chief and as organizer of demonstrations and exhibitions. ",
