In a group of five students we organize a Carnival Queens Election for the elderlies and employees. Carnival is one of the popular events in Aruba and its a bit challaging to bring the elderies to experience the Carnival events. Thus, we thought what a better way to organize a Carnival Queen election at SABA where they can experience and be part of this event. We were responsible for sponsors, decorations, send out invitations for the Minister of Culture, for the press members and for the families of the elderies. In addition, we had to search for entertainment and for a judge panel for the event. Moreover, we needed to put a schedule and make a script for the event.\n\nFor me it was a one-of-a- kind experience because I got to meet a lot of people and I got to know myself better through this project. Not only it was a succesfull event however, it also made me realize that doing even small things can have a big impact on others. I was very grateful for this opportunity."
