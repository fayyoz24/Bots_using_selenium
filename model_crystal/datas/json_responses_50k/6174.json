It is unclear to what extent biodiversity is being affected by the cocktail effect of chemicals. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted by the EU to assess the chemical and ecological status of European freshwater bodies with environmental quality standards of 45 priority substances. However, the WFD is limited because of a limited number of chemicals on the priority substances list, and an incomplete assessment of the ecological status. \n\nIn this project, the limited knowledge of how biodiversity is affected by chemicals will be addressed through an eco-epidemiology study in which ecology and ecotoxicology are integrated. Modelled mixture toxicity pressure from 1785 synthetic compounds will be linked to available biodiversity data. To correct for cumulative effects, data on relevant stressors other than synthetic chemicals will be included. The results will reveal to what degree and which synthetic chemicals are responsible for biodiversity loss, which will be used to help improve the implementation of WFD in two EU Member States: Sweden and the Netherlands. The ambition is to strengthen the bridge between scientific evidence and water management policies to help create a toxic-free environment.",

Wind, waves and currents will spread the sand naturally along the coast of Zuid-Holland, i.e., a building with nature approach. The Sand Engine will gradually change in shape and eventually be fully incorporated into the dunes and the beach. As a result, the coast will be broader and safer. Because the Sand Engine is a pilot project, the development of how the Sand Engine evolves is carefully monitored. This is done via STW NatureCoast, an interdisciplinairy project involving three postdoctoral researchers and twelve PhD researchers of which I am one. \n\nThe objective of my research is to understand the environmental, geochemical processes at mega beach nourishments and to develop predictive geochemical models. We expect that the transfer of sea sediment from anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions will lead to changes in biogeochemical processes. As a consequence, interactions between atmosphere, (fresh) water and sea sediment may affect mineralogical composition, salinity, trace element availability and the buffering capacity. As a result, environmental conditions may vary on a mega beach nourishment that can increase or decrease the preferred environmental conditions for flora and fauna.\n\nResearch funding: STW NatureCoast\n\nhttps://www.uu.nl/staff/IRPit/0\n \nWebsite: www.sandmotor.nl",
