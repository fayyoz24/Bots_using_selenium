Together with artists and designers, we look at what actually happens in their practices and together we try to come up with more transferable knowledge about what they do and, in particular, how they do it. Just like other practitioners, artists and designers would benefit from more adeptness at sharing their ideas and practices underlying their work. We aim at bolstering the artistic and creative potential of groups of makers by working with them on the articulation, evaluation and sharing of their methods, views, processes and other instances of 'knowledge' that often remain more or less implicit and personal. Key elements of the research plan are the study of source material, pilot projects and field research as well as other collaboration forms with artists and designers aimed at their professional development and the improvement of research education.\n\nMuch of the knowledge developed in recent years about research in art and in design is not directly related to the actual practices of makers and has limited value for them. By working directly with them to build knowledge that has at least local value and in addition to strive for 'interlocal' exchange, we hope to contribute to the empowerment and knowledge development of the rich traditions of research in artistic and creative practices. \n\nPractitioners hardly benefit from standard practice oriented research skill training since it shows too little similarities with what they actually do. We aim at developing education based on the actual practices of artists and designers, and the role that research and development plays in these practices.",

It worked together with the professorates Applied Game Design (Jeroen van Mastrigt, Willem-Jan Renger) and Play Design and Development (Marinka Copier) in 8 research programmes to cater for multidisciplinary student and staff innovation and research projects. The projects were assigned by music, media and game companies, publishers, sme's, universities, societal institutions like the Institute for the Blind, health organisations and governmental institutions like Nuffic and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Subsidies were acquired from the government and from the EU (FP6, FP7 and related programmes). The result was that both staff and students were involved in, often the same, projects and research groups that aimed at developing innovative, young professionals in music design as well as their teachers.",
