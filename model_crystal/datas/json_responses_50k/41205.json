    "summary": "Cor Schipper was involved in several European research studies EU FP6, EU FP7, as Modelkey, MESMA, MSFD, Blue Growth, Vectors, OCEANS, Interreg. He participated in European marine organisations e.g.  OSPAR, ICES, SIME, PIANC and IMO.  He was involved in international networks of organisations on environmental and sediment management studies like Dutch-German-Exchange programme, European Biodiversity, NORMAN, SedNet and EuDa. He has published over 20 scientific articles (H index= 19; http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=n7pPt-UAAAAJ&hl=nl ) on the topics of environmental geochemistry, marine policy and ecotoxicology, of which several focus on the environmental risk assessment. He was representative of the Central Dredging Association (CEDA), the OSPAR Working Group on the Environmental Impact of Human Activities (EIHA), and was coordinator of MESMA Black Sea Marine Spatial Planning. He  was member of the PIANC-IAPH working group 174 \u2018Sustainability reporting for ports\u2019 to implement Green Port development. Last years he is working as expert on Nature Based Solution projects as Marker Wadden Lake IJssel and Coastal Genesis Amelander Zeegat, in THe Netherlands and EU Interreg C5A a climate adaptation project. Several publications have been made on the Sustainable Development Goals with focus on a wide range of global climate pressures in coastal areas. Now he is programma manager of the nourishment of Galgeplaat flat in the Eastern Scheldt, The Netherlands. Due to reduced tidal amplitude and flow, the building-up of tidal flats by tidal currents has reduced, which results in erosion of the flats. This has led to loss of intertidal habitats and increasing wave loads on the dikes. The Eastern Scheldt intertidal areas Galgeplaat and ROggenplaat are especially important as foraging grounds for birds and seal habitat. Because of its nature value the Eastern Scheldt is a Natura2000 area and managed as a Natural Park.",

Recent initiatives such the Sustainable Ports Guidance of PIANC and IAPH suggest to move away from the traditional approach and adopt interventions as an opportunity to create added value instead. Such interventions require a successful balance between morphological, economic, ecological and social processes. This proposal builds onto that knowledge to apply and develop it in African context aiming integrated and sustainable plans and designs for African ports. The approach is interdisciplinary, in co-creation with (African) stakeholders and develops bottom-up from practical cases into tools and a generic framework for African ports. Specific aspects for the African context will be addressed in Ghana within the Port of Tema pilot study, and compared to and expanded using other relevant African cases, thus creating generic knowledge and tools which will be applicable in African port development projects. A growing consensus recognises the need to shift economies and social structures towards more integrated, sustainable, inter-disciplinary approaches aimed at finding the right balance between human, environmental and economic aspects of development. However, traditional port development often requires activities such as land reclamation, dredging and building new infrastructure, which generally have a substantial negative impact on local and regional ecosystems.\nWhat is lacking is an integrated approach to sustainable port development, which embraces\nthe three perspectives of: 1) engineering, 2) ecosystem services and 3) governance. Such an\napproach should also include knowledge of the underlying physical processes and (software)\ntools to enable quantitative design.",

This includes the socio-economic development, natural requirements and impact of sustainable design. Of course this requires insight in cause-effect relations/chains. The application is useful for port authorities, planners, policymakers, NGOs, scientists, nature developers and citizens. The Green Port knowledge-based serious game can be further developed so that the complexity of the marine city-port area and port development will be integrated with fundamental knowledge developments.The game applies a fictional but realistic environment, autonomous (i.e. non-controllable) scenarios, a set of measures and a qualitative set of indicators for safety, economy and the natural environment. This framework is used and adapted to a fictional coastal port environment including its hinterland, both natural (e.g. river) and economic (city, transport). Also, a set of indicators is defined for port development is such a way that the effect and impact of a traditional port can be compared against a sustainable port development. Yet, port projects are confronted with a growing scarcity of prime locations and the uncertain impacts of climate change. Clearly, there is a need for innovative solutions for port development that is in harmony with the ecosystem and that is robust or adaptable under change.\n\n",

Rijkswaterstaat has been implementing sand nourishment for many years and aims to further improve this approach to address rising sea levels. The Coastal Genesis 2.0 programme aims to answer three questions: How much sand will be needed in the long term to ensure that our coastal foundation keeps pace with sealevel rises? Where and when will that sand be needed? And what is the best way to add this to the coast? There are various reasons for ecological research in the\nAmeland Inlet. First, researchers aim to establish the starting situation (baseline measurement) in order to determine the effects of the planned nourishment on the Ameland Inlet ecology. Furthermore, little is known about ecosystem functioning in tidal inlets. This Ameland Inlet research should make clear how marine animal populations recover following the pilot nourishment. This research will also expand our ecological and morphological knowledge of outer deltas. Ultimately, the research should provide insight into the most appropriate level and location for such nourishment in order to minimise  ecological impact.",

It respects the limitations that many European ports are facing concerning the port land, intermodal infrastructure and terminal operation. It proposes beyond state of the art innovations that will increase efficiency and optimize land-use/infrastructure, while being financially viable, respecting circular economy principles and being of service to the surrounding urban environment. Through COREALIS, the port will minimize its environmental footprint to the city, it will decrease disturbance to local population through a significant reduction in the congestion around the port. It will also be a pillar of economic development and business innovation, promoting local startups in disruptive technologies of mutual interest. COREALIS innovations are key both for the major deep sea European ports in view of the new mega-vessel era, but also relevant for medium sized ports with limited investment funds for infrastructure and automation",

The method  was developed based on the international marine monitoring project SETL and applied in  7 Dutch harbours to monitor epifaunal abundance. Ten 14 \u00d714 cm PVC-plates attached to a floating dock were checked every three months. Surface water concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, insecticides, heavy metals and abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen concentration, depth and flow rate) were measured. Multivariate statistics (CANOCO) and msPAF calculations were used to assess the suitability of indicators for contaminants and ecosystem health.The correlation between the msPAF and epifaunal bioindicators is a useful approach for assessing the environmental status and therefor also water quality.",

However, most of the persistent,bioaccumulating and toxic (PBT) chemicals known to induce chronic sublethal effects (i.e. imposex and intersex) in gastropods are bound to the small sediment particles and transported to locations far away from the original dumping site. Given the potential chronic environmental consequences of these PBT chemicals and their bioaccumulation in the food chain, it is vital to improve the assessment of the full environmental risk from contaminants in disposed dredged material, including the risk for chronic effects at locations at a long distance away from the disposal site. International studies have shown Tributyltin (TBT) to be the most problematic of all the chemicals tested in the marine environment. Up till now, the impact of TBT on the ecosystem has been fragmentarily evaluated. The local impact can be studied by using local biological indicators. These bioindicators are local species whose population or health status can be used as a reference to determine environmental\nvitality.",

Deltares performs vulnerability assessments of ports and port areas in which sea level rise, green adaptation, eco-engineering and healthy ecosystems are taken into account. To cover all these critical aspects adequately it is essential to have a close cooperation with local and national authorities. In the port of Beira, the original focus on climate change effects was extended to a broad evaluation of environmental issues in the coastal zone. As such the project evolved from a climate-change oriented analysis towards a broader scope of environmental problems in the coastal zone.",

Therefore there is a growing demand for sustainable dams, which have no negative impact on the ecosystem. Sustainable  evelopment of dams can be achieved not only by setting regulation and guidelines, but also by raising awareness among stakeholders and policy makers about their optimal implementation and  ecessary measures to minimize the impacts.The main objective of the study is to develop a knowledge-based framework that evaluates impacts on resilience and sustainability measures. The key performance indicators and assessment of sustainability measures in the context of defined indicators are very sensitive part of this approach.

This raises\nthe question of the extent to which aquatic sediments act as a source of pollution due to the\nrelease of substances. This study examines whether substances are released from aquatic\nsediments to the water column by means of diffusive transport, and the degree to which this\noccurs. It also considers what routine or specialist methods are available to measure this\nsubsequent release of substances.\nThree very different locations (IJmuiden, the Afferdensche and Deestsche Waarden, and the\nGhent-Terneuzen Canal) were sampled. A range of measuring techniques were used, and\nexperiments were conducted to quantify emission fluxes of organic compounds (PAHs,\nPCBs), heavy metals and nutrients.\nThe results showed that substances are released by diffusion at all locations, and that in\nsome cases they partially determine water quality, and thus compliance with WFD quality\nobjectives. The main substances are phosphate, arsenic, zinc, lead, nickel and a number of\nPAH and PCB compounds. At the three locations examined, PAH levels in surface water\nexceed the WFD limit, mainly as a result of the release of sediment-bound contaminants.\nIt was found that, in order to determine fluxes on the basis of diffusion, some idea of the\nconcentration gradient over surface water and sediment is needed. This applies equally to\norganic contaminants, heavy metals and nutrients. The redox-sensitivity of substances,\nparticularly at the transition between oxic and anoxic conditions, is very important. As a result,\nnone of the \u2018routine\u2019 techniques used was capable of giving a reliable impression of diffusive\nemissions. Passive sampling (IVPS), Empore disk, SOFIE and modelling instruments were\nthe most suitable of the \u2018specialist\u2019 techniques.\n",

The key elements in the ECOSTRESS project are represented by the use of an ecosystem integrated approach to deliver societal benefit. The risk assessment of flooding hazard occurrence in the coastal lowlands system will be evaluated by taking into account the interaction of three elements of vulnerability: economic, ecological and social vulnerability. The idea is to promote an innovative approach in order to understand the processes occurring between ecosystem services and the value of natural capitals, for a valuable implementation of current management and conservation strategies. The analysis of the ecosystems resilience, their ability to cope with the impacts from natural hazards and to reduce the risk of damage, will be combined with the \u201cadaptive capacity\u201d of a community, element of social vulnerability. In ECOSTRESS is defined area of interest on the base of field visits and  understanding based on the analysis of reporting on the Northern Adriatic Italian test case and the Dutch Wadden Sea under the general context of water and flood management.",

This report describes the environmental conditions in the Dutch part of the North Sea, the current human activities and the associated predominant pressures on the ecosystem. It also describes the present environmental status in terms related to eleven qualitative descriptors for Good Environmental Status from Annex I of the MSFD. A social and economic analysis that will form part of the Initial Assessment is being carried out by the Centre for Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) and will be published separately. The other two reports deal with the determination of characteristics of Good Environmental Status (GES), required by Article 9 of the MSFD, and the  establishment of indicators and environmental targets as specified by Article 10 of the MSFD. In the report establishment of Indicators and Environmental Targets the interrelationship between the 3 reports is presented.",

As a result, the dynamic morphological equilibrium of the basin has been disturbed. Intertidal flats are now confronted with the so called \u2018sand hunger\u2019 or sand starvation: due to reduced tidal amplitude and flow, the building-up of tidal flats by tidal currents has reduced, which results in erosion of the flats. This has led to loss of intertidal habitats and increasing wave loads on the dikes. The Eastern Scheldt intertidal areas are especially important as foraging grounds for birds. Because of its nature value the Eastern Scheldt is a Natura2000 area and managed as a Natural Park. As a mitigation measure, intertidal flats of Roggeplaat and Galgeplaat will be nourished with sediment to conserve foraging grounds for birds. Goal is to reduce the impact of sand starvation under sea level rise to preserve the ecological functions (i.e. low-water foraging function of bird species) in reference year 2010 for the following 25 years and at the same time prevent undesirable wave impacts.",

Through an improved understanding we can minimize the risks associated with the\ndisposed dredged materials.Chemical and biological analysis of dredged material indicates potential hazards and provides a means to quantify the risk when also bioavailability is taken into account and ecologically relevant endpoints are being studied. The estimated risk and current sediment quality criteria, however need to be validated by performing local impact assessment upon licensed disposal of dredged harbour sediment. Bioassays with local sediment may provide insight into the bioavailability and mixture effects of chemicals from the dredged material. In addition, a wide variety of bioindicators can be used to determine the effects of sediment-associated chemicals and tohighlight adverse effects overlooked by the risk assessment for the local ecosystem at or beyond the disposal site. This might facilitate improved ecological risk assessment of dredged sediments for the receiving marine coastal ecosystem. Sediment-associated persistent, bioaccumulating and toxic compounds in dredged material mostly accumulate downstream of the disposal site due to transport of the contaminants bound to small particles. To identify effects of the chemicals, bioassays and biomarkers are needed that relate ambient sediment chemistry data to specifi c potential adverse biological effects.",
