    "summary": "Linguistic Systems BV is a language technology company, located in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nThe company was founded in 1985, by computational linguist Drs. Leo Konst. Before, he worked as a scientific employee at the University of Nijmegen in large European projects in the field of language technology and developed applications that make computers work smarter with language.\n \nOne of the first products of Linguistic Systems was a spelling checker for Philips. Deals with Casio followed, where the simple Multi Translating Dictionary \"Euroglot\" was launched to the market. Later AKZO, DSM and Siemens started using Euroglot. At the present day, they see Euroglot as a fast and accurate translation tool.\n \nThroughout the years the development of language technology has continued, and Euroglot has grown along. Euroglot Professional was developed, as well as, pronunciation modules (the so-called \u201csouffleur\u201d) and specialised dictionaries. At the present we are working on a grammatically correct automatic translation system.",
