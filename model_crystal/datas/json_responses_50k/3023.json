Animals die en masse and we are so alienated from nature that we hardly seem to notice it. With nature recordings, disturbing trumpet sounds, crushing electronic beats and two chirping, squeaking and growling analog synths, Evelien has made raw, mesmerising and mournful music. Music that navigates between electronic- and pop music, sound art and contemporary classical. It premiered at the November Music festival on November 9th 2019. In 2020 the album Endlings was released, with music from Biophonica.\n\ncomposition, electronics, texts, production evelien van den broek | trumpet, electronics mark nieuwenhuis | visuals timo hoogland | bird design sound modules edo paulus | live sound engineer sandor caron | studio production and -mix gijs van klooster | graphic design richard van kruysdijk | mary river turtle photo chris van wyk\n\nBiophonica is financially supported by the Performing Arts Fund NL.",

With a collection of acoustic and electronic instruments, live sampling, live sound manipulation and harmony vocals, Daisy Bell switches from soft and intimate to a raw and vibrant wall of sound.\nOn stage, the band is lit up by large projections of poems by William Blake (1757-1827), which they use as their lyrics.\n\nDaisy Bell debuted with a concert for VPRO radio (NL), broadcast live via satellite in 25 countries. Shortly after that they released their first songs on pink vinyl on WORM Records, were the support act for CocoRosie and played several gigs including Faust's prestigious Avantgarde Festival (Germany). In 2014 they toured with gamelan ensemble Gending with their programme Year Without A Summer.\n\nIn December 2013, they recorded their debut album with engineer Sandor Caron (Knalpot) at the legendary Hilvaria Studios in the south of the Netherlands.\nIt was then mixed and produced by Darren Allison (producer of Efterklang, Amatorski, Belle & Sebastian, Spiritualized a.m.m.) in London and will be released november 2015 by Opa Loka Records (GER). www.daisybell.eu",

Tornadoes, industrial machinery and insects seem to surround you, when suddenly you\u2019ll find yourself in the middle of a dreamy choir. Loopers, bouncing delays, heavenly reverb, distortion and live sampling-scratching are some of the sound manipulations that are used. Songs about absurd, awkward and obsessive love.
