    "summary": "My passion for film production was sparked by lessons on Media & Marketing during my IGCSE Business course. I found myself intrigued with how media giants and producers influence consumers using various forms of advertisements, and how different interpretations of messages can affect the consumer\u2019s mindset. Not only that, my curiosity was piqued after watching how these producers profoundly reshape people\u2019s perceptions using only combinations of moving images, sounds and lights!\n\nSince the summer in 2018, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to gain some practical experience by working for a film crew I connected with on Facebook called \u201cThe Envizualists\u201d. Through many projects with them such as \u201cPolyChrome\u201d, or \u201cThe Emerging City\u201d, I have had the chance to participate and explore the many phases of media production like an actual producer, from storyboarding in pre-production, filming in production, and editing in post-production. Thus, being a producer pushed the limits of my creativity, through oscillating between different camera angles, and combining lights, sound effects and music to create the most impactful mood for the audience. Alongside this, I\u2019ve found communicating with the other team members regularly has helped me to improve my confidence in making my own vision clear to others as well as my public speaking skills. As well as the practical side of film making, I feel that through discussing ideas with directors, visualizing their concepts, and understanding their goal, I have been able to build the interpersonal skills needed in becoming a great media producer.",
