Theme: Social Entrepreneurship. \n\nAs the first young consultant of Hieroo Rotterdam, I was involved in the start-up of the organization. Contributing to strategies regarding the recruiting of new consultants, the development of the first yearly social intervention, and expanding our network in Rotterdam made my entrepreneurial interest grow.
