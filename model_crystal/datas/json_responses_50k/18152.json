    "summary": "Passionate manager with a strong people focus. I enjoy accelerating teams and organizations to achieve results they haven\u2019t been able to meet up to then. T\u200bo allow each individual to achieve their maximum result\u200b, I coach, strengthen, build bridges and connect people\u200b. \u200bI\u2019m ambitious, approach\u200b opportunities with an open mind \u200band boost a proactive, driven way of working.\n\nAfter completing a Bachelor and Master Degree in Rotterdam and St. Gallen, Switzerland, I joined KPN in 2012, with the ambition to dive into the world of IT. Honestly I would never have expected the joy I would get out of this industry. Starting out with 1,5 years as management trainee, KPN introduced me to the dynamics of IT service delivery. After completing the traineeship, I fulfilled multiple operational and strategic management roles. These brought me my passion for IT leadership in the conflicting world of business needs, diverse HR aspects and technological innovation challenges. In summer 2017, I joined UMBRiO because I wanted to experience the culture of an IT start-up, but also because I wanted to bring to practice more of my vision on IT leadership. After UMBRiO became part of Telindus and the Proximus Ecosystem, I joined Telindus to take up the challenge of accelerating the necessary transformation towards a services-first company.\n\nVoluntary work and coaching both play an important role in my life aside from work. In spare time, I enjoy ancient Roman history, reading, music, our dog and museums.",
