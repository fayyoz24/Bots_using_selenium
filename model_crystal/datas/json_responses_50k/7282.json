We organized a study trip to Tokyo, Japan and South Korea for first year students from the Bachelors Japanese studies and Korean studies. This trip was meant for students who had never been to Japan or Korea before. It provided them with a small taste of not only Japanese and Korean culture and language in practice, but also an idea of what it would be like to study and work in Japan and show some of the educational and professional opportunities available to them as students and alumni. Some highlights of the program were thus visits to the Dutch Embassy, local museum, local universities and various commercial organizations. I was responsible for various aspects of the organisation, including making a suitable programme, organisation of activities and transport, ensuring sponsorship and acting as guide during the trip itself.
