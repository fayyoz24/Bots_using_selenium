    "summary": "I am a political scientist who works closely with environmental NGOs in Asia. Our goal: to support local communities, protect their environment and sustain their livelihoods and cultural values. \n\nCommunity participation in natural resources management is key in my work. Creating partnerships between environmental organizations, multi-level government institutions, knowledge institutes and industries is what I do. I work from my own consultancy Makara (part of NedWorc).\n\nI have more than 25 years of experience in working with environmental organizations around the world. This involved staying with remote indigenous forest communities in Indonesia, discovering sacred groves in India and visiting rural indigenous women groups in Latin America. I lived in Jakarta for my research \u2018Principles, Policies and People\u2019 on the influence of international environmental principles on conservation policies and practices in Indonesia.\n\nMy current project is the AksiBrantas partnership: a long-term project funded by Dutch government - with the Indonesian environmental group Ecoton, local authorities and Dutch technical institutes TU Delft and Tauw. It is a unique partnership: Indonesian environmental activists join forces with authorities and mobilize community groups to stop household waste ending up in the river. Dutch and Indonesian experts research water quality with the latest technologies. Dutch engineers support small and medium enterprises along the river to decrease pollutants in their waste water. Sharing and learning from each other is our philosophy. Together we build a strong community-based program to protect future life in and along the river Brantas.\n\nI am initiator of YUYU River Expeditions, an initiative to fight global river pollution at its source: in Asia, where the rivers are polluted the most, and in the Netherlands, where part of the plastic waste in Asian rivers originates. YUYU Expeditions are traveling exhibitions that are designed to inspire upstream communities to protect their rivers from plastic pollution. We study the ecosystems in the river and the quality of the water, and by doing so learn about the communities, life along the river and how this is affected by pollution. We visit communities that come into action and we tell their stories in the Netherlands, and facilitate them to tell them themselves, in person or online. We share our built up knowledge with Dutch policymakers and ask them to stop the illegal export of waste to Indonesia. We work closely with local environmental organizations on East Java.",

In December 2014, a group of Indonesian NGOs decided to join forces and initiate the IndoWater Community of Practice. This Community of Practice aspires to contribute tangible models for community participation in IWRM, while strongly addressing the often destructive impacts of failing river basin management in national policy making. \n\nSee http://indowatercop.org/"
