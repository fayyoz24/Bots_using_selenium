            "description": "Won Third Prize in Bartlett Centenary Award for sustainable urban design concept\n\nProject description:\nCities are expanding at a rapid rate, raising a number of questions concerning the impacts of their materials, energy and water consumption, as well as the production of waste and greenhouse gas emissions on the planet. Can the concept of sustainability provide a better way of understanding and mitigating the local and global environmental impact of cities?\n\nEARLS, which stands for Exposing Attractive, Rewarding, Long-term Systems, seeks to address this issue through a mix of urban design, technical innovation and behaviour change. It is based in the redevelopment area of Earls Court in London. It\u2019s main purpose is to re-imagine the site into a working showcase for sustainability, as well as to demonstrate, test and export ways to use resources more sustainably in a major city like London. \n\nOverall, EARLS is based on Unilever\u2019s research into sustainable behaviour change, and provides an integrated package of technological and societal interventions to trigger and sustain behaviour change in residents and visitors. Through exposing the sustainable resource infrastructure, residents and visitors are provided with visual reminders and information about the on-site resource systems. These will raise awareness and facilitate dialogue on resource consumption, encouraging\nrefinement and acceptance of the technologies available.\n\nBy making the systems\u2019 use attractive and convenient, residents and visitors will grow more confident in using them and may encourage their peers to follow. If applied properly, systems usage will reward behaviour change in the form of reduced utility bills, comfortable buildings and new public spaces, which will serve to reinforce and sustain long-term behaviour change, both on-site and across the city.",
