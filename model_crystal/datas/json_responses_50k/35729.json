    "summary": "Hi!\n\nAs you may have noticed, my name is Soso Chkhaize!\nTo shortly summarise my background, I was born in Georgia (country) and later on when I was 3 months old, my family have moved to Latvia, and eventually they ended up taking me with them as well. So then, for the next 13 years of my childhood I spent my time, except for few summers, living in a cold country with my family and my brother who came to be when I became 5 years old. \n\nAfter those thirteen years, me and my folks have decided to go back to Georgia, were they still keep on living till this day. As for me, I had a fun and adventurous time back in Georgia, till the age of 18, when I moved to the Netherlands for studying Product Design at this Amazing and super conceptual Design Academy in Eindhoven. \n\nSo that's my story in a nutshell. Now I'm finishing my bachelor Degree, and I still have a lot of pages to fill in to my personal notebooks. So I'l see where it will al go.",
