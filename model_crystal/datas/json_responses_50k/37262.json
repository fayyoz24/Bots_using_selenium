    "summary": "I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the ECOSPHERE and Behavioral Ecology and Ecophysiology (BECO) groups at the University of Antwerp in Belgium.  I earned my Master\u2019s degree in Biology in 2015 in which I studied PFAS in the aquatic environment of the Vaal River in South Africa. \nDuring my PhD in the ECOSPHERE and BECO lab, I worked on the distribution and toxicity of elevated PFAS concentrations in the terrestrial environment, mainly songbirds and invertebrates, near a fluorochemical hotspot in Belgium. In addition, I developed a novel analytical method for the detection and quantification of PFAS in multiple environmental matrices. \nCurrently, my main focus has shifted slightly to factors that affect the bioavailability of PFAS to terrestrial and aquatic biota (from plants to vertebrates). \n\nFor a complete list of my publications, please have a look at my researchgate profile (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thimo_Groffen) or contact me!",

I assessed the effects of PFASs pollution on reproduction of the birds, as well as multiple indicators of biological condition of birds and isopods.
