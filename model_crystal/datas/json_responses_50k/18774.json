    "summary": "\ud83c\udf10I have lived in Romania for most of my life but followed my passion for the unknown and moved to study International Business in Netherlands. Along the way, I have also lived in Monterrey, Mexico for my exchange semester, studying business and marketing as well as in Munich, Germany as part of my internship in project management. I constantly had jobs and side-hustles in different industries, developing my skills, growing my network and providing value. \n\n\ud83d\ude80I am currently working in a digital marketing company that I also helped founding doing a bit of everything but mostly creating/managing digital marketing projects for our key accounts as well as raising awareness for the brand. Moreover, I am doing my thesis for graduating the program of International Business at The Hague University, specialization in Finance & Accounting as well as working as a freelance journalist for the student community.\n\n\ud83e\udd39\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fMy choice of studying business was made since it is a topic offering experience in multiple areas by being constantly challenging, evolving and keeps me alert. I enjoy finance because I believe that the financial system is what makes the world go round as well as marketing/sales since I like to help businesses reach their potential through creative marketing strategies.\n\n\ud83c\udf93Comparing to my years in high school, during my bachelor I found out that I can be a top performer if I like what I do or study. I like to get out of my comfort zone, learn and develop skills and put myself in situations where I need to grow. I am open to business ventures, networking and co-working.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6I have the highest aspirations and I will do everything I can to achieve them.",

It was my first true experience in the financial industry and partly influenced where I currently am. Aspects related to the internship involve how to do a financial analysis for a customer, communication and overall soft skills, knowledge of financial products and financial planning. The reason why I could not continue my work for OVB is that my International Business study at The Hague University started.",
