Having lived and worked in Armenia, Greece, Cyprus, the Netherlands I truly enjoy working in a multicultural environment and developing projects for emerging economies. My solid experience in managing multicultural teams and delivering international projects in renewable energy, water management, and higher education industries have greatly increased my commercial and management acumen. Having controlled project budget funds of more than $ 30 MM by large international monetary organizations including the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, EBRD and the European Commission I ensured the project objectives were met within the pre-set criteria. \n\nRenewable energy (utility-scale, commercial & industrial and off-grid segments)\nCircular economy\nCarbon markets\nDigital economy",
