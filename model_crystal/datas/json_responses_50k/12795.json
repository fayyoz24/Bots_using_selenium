In the nominations, the jury looked for students who have distinguished themselves from other students for the benefit of the faculty, the humanities in the broad sense or through a special social contribution. This could include organising a major event, achieving excellent teaching or research results, or making a special contribution to student life at the faculty.",

Helleke van den Braber, As an alumni of the Bachelor Arts and Culture Studies, I will be hosting this evening together with spatial historian dr. Anna Geurts. \n\nWhen Art Offers Space for Community:\nThis night is about spaces, community and art/heritage. Spaces such as archives, bookshops and museums that were created to collect, present or sell the art and heritage of socially marginalised groups often serve other important functions as well. In hosting visitors from those groups, they offer a home to meet people with similar experiences, for instance, and a place to be oneself; a space for developing one\u2019s culture and connecting to one\u2019s foreparents, passing on knowledge that would be lost if left to hegemonic art or heritage institutions; or a place for organising, building alliances, or educating allies. What makes these places special and sets them apart from other dedicated fora such as newsletters and festivals is the fact that they offer a real place in a stable location, where people can physically gather and to which they can return.\r\n\r\nAt this evening at LUX, we hope to learn from three organisers with tremendous experience in creating or working in such places. What different purposes have they seen their spaces serve over the years? How accessible have they observed these places to be for visitors, and how inclusive have they tried to make them? And, finally, what is the work that is needed to create and maintain these spaces?\n\nThe guest speakers are Nikita Krouwel from The Black Archives, Marischka Verbeek from bookshop Savannah Bay, and Kachi Yip (k.Chi\u201d) from The Mansion. The evening will also be filled with performances by k.Chi\u201d and Neema Souare. ",

In a group of three other high school students, I worked together with Denise Campbell, junior curator ceramics at the Rijksmuseum, and Stefan Scholten from design studio Scholten & Baijings. The final product of this traineeship was a video about traditional Japanese ceramics and being a guide for one day at the Rijksmuseum. \n\nLater that year, I had the opportunity to work together with Menno Fitski, Head of Asian Art at the Rijksmuseum. I followed him for a whole day as he showed me the art depot, what a general day for a curator at the Rijksmuseum looked like, and what his own experiences of becoming a curator entailed. ",

The Living Lab connects sustainability issues of faculty and staff of Radboud University and Radboudumc to students who want to make a sustainable impact with their own research. Everything is possible in the Living Lab: internships, short- and long-term assignments, course assignments, bachelor and master theses and even Honours is possible.\n\nNext to coordinating the Living Labs, I also worked on a sustainability guide for study associations. I did this together with a focus group of 20 study associations from Radboud University.",
