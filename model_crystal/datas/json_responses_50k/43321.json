We are currently aiming at building a platform that enables weather stations to recover their electronic payload. Currently, each weather stations release these payloads twice a day. Our solution will save costs.\nMy participation on the project is focused on controlling the attitude of the balloon and building the trajectory simulator. The simulator consists of Python script, which fetches atmospheric data forecast from NOAA servers, delivering it to the C code for trajectory calculation. I also implemented a Python KML file generator for visualization using GoogleEarth to observe the simulated path and real time tracking of the balloon by radio communicated GPS position.",

The implementation was done in C code running independently on a Texas Instruments TMS320C6713 DSP processor, with the ADC\u2019s acquiring signal up to 100kHz. A host program was also created in C, running on a windows workstation. It communicated with the DSP for data storing and further post-processing. Images from a high speed camera are also stored for visualization of the flame front motion and all the tracking codes where implemented in Matlab. On the final part of my thesis, I will create a simulation of the flame front motion by discretizing a partial differential equation (G-equation). Since there is no off-the-shelf solver for this equation, I will be implementing the codes in C and comparing the movement of the simulated and real flames, thus improving the flame model.",
