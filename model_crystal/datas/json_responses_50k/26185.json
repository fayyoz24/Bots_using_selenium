    "summary": "I've been working with technology since the late nineties. Self-taught and extremely curious, I began my career working on computer maintenance at the age of 16. \n\nThe following year, I started working with technical support at Audaces. I then used this opportunity to prepare myself with the knowledge of the problem domain (CAD/CAM for textile industry) and evolve my professional skills, doing the bridge between technical support and the development team. \n\nDue to results shown, I was promoted to Junior Developer, doing C++ development at the company's main product, where I also obtained extensive experience in reverse engineering binary streams. \n\nHaving evolved technically and professionally, I climbed up until reaching the position of Senior Developer (2007), having composed several teams, developing systems in C++, C, Python and Java. Also leading the adoption of several agile development practices like TDD, peer code review and continuous build. At this point I have accumulated a broad range of experiences in several fields of software engineering: from code quality metrics to code coverage, from legacy code to greenfield development.",

It reached a limit of how much it can scale. South American markets are less demanding on the garment characteristics therefore demanding less specialized tools. \n\nTrying to enter European and Asian markets has shown that that limit was reached. It was no longer possible to add new features to be able to sell on those markets. \n\nContributions: \n- Added an abstraction to the low level math library. \n- Added three implementations: One using the old in-house library, another over the CGAL library and a third one using OpenCasCade library. \n- Added a battery of tests to show that the three implementations behave exactly the same. \n- OpenCasCade was chosen after a comparative analysis has shown it was the best option.\n- With this new maths library in place we were able to evolve the model abstraction with the help of a Specialist (Patricia). \n- Defined a new architecture using modern C++ '11 and '14 features.\n",
