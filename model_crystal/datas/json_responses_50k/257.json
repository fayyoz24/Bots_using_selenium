We are replacing the power systems of fiber locations that provide services to households. We completed the modernization of a small fraction of all the locations spread over the Netherlands, but the results can already be seen by the reduction of energy consumption and the reduction of service interruption at the modernized locations. It was a challenge to keep the work on site in progress with multiple partners and to ensure the delivery of the new equipment, considering all the obstacles brought by the pandemic. But, as a result, we are now about to start a new phase in which we will not only modernize, but also make it self-sufficient energy wise.",

The goal was to invest in the training of qualified personnel to obtain the skills and abilities necessary for the advancement of science in the Brazilian society. The selection criteria were: the best scores on the Brazilian national exam (ENEM), the college grades and performance,  the English score (TOEFL) and the acceptance of a foreign university. I was accept by Indiana University - Bloomington where I had English classes. Then I applied and I was accepted  to study IT related classes at  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. This was my first international trip which I was able not only  to study in high quality universities to develop my academic skills, but I also had the pleasure to travel, to make friends from all over the world, to experience many different cultures. In short, it changed the way I see the world.",
