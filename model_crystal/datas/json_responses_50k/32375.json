    "summary": "An Engineering and Management professional focused on making cities more sustainable, inclusive and resilient. I study the systemic implications of innovations to ensure that they are supported by capacity building, staffing, procurement methods, impact monitoring, and legislation. I have worked with local, state and national governments to enable institutional strengthening and data driven decision making. Through a diverse and inter-disciplinary skill set - including data analysis and visualisation, software product management, technical writing, curriculum development, and policy implementation -  I have  supported projects on climate change, WASH, and urban livelihoods.\n\nCurrent student at TU Delft, MSc in Complex Systems Engineering and Management. \n\nA Graduate of the Construction Technology Program at CEPT University.",
