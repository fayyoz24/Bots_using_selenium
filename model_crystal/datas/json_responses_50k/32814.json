            "description": "Masters' Thesis\nAdvisor: Dr. Tim Kowalewski\n\nThis work involves the development and testing of stretchable and flexible embedded circuits using additive manufacturing method. With the widespread popularity of desktop 3D printers the power of low-cost 3D printing can be harnessed to print electronics on stretchable and flexible bio-compatible skins with integrated circuitry, which can conform to irregularly shaped mounting surfaces. A multi-material freeform fabrication process with quick tool change provides the potential to print complete functional devices in a single manufacturing process, integrating the printing of both the structural and electronic blocks of the device. In this work, a custom-developed syringe-based controlled extrusion process using conductive silicone was developed for printing integrated circuits. The characteristics of the conductive silicone under stretching were studied. A proof-of-concept flexible bio-compatible skin device with an embedded voltage divider circuit was printed and the behavior of the device was studied under various working conditions.",

In sync with calculated TTC, a simple color coded LED display system relays info to help the driver in decision making regarding lane change.\n \nTesting of this sytem was done at the HumanFIRST simulation lab.

The aim of the project was to complete a pan-India study of the automotive market through qualitative and quantitative studies and analysing the data to identify key opportunity spaces for new product development. I acted in the capacity of a Market research coordinator from NPI, to assist and plan implementation of the study.\n \nFor Phase 1 (Qualitative), I co-conducted the customer direct interviews for Bangalore region. For Phase 2 (Quantitative), I assisted in the development of the quantitative survey, coordinated the logistics for participation of Tata Motors' personnel (from various departments - marketing, R&D, Manufacturing, Technical services, Industrial Design, etc.) and worked on data assimilation and analysis. I also undertook the technical briefing for VML Qais for Phase 2.",

New tooling designs were developed for the CMS AGVs to be able to house the new powertrains, focusing on minimising process time & improving flexiblity of the CMS by utilizing common fixtures for multiple powertrains. A new concept for locating the powertrains was developed using flexible pin locators as engine mounting PLPs (position locating points) for the fixture table, which can be used in various configurations depending on the powertrain-chassis cobination being assembled. An ergonomics study was also done to assess process feasibility and operator ergonomics.",

Saviteja is a portable multifunctional rechargeable solar lamp that makes use of innovative thermoelectric technology. This product provides a sustainable lighting alternative aimed at rural regions in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of conventional sourcs of energy, even though most houshold appliances run on such sources (namely electricity). \n\nSaviteja was developed with a focus on making non-conventional energy solutions viable to the common man. From the needs hierarchy generated from the market research, 3 important areas were identified for design requirements, namely: 1. ergonomics - the ergonomic operation is a primary concern of users; 2. durability - since the lamp often faces tough situations,it needs to be not only rugged, but also be reliable; 3. multi-functionality - the lamp needs to cater to all the requirements of the household, varied as they are.",

Initially low fidelity parametric study was carried out with Digital DATCOM to assess the relative effect of various wing planform parameters on the aerodynamic performance.\n \nThe wing planform was varied by varying a design parameter, while keeping other parameters constant. Of the initial 4 parameters considered, based on the initial study 2 cases were considered for the design of the wing planform, and then high fidelity parametric studies were carried out with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Using ANSYS ICEM CFD for meshing and FLUENT for solving, the aerodynamic parameters were estimated and an optimized planform chosen.",
