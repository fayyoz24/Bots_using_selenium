    "summary": "More and more people are surviving cancer. What many fail to realize, however, is that even years after cancer, people can suffer from a wide variety of serious health or psychosocial problems, or \"late effects of cancer.\" As a PhD candidate at the Expertise Center for Late Effects after Cancer and as a project member of the PanCareFollowUp project, I conducted many interviews with cancer survivors and their caregivers and developed and evaluated multiple eHealth interventions aiming at preventing and relieving late effects of cancer. Stimulating a healthy lifestyle is one of the main focusses ofall my projects. All these experiences have allowed me to develop my project coordination and communication skills to a high level. I am committed to my tasks and have an eye for detail. At the same time, I value colleagues very much and I am therefore very approachable. Person-centred care is a high priority for me and our center. Therefore, in every step of my project, I always keep the target group of my PhD project in mind. After all, contributing to improving the quality of life of cancer survivors gives me the energy and motivation to get the best out of myself every single day!",

The PanCareFollowUp Consortium has developed and evaluated two interventions, including a person-centred and guideline-based model of survivorship care (Care Intervention) and an eHealth lifestyle coaching model (Lifestyle intervention).
