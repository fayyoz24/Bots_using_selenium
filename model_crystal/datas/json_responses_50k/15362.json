    "summary": "After a few bad choices regarding education, I finally found my passion in entrepreneurship at Fontys Small Business & Retail Management. Marketing and sales are both fascinating to me and putting words in action is the best part of this study.In 2014 I won a price for Best Student Company with my fellow students and in October 2014 I went to Turkey to write a business plan for a Turkish company. After building my own website and finishing my internship at TGC Trading in Tilburg successfully, I am now graduated.\n\nI can't tell you where I'll be next year but I can however keep you posted.

So be prepared for the best time of your life! Experience Eindhoven to the fullest. Party, study and keep your place neat!\nExplore it all; with your own StuGi!!\n\nThis was the introduction of The StuGi, a student guide made by student company SaleME of which I was the director. With a circulation of 10.000 pieces, we spread our free student guide throughout the whole city and even much further.\n\nWithin one year we started a company with a small idea that turned out to be a big success. We won the national contest for Young Entrepreneurship called Jong Ondernemen 2014 with The StuGi and thereby gained access to the European final and a lunch with Gerrit Zalm, CEO of ABN AMRO Banking. This was a great first experience with entrepreneurship which opened many doors for me.\nMany thanks to Stichting Jong Ondernemen.",
