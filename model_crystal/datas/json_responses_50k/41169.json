The programme management dynamics of Infrabel, SNCB/NMBS and FPS will also be investigated. Phase 2 (for about 7 years) centres on full knowledge transfer to FPS and includes follow-up audits and recommendations for effective programme management auditing and monitoring of the ongoing railway safety systems roll-out.",
