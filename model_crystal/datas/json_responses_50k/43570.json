    "summary": "Hello there! I'm a passionate graduate student at the University of Amsterdam, diving deep into the captivating realm of Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I'm putting my Computer Science expertise to work as a dedicated Data Assurance Engineer at Optasia, where I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to ensure data integrity and accuracy.\n\nMy journey through the tech landscape has been quite exhilarating. From mastering languages like C, Python, SQL and even venturing into the dynamic world of Pyspark, I've honed a diverse skill set that enables me to tackle intricate challenges with finesse.\n\nDuring my earlier academic pursuits at NKUA, I delved into an intriguing thesis on \"Ontology Creation with the help of a Chatbot,\" showcasing my penchant for innovative solutions. Moreover, I further expanded my horizons through an enriching semester abroad at the University of Koblenz. There, I explored advanced subjects from their Master's program, enriching my technical foundation and global perspective.\n\nOutside the realm of academia, I find fulfillment as a dedicated volunteer at ESN KAPA Athens. In this capacity, I proudly serve as the webmaster, orchestrating the online presence of our vibrant ESN Section. This multifaceted role not only keeps me in sync with the ever-evolving tech sphere but also offers a platform to share my skills and maintain ties with a lively community. This journey has significantly developed my soft skills, as effective collaboration within diverse teams has become second nature.\n\nJoin me in exploring the frontiers of technology and innovation. Let's connect, collaborate, and craft a future where possibilities are limitless",
