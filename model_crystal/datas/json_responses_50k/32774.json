Although the design of a system that is focused on maintaining the transportation of fossil fuels may seem the very opposite of sustainable, thorough investigation leads to the conclusion that the leakage of methane is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that these leakages can be prevented or detected in an early stage, motivated the MAINTAIN team to design a detection system which outperforms all current solutions in cost, quality and sustainability. Additionally, the implementation of a first of its kind micro gas turbine engine is a paradigm changing innovation within the realm of small UAVs. The MAINTAIN project can thus be viewed as a beachhead for a range of new highly efficient UAV systems. The United States of America were chosen as the initial market as it houses more than half of the global pipeline network and has social-economic similarity to the country of development: the Netherlands. \n\n\u2022 11 fulltime weeks",
