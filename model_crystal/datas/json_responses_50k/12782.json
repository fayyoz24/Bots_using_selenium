(The 5th largest malt producer in the world and No.2 in Europe), Piet Brouwer Power Solutions provides the complete emergency power and grid connected high- and low voltage energy distribution on their greenfield site in Debre Birhan, Ethiopia. The installation will be kept in standard ISO shipping containers.\n\nFrom May 2019 until end of August the same year, we are planning to install the completely containerized power generation and distribution system for the malting plant in Ethiopia. On a height of 2.800 meters above sea level we face yet new challenges for our system to which we have to adapt and challenge all the items part of it. By means of 2 40ft containerized 2.284 kVA prime generatorsets we will make sure the malting plant will be operational 24/7 with limited nuisance of the unstable grid supply. Commissioning a single substation will be as simple as connecting the 15kV supply cable and close the main switch to get it up and running.",

Apart from extending the powerplant's capacity we expand the brewery's distribution network with 2 additional substations, one containerized and one integrated within one of the civil buildings.\n\nInstalled for protecting the loads from any unwelcome power quality issues and powering them through unplanned power-cuts from the national grid is a 1 MW Static modular UPS from Huawei. The UPS communicates with the Powerplant making the total system extremely reliable. The connected loads never experience any power outage due to the Powerplant as well as the UPS being integrated in the intelligent system of Piet Brouwer Elektrotechnology.",

We were responsible for designing, delivery and installation of the complete Electrical Power Generation and Distribution system. We delivered a 15kV system with substations in 4 different locations of the site. These were connected by 1,2km of Multi core Medium Voltage cables. The electrical power is produced by 4MW Generator sets. Our system was designed to be an automated powerplant that will function as the main power supply until the grid connection is realized to provide the brewery with electrical power. \n\nAfter the brewery made a connection with the national grid, our system works as a back-up power system that will intervene on the moment that the local grid is dis-functioning. The Powerplant will automatically start-up and take over the load from the grid and provide the brewery with a stable power input. Once the Grid is back and stable our system will then synchronize back to the grid and transfer load from the generators back to the grid. When deloaded the generators remain stand-by for any dis-functioning of the grid that will appear in the future. This whole process is done without interruption of the production system. The consumers won't even notice the power supply has changed to two different suppliers in the mean time.\n\nAll the sensoring, detection of grid dis-functionality as well as start-up, synchronize and shut-down sequences of the gensets/Powerplant are all done automatically without interference of an operator.",

Within this substation was the 13,2kV Medium voltage distribution panel, a 1600kVA Dry-resin high efficiency transformer and a Low Voltage Distribution Board (LVDB) existing of a \"dirty\" side and a \"clean\" side. I was responsible for the Engineering and Project Management of this project.\n\nThe \"clean\" side owes his name due to the filtered power supply of the Dynamic UPS system. More on this can be found here (https://www.pietbrouwer.nl/en/news/338-lessons-for-ups-from-piet-brouwer-electrotechnology). This system operates as back-up power for the consumers due to the unreliable grid connection. During a power-cut the D-UPS system will supply the consumers on the \"clean\" side of the LVDB with the required power to continue operating while the factory's emergency powerplant starts up and takes over the load. Supplying the consumers and charging the D-UPS for another power-cut in the future.\n\nDue to this containerized substation solution the customer only had to worry about a concrete slab to be finished. Something that can be done really fast. The project was completed far withing the given time-frame and is now providing the production line of our customer with a 100% reliable power supply.  \n\n\n\n",
