    "summary": "Saleh currently holds the position of Renewable Energy Consultant at Witteveen+Bos and Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Energy Transition in the Built Environment at the Delft University of Technology. He obtained his MSc in Architectural Engineering & Technology in 2008. In January 2016 he was awarded by Eindhoven University of Technology with the Doctor Degree (PhD) in Smart Energy Systems. His field of expertise focuses on Renewable Energy Technologies, Zero Energy Buildings, Building Energy Simulations, Designing Renewable-based Energy Systems and advanced engineering solutions for the built environment. He has more than 10 years of professional experience in designing and engineering, research and business development. During his career, he developed ample experience in the field of design and developing energy solutions for the built environment (zero energy buildings and building energy systems, collective low-temperature heating and high-temperature cooling systems, Aquathermal and aquifer thermal energy storage, smart thermal grids,) and grid solutions based on renewable energy technologies (solar and wind power systems) all over the world. \n\nDr Mohammadi has worked internationally in projects in South Korea, Singapore, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Seychelles, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, Romania, UK, Finland, Panama and Belgium. \nHe participated and led high-profile projects such as the design of Smart Thermal Grids for Floriade 2022, Infrastructure design of Grand Bois residences (Seychelles) and design of the ATES system in Busan Smart City (South Korea) and design energy system for Dutch Pavilion Dubai Expo 2020 (UAE). \n\nBesides his consultancy position, Mr Mohammadi was employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Architectural Engineering & Technology of the Delft University of Technology. Within the framework of the H2020 Green Cities Project, he completed his PhD at TU Eindhoven in 2016. Later, as a PostDoc at the TU Delft, had participated in multiple EU research projects such as ERA-NET Smart Urban Isles, TKI Urban Energy KoWaNeT, and deZONNET. These projects primarily involve designing and developing energy systems energy based on the locally available renewable sources, heat storage systems and exchanges potentials between buildings. \n\nSaleh has also presented the result of his research projects at various international conferences, chaired various panels at renowned international conferences and published papers in high-impact journals. \n",
