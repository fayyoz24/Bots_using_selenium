    "summary": "I am a graduate at the University of Tilburg where I pursued my Masters in Data Science. I have a good command of data analysis tools, including Python and R and I have a strong research background with expertise in business.\n\nI was previously employed for a big tech firm in Silicon Valley, which further developed my interest for data analysis and in particular the interest to combine business and tech. I hope to further develop myself with a broad skill set covering more important data analysis facets.\u200b\n\nI was born in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and raised trilingual. I am internationally-oriented, intellectually curious and a jack of all trades.\n\nCurrently, I am a Data Analyst and Subject Matter Expert in the CS Data Governance team within ASML Netherlands B.V. I am always open to connect or you can contact me at sabrina.graaf@hotmail.com.",
