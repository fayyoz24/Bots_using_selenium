    "summary": "Stories fascinate me. Whether it is a good old story about my family\u2019s history, a moment to enter an imaginary world, or a creative brand campaign to release oxytocins (a \u2018feel good\u2019 hormone) in the consumer\u2019s brain. Not only because stories move, bind or persuade, but also because everyone and everything has their own one.\n\nI strive for performance and results. I am used to work hard and fully commit to achieving my goals. Because of this trait, I have become multiple world champion in Kempo/Kenpo Karate. In my work, I apply the same drive and perseverance.\n\nIn search for someone who is studious to be part of a team to create and strengthen your company\u2019s brand or product? And feel like we could be a match?\n\nLet's connect and have a chat!",
