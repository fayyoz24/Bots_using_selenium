    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m a researcher/consultant with 8 years of experience in the field of urban studies. After moving to the Netherlands from Kentucky in 2012, I started doing what I love and do best: researching the very real challenges facing our cities. My expertises include bridging the gap between bottom-up and top-down processes, place branding and social innovation, and more recently, sustainability transitions and experimenting with city streets to transform urban mobility. \n\nThis path has included its fair share of roles and allowed me to work with and for a variety of different organizations and people. My door is always open - let\u2019s get in touch!",

The project deliverable took the form of several interactive models, and an exhibition of PGDP\u2019s alternative futures, which traveled throughout Kentucky and was included in the 2012 International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam.

Qualitative data was collected in the form of interviews and interactive workshops. Quantitative data in the form of maps and figures was also collected in order to provide a complete picture of each city's DNA.

The results of these international cases are applied to the Dutch context, in an effort to understand how this relationship can serve to strengthen the global competitiveness of the Netherlands.\n\nAlongside the independent research project described above, my role at the Deltametropolis Association included working in a team concerned with developing transit oriented development strategy for the Province of North Holland.
