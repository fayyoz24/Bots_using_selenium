Therefore, I need to constantly adapt my approach, tone and message.\n* I have invested in developing and maintaining a comprehensive network of government agencies, non-governmental organizations, as well as the private sector, including Shell. Through this network, I was able to present a 360 analysis of the security situation to the management of the embassy and provide informed and actionable tactical and strategic advice and assurances.",
