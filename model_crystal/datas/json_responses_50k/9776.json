    "summary": "Having grown up in Singapore, a global trade hub, I have always had an understanding of how interconnected and interdependent the world is. Now, through my studies I have a new grown appreciation for and understanding of this characteristic of the international system.\n\nI am exploring this interest by studying international politics, international law and anthropology during my bachelor at University College Roosevelt, resulting in my final year senior project being in the field of geopolitics. My interest in the world around me combined with my love for research render me effective at analysing, applying theory, discussing and report writing. \n\nSome of my current areas of interest include: peace-building opportunities, the Arctic Council, ASEAN cooperation, the belt-and-road initiative, cognitive Geopolitics, weaponised interdependence, and the coming global power shifts. If you share any interests of mine or know of interesting literature, please reach out! \n\nOutside of academics I have remained committed to my area of interest through involvement in the Battlefields Uncovered Program and the 16th Annual Summer University Course in Geopolitics. I have also been engaged in volunteer work as the PR manager of Amnesty Student Group Middelburg and as Chair of UNICEF Student Group Middelburg. \n\nI love to travel, cook, read, play volleyball and learn :)",
