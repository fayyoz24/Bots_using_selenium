            "description": "In Northern Java communities are suffering from coastal erosion along hundreds of kilometers of coastline. In the district of Demak more than 3 km of land have already been swallowed by the sea including entire villages. Sea level rise is projected to flood 6 kilometers inland by 2100, affecting over 70,000 people and 6000 hectares of aquaculture ponds. In the long run 30 million people may suffer from coastal erosion. The main causes of the erosion problems are the removal of mangrove belts for aquaculture development, coastal infrastructure which disturbs sediment build up from offshore, and groundwater extraction which causes land subsidence, and river canalization. The Building with Nature Indonesia Consortium introduces the Building with Nature approach to address these root causes, integrating mangrove and river restoration, small-scale engineering and sustainable land use. \n\nWe helped the consortium: to develop a campaign strategy, research what is needed to mobilise stakeholders, visualise (pictures and interview) daily life in the communities and to guide the Building with Nature Consortium on how to continuate the campaign offline and through social media in the coming years (e.g. by enabling the team through capacity building to continue the activities themselves, and by advising how this can be embedded in the longer-term communications strategy. \n",

One of the most important causes of this is women\u2019s poor accessibility to education and healthcare, and the lack of qualified midwives.\n\nIn the conservative city of Tarin Kowt (Uruzgan), a dedicated women\u2019s wing was added to the provincial hospital in 2008. Women can go there for treatment, sex education and maternity care. There\u2019s also a vaccination programme, and young women are trained to become midwife here. The Taliban considers women to be less than second-rate citizens. Although officially dispelled, the Taliban\u2019s influence is still felt everywhere.\n\nIn traditional parts of Afghanistan \u2013 like Uruzgan \u2013 women only see very small improvements to their lives. Where women and girls are allowed to show themselves in public, they can only do so in the presence of their husband or a male relative, and they are required to wear a burqa. A visit to the women\u2019s wing of the hospital is therefore not at all without risk. Being trained to become a midwife even less so. And still the women come. Still they finish their training and start their jobs. Despite their vulnerable position they have the drive and willpower to make a positive change in their lives.\nTravelling Exhibition on maternal mortality in Afghanisthan.\n\n",

Using our combined expertise, we demonstrate what land subsidence is, its impact on society and the resulting landscape, urban planning and political questions, choices and solutions to which it can lead. Using the personal stories of urban residents, the project illustrates the impact on the lives of those affected and their perspective on the future. What is it like to live in a sinking city? How do you deal with that reality? We connect this social reality with scientific research in an innovative and overarching way, drawing a multifaceted and engaging picture of the threat of land subsidence as well as the policy and technical options that exist to tackle it.",

Maar terwijl het stijgen van de zeespiegel alle aandacht krijgt, voltrekt zich aan de andere kant van de dijk iets wat veel minder bekend is: de bodem daalt. Op sommige plekken in West-Nederland is de bodem door de eeuwen heen vijf \u00e1 tien meter gedaald. Als we doorgaan op de huidige voet, komen delen van de Randstad op acht \u00e1 tien meter beneden NAP te liggen. \n\nDe bodem daalt al duizend jaar. Maar door de klimaatverandering gaat het proces sneller dan verwacht en zijn de gevolgen groter. Bodemdaling zorgt voor funderingsproblemen, schade aan huizen en de infrastructuur en heeft negatieve gevolgen voor de landbouw, het klimaat, de natuur en de biodiversiteit.  \n\nIn Gouda merkt iedereen de gevolgen van de dalende bodem. Overal zakt wel iets weg: van de monumentale panden in de binnenstad en tuinen en straten in een woonwijk tot de koeien van de boeren in de omliggende polders. In hoeverre is de situatie in Gouda een voorbode voor de rest van Nederland? Betekent bodemdaling het einde van de historische binnensteden en het typisch Nederlandse polderlandschap? \n\nSinking Cities Gouda gaat over die andere strijd van Nederlanders tegen het water. Over adaptatie, innovatie en vasthouden aan tradities. Over problemen \u00e9n oplossingen. Een trilogie die begint in de historische binnenstad van Gouda en eindigt in de diepste polders van het land, de bakermat van de beroemde Goudse kaas. Wat betekent het om te wonen en te werken op een plek die zinkt onder je voeten?",

North Jakarta) is an awareness & information campaign about the sinking of Jakarta focussing on the urban young  in Jakarta. \nThe project aims to inform and raise awareness about flooding in Jakarta. It also shows the urgency to protect Jakarta against floods. The project portrays the lives of 4 people living in North Jakarta behind the seawall. It captures their struggles with floods, a sinking house and the costs of drinking water in a city on the verge of drowning; their worries, dreams and hopes for a better future.  \nThrough various media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, website, magazines and exhibitions. The project can be followed  and on Facebook or website. \n\nI recruited and lead a team young Indonesian creatives for execution of this project. Such as a designer, social media experts, journalists, video editor & copywriter.\n\nBackground information\nJakarta, with around 20 million residents, making it one of the world\u2019s five most densely populated cities, is on the verge of drowning. If nothing is done, it is expected one third of the city will be submerged in water in 20-30 years\u2019 time. In some areas the city is sinking at an alarming rate of 7,5-25 cm a year caused by subsidence. Population growth and deep groundwater extraction are a big part of the problem. In the face of heavy rainfall disastrous floods are an impending situation for Jakarta. But also high river water levels because of water running down from the mountains and flooding due to obstruction and pollution of waterways. The risk of giant waves (tsunamis) and the rise of the sea level and a change of climate pose threats as well. Twenty percent of the residents of this megacity are poor and have no access to running water or sanitation. Jakarta relies on an existing 40-year-old seawall to keep the city safe from the Java Sea. This 30-kilometers seawall is also sinking at the same alarming rate.",
