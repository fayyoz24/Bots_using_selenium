    "summary": "As a J.N. Tata scholar and an Aerospace Engineering master student at Delft University of Technology with a specialization in Aerospace Structures and Materials (2021-2023), I am highly motivated to work in the field of development and manufacturing of aerospace components while devising novel material solutions to contribute to a more sustainable aviation sector. \n\nMy relevant experiences during my master's include an internship in Surface Engineering & Characterization Techniques at DRDO, India, and a role of a Manufacturing Engineer at Lambach Aircraft- A TU Delft Student team. With these experiences, I have gained expertise mainly in the field of material characterization techniques, Non-Destructive testing, and Manufacturing of composites among others. Being a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate, my experiences then, result in my competency in mechanical design, analysis, and manufacturing of structures using CAD/CAM. Being a part of various organizations has also resulted in me possessing strong communication skills and a taste of the work-environment culture.\n\nApart from education, I play club-level Lawn Tennis and am also a huge football enthusiast. \n\nWould love to connect!",
