This material is able to break energy absorbed from the sun from one big piece into two smaller pieces that can move, recombine, then be collected more efficiently.\n\nThis research is important because it frames our understanding of abstract quantum-mechanical processes as a useful tool. A tool that can be used to help develop more efficient solar cells.  My experimental data and analyses provide a fundamental exploration of these processes for future researchers to build on-top of and extend into other materials.\n\nKey Achievements:\n\n\u2022\tDelivered 3 large research projects by optimizing laboratory workflows while mentoring 5 scientists. Recognized for work with 3 fellowship awards.\n\n\u2022\tDesigned modular optical microscope to perform a variety of experiments, expanding the research team\u2019s capabilities and avoiding the purchase of a commercial product worth 25% of our annual budget.\n\n\u2022\tCoordinated the design and testing of a technical hardware & software project in collaboration with 4 other research professionals.\n\n\u2022\tTrained other scientists on optical alignment methods for large UV-VIS-NIR optical systems and developed alignment tools and sensors. \n\n\u2022\tSynthesized actionable information from large, detailed data sets using numerical analysis techniques\n\n\u2022\tCreated a nonlinear numerical simulation in Mathematica to explain the power-dependent change of PL contributions seen in a physical data set with 5+ experimental axes.\n\n\u2022\tPurchased and utilized a wide range of optical systems resulting in expert-level market knowledge.\n\n\u2022\tExperienced public speaker from regular progress meetings and 4 poster presentations (2 presenter awards.)\n\n\u2022\tDeveloped physical vapors deposition method for amorphous rubrene.",

First, I was a deep water lifeguard at Blizzard Beach for two summers.  I then transferred to Kilimanjaro Safaris where I  drove through the Harambe Wildlife Reserve as a safari guide for three summers. I enjoyed showing the beautiful African animals to eager children (and adults).  My favorite animal was the Thomson's Gazelle (they're so cute!) Finally, I spent a summer in the Asia themed area of Animal Kingdom at Expedition Everest, where I helped tame the Yeti.",
