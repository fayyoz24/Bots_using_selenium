The aim of the project was to make an interoperable Persistent Identifier framework that linked existing international URN:NBN resolvers and creating policy interoperability for Persistent Identifiers. The Policy interoperability defined the meaning of the word Persistence for organisations who want to join any Persistent Identifier infrastructure (URN:NBN, DOI, etc)\n\nmy role in this project was to provide expert advice to the project leader and to other members. The advice was about on creating a large resolution network, system behavior, resolution syntax,  Also quality assurance of the project results was my task. In the absence of the project leader in the middle of the project, I temporarily took his place.",
