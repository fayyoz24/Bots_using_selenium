I started with performing manual tests of new features and system condition. The application (Vinci Events) was then at its development stage, and each week has been a new challenge as we added more and more features to the future product. In order to prepare for production launch I have studied and mastered Selenium, a framework for automation testing. This enabled me to write tests that would perform automatically before each deployment.",
