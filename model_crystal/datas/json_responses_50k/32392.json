This application is a house to the storage of millions of critical data pertaining to the banking and finance industry. The system had several hits from users across different cognizant locations in and around the world. Performance testing of the application using Web Load 7.0, Load Runner 8.0 and OpenSTA \nPerformance testing was performed from a perspective, to determine how fast some aspect of a system performs under a particular workload. It also served to validate and verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability, and resource usage. \nPerformance testing of BFS severed different purposes. It demonstrated that the system meets performance criteria. It compared two systems to find which performs better. It measured what parts of the system or workload cause the system to perform badly. Scope of testing were-\n1. Load Testing\n2. Stress Testing\n3. Endurance Testing\n4. Spike Testing\n5. Scalability Testing\n\nRole served was that of a team member exploring tools, test environment preparation, execution, and Result Analysis",
