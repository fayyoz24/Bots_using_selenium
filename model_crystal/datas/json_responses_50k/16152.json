Together with Dr. Sander Bakkes, the paper was shaped into a publication at a top tier game conference, and it was nominated for the best paper award. \n\nIt delves into theories of psychology, neurobiology and game studies to explain why people play casual games that are simultaneously frustrating yet engaging. Examples of such games are Flappy Bird and Super Meat Boy (albeit less of a casual game).\n\nLink: http://sander.landofsand.com/publications/roest-bakkes-2015.pdf",

Moreover, some students did not have enough programming experience. Upon realizing this, I organized a skills workshop 2 to 3 times per week to give people more programming experience for those who needed it. And gave extra personal attention to those who needed it. When I took the course HCI I liked it and I wanted other people to like it as well.",
