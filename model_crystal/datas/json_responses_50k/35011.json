The same WTMKL event was held in March 2016, saw an increase of female participation that has led to secure more woman speakers for other local community events including Google I/O Extended Kuala Lumpur 2016, DevFest Kuala Lumpur 2016 and Jom Code Kuala Lumpur 2017. In March 2017, she was invited for a leadership course at Google Asia Pacific Headquarters in Singapore and is now a part of the APAC regional Women Techmakers Lead Organising Team. \n\nShe was invited to speak at several international conferences in 2017 including DroidCon Bangkok, Google Developers Group Summit in San Francisco, Techsauce Global Summit Bangkok, and also Webcamp Penang. She was also invited to mentor the Startup Weekend Women's Edition and Startup Weekend USM organised by Techstars in 2017. This year, she was invited to speak at DroidCon Vietnam as the only woman speaker, representing women-in-tech within the SouthEastAsia region.\n\nHaving to successfully build the community from scratch to over 1,000 members online, Nazlina was awarded with Marie Claire's Amazing Women 2018 for her contribution towards the tech industry here in Malaysia.\n\nLog on to www.facebook.com/WomenTechmakersKL to learn more about Women Techmakers Kuala Lumpur.",

In March 2017, she was invited for a leadership course at Google Asia Pacific Headquarters in Singapore and is now a part of the APAC regional Women Techmakers Lead Organising Team.\n\nShe was invited to speak at several international conferences in 2017 including DroidCon Bangkok, Google Developers Group Summit in San Francisco, Techsauce Global Summit Bangkok, and also Webcamp Penang. She was also invited to mentor the Startup Weekend Women's Edition and Startup Weekend USM organised by Techstars in 2017. This year, she was invited to speak at DroidCon Vietnam as the only woman speaker, representing women-in-tech within the SouthEastAsia region.\n\nHaving to successfully build the community from scratch to over 1,000 members online, Nazlina was awarded with Marie Claire's Amazing Women 2018 for her contribution towards the tech industry here in Malaysia."
