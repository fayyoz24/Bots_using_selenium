    "summary": "I'm Phil and I am an avid follower of football (soccer for my North American friends), a motorsport and auto enthusiast, a budding musician, and a lover of all things creative. Sports have always been my life's main passion, and now I am taking the required steps to develop my career, network, and presence for myself in the sports management industry. I completed my specialization in marketing and my Bachelor of Business Administration at Simon Fraser University and received my Master's in Sport Management at the Johan Cruyff Institute. \n\nI am energetic and enthusiastic about working in the sports industry and use my leadership, academic, and professional experience to work creatively in a decision-making position to make a real impact within the sports industry, and most importantly to continue learning and innovating at the highest level.\n\nCurious to find out more about me, or have an exciting opportunity in the sports industry, or do you just want to network and grab a coffee?
