Currently, I am working at the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets. Personally, I have devoted my legal passion to the European Law Student's Association, of which I fulfilled the position of President of ELSA the Netherlands. \n\nHaving lived in Germany, and the Netherlands, I have grown accustomed to a great variety of changes and challenges based on the country I reside in. These make me a liberal and forward thinking individual that enjoys to work and live in foreign countries outside my comfort zone.",
