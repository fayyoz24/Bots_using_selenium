After 5 to 6 hours of collaborating and building up our final proposal, we presented our ideas to the judges and fellow competition.

Roughly two weeks before the magazine is released I am sent all the articles and a theme, it is then up to me to gather assets and configure the design and layout. Honestly, this is a true test of working creatively under pressure but I thoroughly enjoy it and have advanced may skills in graphic design massively since the beginning.\n\nI've attached my favourite two issues to this post.",

This meant I had many responsibilities and served as my boss\u2019 right hand. I have learnt to become a great listener of customer needs, which has enabled me to deliver a fulfilling customer experience. Because I'm tasked with many activities in the restaurant, my job requires close attention to detail. Additionally, I have picked up a fair amount of the Dutch language through my time spent here.\n\nI am very grateful for the challenges and lessons the Poketaria has presented me with.",

As such, I found a wonderful family with three kids under the age of 8 whom I stayed with for a year and learnt a lifetimes worth of lessons.\n\nAt first, the position required a lot of adaptation as I was living in a multinational environment. I had to learn how to read them, learn from their actions, understand how they live, make them feel comfortable in my presence and make myself comfortable in their presence.\n\nAdditionally, I have mastered the skill of planning and staying consistent with a schedule. As well as, to be agile and make quick impromptu decisions when problems occur. There were plenty times where the parental responsibility fell on my shoulders to satisfy the needs and wants of the three children. I was happy to be trusted and given the responsibility of looking after the children. Acknowledging my responsibilities, I learnt how to lead without additional help or advice, ensuring not to doubt myself or panic.\n\nLastly, due to the fact that I chose to partake in full-time studies while being a full-time au pair, I quickly learnt the importance of prioritising tasks and work-life balance. This past year I have learnt so much about my self-dedication and motivation and how I navigate my work under pressure. I can now happily say that it was my most challenging yet successful experience.",

At the time, I had a long-standing interest in design, and at one point considered majoring in Graphic Design. I mentioned to my employer that I was completing a Graphic Design course and she immediately took interest. At the time, my employer and her husband were relaunching a family owned restaurant in Zurich, and she wanted me to design a flyer for their restaurant. They were thrilled with the results! Later, I also designed the restaurant menu, as well as other personal family projects. My employer recommended me to her friends, and I designed yet another paid flyer for a gardening and home business.\n\nAlthough they were only a few projects, I learnt a lot from my experience designing for clients. The main lesson I learnt was that there is absolutely no harm in trying something different, even if you aren\u2019t highly skilled in it. For example, I hadn\u2019t yet finished the Graphic Design course before I landed my first client. This gave me the confidence that I had the ability to design, and that I would get better with practice.\n\nAdditionally, I witnessed the power of \"word of mouth\" marketing. If I hadn\u2019t spoken about the course I was doing, I never would have landed any clients. Working with clients is fun, and freelancing is  something I'd love to continue in the future.",

To celebrate my love for slow fashion, a good friend and I decided to host our own secondhand market clothing and afterparty. My friend was moving at the time, and we planned for the event to be hosted the day the house was completely empty. It was quite a spontaneous idea which left us with one week to prepare, but we did our best to ensure a successful event.\n\nFurthermore, my friend and I designed the logo together on Adobe Photoshop and advertised our event through Facebook and Instagram. We wanted to accommodate more styles and sizes, so we arranged for additional small businesses to come and sell their goods at our event. Our idea for the event was to have the secondhand market run till the late afternoon, and then turn the event into an afterparty consisting of local DJs.\n\nThis was a great experience for me to trial being an event coordinator as it was something I hadn't done before. I had so much fun planning, co-ordinating and marketing the event and learnt a lot of valuable lessons. In conclusion, the event was a success, but it was noted that had planned further in advance it would have been an even greater success.",

            "description": "At Elkanah House high school, there is a program ran by Mr Le Roux and a large team of students called Social Outreach. Although this program was literally quite limitless, it involved \u201cloving beyond self\u201d in the forms of giving to others who are less privileged. In South Africa, we are exposed to poverty and townships almost all the time, and it is impossible to turn a blind eye to. And this program gives us the opportunity to help out where we can. I was a part of this team for my final three years at Elkanah House, mostly helping run events and the usual Friday projects. The Friday projects were ran for three hours and consisted of students either traveling to under privileged schools in rural areas or an old age home to spend time with those people. Some students stayed at the school and knitted blankets for mothers with premature babies or make sandwiches to later hand out. Personally, this was my favorite part of the week by having the opportunity to give back to others, even if it is only my time and to literally see how it changes their lives and brings such immense joy. Having interacted with this first-hand I will always want to give back in some form or another for the rest of my life."

I reached out to The Learning Tree Educare close to my home, to volunteer for a week. Each day I rotated to different classes dealing with different ages of children from 2 years to 10 years old. This was certainly a wake-up call for me as children require lots of patience, attention, selflessness and care. I learnt a lot about how to entertain different ages, as well as how to promote correct behavior and brain development. This certainly helped me later on in my Au Pairing experiences."
