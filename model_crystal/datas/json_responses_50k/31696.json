I gained a wealth of knowledge and experience with challenging and exceptional opportunities. Looking back today I realize that my journey is not complete with special paths that awaits me to explore. \n\nHaving worked and led people and teams across the entire spectrum of the human resources functions in a Corporate and Consultative environment, the most rewarding for me has been in the talent domain. I have developed a passion for making organisations successful through the identification, development and management of people, leaders, managers and teams. \n\nCareer Objective\n\nMy passion is people and realizing the talent and potential in all people to deliver organisational results and effectiveness. I wish to grow, build and expand my professional knowledge and experience, and put my experience, expertise and knowledge to practice to enable successful people, teams and organisations. \n\nMy core focus areas are Talent Acquisition; Talent Management; Career Management; Succession Planning and Management; Leadership Development; Learning and Development; Coaching; Business Process Improvement; Continuous Improvement; and Organisational Design, Development and Effectiveness.\n\nI am at my best and most inspired when finding fit-for-purpose solutions which enable movement.",
