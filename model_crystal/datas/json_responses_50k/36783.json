    "summary": "Results-proven, team oriented. Eager to apply the knowledge I have learnt in practice and offer my full effort to achieve the targeted goal. \n\nI am highly ambitious, extremely hardworking, self-driven and do not shy away when there is a challenge ahead.\n\nI was born and raised in Aruba. I love going to the beach on a nice sunny day with my friends and family, eating barbeque under the palm-shade with a nice cold drink to cool off. I moved to the Netherlands in 2018 for the sole purpose of furthering my higher education and starting a prosperous career. \n\nFour years later, I  achieved my Bachelor of Science BSc Finance & Control with a GPA of  8/10. My short-term goal is to achieve a Masters Degree in Finance & Accounting, my long-term goal is to have prosperous career in the field of Finance and also, contribute in developing entrepreneurial projects globally.",
