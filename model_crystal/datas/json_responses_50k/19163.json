            "description": "Wearable robotics (WRs) are becoming increasingly crucial for the rehabilitation or the daily support of individuals with impaired motor function. New technologies and materials result in more and more robotics designs with incredible features. However, robot makers often overlook the importance of ethical, legal and societal (ELS) aspects in the design and use of WRs. Considering the social impact of such technologies, it becomes clear that designers of such technologies should be aware of their role in the context of society and develop a mindset that will be more sensitive to ELS aspects. The achievement of this goal may lead to the design and development of technologies with higher user acceptance rates. A straightforward approach to address this issue is by educating young engineers and roboticists. \nTo this end, we decided to coordinate an effort to produce educational material about ELS issues of wearable robotics. This educational effort could take the form of a technology-based, engineering-friendly app or a game that will have maximal impact on engineers. \n\n",

            "description": "Cleaning has a high physical and cognitive load for the cleaner. Also, the cleaning sector is increasingly confronted with new technologies that might have unforeseen consequences \u2013 especially robotics. On the one hand, robotics can be seen as a threat when the robot replaces the human being, on the other hand, there are also opportunities if a robot supports the cleaner, for instance when the cleaner gets older.  Moreover, robotics offers possibilities to create space for work that cannot be done now. The central challenge for the responsible development and implementation of robots is to realize a concrete robotic cleaning system by means of an iterative design process to develop the current first idea into a concrete prototype.",

As a consequence, functional abilities of the arms decrease up to the point that no arm function is left. The disease affects approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births. With increasing life expectancy, the preservation of functional abilities in boys with DMD becomes increasingly important. Although some devices aim to compensate for the loss of muscle function, these are not always adequate and are highly stigmatizing.\n\nTherefore, the A(bility)-Gear project aims to develop an inconspicuous body-bound assistive device that can be worn underneath clothing and supports the arm for the independent execution of essential activities of daily living.",

My vision is to study, develop and improve upper extremity rehabilitation protocols in combination with Virtual and Augmented Reality environments for people with upper extremity related impairments. Additionally, I am very interested in research ethics and how modern technology can have a positive impact on society, by considering the individual needs of the users and all the relevant ethical consequences.
