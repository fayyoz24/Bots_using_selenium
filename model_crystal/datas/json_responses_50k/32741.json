    "summary": "I am a strategy consultant working majorly in energy and chemical sector. Having worked in various topics such as circularity, CCUS, emerging fuels, I believe that with consistent and combined efforts the goal of net zero can be achieved.\nI completed my Ph.D. from TU Delft. During my Ph.D. I worked on the turbulent combustion modeling of anode baking furnace to reduce NOx emissions. Having completed my Ph.D. and master's degree from TU Delft and bachelor\u2019s degree from one of the National Institutes of India (NIT, Nagpur), I decided to broaden my horizon in the commercial domain of technologies especially required for carbon neautrality. Being an enthusiastic learner and team-player, I have worked on various multidisciplinary projects to explore my theoretical knowledge in practical applications.  With my hardworking, good listening and collaborative abilities, I have successfully completed projects in multinational teams to develop solutions through strategic thinking. I am constantly looking forward to ways in which I can improve my technical and strategic skills.\nAlong with the academic curriculum, I have also handled various responsibilities to develop my leadership and PR skills. I keep exploring my wish to help the society by taking part in various activities. For example, during Covid-19 outbreak, I co-founded a drive named Mask for India to provide free reusable masks to underprivileged population of India. Being a part of social activity organization from undergraduate university, I have contributed to improving the education of students from one of the orphanages in India. In my free time, I like to cook, practice yoga and travel.\n\nYou can reach me on: prajakta.nakate11@gmail.com",
