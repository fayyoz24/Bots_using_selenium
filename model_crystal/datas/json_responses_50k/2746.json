    "summary": "My purpose is to help individuals and institutions to take sustainable action. Since human beings seem to have problems with their motivation for these actions, institutions must implement policies. I contribute to help transforming banking into a force that facilitates sustainable action. A banking sector that uses its best efforts to preserve the planet for future generations is worthy to be trusted.  \n\nAlongside my full time job at ING, I am a Professor of Practice of Business Ethics at the University of Groningen. During my PhD, I became interested in the research question: why is it so hard for people to become motivated to act such that we preserve the earth for future generations? In 2019, Routledge (London) has published my research monograph entitled: Sustainable Action and Motivation: Pathways for Individuals, Institutions and Humanity.",
