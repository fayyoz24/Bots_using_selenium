I was given the responsibility to design the upper steering column: A system that is dense in functionality, and directly in the hands of the user. As it was to be extremely lightweight and compact as well, and to adhere to both road and EASA regulations, designing this system was an exciting challenge. By applying clever, well thought-through solutions the system met all requirements, and the prototype was fully functional upon first assembly. In addition, an ignition lock was designed, heavily relying on 3D printing technologies. Again, a highly integrated and compact system was developed, that met all the safety requirements.",

To understand the impact of standardization, I was asked to initiate an optimization study for the heavy duty powertrain with Waste Heat Recovery (WHR). This was an individual project, though done in cooperation with both DAF Trucks and Eindhoven University of Technology. I created a drivecycle-based optimization platform with formal constraints that is able to optimize the main powertrain component sizes and control in an integrated manner. Moreover, I developed a novel, integrated method of optimizing the WHR system as well. As the platform had a modular setup, it anticipates the integrated optimization of powertrain topology. The results gave DAF insights in the optimal sizing of the components, which constraints they were bound to, as well as what consequences integrating a WHR system has for the powertrain design. The platform will be used as a basis for an integrated powertrain optimization tool at the Eindhoven University of Technology.",

In order to develop such a system, a model-in-the-loop environment was to be made. I was responsible for the electromotor model. By first understanding the electromotor physics, and modelling methods, I was able to develop a generic but accurate electromotor model, suitable for a forward dynamic electro-hydraulic power steering model.",

I was tasked to lead one of three teams. I coordinated the team by ensuring that each member was aware of the tasks at hand, ensuring that each was able to give input in the design process and providing help where necessary. In addition, I made the detection and response algorithms, as well as the sensor models. The result was that this team developed an innovative Adaptive Cruise Control controller with two-dimensional situational awareness, that was able to preempt cut-in manoeuvres by fellow road users.
