Three-phase Magnetic Fault Current Limiter (FCL) concept is developed and patented. Full-scale 1.2 MVA prototype is successfully tested at KEMA laboratories in Arnhem.\n\nFCL utilizes magnetic properties of silicon steel to limit short-circuit current to low pre-determined level. Its reaction on a fault is instantaneous, which enables successful limitation of the first fault current peak.",
