    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my profile!\n\nI am an astrophysicist, currently pursuing my PhD at Leiden Observatory, The Netherlands. I study different aspects of galaxy evolution in groups and clusters of galaxies, including the growth of their stellar content over cosmic time using data from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Hydrangea, EAGLE), and photometric and spectroscopic surveys (KiDS, GAMA).\n\nI have obtained my MSc in Astrophysics (September, 2018) at the Erasmus Mundus MS program called Astromundus (http://www.astromundus.eu/). During the MSc program, I have studied at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, University of Padova, Italy, and University of Belgrade, Serbia. For my MSc thesis, I worked with data from the MATLAS photometric survey to study the nature of the nucleated dwarf galaxies in the local Universe.\n\nI also have 10+ years of experience in astronomy and science outreach in Bangladesh and the Netherlands (2+ years). I strongly care about sustainable practices in personal and professional life, and equity, diversity, and inclusion in science and academia. A glimpse of my work is provided in the following sections of this page. \n\nLast but not the least, painting using different mediums, traveling, and reading are also important parts of who I am. You are welcome to check my blog \"lammimahad.me\" where I write about different topics of my interest.",

I, with two of my fellow program participants designed this project to share opportunities with sub-urban students around the country. \n\nAs the treasurer, I have received the grant money of $1500 in my account and have been keeping all the accounts of expenditure and fund allocation for the project. \n\nAs the co-director, I have designed the project structure, worked on deciding and managing logistics and taken sessions at the outreach programs. Besides, I have mentored 2 groups of beneficiary students with their small project and career counselling.
