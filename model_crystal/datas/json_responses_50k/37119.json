    "summary": "I believe people can be empowered to discover new things about themselves every day and eventually realize their own strengths and potential to and by putting their great ideas into practice. \nI enjoy working with youth -and people with more experience in life- to facilitate processes by which they implement projects of impact in their school, organisation or communities. \nI entered the world of Education first as an international student but later, through Development and Human Rights, as a vehicle to support the change I believe our world needs. Still learning from wonderful people, of all ages, around me and trying to find new ways to bring about and support systemic change.\nI cherish and need nature around me, from nurturing a seed to bloom into a beautiful flower  or a nutritious food, to contemplating trees moving in the forest. \nMy interests are collaborative creation; physical, emotional and spiritual well-being and environmental sustainability.",
