    "summary": "Studied Civil Engineering and Economics and achieved a Masters degree in Real Estate. Urban development and construction has always been of great passion to me, from a very early age.\n\nWorked in hospitality for over 10 years and in addition worked at multiple Real Estate related companies, this made me specialised in the Leisure Real Estate business.To combine these two aspect within my work environment would be my preference profession. \n\nOther aspect of me that I'm very passioned about would be: \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTravel                    2010 - 2011\n\n\u2022 It's one of my mayor passions. Being to every continent has opened my eyes about the differences, similarities and possibilities within cultures, religions, politics and heritage \nWhile travelling through South East Asia, Australia and New Zeeland my biggest accomplishment has been to build up a new life, get a job and a home in a completely different country, language and environment and surviving without any help doing this.\n\nVolunteerwork         1997 - 2011 \n\n\u2022 During pacific times in my life I have volunteered for multiple charities. During college we held a yearly fundraising to raise money for the development of a college in Guatemala.\n\u2022 During my travels I have volunteered on numerous occasions in Asia. Where I have helped in orphanages, schools and community centres by working for them or helping them out this was with varying terms of 1 day up till a couple of weeks.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
