    "summary": "My professional experience links wide-range scholarship, incorporating art history, history and cultural philosophy, with creative and reliable management for museums and exhibitions. I like challenges, getting results even under difficult circumstances. My strength is my capability to encourage teams to get more and better results through collaboration, starting from clearly-expressed directions and goals.\nMy own goal is to keep on developing my experience in directing people within museums, in collaboration with all kind of stakeholders, most of all the museum public.\n\nSpecialties: directing people through collaboration, focused on results by means of creative efficiency, generating concepts and scenarios for museums, exhibitions and city art projects, producing exhibitions, (art)historical shifts and margins, anchored instead of autonomous creative developments",

(Collection online in Dutch.) This enhances the visibility of the entire collection and its use by the Fries Museum itself but also by other heritage institutes. At any given time, objects from the collections are on display at over 100 locations.
