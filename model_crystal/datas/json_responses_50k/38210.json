    "summary": "Passionate hard-worker that is always eager to acquire new knowledge while taking responsibility for his actions and is a true believer that we can achieve more together.\n\nThrough my past internships and several projects during my studies, I was able to gain practical experience in B2B and B2C marketing and sales such as market analysis, cold calling, account management and evaluation of marketing tools effectiveness. \n\nAs a matter of fact, I like planning ahead, and rapidly apply recently learned new skills. I enjoy taking the initiative and work on my own. Also, I enjoy working in a team and quickly adapt to the individual team dynamics as I believe that we can achieve more objectives together. This is because, while volunteering and living abroad, I've developed an affinity in working with people from different backgrounds. \n\nAfter having successfully completed both my bachelor's degree in International Business & Management at Hogeschool Rotterdam Business School, and MScBA Programme in Entrepreneurship & Innovation at Amsterdam Business School. At the same time, joined the Honours Sustainability Programme intending to learn how to create business models and partnerships needed to help businesses transition to more socio-environmental-friendly practices.\n\nI\u2019m currently exploring opportunities to test my current skills and acquire new ones through a new challenging full-time working experience that could allow me to connect with multiple professionals across different sectors. \n\nIn the future, by acquiring knowledge\u00a0through my studies and working experiences, I aim to become an impact entrepreneur with the scope of\u00a0making a difference and bringing change across multiple sectors.",

We established a real Joint Venture (registered in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce and with a real bank account), and we are running the business through the whole school year.\n\nIn order to achieve the agreed outcomes Rotterdam Business School students have been collaborating with Lille University students and vice versa (3 students from RBS and 3 students from Lille, two groups). During the whole school year we have been working under guidance of the lecturer assigned to review this project.\n\nFurthermore, four join pressure cooker sessions were organized in Lille and Rotterdam. During which we had generated ideas with regards to a particular product or service, created a business and project plan, have been reporting bi-weekly our progress and company\u2019s performance and give the final briefing on the achieved results.  However, due to the latest pandemic we had just one of the four pre-scheduled meeting.\n",
