    "summary": "My name is Joey Koopman, I live in Rijswijk and graduated the Applied Physics study at The Hague University in Delft. During this program I learned to systematically analyze and solve problems. I have also worked multiple projects in different fields, such as: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and business administration.\n\nI see myself as a creative person with a lot of perseverance and I always work hard to achieve my goal. My interest in physics cannot be summarized in one subject, I am very interested in many new technological developments in different fields. Furthermore, I am an enterprising type and like to work 'hands-on' and do experimental research. In addition, I am also interested in business, that is technologically based. This is my ambition for the future.\n\nDuring my study I did two internships, one at cosine measurement systems and the other at TNO Acoustic & Sonar. At cosine I have performed a radiometric characterization of an infrared imager and made an experimental setup to measure the signal to noise ratio. At TNO, I designed a sonar buoy network to detect and track whales by the sound they produce.\n\nWith these two projects it can be seen that my interests are not limited in 1 subject. Although they are very different, they were both very interesting and fun to perform.\n\nI find the working environment the most important thing for a company. The work should be performed in a nice and open work place, with a dynamic team. That way I can learn from others and others from me, this will definitely boost the morale of the group and will make the job even better.",
