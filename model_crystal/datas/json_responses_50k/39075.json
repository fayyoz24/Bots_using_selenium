    "summary": "I\u2019m Tom, born in the beautiful city of \u2018s-Hertogenbosch and currently living in Tilburg. I acknowledge and appreciate where I come from. I think it is a very privileged position and I am grateful for the life I\u2019ve had so far. Of course life also has hardships, but those gave me the most drive, passion and motivation to do something that\u2019s meaningful in my eyes. Also, triggering this in others is at least as motivating to me.\n\nDuring my Bachelor's in Psychology I learned how to combine theories I learned in classes with practical experience in my personal life, work and extracurricular activities. \n\nMy board position at AIESEC Tilburg taught me many other things, next tp further putting the theory learned in my Bachelor's in practice. All the mutual feedback that was given, enabled me to learn a lot about myself and the people around me. Also it brought me a huge increase in knowledge about the business world, with all of the partners and members I got to interact with.\n\nCurrently, enjoying a Master's program at Tilburg University 'Data Science and Society', where I am learning how to provide data science solutions to solve societal health problems.\n\nAt work, I\u2019m at my best when I am in an environment where I can be honest, direct, and serious.",
