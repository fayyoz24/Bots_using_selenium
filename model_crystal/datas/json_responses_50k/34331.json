Involved in the development of the hardware and readout part of the straw-tube tracker (STT) of PANDA with a focus on the performance testing and optimization of track reconstruction and analysis tools in the data acquisition process of the central tracking detector. These developments will be driven by analysing the data from test measurements of the STT conducted at the Forschungszentrum in Juelich, Germany. Physics feasibility studies will be carried out for PANDA by using Monte Carlo simulations and an object-oriented reconstruction and analysis framework that is under development. The focus will be on studying the PANDA potential for open-charm production with the aim to carry out a heavy-light (Ds) spectroscopy program in the near future using antiproton-proton annihilations. The interest is a study of the hadronic and electromagnetic transitions among Ds states which provide crucial information that could reveal the structure of charm-rich matter. A key element for a successful heavy-light physics program is the performance of the track reconstruction. Hence, the feasibility studies match well to the hardware activities that are conducted in the first phase of the project. Participation in the data taking activities of the BESIII experiment, which exploits electron-positron annihilations to populate open-charm states.",
