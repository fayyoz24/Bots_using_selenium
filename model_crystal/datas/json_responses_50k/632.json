Most of his art at those times, where found objects and paintings. His bachelor in architecture and furniture design is reflected back in his 3 dimensional forms and philosophical concepts about society. \nAfter winning an art prize at the Dutch Caribbean exhibition: Arte\u201d 99, he bought his first \"Digital 8\" handy camera and started doing video art. As a contemporary artist he has been representing his island since 2001 on different international exhibitions from biennials to group exhibitions in the Dominican Republic, USA, Cuba, Taiwan, China, Germany, Portugal, Costa Rica, Cura\u00e7ao etc. He has a skeptical view on the new world we live in through his artwork as well as a sharp and minimalistic artistic work approach. In 2011 he did his debut as co-director in the short film \"10 Ave Maria\u201d and was awarded by the jury as Best Short Film at the 2011 Trinidad & Tobago Film Festival. Mid 2011 Oduber was the first recipient of the J. C. \"Padu\" Lampe award, a price awarded for his cultural endeavors in Aruba for the visual arts. In the same year he did the direction of photography and the editing in the short artistic film \"Muhe Frida\" (best Aruban short at the Aruba International Film Festival 2011) which was also presented in the New Media Program of the 2011 Trinidad & Tobago Film Festival. \nHis next short film \u201cAwa Brak\u201d (2012) won the audience award at the 2012 Aruba International Film Festival and was also showed at the  2012 Trinidad & Tobago Film Festival together with his latest short Art-Film, \u201cKima Momo 58\u201d under the New Media Program. He\u2019s most recent exhibition was in Maracaibo, Venezuela at the MACZUL. He is currently the head of the Media department at the National Library of Aruba and also does commercial work in the field of graphic design and video.",
