    "summary": "Meticulous and analytical researcher experienced in the development of finite element models in the fields of microfluidics and biomechanics. Adept at independent and collaborative research, study design, implementation and testing as well as process improvement/simplification.\nIn microfluidics, I worked on developing a prototype for a portable blood-test medical device the size of a wallet. I improved the design and efficiency of one of the components by combining CAD, CFD and experimental testing. \n\nIn biomechanics, I developed a new methodology for generating patient-specific FE models, to predict knee joint osteoarthritis and to validate the approach against follow-up information by combining MRI, FEM and motion capture. Currently, we are incorporating this method in developing a clinical tool to predict knee joint osteoarthritis using FEM. \n\nThe research resulted in 5 scientific publications in high-impact journals and were presented at 6 national and international conferences. These projects were carried out in collaboration with both internal and external partners.\n\nDoing research in several different fields means that, even though the general approach is the same, I must adapt and learn to use new tools fast due to the length of the projects. I am a bit of an introvert and a good listener, which allows me to keep calm in stressful/conflict situations and focus on the problem itself. I like to be direct and honest and do not like promising what I know is not feasible. I love working in different challenging areas and finding innovative approaches to solve them. I particularly enjoy working on projects I am passionate about that challenge me to dive deep to find a solution.\n",
