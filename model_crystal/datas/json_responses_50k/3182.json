The project is to analyze the feasibility of a Hydrogen Powered Aircraft (Embraer E-145) and come up with a best possible design for a future fleet of hydrogen aircraft.  The Project will quantitatively and qualitatively analyze different propulsion systems like hydrogen combustion, fuel cell systems, batteries or a hybrid system and integrate them with the E-145 aircraft to come up with the great design in terms of Flight Performance and Economical Feasibility. Also developed the Business case for Embraer and built a strategy for how to further build the project.",
