    "summary": "Currently I work as a Solutions Engineer at Atlassian, primarily analysing customer technical requirements, improving communication with clients, onboarding them with technical solution assistance, helping them with their technical questions and issues for our solutions. My approach is based on more customer-oriented strategy, helping customers to meet their goals with possible solutions from Atlassian tool stack, even delivering custom scripting solutions and reports accordingly. \n\nWhile I'm not working, I like to travel in order to see new places and meet new cultures. I'm also interested in professional photography, painting and graphic design. \n\nIf you think that you have a project I can help with, please feel free to get in touch.",
