Attitude is more important than technical level. The group does not want to encourage competition and perfectionism for its own sake but we want to awaken growth and positive social values through the performing arts. We will work towards choreographies to perform for the Suite in the LAKtheater or other occasions such as Dance Festivals possibly with live Arabic music. Everyone who is enrolled in one of the previous levels of Egyptian dance or from other Belly dance courses can apply. There will be an audition day on the 9th and 10th of Sept starting at 19h30. For application and more information please contact info@egyptiandance.nl",
