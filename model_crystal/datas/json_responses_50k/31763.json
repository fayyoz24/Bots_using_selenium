    "summary": "I help the payment and chip industry to be compliant with various interoperability & security standards. Sometimes certification can be a road-blocker, but we assist companies with the right knowledge at the pre-certification stage. This helps them make informed decisions not just to be compliant but to do more than what is expected. \n\nFor the last six years, I have been working with various Issuers, Acquirers and PSPs in Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. I was based in South Africa. So I will always have a soft spot for my home country :) I relocated to the Netherlands in 2020 and working my account management magic on the BENELUX market. \n\nI am easy to work with and hands-on to support my colleagues and, most importantly, my customers to be successful. I provide clear communications and very detail-oriented. I am working on my leadership skills as I someday want to inspire others to achieve their goals and dreams. \n\nDo you have questions around digital security and digitalization? I have access to a phenomenal team across the globe that can help out with:\nEMV Issuing and Acquiring | MTIP | CPV | 3DS | Common Criteria | PCI | CPoC | softPOS | Terminal Security | Functional Testing for L1 and L2 | Brand Certification & Verification | FIPS | Test Automation | Self Test Platform | PSA Certified Test Lab | eSIM | Payments End to End Testing | EMVCo SBMP | Mobile Payment Certification | SDK Security Evaluation | Secure Element Hardware Testing | MPA Functional Testing Service | Issuer Wallet Certification | C-TAP | GSMA | ISO 19790",
