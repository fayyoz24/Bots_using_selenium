    "summary": "I am financial manager and agricultural water management expert at FutureWater with over eight years of working experience in managing and executing international projects in the fields of water management, irrigation and agriculture. I received my master degree in Environmental Sciences at Wageningen University, where I gained broad experience in planning and organizing projects, and worked both as a consultant and scientific researcher. My technical expertise embraces drone and satellite image processing and interpretation, GIS analysis, climate smart agriculture and water allocation modelling, both at the level of a single field and an entire river basin. Countries of work experience include The Netherlands, Spain, Mozambique, Kenya, Ghana and South Africa. Over the past years I had a predominant role as project manager of FutureWater\u2019s agricultural flying sensor (drone) projects in Africa. In these projects, I functioned as business developer to set up successful local enterprises in Mozambique and Kenya, which provide a low-cost drone service to small- and largescale farmers. The high-resolution drone images, which are made by trained local operators, indicate crop stress, around ten days before it can be detected by the naked eye. This early-warming decision tool gives farmers the possibility to take preventive measures, reducing crop loss and thus increasing yields and farmer\u2019s income. The images are also used for an innovative (water) productivity analysis in combination with crop growth modelling.",

In this course a group of about 30 students with a diverse cultural and disciplinary background perform a real life environmental consultancy project abroad and as a group. \n\nIn a period of 10 weeks we conducted a mobility analysis for a client in Brno, Czech Republic. Part of the project was carried out in Wageningen, but we also travelled to Brno for a period of 2 weeks. I was appointed project leader in a group of 30 people. I experienced that active-listening and clear communication are of great importance to yield maximum team progress.",
