    "summary": "From advertising ideas to strategic propositions that can be advertised. \n\nWRITE YOUR STORY BIGGER: \n\nI am what I call Chief Idea Officer: copywriter, creative director, Head of Brand, ideator, trendslator, proposition marketeer, storyteller and contenteer all in one. I can move on business level, on marketing level and/or purely on advertising/activation/sales promotion level. More urgent than marketing strategy it is never going to get though.\n\nEither way, my scope isn\u2019t so much different, I find - or invent - the things worth talking about, the things worth noticing, the exceptional, the new. That distinct resonance. That part remarkable. \n(While 'distinct' makes sure your story is heard, your brand is seen. 'Resonance' makes sure the audiences care. And \u2018remarkable\u2019 is about the why, what and how.) \n\nSo let\u2019s get your corporate, business, brand or product story crisp and clear again, its core and soul (re)defined. You yourself can\u2019t get it sharp? The problem lies between the organizational, product and marcom levels. We start on one to find the clues for the other. \n\nThe story most concise, in words and shapes everyone understands, brings new clarity, gives direction to decision-making and inspires work floors. A communications plan. A copy strategy\u2026 (I bet 80% of your current content is worthless!)\n\nTHINK DIFFERENT. INK DIFFERENT\n\nAlong the line I invite you to find inspiration in purpose, blind spots, blue oceans and white spaces. In innovative propositions with better value, in campaigns and platforms that reignite, reshape and include. Less data-driven stalking. More intriguing angles. \n\nI won\u2019t just leave you with a document, but produce a PPT, an umbrella concept, a film or whatever tells (and shares) best what should be it; a strategy, a positioning, new product-market combinations and/or the campaign plus the mechanisms and constructs for branding, storytelling and (social) media. \n\nSo, come to me for mission/vision, a stand-out statement, a manifesto, a strong new theme (or a cultural consultation when you are from abroad). AND for translating these into an overarching strategy, a formula, the frameworks and the practical pointers to stay on strategy in design, advertising and content.\n\nLet me pitch triggers per channel: smart budget ideas, ads, activations, value props, content ideas, events. Enough brainwaves to find brilliant ones.   \n\nWe\u2019ll divide things and you\u2019ll pay me a tailor-made fee per track?\n\nPORTFOLIO > https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjAayGx",
