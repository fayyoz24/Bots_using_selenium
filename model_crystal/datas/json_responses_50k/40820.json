The energy network of Eskom, the national energy provider, is overloaded and power stops are getting more frequent. The assignment of our graduating project was advising Birchwood by developing and implementing an EMS (Environmental Management System). We wrote an advisory report and helped the hotel by setting up energy saving projects, we organised the communication and awareness creation of employees and assisted by carrying out Corporate Social Responsibility to the guests.",

In these departments I was serving the guests and worked on my language skills. After 11 weeks in the F&B department, I went to the housekeeping department, where I worked as chambermaid, as employee of the launderette and with the heads of the housekeeping. After this experience, I went to the front office department, where I worked at Service Express, reception and concierge.
