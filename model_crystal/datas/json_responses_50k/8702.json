    "summary": "I am a senior researcher at the department of Political Science at the University of Amsterdam. My area of expertise is international comparative research on migrant rights and immigrant integration.\nI am the PI of RIGHTS project (funded by an ERC Starting Grant). This project takes a novel approach to the issue of low skilled migrants' rights, by examining how governments of migrant origin countries can influence the rights of their low skilled migrant workers in destination countries. \nThe focus of my teaching is research methods and introductory statistics. I encourage students to become critical consumers and producers of social-scientific data. An essential skill not only for researchers but also for policy makers, NGO staff, journalists and politicians.\nI enjoy thinking about new ways to support students in their learning. Small group exercises and discussions are a key part of my approach to teaching. It is through active engagement with the course topics that students learn best.",

            "description": "When there is discontent, why do some people protest while others cross borders? Connecting theoretical expectations from the migration and protest literatures, we examine:\n\na) whether similar factors drive the choice to migrate and/or protest at the individual level;\nb) how context affects this mobilisation;\nc) whether these choices are independent of each other or mutually reinforcing/ undermining.\n\nMOBILISE employs a multi-method (nationally representative face-to-face panel surveys, online migrant surveys, protest participant surveys, focus groups, life-history interviews, social media analysis) and a multi-sited research design. It covers Ukraine, Poland, Morocco and Brazil, which have recently witnessed large-scale emigration and protests. It follows migrants from these countries to Germany, the UK and Spain.\n\nThe project offers four key innovations:\nit combines protest and migration;\nit captures all the relevant groups for a comparative study (protesters, migrants, migrant protesters and people who have not engaged in migration or protest);\nit tracks individuals over time by employing a panel survey;\nit includes the use of social media data providing real time information on the role of networks and political remittances.\nThese features allow the project to make a major contribution to theory development in both migration and protest studies and offer key insights to policy makers on factors influencing political and economic stability.",
