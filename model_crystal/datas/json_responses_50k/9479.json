    "summary": "A curious individual and storyteller, I worked as a journalist for more than a decade. \nI started my career as a print journalist but fell in love with what technology has to offer to storytelling. I moved to Amsterdam to pursue a research master\u2019s degree in New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam. This course allowed me to deepen my understanding of new technologies and the politics behind them, and combines the humanities with another passion of mine: data analysis. \nBefore moving to Amsterdam I worked for 8 years in Haaretz' newsroom, Israel\u2019s most renowned newspapers as a front-page editor, leading a team as a copy editing manager and, most recently, 4 years as the outlet\u2019s Education correspondent. \nIndependent and self-starter, I like a fast-paced work environment and specialize in creative problem-solving. \nPassionate about diversity and equality, I volunteered in feminist grassroots organizations that give women an opportunity to raise their voices. \n",
