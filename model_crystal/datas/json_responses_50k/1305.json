    "summary": "I am an ambitious, highly-skilled young professional. I am currently living in Groningen and working in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands. \n\nIn my current position, I am the Recruitment and Admissions Officer for the Bachelor programme at the University of Groningen's - University College Frysl\u00e2n called Global Responsibility & Leadership. I truly believe that the graduates of this programme will be the leaders of the future. They will change the system, thus, recruiting students for this programme, in my opinion, will have an impact on the system we will be living in, in the future. \n\nPrior to this, throughout my BSc degree in International Business, I was working as International Team [I-Team] Coordinator for the Central International Marketing & Communications Department of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen [RuG]. \n\nAdditionally, throughout my MSc in Sustainable Entrepreneurship, I was working in the International Marketing, Communications and International Relations office of my faculty, the newest faculty of the RuG - Campus Frysl\u00e2n. \n\nI truly believe that everyone can make an impact on the world, and it's important that everyone tries because a lot of small changes, can result in massive overall changes.",
