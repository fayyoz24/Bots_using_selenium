    "summary": "CURRENT: Last 12 months: Freelance cook for 'Brut de Mer' (De Pijp, Amsterdam), 'Harbour Club' (Vinkeveen), 'Hotel Spaander (Volendam), 'Cantine de Caron' (Westerpark, Amsterdam), Art Ventura (Catering bedrijf, Amsterdam) \n\nDuring the pandemic I worked for the Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) as a Covid-19 tester and administrator.  I have also been a vaccination support worker. \n\nThe previous four years, before the pandemic, I had followed my cooking passions, from cafes to 5 star hotels and everything in-between, as a freelance chef.\nI completed a year long project in Limburg (NL) turning a bankrupt and outdated lunchroom into a successful evening restaurant.\nUpon return, I project managed the building of a kitchen in a large restaurant in Amsterdam. \nSince the Limburg restaurant I was not fully running my tent and event company, and only on an occasional basis hiring them out. One cant do everything at once and, with two small children, something had to give! But thats rapidly becoming history...\n\nA great positive of the pandemic is the time to reflect that it has given me with a renewed passion for everything involved with entertainment. \nNaturally I'll continue with my passion for food and work within the industry, but with my children now somewhat older, I'm also actively seeking work in the events sector.\n\nIn the past I have managed my own company as an event organiser, artist manger and promoter. Combined with my vast catering, restaurant and hospitality experience, it has given me a tremendous oversight of location management and tailor-made concepts. With my dome tents, I created festival-style weddings, as well as using them for other events.\n\nI also have an extensive knowledge and passion for music and film. I have worked as part of a audio/visual DJ outfit (video editing and sound production of our own material) and performed this at large festivals and events around the world. None of this would have been possible without having an eye for marketing.  I have also re-scored and edited soundtracks for classic films that have been shown in prestigious  locations in and around Amsterdam. I also continue to produce and release electronic music in my spare time.\nThe next adventure awaits, and I'm ready to get my hands dirty, with the enduring attitude that a jobs not over until its finished!",
