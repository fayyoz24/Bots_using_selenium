    "summary": "I'm a multidisciplinary UX Designer with 5+ years of experience based in Drachten, The Netherlands. My added value lies in the intersection of business, design and development. That means that I not only know how to craft beautiful (and usable) user experiences, but I also know how to make UX contribute to your KPIs and how to hand-off my designs to development in an efficient and lossless way. \n\nDuring the past few years, I've been working on 10+ (international) projects for various SaaS products in industries like Mobility, FinTech and Domotics. My experience is based upon a cum laude Bachelors degree in Communication & Multimedia Design and a Masters degree in Creative Technologies (Serious Gaming). People who I\u2019ve worked with, characterise me as a highly organised design thinker with an extensive skillset.\n\nPortfolio (outdated): www.rinzevanderbrug.com \n\nExperience: UX Design, UI Design, Product Design, Interaction Design, Wireframing, UX Research, Prototyping, Gamification, Design Thinking, Usability Testing, Scrum, Motion Design, Information Architecture\n\nTool stack: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Framer, InVision, UXPin, Whimsical, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Axure, Adobe After Effects, Lottie, HTML, CSS, GIT, GitHub, WordPress, Miro",
