Between 2008 and 2014 I travelled to beautiful Vercelli, European capital of rice and risotto in Northern Italy, and learned more and more about the community, the people and the local football team. By means of connecting past and present, and exploring what Pro Vercelli is about, the legendary champions are brought back to life again in this debut.",
