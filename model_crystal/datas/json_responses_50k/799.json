    "summary": "I believe in authentic leadership.  My future employer should know I am a dynamic woman with a remarkable story. My resume attempts to relay a multi-talented career but in truth, there has been as much failure as there has been success. \r\n\nI am blessed with creativity, poise, the ability to retain a great deal of information and excel at nearly whatever I dedicate my mind. To some this is an asset. My dream job will truly see me and welcome all that I am capable. My dream job will be a convivial team where I can laugh and bring my whole self to work.\r\n\nThe inspiration to articulate my authentic truth comes from blessings at two events: the 20th Annual AACUC Conference in Atlanta, Georgia and the 10th Annual Dress for Success Gala in Scottsdale, Arizona - where I was honored to be a guest speaker. Surprisingly, my message of the power failure attracted positive reinforcement from numerous Executives who too experienced struggle before success. With authority, they have instructed me persevere. Will do, dear friends, will do!\r\n\n\nKey Words: Global Client Relations, Customer Support, Strategy, Analysis, Project Ownership, Process Improvement, Team Building and Public Speaking. \r\n\nCover Letter and Resume Available \n\r\n",

PGs play an important role in mediating both the acute and the chronic consequences of UVR exposure. UVR-mediated induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) contributes to increased PG synthesis. In theory, reduced catabolism might also contribute to increased PG levels. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin deyhdrogenase (15-PGDH), a tumor suppressor gene, plays a major role in PG catabolism. In this study, we investigated whether UVR exposure suppressed 15-PGDH while inducing COX-2 in keratinocytes and in human skin. ",

The purpose of this protocol is to study the action and the effects of Etanercept, on psoriasis. This medication has been studied extensively and has been found to be effective and safe in the treatment of psoriasis. The eligible patient will have 10% of his/her body surface area involved with psoriasis vulgaris. This trial is a phase III study to help understand the action of the drug etanercept, trade name Enbrel, for the adult patient with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and who is a candidate for internal medications.",

Subjects must have a minimum of 6 months history of psoriatic arthritis to qualify. The study is in 3 phases - pre-randomisation of up to 35 days, up to 84 days treatment and a 28 day observational follow up. Treatment groups are 40mg CC-10004 od, 20mg CC-10004 bd or placebo. To ameliorate the dose dependent adverse events of CC-10004 (headache and GI disturbances) there will be dose titration of 10mg od (or placebo)for days 1-3 followed by 20mg od (or placebo) days 4 to 7 in the first week of dosing. Assessments take place after week 1 and then every 2 weeks during the treatment phase.\n\nPlasma pharmacokinetics of CC-10004 will be evaluated in a subset of patients from each active treatment group during the treatment phase. Normal and psoriatic skin biopsies and/or synovial biopsies will be taken for evaluation of histopathology and biomarkers from subsets of subjects in each treatment group.",
