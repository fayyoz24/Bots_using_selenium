    "summary": "Supporting clients on their circular economy journey specializing in circular economy strategy and circular transition indicators ( CTI ) as a framework. Passionate about the energy transition and its close connection to the circular economy and decarbonization.\n\nNext to this I have worked with a diverse set of clients including environmental strategy and calculating carbon ( CO2 ) emission  including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. I have worked with sustainability reporting from an audit perspective ( ESG assurance ) which has helped me better understand the struggles of companies with adopting ESG and I have worked with advisory clients on supporting them with getting ready for the CSRD. \n\nHappy to chat with likeminded so don't hesitate to send me a text!\n\nCircular economy | Sustainability | CTI | Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ( CSRD ) | GRI",
