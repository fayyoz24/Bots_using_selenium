Ideally, I would like to pursue my career in the field of arts and culture. Based on insights from cultural economics and experience in the road of values, I am interested in arts and/or cultural related (international) projects. \n\n",

Member of the international team of cultural economists at EUR (2013-2012)\nTasks: In order to come up with sound advice for the Dutch government, we charted the various practices, policies, institutions and economies concerning the utilitarian crafts in China, India, Italy, Germany and the UK. At the same time, when researching the importance of plumbers, welders, house painters or roof workers, we also discussed the value attribute to the craftsmanship of skilled work in our daily lives across the various cultures. I was fully responsible for the research on China and partly for the UK\nResults: <Herwaardering ambachtscultuur hoofzaak> report\n\n2. Member of the international team of cultural economists at EUR (2011-2012)\nTasks: From a cultural economic perspective, the project focused on economics of the arts, the crafts, and in particular the creative crafts in modern society. We proposed a new notion to make a distinction between \u201ccrafts culture in general\u201d and \u201ccreative crafts culture in particular\u201d. Therefore, we had to investigate the creative crafts sector in Japan, China, India, Italy, Germany, and UK, and also to explore the important role of crafts in the economy of the future. I was fully responsible for the research on China and partly for the UK\nDetails: As an investigator, I went to China (Beijing, Jingdezhen, Chongqing and Xi\u2019an), and was invited by Mr. Shan WANG, the secretary-general of the China Arts & Crafts Association in Beijing.  I also interviewed craftsmen (e.g. ceramists, glass-makers, and embroidery-makers), shopkeepers, consumers and craft educators to explore how China struggles to maintain craftsmanship in modern society. \nResults: <Creatief vakmanschap in international perspectief> report",
