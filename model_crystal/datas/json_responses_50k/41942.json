    "summary": "Welcome!\n\n''Goal = plan + action!''\n\nAre you excited by having the perfect team fit or greatest job? I get energized by bringing ambitious professionals & companies together. I enjoy working out of a company's strategy reaching the best results while having fun, developing and creating new skills. Who doesn't want to have a satisfying job and be successful? \n\nRecruitment is my ambition. I prefer working in International environments and love the challenge of finding the best possible recruitment solutions for hiring managers. I enjoy working on large recruitment projects and cooperate along the way improving strategies. \n\nSpecialities: recruitment, sourcing, interviewing, communication, relationship building/account management, successful meetings, employer branding, social media.\n\nWhen I am not recruiting, networking or have fun with my colleagues, you can find me running, on the volleyball field (in- and outdoor), in nature for a great hike, practicing my language skills, writing blogs or meeting dearest and nearest. Besides that, travelling is my passion, so I travelled the world and there is still a lot to discover... \n\nCurrently I add all my passion and experience into the recruitment goals of Coolblue (Energy)!\n\nDo you want to be part of our winning team and experience our culture (simply amaze, slightly different, friends, flexible, just do it)? \nE-mail me: c.vkralingen@coolblue.nl \ud83d\udce9\n\nOr feel free to connect. \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
