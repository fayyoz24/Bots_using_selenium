The similarity, the co-existence and overlapping of features of traumatic fractures and heat-induced fractures (HIFs) accounts for this problem. Scarce literature exists for this issue, particularly for blunt force trauma (BFT) and these studies utilized animal bones. \n\nTo address this problem, this project (Master's thesis) aimed to distinguish the characteristics of BFT-fractures and HIFs (and situational fractures) in burned bones. \nLong-bones were subjected to either trauma or fire, or both trauma and fire. Analysis of human cadaveric arms was done macroscopically (using a checklist) and micscropically. Custom-made device and apt pyre were built for fracturing and burning of bones, respectively.\n\nDifferences between BFT-fractures and HIFs, post-burning, were observed. There were also features were very similar between some fractures, that could cause misidentification of fracture type. Most of the observed features agreed with former studies. Interestingly, some key novel findings were also seen.\n\nThis project moreover showed the effectiveness of a checklist of both quantitative and qualitative features for fracture differentiation. It was concluded that differentiation of traumatic fractures from HIFs is possible through meticulous analysis. \n",

Array of methods are available for TBI detection and for dating.\n\nIn this literature review, few of these methods were evaluated based on a custom-made list of criteria.

The matchmaking application is a free service for visitors of the business events, exhibitors, speakers and sponsors with their details. This way they can get connected before Chocoa and meet each other during the festival. These events are excellent opportunities for meeting new business relations. \u2018Chocoa 4 Business\u2019 contains information about exhibitors, visitors, speakers and sponsors. The Matchmaking app can be considered as a combination between Tinder and LinkedIn. \n\nAs part of the marketing team for this application, my role is to collate, analyze, organize and refine data regarding the various people/companies. I also communicate with these people/companies via email to ensure accuracy and credibility of information. The data is then transferred to the App for effective usage by participants. During the festival, I helped with on-spot technical issues and data matters for the app.",
