    "summary": "I coach people in the development of their communication, presentation and story telling skills. The people I work with include individuals, teams and organisations from the business and education sectors.\n\nMy understanding of the relationship between the body and voice, and their potential as vehicles of communication is the result of more than 30 years working as a professional dancer, actor, singer, director and choreographer in a variety of theatre genres.\n\nDeveloping communication, presentation and story telling skills is an experiential learning process of which I'm a fervent advocate. I take theory a few steps further by using the body, the senses and instinct as powerful learning tools. For me it\u2019s all about doing and experiencing, then analysing. My approach is physical which the people I work with say can be thought provoking and challenging, yet always supportive with a sense of fun.\n\nOriginally from Newcastle, Australia I live and work in the Netherlands since 1988.\n\nPositive outcomes for people I work with include:\n* Learning to give a presentation with a clear core message and concise delivery.\n* Developing new verbal and non-verbal communication skills by exploring and where necessary setting aside old habits.\n* Developing their creativity and expressiveness whilst remaining authentic.\n* Increased efficiency in the workplace through clear and relevant communication within and between departments.\n* Obtaining goals by learning to respond effectively to the environment.\n\nI specialise in:\n* Presentation work - from creating the concept to coaching the performance.\n* Storytelling.\n* Voice/body integration - includes vocal maintenance and training the voice and body to work as a unit.\n* Grounding/mindfulness.\n* Confidence building.\n* Team building.",
