    "summary": "I am a physicist with a background in particle and astro-particle physics. Since July 2022, I joined the TROPOMI team at KNMI changing my research subject to engage with the exciting study of the atmospheric ozone using satellites remote sensing techinques. I find this new topic very stimulating as I realized that I work at my best when I am in the middle of a research field with a an applicable output, involving at the same time, communication and management skills.\n\nPreviously, I have been part of several astro-particle physics experiments. At Nikhef (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), in the Dark Matter group, I was involved both in data analysis and technical projects in a R&D laboratory. During my Master thesis, at the TU Dortmund (Germany), I have carried out a technical project working on pixel silicon sensors for the upgrade of the ATLAS Inner Tracker detector at the CERN laboratory (Geneva, Switzerland).\n\nDuring my years of study and work, I have always been drawn by the idea of the cooperation worldwide which is what has always lead me to search for new experiences also outside the University of Bologna.\n\nFor more information, feel free to contact me at dipede.serena@gmail.com",

We worked in a data analysis project using data coming from the ATLAS experiment at CERN to look for the heavy vector boson called W' in order to improve the experimental sensitivity and the exclusion limit of its decay using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Each of us focused on one ML technique (Multilayer Perceptron, Boosted Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine) and we showed that both the\nsignificance and the exclusion limit of the W' were improved.",
