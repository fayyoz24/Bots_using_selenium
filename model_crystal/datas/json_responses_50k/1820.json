But the festival's philosophy is based on the idea that people will have to revalue their food in order to make a sustainable change. In our view, the best way to do that, is by enjoying, loving and caring for your food. And the best way to do that is to get inspired. Therefore we also screen documentaries that show the most amazing chefs, dishes, food producers and food lovers. Also, we invite the public of the Food Film Festival to brush up on their cooking skills by partaking in one of the many workshops. Because the best way to revalue food is through the shared experience of it. In 2011, the first edition of the festival drew the attention of around 3,500 visitors, in 2014, the Food Film Festival welcomed over 9,000 visitors.\n\nAs one of the founders, I have been involved in various roles in de development of the festival. As a Managing Director, my main responsibilities were overall management, finance, partnerships and fundraising.

YFM has developed a two tie strategy to change the future of food and farming. By creating an interdisciplinary network of young people that share the value of food, we are creating a fertile ground for new ideas, businesses and projects that help the food system forward to flourish. By connecting people from different social, professional and cultural backgrounds, we create a network of change makers that will change the food system from within.\n \nOn the other hand, the YFM is constantly enlarging and strengthening its on- and offline community, by doing grassroots events, campaigns, and by influencing the (online) debate on the future of food and farming. Raising public awareness while showing innovative alternatives for food production and consumption holds the key to steering the transition to a truly inclusive, good, clean and fair food system. \n\nOver the years, YFM has evolved from being a volunteer-based, grassroots organization to a social enterprise that runs various projects. These projects are both privately or publicly funded. As director, I was responsible for strategic long-term decisions, day-to-day management (financial and HR), partnerships and fundraising (private and public).\n\n\nwww.youthfoodmovement.nl\nwww.yfmacademie.nl\nwww.heteetcafe.eu\nwww.damnfoodwaste.nl",
