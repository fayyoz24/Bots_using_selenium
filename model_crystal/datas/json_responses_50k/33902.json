Companies were forced to send workers home, transfer some of them to part-time work, while others have been laid off and not called back. Unlike any other modern recession, the downturn triggered by the COVID pandemic has created larger employment losses among women than men \u2013 and it is a global trend. In Ukraine, the number of employed women in 2020 decreased by 4%.\n\nWe analyzed which professional clusters of women have become more vulnerable to two types of risks: the risk to lose a job due to new lockdowns and the risk to become redundant due to accelerated automation. According to our estimates, 58% of all employed women in Ukraine, or 4.4 million, have become more vulnerable to the consequences of the COVID-crisis. These include certain categories of office workers, technicians, laboratory and research staff, service and trade workers, and women in elementary occupations.\n\nWe scanned the most relevant vacancies in the labour market using big data and talked to HR professionals to develop up-skill and retraining recommendations for professional clusters of women we consider potentially vulnerable.

Latest data suggest that its share in Ukraine\u2019s GDP has reached 5%, and its increase to 10% is one of the key goals of the Ministry of Digital Transformation. \n\nAlthough the number of students majoring in Computer Sciences is growing by 11% annually, only 20% of them are females. As a result, the Ukrainian IT industry, like the global one, is gender unbalanced: 25% of IT employees in Ukraine are women, yet most of them work in non-technical jobs, such as project managers, HR, and marketing specialists. \n\nStudying Computer Sciences is often associated with math. However, the data show that there is no statistically significant difference in the average scores of ZNO, a nationwide examination to enter higher education, in Mathematics between girls and boys. In addition, girls choosing to major in CS have higher ZNO scores in Ukrainian language and English. Therefore, the difference in mathematical abilities cannot explain the low share of girls in CS programs. \n\nThe peculiarity of the Ukrainian IT sector is that it offers much higher salaries than other industries. For women who are interested in innovation, ready to constantly learn and integrate into the global community, employment in IT can become a decent option for greater financial independence. We calculated that even in junior roles in IT remuneration is three times higher (+15.3 thousand UAH per month). \n\nIn addition, the gender pay gap in IT is 11 percentage points less than the national average. In other words, a small positive impact on the economy from attracting more women into IT could be achieved through a smaller pay gap in an industry where compensations are already much higher than the national average. We estimate that the Ukrainian economy would gain up to 32.7 million USD from this. ",

The tracker helps assess the ongoing situation in the russian economy under Western sanctions amidst the official data credibility concerns. Our work was published on VoxEU/CEPR and featured in The Guardian, Business Insider, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Lavoce.info, and other. \n\nOn the China desk, I contributed a chapter to a policy note on the transformation of China from a global manufacturer to a technology leader. The note takes stock of China\u2019s progress towards strategic autonomy, and the policy implications for its major trading partners, including Europe. \n\nI also co-organised the 2022 China expert network workshop, an annual conference for China policy experts and academics from the Eurosystem, fellow central banks, think tanks and international organisations. \n\nLastly, being one of the 17 first Ukrainian nationals ever at the ECB, I initiated the establishment of the ECB-UA support network. It is a community of ECB employees organising and promoting organisation-wide initiatives and events in support of Ukraine.",
