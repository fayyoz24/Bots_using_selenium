    "summary": "I specialized in creativity, health and transformation. I have gained considerable experience in the wide area of human resources management and personal development within multinational companies. Based on a BA in Human Resources Management and an in-company MA in Organisational Design, I developed an expertise around organizational and personal development, as well as in (personal) coaching. \n\nMy corporate experience motivated me to broaden my horizon, when I observed at first hand that personal development is highly multi-disciplinary. I became quality coordinator of a large Dutch multinational and was trained in the Baldridge method.   I obtained an MPhil in Political Sciences (Peace and Conflict management) at the University of Granada (Spain), specializing in the use of non-violent communication and the impact that violent communication has on personal and individual development.  I am a visiting professor of Leadership, Personal Development and Mind/Body Medicine at different Business Schools. I work as a coach and I am frequently invited to give corporate workshops around issues of leadership, but my real passion lays in running workshops around health, the healthy organization, and holistic personal development.\n\nSpecialties: I became an Ayurvedic massage therapist and continued my education in Ayurveda and health management with Deepak Chopra. Today I am a certified \u201cCreating health teacher\u201d of the Chopra Centre. My listening capacity and constant awareness for group\u2019s interaction makes that I am able to tailor any workshop in Health Leadership, Sustainable Performance, Human Resources and Organizational Dynamics.",
