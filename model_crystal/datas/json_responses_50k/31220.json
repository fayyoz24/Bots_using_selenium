    "summary": "Dr. ir. Maarten Smoorenburg has a knack for technology and earth sciences, and really enjoys bringing innovations to the fields of hydrology and operational water management. His key expertise's include hydrological forecasting, forecast verification, model predictive control, rainfall-runoff modeling, field experiments and remote sensing. In his projects, Maarten aims to get a thorough understanding of the water system and its stakeholders before designing and implementing the innovations that will help people make better hydrological forecasts and forecast-based decisions. \n\nSince 2017, Maarten has been a member of the River Forecasting Service of the Netherlands Water Management Centre at Rijkswaterstaat (WMCN). The service is responsible for forecasting of flows for the  Rhine and Meuse rivers, and also for interpretation and dissemination of EFAS forecasts. \n\nCommunicative, ambitious, and \u2018can-do\u2019 \u2013  Interest in technology and societal/environmental issues made me study civil engineering and specialize in hydrology and water resources management. Working experience in different fields and countries nurtured my broad curiosity and allowed me to develop a broad hydrological skills and mindset. \n\nThemes: Flood forecasting, reservoir management, model predictive control, operational water management, flood risk, catchment hydrology, water resources management, development cooperation, environmental policy, numerical modeling, spatial analysis, remote sensing, geomorphology, science communication.",
