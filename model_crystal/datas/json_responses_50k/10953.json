But they are ineffective when it comes to handling programming constructs like pointers. In this thesis we have developed a pointer analysis infrastructure to enable pointer support for the ASET + BONES approach (a semi automatic code parallelizer). Our pointer analysis infrastructure is based upon LLVM\u2019s compiler infrastructure and relies on an indigenously developed flow insensitive, context sensitive analysis pass called ex-ptrinfo. The pass is designed to perform static analysis of source code and extract required pointer analysis information useful for parallelizing pointer based sequential code.",
