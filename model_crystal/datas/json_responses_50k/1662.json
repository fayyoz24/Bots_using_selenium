    "summary": "I render advice, second and expert opinions to clients and to other advisors on corporate income tax, EU and tax and investment treaty matters. Academically, you can read around 100 publications of mine, including four monographs. I also teach on international tax law, investment tax related disputes and AI and tax law domestically and abroad at various universities and institutions. \n\nI have completed a full time post-doctoral research fellowship at the Singapore Management University (2017-2018) and a full time PhD research program at the Department of Public and International Law at the University of Oslo (2012-2016). As a member of the International Fiscal Association, the International Association of Artificial Intelligence and Law, and The European Federation for Investment Law and Arbitration, I expand an ever growing network of the top tax law, investment law and artificial intelligence experts around the world. My past membership in the international research project entitled \u201cSustainable Tax Governance in Developing Countries through Global Tax Transparency\u201d, financed by the Research Council of Norway, allowed me, in turn, to obtain an experience in cooperative teamwork with prominent tax law experts from 7 universities across three continents and two hemispheres.\n\nI speak English, Norwegian, Russian and Polish, my native language. I also have some knowledge of Portuguese.\n\nSpecialties: international and comparative tax law, ISDS tax related cases, artificial intelligence and law.",

The economic and political stability and development of the EU and its Member States depends to a large extent on offering a stable and foreseeable legal framework for domestic and foreign investors.\n\nIn addition, access to an efficient and effective dispute settlement system is an important and integral element of the Rule of Law within and outside of the EU and its Member States.\n\nEFILA complements these endeavours by providing as a Brussels-based think-tank a platform for a fact- and merit-based discussion on pertaining to all relevant issues associated with the EU\u2019s investment law and arbitration policy.\n\nTo this end, EFILA regularly organizes events such as the Annual Conference and the Annual Lecture.\n\nTogether with the Queen Mary University of London, EFILA publishes the European Investment Law and Arbitration Review. The first legal journal that is exclusively dedicated to the EU\u2019s investment law and policy agenda.\n\nEFILA also publishes papers on relevant topics of European investment law and policy and participates in public consultations organized by the EU, OECD, ICSID etc.\n\nEFILA also actively participates as an Observer in the UNCITRAL WG III on ISDS reforms.",
