    "summary": "I help multinational companies build trust with tax authorities around the globe. I do this by developing and implementing sustainable Tax & Transfer Pricing models.\n\nI also help clients to document and support their position in controversy cases, including during tax audits and via the (B)APA and MAP routes. My practical experience includes dealing with tax authorities from many countries: UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Ireland, Russia, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Singapore, Malaysia, and others. \n\nI am a life-long PwC professional with 13+ years of multi-jurisdictional experience, having worked in London (3 years), Amsterdam (3 years), Brussels (2 years) and Saint Petersburg (5 years).  I have worked (and made friends) with colleagues and clients representing many different cultures and backgrounds.\n\nI am happily married and have a 9-year-old daughter. I enjoy travelling and am a big fan of Europe and of its multicultural heritage. \n\n#PwCTPteamNL",
