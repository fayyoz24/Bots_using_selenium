    "summary": "Scientific researcher with an excellent (magna cum laude and cum laude) academic background in Occupational Health Psychology (MSc) and Forensic Psychology (MSc). Currently working in the field of psycho-oncology, specifically sustained employability of cancer survivors and their partners.\n\nKey skills: \n- strong academic and creative writer in Dutch and English\n- able to coordinate a multicomponent, multicenter, national research project\n- able to observe current trends in a research field and to generate ideas\n- efficient worker with an eye for the bigger picture AND necessary nuance\n- strong intrinsic motivation, calm passion\n\nPersonality: INFJ-A\n\nFuture research interests in:\n- meaning-centered psychotherapy in various contexts (cancer/forensic)\n- narrative integration in various contexts (cancer/forensic)\n- image of God in the midst of hardship (cancer/forensic)\n- return to work in self-employed individuals with (a history of) cancer\n- ADHD, autism, HSP in the workplace\n\nBehind the academic: Having grown up in a village where everyone seems to know at least my grandparents if not my entire family, I have a deep appreciation for smalltown country living, local products, and learning about history. My biggest joys in life include going on woodsy walks, reading historical fiction, learning old-fashioned skills, and listening to my Dad's old Elvis Presley records. I'd love to take up 1930s Lindy Hop swing dancing in the future, and have a background in classical ballet.\n\na.zegers@amsterdamumc.nl\nhttps://research.vumc.nl/en/persons/amber-zegers",
