    "summary": "Enthusiastic, spontaneous, and ambitious. I am someone who recognizes problems, grabs them, and acts in order to solve them. Therefore I do not sympathize at all with postponing solutions and the avoiding problems. My fields of interest are very diverse; from economics and history to music and art. In addition, I am very good in analyzing new projects whilst maintaining sight of the bigger picture with a hands-on approach. Finally, I do not like half measures, hence I finish what I started in a decent manner.\n\nQuantum Computing and its effects on Economics - Thesis at Tilburg University\n\nCliftonStrenghts:\n1.
