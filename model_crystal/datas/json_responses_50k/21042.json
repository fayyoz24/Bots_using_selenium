    "summary": "Currently, I am a frontend developer with over a decade of web development experience, focusing on applications using React and TypeScript. In the past, I was deeply involved with Vue.js, Stylus, and Webpack.\n\nI actively participate in technical interviews for senior frontend engineer roles, ensuring that we onboard top-tier talent. My communication skills have always been a cornerstone of my professional journey, allowing me to effectively liaise within my team and across inter-departmental lines. I am always approachable, and my colleagues know they can count on me whenever assistance or expertise is needed.\n\nIn the blockchain domain, I've accrued over 2 years of experience crafting frontend solutions. My modus operandi emphasizes direct browser operations, such as split-join, signing, and exchanging. I store contracts in IndexedDB, reserving servers (nodes) solely for the concluding contract registration in the blockchain.\n\nMy technical proficiency spans a wide spectrum of tools and technologies, including console, nginx, git, and docker. I previously led SPA development with SSR using Vue.js and Vuex. My testing knowledge encompasses Jest, Testing Library, TestCafe, and Nightwatch.\n\nReflecting on my initial years, I embraced a full-stack role, immersing in PHP, MySQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Node.js, AngularJS 1, Jade, and SCSS. While frontend development has been my predominant focus recently, I also ventured into creating a Node.js and Express API, integrated with Postgres.\n\nAlways keen on staying updated, I keep my finger on the pulse of emerging technologies and shifts in the web development sphere. Occasionally, I revisit the React documentation, refreshing my memory and acquainting myself with new features and updates.\n\nIn essence, I am equipped to drive web projects from conceptualization to deployment, touching upon Backend, Database, Frontend, Server configuration, and more. Although versatile, I predominantly steer towards frontend endeavors, sidestepping unique UI design tasks.\n\nLastly, I serve as a mentor at hexlet.io, undergoing courses spanning frontend development, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, not just as a teaching endeavor but also as a perpetual learning journey.",
