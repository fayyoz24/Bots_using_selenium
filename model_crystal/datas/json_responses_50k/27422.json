    "summary": "Making something or solving puzzles has always been one of my greatest passions. Over the years this passion has evolved from building with Lego's and doing puzzles to near endless curiosity in the physics of the universe and applying this to build something useful. \n\nMy passion lead my to study Mechanical engineering where I developed myself in this technical field and found a great challenge in the energy transition. To contribute and maybe even solve this challenge I opted for a second master degree in nuclear fusion to tackle one of the hardest physical problems currently known that might lead to infinite energy.\n\nNext to my studies I developed myself in the participation bodies of the university, teaching me to be critical and working together with different kinds of people (students, scientific staff and supporting staff) to achieve a great program. I also spend time at the study association where I did some committee work as well as a board year. Learning the importance of planning and making your deadlines in a stress ruled environment. \n\nI graduated both master's degree in December 2021 by completing my graduation project titled: \"Design of a Lithium Vapor Box Experiment in Magnum-PSI, which was awarded a 8/10. \n\nNow I am looking to make my contribution in the engineering or fusion world, hoping that my knowledge and effort will slightly change the world.",
