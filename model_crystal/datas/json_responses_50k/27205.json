    "summary": "I am John Schaap, a passionate software engineer, architect, and accomplished technical lead based in Katwijk. For me, software development transcends mere professional engagement; it is a passion. I pursue the exploration of cutting-edge technology and their practical implementation. My work ethic is characterized by an unwavering commitment to attaining the highest standards of completion in all endeavours.\n\nWith an academic and professional foundation rooted in science, I possess a comprehensive grasp of theoretical concepts. This proficiency extends to the practical realm, enabling me to effectively translate theory into tangible results. My objective is to produce software solutions that are not only functional but are also maintainable and scalable, aligning with fundamental software principles such as SOLID, KISS, and YAGNI.\n\nWhile engaged in software development for volunteer organizations, I predominantly focused on hands-on coding. My corporate engagement within a multinational context involves multifaceted responsibilities. These encompass leadership roles, including guidance for teams, addressing intricate software challenges, designing microservices architecture, conducting requirement analyses for high-value projects, and offering support in project and stakeholder management.\nMy aptitude for swiftly comprehending intricate systems equips me to effectively address issues and provide solutions with minimal production impact, even in scenarios unrelated to my own or my team's work. Colleagues often characterize me as resolute, dedicated, and detail-oriented, supported by a consistent history of tenaciously tackling challenges and delivering optimal outcomes, irrespective of complexity.\n\nMy CV can be found here: https://audabit.nl/cv.pdf",

The application's features encompass the display of information pertaining to missing persons, sea, and beach warnings, as well as general meteorological data such as sun, wind, and water conditions.\n\nA key aspect of the application is its notification capability, enabling users to opt for important alerts. For instance, they may receive notifications about imminent lightning activity and be advised to promptly vacate the water. The notification system relies on ASP .NET to manage and store device registrations, ensuring efficient delivery of popup notifications to the registered devices when necessary.\n\nIn the context of all systems, both the front-end and back-end undergo rigorous testing and are integrated into a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The infrastructure comprises four distinct environments: Development, Testing, Acceptance, and Production (with staging and production slots)",

I developed an application that allowed for 3D object manipulation with hand gestures and with the mouse (widgets). 39 users participated in an experiment where they had to perform 3D object manipulations with both methods with the developed application. The speed and accuracy as well as usability aspects were analyzed. The conclusion was that hand gestures are faster, more user friendly and as accurate as mouse interaction for 3D object manipulation.",

As part of this research, a system was developed to address this concern. To enhance the accessibility of the system for public use in simulations and games, it was imperative to integrate it with the Unity3D game engine.\n\nThe primary objective of the project was to integrate the crowd simulation system seamlessly into the Unity3D environment. However, notable challenges arose due to the inherent programming language differences, with the crowd simulation system being written in C++ and Unity3D supporting C#.\nConsequently, a significant task involved developing a wrapper that bridged the gap between the C++ codebase of the crowd simulation system and the C# environment of Unity3D. Additionally, another crucial aspect was devising an algorithm capable of extracting Unity3D meshes to an .obj format, while intelligently removing non-walkable triangles and structuring the data in a format compatible with the crowd simulation system.\n\nMoreover, a promotional website was created to showcase the project and its functionalities. Alongside software development, I assumed the responsibility of project leadership and engaging in constructive communication with clients to comprehensively understand their requirements, ensuring their satisfaction with the final product.",
