In the three years we dealt with important issues such as the future for our gifted and talented pupils as well as for those with special needs. An other important item on the agenda was development, salaries and benefits. At the same time we would mostly be busy with  approving the school calendar, adopting curriculum, teacher development, overseeing the school's finances, etc. Our schoolboard played an important watchdog role in keeping the school on track, and setting policies that affected our children and school.  Our team contributed their unique talents while collaborating and working as a team with other board members and the school management team."
