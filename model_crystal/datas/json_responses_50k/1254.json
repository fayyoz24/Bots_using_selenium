    "summary": "I am a curious person interested in how things work. My interest in functional materials, and the relationship between structure and properties. Doing research into materials that have the potential to end up in products and devices that improve our everyday lives is highly appealing to me and has landed me somewhere in between the fields of chemistry and physics. \n\nI am an eager worker that dives deep into what I am working on. My interest in communication about my work also makes me an enthusiastic presenter.\n\nI believe myself to be an open-minded person with a broad perspective. In addition, through having varied interests outside natural sciences, e.g., touching on creative arts (drawing, painting, graphic design, and photography), I consider myself to have a broad and diverse skill set, and someone that is always willing to learn.",
