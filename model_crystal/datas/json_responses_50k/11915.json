While most of our traffic saw content in English, the continued success of our product relied on quality localization in 40+ languages\n- An advocate for the customer: fiercely customer-focused, championing the best experience by negotiating the right (and sometimes difficult) conversations with the right people. Knowledge of the business from a broader perspective, like understanding the code logic and limitations in our tech stack, gave context in how to navigate these discussions\n- Community mentor/role model: exhibiting a leadership style that rested on subtle influence rather than hierarchy is how I got the job done\n\nThis hands-on approach gave me the tools I needed to draft the initial job description for this role - which is still used today.",
