The five requirements for a startup to flourish are talent, customers, content, capital and a startup-minded environment. Based on these five pillars, StartupAmsterdam has designed its action programme to boost the Amsterdam startup ecosystem.  \n\nTo support the international growth of startups, StartupAmsterdam continually builds strategic relations with tech clusters around the world. One way which StartupAmsterdam helps startups benefit from these international relations is by organising inbound and outbound startup bootcamps during municipal trade missions. During these intensive multiple-day bootcamps, international startups are introduced to the knowledge and connections they need to enter the Dutch market from Amsterdam. Vice versa, Amsterdam-based startups are invited to join bootcamps organised by StartupAmsterdam with local partners in cities like New York and Paris.",
