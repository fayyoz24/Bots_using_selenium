    "summary": "I am a structural geologist through academic background with close links to geomechanics, petrophysics and sedimentology. Conducted experimental scientific research (geomechanics) before persuading a career in the geo-energy industry. After being a workflow consultant for 10 years, through working on cross disciplinary geoscience related challenges for customers, I received a solid foundation level of mainly Production Geoscience (static reservoir modeling) related competences and field scale geomodelling. This allows me to combine fundamental Integrated Reservoir Modeling (IRM) concepts supported by a solid tooling background (e.g. Petrel / JewelSuite / Techlog / TNavigator / CMG / Abaqus) and software technology development knowledge (e.g. AGILE project management, digital transformation, technical data management, workflow automation, cloud services, deployment).\n\nSubsurface discipline integration (GP-PP-PG-RE-GM) and understanding for example how modeling uncertainties are propagated from exploration, to appraisal, to field development and finally brownfield production, is something I have been exposed to extensively over the past 10 years. As a static reservoir modeler, I like to use my geological knowledge (independent of tooling) to build scalable models on a selected platform with the latest technology that does the job for the modeling objective and underlying field development concept. I have a good background in static/dynamic model QC workflows and Integrated Reservoir Modeling concepts (e.g. uncertainties - scenario modeling - model framing).\n\nKeywords: Account Management | Marketing | Business Development | Consultancy | Product Development & Delivery | Research | Training",
