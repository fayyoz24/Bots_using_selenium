    "summary": "Strong marketing professional, with a demonstrated history of working in consumer goods industry. Passionate about brand building, beauty & lifestyle, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) and driving a meaningful connection with consumers, building brand loyalty and sales acceleration.\n\nFounder & CEO of De Online Kliniek. During my previously job as a Marketing Manager for the skin improvement brand IMAGE Skincare, I discovered what great results this brand shows for skin improvement. I also found out that there are plenty of other brands all over the country with similar results.\n\nI was aware of the fact that the skincare market requires honest and accurate information to help consumers, in the Netherlands and Belgium, to make informed decisions about their skin health. With so many products, treatments, and claims available, it can be challenging for individuals to navigate and choose what's best for them.\n\nIn many cases consumers have a distorted view of which products / treatments actually improve their skin. And quite frankly: good and honest information is lacking in many cases.\n\nTherefor, I took the opportunity to promote transparent evidence-based information, and encouraging an open dialogue between consumers and my skincare professionals. I am convinced\nthe market can better meet the needs of individuals seeking honest and effective solutions for their skin concerns.\n\nThis is how I developed a one-stop solution with my company: De Online Kliniek. By offering all customers a full-service personal skin coach (free of charge) who offers the best honest solutions for skin improvement. Which helps consumers to choose the right products and treatments at De Online Kliniek for their skin. \n\nwww.deonlinekliniek.nl",
