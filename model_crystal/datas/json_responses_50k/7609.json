    "summary": "I have a wide range of experience in traffic and transportation projects, ranging from feasibility studies (including cost-benefit analysis), traffic management to detailed geometric road design, both as a consultant and a project manager. \n\nMy contributions to large scale and complex road infrastructure projects in The Netherlands, mainly focus on the integral (road) design process, taking into account road safety, traffic flow, impact assessment and costs. Some major projects I worked for: 2nd Coentunnel Amsterdam, Zuidas A10 Amsterdam, A2-tunnel Maastricht and the Northeast corridor Eindhoven (NOC). \n\nMy special interest goes out to road design, traffic flow and traffic safety in and near tunnels. Beside contributions to road infrastructure projects, I have carried out several (fundamental) researches on the aspects of traffic safety, road design and traffic flow, resulting in (international) publications and contributions to road design guidelines.",
