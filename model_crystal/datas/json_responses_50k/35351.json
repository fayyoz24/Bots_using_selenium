    "summary": "After I completed my  secondary school (Atheneum-B), I studied Algemene Operationele Technologie (General Operational Technology), AOT. This study comprised the main subjects necessary to operate or maintain an industrial company.\nDirectly after having done my military service, I was hired as a process operator at Cocoa \u201cDe Zaan\u201d, (production of cocoa powder and -butter). After that, I worked as a Logistics coordinator and technical purchaser at Driessen Aircraft Interior Systems.\n\nAfter two years of work here, my interest for the insurance business was raised, and I successfully applied for the position of Technical Loss Adjuster in 1991. From that time on, I specialized in technical and general liability and CAR insurances. This has been my field of work for over 30 years now.",
