    "summary": "I consider myself a very fortunate person as I had the opportunity to try myself out in various roles and positions before building a career in a field that I am the best at.  Before I started teaching as a profession - and before realizing that this is my true passion - I had worked as a temp in different positions at one of the most prestigious multinational companies of the time in Hungary while doing my university studies. I am extremely grateful for these years as I gained a tremendous amount of experience in very diverse fields such as HR (training and recruitment), payroll, secretarial jobs, customer care, and even warehouse work. It armed me with adaptability, flexibility, and a skill set that is applicable in any job. However, after having graduated I decided to leave corporate culture and start teaching English as a foreign language.\n\nAs a teacher, I have always been proactive and innovative inside and outside the classroom to see how either the learning process or the learning environment can be developed and to make learning more effective and more fun. I never do routine classes and engage my students in the work so that they can reach the clearly defined goals we set together.\n\nAs I have encountered hundreds and hundreds of different students during the course of my work, all with different needs, I had to become some sort of a jack of all trades (and hopefully a master of some).  I helped many trainers and training companies translate, compile, and present training sessions and have acquired a great deal of knowledge in the field in the meantime. I believe that having taught outside the traditional school setting has a beneficial effect on my school classes as well because I am constantly aware of what language knowledge the market requires. At the same time, I also enjoy taking a scholarly approach to language learning and deal with English literature, linguistics or history.\n\nAround 15 years ago I shifted my focus to special needs teaching and tried to see where the opportunities lie in using special needs methodologies in language teaching. In 2012 I decided to establish a language center with my best friend, where we focused on learners who cannot excel in the traditional group or classroom setting. Although this enterprise proved to be the most rewarding and most successful thing I had ever done, I had to give it up when we decided to start a new life in The Hague in August 2019. \n\nNow it seems I will have to start building everything up from scratch, but who doesn't like some good old-fashioned challenge?",
