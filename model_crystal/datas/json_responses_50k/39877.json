Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, a cutting-edge academic facility, covers a wide range of specialities in many areas. The construction of a new hospital is ongoing but could take seven to ten years to complete.\nDuring the ongoing build, there arose an urgent need for increased operating theatre (OT) capacity as the existing operating theatres did not meet the current safety requirements, especially for high-risk orthopaedic procedures. The hospital management set out a tender procedure to seek a mid-term solution during construction of the new hospital. The hospital needed a solution that could be operational within a very short period of time but be robust enough in the medium to long term to fill the gap for a period up to 10 years.\n\nYoung Medical, a Q-bital company, specialised in the modular construction of complex healthcare facilities, won the tender and gladly took up the challenge. Working closely with the hospital building team, Young Medical realised the construction of the interim facility within 10 months of signing of the contract. The complex, with a footprint of 324m2, providing two additional operating theatres and a preparation room, has been built to meet the strictest requirements for high-risk orthopaedic procedures.\n\n",
