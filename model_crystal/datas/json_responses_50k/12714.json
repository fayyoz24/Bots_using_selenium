    "summary": "I am a 21 years old, Romanian student of Creative Bussines at Breda University of Applied Sciences. In this study programme, we focus on different areas of media and how to manage them as well as the finance part of media. I am passionate about different social media channels and not only, sometimes I do work on digital art or on the creation of logos by combining Photoshop and Illustrator. I have already worked on different small projects ( book for kids, short movie production, currently developing a VR experience) but I plan on dedicating my free time to bigger projects. I know how to work in Adobe programs such as Adobe Premiere, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Acrobat, and Adobe Lightroom. I can learn easily new software and I am flexible. Recently, I have started developing my skills also in Unreal Engine, but for the moment I am at the beginner level. Other people and I consider myself as a very creative person. I have a storm of ideas in my head all the time. This doesn't mean that all of the ideas are good but usually because I am very comfortable with sharing my ideas in a team, the rest of the teammates get more comfortable with sharing their ideas too. This can lead to such nice concepts and ideas and I just love that. I am a chatty person, but I also like to listen to the people around me. From when I knew myself I've always liked the \"NEW\" and never been afraid of it! As an example this year I threw myself in a VR project without knowing too much, but this didn't stop me. This made me want to learn and self-study more and start work in programmes such as Unreal Engine in which usually only students or specialists in the games industry are working on. There is nothing I can't do if I like what I'm doing, and Media is so various, full of surprises and new trends, exactly how I see my life! If we have any common interests connect with me and let's chat I would love that! :)",
