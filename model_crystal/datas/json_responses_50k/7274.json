            "description": "This research addresses the question of how Qaddafi Libya\u2019s alternating foreign policy towards the US can be explained through analyzing intentional, dispositional and structural forces affecting its policymaking process. Carlsnaes\u2019 Foreign Policy Analysis synthesis \u2013 added by the liberal approach of Moravcsik; the neorealist systemic theory of Mearsheimer; and a cognitive-psychological model as propounded by O\u2019Reilly \u2013 provides a crucial insight into the matter. Qaddafi\u2019s initial goals to curb US influence within the Arab world and enhance domestic and regional legitimacy for his leadership increasingly interfered with Washington\u2019s interests in the region; namely, a steady supply of energy resources, security of its Israeli ally, and countering potential communist encroachment. While Mearsheimer\u2019s approach satisfactorily explains Tripoli\u2019s collaboration with the Kremlin and its pursuance of WMD, Moravcsik\u2019s theory clarifies Qaddafi\u2019s confrontation with the US more comprehensively. Ideological revisionist notions stemming from Nasserist Arab nationalism \u2013 most notably anti-imperialism and pan-Arabism \u2013 mainly fueled Libya\u2019s belligerent conduct towards the US. While both regime survival and revisionist idealism informed Qaddafi\u2019s policies during the first two decades of his tenure, the former increasingly determined his foreign policy agenda during the post-Lockerbie era. In Moravcsik\u2019s terms, Libya\u2019s leadership was confronted with three internal threats: diverging fundamental beliefs, disaffection due to political exclusion, and material scarcity. The third societal constraint on Libyan foreign policymaking proved the most acute and can therefore be conceived of as decisive in effectuating foreign policy change. Pragmatic opportunism informed by a desire to secure regime survival prompted the Qaddafi leadership to seek reconciliation with the US, reverse its position of international isolation, and subsequently accommodate the economic needs of its people.",
