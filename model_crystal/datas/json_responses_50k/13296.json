    "summary": "Things might have got a bit out of control. \n\nSure, I've sold everything from banks, airlines and sports cars to magazines, lightbulbs and sanitary pads. But I advocated kidnapping as a medium, depicted graphic vengeance by a dog, promoted the benefits of selfishness, helped people to see music with the aid of alcohol, was accused of promoting promiscuity and (in an unrelated incident) helped South East Asians to talk openly about their genitals. I got super-competitive Singaporeans to celebrate quitters, inspired a panda to twerk, showed commuters an alternative reality, proved that Milli Vanilli CAN sing and helped to instigate 'bikini' as a verb.\n\nI know its no excuse, but I was media-neutered at an early age. I just aim for surprisingly elegant solutions and playful execution.\n\nThe good folks at D&AD, Cannes, One Show, Spikes, AdFest, Effies, and the IPA seem to have fallen for it. My Nan remains sceptical.\n\nWhat do I want? More of the same crazy, please.",
