    "summary": "In my life so far, I have always\nenjoyed getting involved in\nprojects with data analysis so that\nI could draw reasonable\nconclusions. As a physician, I\ndecided that my future goal is to\nunderstand patterns and\ncorrelations and create scientific\nmodels that explain them so that\nI can draw important conclusions\nand provide support in the\nprocess of solving problems. I did\nan internship on image analysis of\nnanostructures. As coordinator of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic analysis\ndepartment , I had to manage an\nenormous pool of information\nwith great respect for privacy and\nmedical confidentiality. All these\nconcluded that my view of the\nimportance of analyzing the\nvarious data in modern society is\nright. The development of society\nthrough scientific analysis of data\nis my motivation and the dream\nthat I want to pursue",

My responsibilities include collecting and processing data using Python, performing data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating data visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.\n\nI have experience using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze data and create visualizations. In addition, I have experience with data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, as well as basic machine learning techniques such as regression and clustering.\n\nMy role also involves collaborating with other departments to identify opportunities to use data to improve business processes and support decision-making. I am currently working on a project to collect bid proposal guidelines and use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract important features and train a predictive model to identify new events that align with the MECC profile.\n\nOverall, my internship at MECC has provided me with valuable experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, as well as exposure to the exhibition and conference industry. I am eager to continue learning and contributing to the team's success.",
