She creates fusions of contemporary music, theatre and performance art. The key of her work is not only to express herself through art but to make work that resonates with nowadays society and creates space for the audience to discover their personal reasons to be. This approach culminates in her current work on the New Opera Project. By bringing the opera into a new multiple and dimensional language, narrative structures and media.",
