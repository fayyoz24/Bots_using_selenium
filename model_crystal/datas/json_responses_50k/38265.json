    "summary": "My name is Eric Brekelmans. I'm a Dutch National, living in both Accra, Ghana and the Netherlands.\n\nThe technical knowledge which I secured by attaining certifications, combined with business consultancy / account management / Sales and IT projects experience make me a broad and versatile professional today.\nI discovered that managing a complex project not only from a technical point of view but to also make sure that a project \"lands\" properly within the organization is something which gives me a great deal of satisfaction. Doing this together with local- and experienced team members is a great experience, especially in foreign countries, which I discovered when I worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWith my technical background and no-nonsense mentality I produce measurable results and will act as a natural liaison between technology on one hand and contact for management on the other hand very quickly.\n\nNaturally I have a positive mental attitude, am socially active and engaged, conscientious, passionate and ambitious. I can work independently or as part of a team. I have excellent analytical capabilities, am a creative problem solver and turn problems into customer satisfaction. \nFurthermore I have excellent communication and presentation skills but foremost I am a result driven and motivated person.",
