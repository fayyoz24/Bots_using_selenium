While one powerbank is charged, the other one is used to supply energy to the system. \n\nPlease bear in mind that I am currently testing quick prototypes that may compromise the bike reliability in some cases (aka 'learn by doing'). No stress, compression, bending or torsion analysis have been carried out yet on the power generation stage, so use all this project content at your own risk. ",

Topics covered during the academic term involved Electronics, Magnetism, Calculus, CAD design and FEA analysis with SolidWorks, motion simulation analysis with SIEMENS NX, dynamics modelling and control with Matlab & Simulink and control theories applied to different with the QUANSER CUBE.\n\nRegarding the practical side, it was also possible for me to teach Motorsport and Automotive students. The main subject covered was the data acquisition and analysis through the CAN bus communication system of a vehicle. \n\nFirst, basic concepts about ABS, ASR, EDS and ESP were explained using the THEPRA pro line bench. Second, the students tried to retrieve data from a Renault M\u00e9gane and a Lotus Exige from their respective ODB and also directly from sensors. To perform these tasks Arduino and also a professional device (PicoScope) were utilised.\n\n2017 - 2018\n\nMy role as a GTA is to teach Graduate and MSc students. Modules covered during this academic year were Electronics applied to Aeronautical Engineering with LJ Create Tools, Materials Engineering, Technical Drawing and CAD with Solidworks, Motion Analysis with Siemens NX, Control Systems with Embedded Implementation using Freescale, LabView and MyRIO from NI Labs for the coursework and Matlab and Simulink for State Space Design, Control Theory and a little bit of Artificial Intelligence .\n\n2018 - 2019\n\nLast year! This year I have also decided to teach Fluid Mechanics! New automotive rigs have been carefully studied and now they are fundamental for the Automotive students. There are two Ford rigs with basic sensors and actuators (petrol and diesel) and a Volkswagen CAN rig. My aim is to show students how different communications systems work on a car and why they are used and how to retrieve, process and filter signals from different sensor in a car.",

However, my colleague Eddy and me managed to almost finish it completely by designing an in-house air-box, trumpets, linear screw mechanism and its respective controller.

This involves the design of every lesson/concept in a very creative and attractive way. I have to say that it is a challenge. Every single student is completely different and shows you different points of view when dealing with a problem.\n\nAll in all, I am trying to teach what I had to learn by myself during my childhood. It is amazing to observe their expressions when you demonstrate that they can design almost everything using LEDs, potentiometers, push-buttons, photo-resistors, etc.\n\n2018 - 2019\nI had the chance to design another course for the upcoming year. This course will be divided into three terms: Introduction to Mechatronics with Arduino, Autonomous Ground Vehicle and Robotic Arm. If you want to know more about it, please check Richer's Education webpage and I hope you like/enjoy it!",
