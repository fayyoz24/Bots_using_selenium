For this, we apply a systems approach and work together with relevant stakeholders from the neighbourhood through co-creation. \n\nAs part of my PhD I am: \n- studying the food environment by combining objective GIS methods and subjective lived experience methods \n- studying what factors facilitate or hinder the creation of healthy and sustainable food environments in high-traffic public spaces when local governments collaborate with other stakeholders \n- studying how neighbourhood food environments can become healthier and more sustainable through systemic changes, which are co-created with- and implemented by residents, the municipality, entrepreneurs, experts.  \n\nI am doing this PhD at the Consumption and Healthy Lifestyles Group of Wageningen University. The research is part of the larger Regio Deal Foodvalley programme.",
