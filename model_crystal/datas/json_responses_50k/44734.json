    "summary": "Deanna received her BBA in international business and marketing with a minor in Spanish from the George Washington University School of Business. During her studies she especially enjoyed her study abroad in Madrid where she had the chance to enhance her Spanish while also learning about Spanish culture in her Spanish film, literature, and Flamenco classes.\n\nDeanna is currently working in a European product management role at Medline in Arnhem, the Netherlands, with a focus on the face masks and surgical gowns portfolios for the European hospital market. Her product categories were key during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adaptability and a fast time-to-market in her portfolio management.\n\nIn her free time Deanna enjoys playing violin, hiking, and finding restaurants in new cities. When home with family, she enjoys sailing and cooking favorite recipes.",
