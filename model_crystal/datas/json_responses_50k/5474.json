    "summary": "As an administrative professional with over ten years\u2019 experience, I know my diverse skills and qualifications which have contributed enormously to achieve my goals.\n\nI\u2019ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries, mostly in small companies where I was not just the admin but also in charge of languages tutoring and translation. I also lived in Australia where I had the opportunity to work as a sales representative for one of the biggest Brazilian groups called VOTORANTIM. I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same. In addition to being flexible and responsive, I\u2019m also a fanatic for details. \n\nLast but certainly not least, I want you to know that I\u2019m passionate about foreign languages and cultures. I\u2019ve been studying languages since I was 8 years old, therefore being able to work with management skills and languages is something that I have always aimed to achieve.\n\n\n\n",
