The EIFFEL pilots cover the following topics: (1) water and land use management, (2) sustainable agriculture, (3) transport management, (4) sustainable urban development, and (5) disaster resilience.",

The assessment was comissioned by Stadsregio Parkstad Limburg and the project was part of my Master's studies at Maastricht University. I worked on this project together with four fellow students for a period of around two months. \n\nAs a research team, we applied multiple analytical techniques and engaged with stakeholders using various participatory methods. The project allowed me to apply the knowledge and experience that I had attained throughout my studies in a practical manner, and therefore provided a valuable learning experience. Due to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19, teamwork and interaction with the client and stakeholders were done in an online environment. This created an additional challenge, but also an extra learning experience, as it forced us to be both flexible and creative.",

            "description": "As a volunteer at the Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in South Africa, I helped out with general day-to-day activities surrounding the care of wildlife at the centre. These activities ranged from preparing meals and feeding of an orphaned animal, to the cleaning of enclosures. The aim of the rehabilitation centre is to take care of wildlife that is injured, orphaned, or in need of other help. If possible, animals are rehabilitated and returned to the wild.\n\nWorking at the rehabilitation centre was a fulfilling and educational experience. It has provided a foundation for my interest and passion for environmental and sustainability issues."
