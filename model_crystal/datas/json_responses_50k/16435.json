    "summary": "I am an explorer and changemaker that orchestrates from understanding the past to envision the future\".  I help organizations with their transformation on the intersection of (digital ) Innovation concepts and organizational impact. I have an entrepreneurial mindset capable of analyzing large complex situations and themes and translate these into small tangible steps. I use my technology communication & collaboration background and many years of experience on human (digital) engagement and change management to support and reinforce this process. In addition, with digital growing exponentially I'm always very keen on balancing artificial (algorithmic) and human (creative & emphatic)  intelligence in order to contribute to a (digital ) environment that does not forget to place people at the center of the process.

Through dialogue and storytelling, children are seeing that there is much to learn from the life experiences of the elderly in their own village or town. In essence, the project is initiated to create a more meaningful engagement between these two groups.  To prepare the children for their conversation the program is designed to also address fundamentals for children in the age between 10 and 12 years old on what it takes to create meaningful connections and relations in the real world. The curriculum co-designed by an education specialist and teacher prepares children around the theme of ' good citizenship' . By understanding one's own needs and behavior first the children experience that this is an essential stepping stone in order to do good for others and after that their environment. The end product - the stories - are then given back to the community in a creative, artistic way, highlighted in a festive gathering for the whole community.",
