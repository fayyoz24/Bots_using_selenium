    "summary": "MSc in Architectural Engineering & Building Sciences, BSc in Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences\nI studied architecture because of being mesmerized about the way that the built environment shapes and enhances our society and lives. While studying architecture I developed my own vision of integrating spatial, functional and innovative technical design in one product. However, after working for some years in different architecture offices, I developed a passion for interiors and hospitality design and decided to start my own company, WeDesign Lab, in order to able to fully express my personal vision on the built environment.\n\nWeDesign Lab is operating in the fields of architecture, interior design, project and construction management. Our current projects are located all over Europe with main focus in Italy, Greece and Romania. We specialise in hospitality design, including interior & exterior design, concept creation, upscale renovations, energy performance consulting as well as building typology researches.\nOur high-end projects include both new building construction and renovations of interiors of all sizes, small to large. We are committed to delivering inspired designs that fulfil client expectations through collaboration and exceptional service.",

To achieve this balance, soft, earthy colour tones were utilised throughout the spaces, while furniture and decorative elements with natural materials and signature morphology were incorporated, as well as special textures with patterned fabrics, evoking a bohemian atmosphere. At the same time, new private swimming pools were designed, highlight lighting elements with a special functional and aesthetic character were utilized, while the plantings were redesigned, with native Mediterranean plants and the flooring of the surrounding area with cast materials and gravel, to ensure a new , integrated experience of luxurious escape and relaxation.",

It is a large beach front complex consisting of 311 guest rooms & bungalows and bars, as well as conference facilities with a 550 people capacity. The hotel complex combines the facilities of an all-year resort destination and conference tourism. The main design challenge was to integrate elements of contemporary luxury and traditional Cretan motifs in the interiors, while maintaining the effortless atmosphere of a seaside resort.\n\nThe aim of the architectural project was the functional, morphological and general building renovation of the hotel based on its functional needs.  200 rooms were renovated and 100 new private pools were built.\n\nThe design interprets the landscape into forms, into unique spaces, while following the quiet sounds of sea and wind that are manifested in the choice of materials, lighting and colouring.\nThe concept of the outdoor spaces is to create the absolute resort destination by maximising the connection of each space with the views. A series of private pools surround the buildings and resemble the feeling of the sea. The design is inspired by the underlying forms of the ground and effectively makes use of the different height levels. The outdoor spaces with the pools create the feeling of awe as you feel like swimming in the skies and unify this experience with the unique design form. The spaces around the pool follow minimalistic lines enabling the guests to completely relax.\n\nThe overall concept of the design is to create a bohemian chic resort hotel. The bohemian design culture reflects the spirit of the traditions and characteristics of the location while the \u201cchic\u201d refers to the luxurious spaces, the choices of the materials and the creation of experiences.",

The projection of a new aesthetic, perceived through the openings, will be clearly reflected in the profile of its new visitors.\n\nWe wanted to create a hotel that is by itself a tourist attraction. The building itself and its interior become a destination, either because of its facilities or, and mainly we refer to it, due to the peculiarity of its design.\n\nFor this to happen we needed a strong central idea, something that has to do with both the operation and the design and was done in collaboration with the hotelier and the brand that has been chosen. The design, even when it concerns only the interior, can not be done with \"decorative\" criteria but be based on the genius loci of the area and the building.\n\nThe goal in Grand Hotel Savoia is to result in spaces that create a post-image, after image, capable of creating the desire of the visitor to return, again and again seeking the feeling of familiarity that every successful hotel unit must provide.\n\nThe design\nThe design aimed to create a strong and new identity. Serene mountain beauty, idyllic snow-covered slopes and the distinctive culture of the area have deeply influenced the formation of the interior design concept. A comfortable, stylish and cozy retreat after a long day of skiing or walking is created by blending rustic style with an elegant and luxurious touch. Fluffy and playful items complete the interior look creating a positively modern chalet dream and activate the feeling of surprise and awe.",

The need for zero-energy buildings in the future would not only be more relevant than today, it will be obligatory for all buildings in use. Professionals in the building sector, including architects, managers, building engineers and academia, have to respond in the need to change the ways of construction, designing, choosing certain materials in order to contribute in a more sustainable society. It is crucial that the designers of today and all professionals of the building sector thrive to create sustainable architecture. Change the way we see architecture and the goals that the building environment has to fulfill. The more examples of realized energy efficient or even zero-energy buildings the faster the knowledge will grow. ",

However, healing architecture is a notion which developed the last couple of decades. Empirical research evidence showed that aspects that architects can control have an influence in the quality of patient experience and health outcomes. This thesis aims to elaborate on these aspects and create an overview of significant knowledge. This knowledge is projected in health care facilities influenced by great architectural movements. The interaction between the buildings, architectural movement and healing aspects is explored.\n\nKey words: Healthcare architecture, healing space, healing environment, theory, architectural movements\n\nFor additional information on this project or consult requests regarding the creation of healing environments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
