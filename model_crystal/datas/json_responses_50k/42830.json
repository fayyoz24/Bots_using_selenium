I have developed a strong set of skills and competencies in financial administration, project monitoring, office administration, and communication and collaboration, as well as a deep understanding of the cultural, political, and social aspects of the Latin American region.\n\nRecently I have worked as Administrative Assistant at WASTE NL, a Dutch NGO that focuses on sustainable waste management and sanitation solutions.
