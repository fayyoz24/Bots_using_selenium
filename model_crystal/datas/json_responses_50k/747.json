    "summary": "Born in the Netherlands, I have lived in Ghana, Nepal, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Italy and California, and have been fortunate to travel in more than 30 countries. My talented parents are Dutch and American.\n\nIn 2011, becoming a successful marketing strategist was not on my radar. \n\nEverything changed.\n\nI read Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition, by Jack Trout, and found my passion. Answering people\u2019s needs with a brands added value that no competitor can duplicate. I started to think about how each business has found their Unique Selling Proposition.\n\nI set up a plan for my future.\n\nIn order to gain as much experience as possible, I wanted to develop practical experience in both B2B marketing and B2C marketing.\n\nI sought for a graduate position in marketing or operations within: Consumer Behavior, Data Analytics, Content Marketing, or User Experience. Afterwards, results showed my effective effort in: Market Research, Data Visualization, Brand Awareness and Lead Conversion.\n\nWith an opportunity at my feet, I decided to jump into entrepreneurship.\n\nWe are striving to provide everyone with the best protection for their lungs.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy travelling, sports, games, reading & writing, and cooking. Further curiosity has led to discovering the powers of social media, writing, software programs, teaching, IT, finance, investing, and accounting. Recently I have developed skills in web development, SEO, marketing, social media, consumer behavior, advertising, branding, sales, SaaS, and operations. \n\nA brand can only be profitable if it offers unique added value to a customer. I aim to create the best possible user experience and enforce a Unique Selling Proposition that people need, and I support.\n\n\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works\u201d \u2013 Steve Jobs",

This one-of-a-kind, high quality, long lasting, LED Disc and Boomerang + Smart Golf Discs project is so worth it! Robofi has partnered with Tosy Robotics, a successful toy designer and producer. \nThe Kickstarter campaign went live on August 26th. The products have been tested for more than 1000 hours, and design alterations have been made to pass all Standards. I worked on all of the communication copy, sales, newsletters, advertisements, marketing, branding, the FAQ, and emails etc. With a Testers Program we were able to collect a lot of feedback to continue improving the design. The project was successfully funded with just under 420k. \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tosyflyingduo/tosy-flying-duo-360-leds-flying-disc-and-patented-boomerang/",
