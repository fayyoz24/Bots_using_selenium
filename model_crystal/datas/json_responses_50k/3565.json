    "summary": "Driven to support people and their development, so they consistently can reach the goals\n\nI have been leading and involved in teams with a focus on our employees: their engagement, self-development, motivation and teamwork. For example, involved in the creation of the Motivation Conversation Framework for the Team Leads that has been rolled out in our track, involved in revamping a mentoring programme for around 200 employees and doing individual coaching and mentoring sessions.\n\nI have been a driver and a leader, as well as an integral part of various international teams in bringing out the best version of our employees locally, regionally and globally. \nFor example, driving a team on revamping our region's engagement group with more than a 100% increase in engagement as per the group's metrics. Lastly, a part of a team managing the company's learning group of 5000+ people, where I am supporting the creation of a passionate learner community!\n\nIndividually I support others globally on workshop facilitation, soft skills, learning and project management.\n\nWould love to connect with you!",
