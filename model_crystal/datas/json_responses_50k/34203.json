As such, I have gained a lot of experience in lead generation campaigns. When available, I optimised the campaign based on the ROI derived from the realised donation amount (either online or via telemarketing). Other examples of campaigns are conversion campaigns optimised for webshop sales, brand awareness campaigns and full funnel campaigns.\n\nChannels included Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Search (including Google Grants), Google Display, and Bing.

Furthermore, for each cubicle of gas that is emitted through Vandebron, the amount of CO2 is compensated by means of Gold Standard's CO2-compensation programmes taking place throughout the world.\n\nJob activities:\nTogether with one or two colleagues, I worked at biological food markets, supermarkets and other locations to promote Vandebron's services and sign subscription contracts.
