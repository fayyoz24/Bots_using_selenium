    "summary": "I consult the Food & Feed sector on achieving business competitiveness and future-proofing their business model, through measuring and reducing their environmental footprint. This is my way of serving society, the environment and humanity.\n\nMy clients are international and multinational companies, as well as European sector associations, active in the supply chain of a wide range of products. Major industries I worked for are these of feed, food, brewery, animal proteins, rendering, horticulture and novel ingredients.\n\nPerforming environmental assessments, including carbon footprint, and consulting the industry sums up 80% of my job. I daily analyze primary and secondary data including energy and mass balances and processes\u2019 efficiency, in order to establish consistency of data. Simapro software and other specialist technical data analysis tools developed by our technical and IT team are my trusted partners at the stage where I develop LCA models. Besides models\u2019 development, impact interpretation as well as effective and transparent reporting are part of my consulting services. In addition to that, I have been taking a very active role in R&D by feeding back to my colleagues with regards to the development and improvement of databases and tools we build internally: a task that gives me great joy.\n\nNevertheless, it is not all data and numbers only: part of my job is the efficient communication with our clients only when and if necessary. These critical interventions are made to ensure the quality of data, leading in turn to high quality results.\n\nI have an educational background in Industrial Engineering and Industrial Ecology. During my studies I focused on sustainability and the environmental impact of the industrial sector and contemporary lifestyle. My interest lies on sustainable agricultural systems and bio-refineries, the bio-based economy, novel foods, sustainable lifestyles and behaviors, and how life-cycle oriented methods and environmental policy tools can stimulate sustainable development.",
