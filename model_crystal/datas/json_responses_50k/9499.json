    "summary": "I have a strong academical background in Peace and Conflict studies (M.A.) and International Business (B.Sc.). Recently, I started my transition into lecturing after gaining valuable experience as an expert lecturer and senior academic operations coordinator at NHL Stenden. During my time in this role, I developed and delivered engaging lectures on topics such as intercultural competencies and ethical and social responsibility. In addition, I coordinated and hosted projects involving international partner universities. \n\nPrior to starting at NHL Stenden, I worked as a project advisor at the Kikori District Hospital, Papua New Guinea. Focusing on gender based violence projects, my work aimed to support the education and empowerment of both women and men. During my time in Kikori, I successfully helped the local women\u2019s group to develop, fund, and coordinate the first literacy class for disadvantaged women in the entire region. Furthermore, I conducted co-constructed research on sexual and gender-based violence to collect preliminary data in this under-researched area. Additionally, I designed and taught sexual and gender based violence awareness courses for nursing students at the hospital. Working in this demanding environment has taught me to work independently, given me the chance to develop long lasting relationships with international partners and stake holders, and strengthened my ethnographic sensibility. \n\nThroughout my career, I have had the honour to work with talented colleagues in divers fields in four different countries, allowing me to adapt quickly to new situations, view points, and cultures. \n\nI am an enthusiastic, analytical, and communicative person who thrives on new challenges.",
