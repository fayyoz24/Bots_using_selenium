Goal of the Inbound Logistics II Project is to improve the efficiency of the inbound and return processes.  To this end a SAP WMS solution with Handling Unit Management has been implemented to facilitate Client specific warehouse processes (Receipt, Put-Away, Picking, Cleaning, etc.) on a handheld RF scanner. \n\nThe solution implemented previously in Veldhoven will be rolled-out to the Wilton plant. Some modifications to the solution are necessary to cover gaps between the way processes are executed in Veldhoven versus Wilton. Additional challenge is that the project is partly executed on site in Wilton (United States).\n\nWalter his responsibilities were:\n\u2022   Execute unit and integration test\n\u2022   Support user acceptance test\n\u2022   Create training plan / materials\n\u2022   Prepare training system for training\n\u2022   Conversion activities executed on site in Wilton\n\u2022   Aftercare support executed on site in Wilton \n\u2022   Implementing complex RFC\u2019s",
