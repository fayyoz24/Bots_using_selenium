    "summary": "I'm a dedicated researcher with a decade of experience in the field of psychological stress and trauma. My specialisation is in occupational stress and trauma, and I have worked on research projects involving veterans, police officers, and humanitarian workers. My primary goal is to conduct research that has practical implications for the wellbeing of workers in highly stressful jobs. I'm particularly proud of my work on the specific stressors that humanitarian field workers face, including sexual harassment. Outside of my current work, my main professional interests lie in developing and testing new psychological interventions, improving refugee mental health, supporting the mental health of staff working in crisis areas, and teaching.\n\nAs a team player, I bring a dedicated and collaborative approach to my work. I strive for excellence in all that I do, and I'm always looking for ways to make meaningful contributions to my field. Ultimately, my goal is to help create systems and changes that support and protect the wellbeing of workers, and I'm excited to continue making a positive impact through my research. Beyond that, my greatest wish is to one day find myself in a position where I can teach and mentor students.",

Further, I attended research meetings to develop my understanding of the project, and was made the lead RA and asked to train all the new research assistants.\n\nBesides my work as a lead RA, I also volunteered at the VA's military sexual trauma clinic. My duties included assisting patients in filling in their intake forms and answering any questions they may have. In addition, I supported the set-up of the clinic's Clothesline project and ran preliminary statistical analyses on the clinic's data for the purposes of building a military sexual trauma databank.",

In Scotland, I was an integral member of the Glasgow University Red Cross Group, serving over 3 years first as a regular member and later as a first aid assistant coordinator, and the president of the group. The club organised volunteering activities in three main areas: first aid, fundraising and humanitarian education. We kept our first aid knowledge and skills up-to-date as well as trained new volunteers, we raised funds for the British Red Cross through organising a variety of events at the university, and we provided humanitarian education both in- and outside the university context."
