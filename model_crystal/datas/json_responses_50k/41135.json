    "summary": "My name is Attila Nagy a young, determined Tone Master, was born and raised in Budapest. I started to study as a tone master in 2017 at the Oktopus Multimedia Institute.\n After the first semester, I began to work on an independent film production where i realized how beautiful feeling is to be a part of hardworking community. On this shooting i made my first connections which leaded me to the next independent short film what won two awards (3rd and 1st) on film festivals. \nI focused on my career which means i just wanted to work wherever i can.\nI consider myself a friendly cooperative person, and this is why i was able to make useable connections with other young filmmakers (cameraman, director, lighting technician etc.), and they needed somebody who is working with Sound for Visualmedia ( pre-production and post-production).\nI had to realised the situation and the opportunity what i got, and i wanted to do well. I had to admit to myself that, alone i am not enough for an acceptable level. That was the point where i started lead my team and quickly became a sound leader for these independent film shootings. I enjoyed all the time when i had to organize the sound part for many different kind of scenes. To talk with the heads of other departments was comfortable for me, and i think it was one of the most important part of my job, because i had to be responsible for my team, my job, but our main goal was always the production and we needed to work on it together.\nOne of my biggest milestone was when i somebody asked me to work on the commercial film of McDonald's Germany, which represented a really professional, international, work environments which was an amazing experience as well.\nSince 2017 til today i was working in Hungary on films, commercial videos, promotion videos, and concert evenings as well. i did not get payment for these projects, or just rarely, but my goal was to get as much experience as i can, and work with people to create something great. \n\nReferences: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Rk6Zt1qAA \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCjpElKxx_8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr0qCpV8dCI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztM5K2tMz2g\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XDIPp9DnAk\n\nBlogs: https://attilanagy97.blogspot.com\n\n",
