I'm passionate about journalism, politics and policy, international affairs, sports and literature. \n\nAfter graduating cum laude in 'Modern History and International Relations' (with a specialization in Russian and Ukrainian history) from the University of Groningen in 2012, I started at Crowdynews as Director Business Development. My responsibilities there have grown gradually, and included project management and executive management. In Spring  2019 I've joined Interim Corporate Finance as an advisor and analyst, responsible for project management and the drafting of information memoranda. ",
