    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my LinkedIn profile.  My partner, Braam Hoffmann and I started our new adventure in The Netherlands on the 1st January 2019.\n\nI had just completed an exciting project in the Correctional Services in South Africa.  Together with the community - a bio-ethicist, prosecutor and academic philosophers - a group of incarcerated people have been trying to make sense of re-igniting Ubuntu in their society:  Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu / I am because we are / A person is a person through others.     \n\nMy 25 years of practice in South Africa and the UK, taught me that Ubuntu informs the essence of what I do, especially working with individuals and families who are living with neurological and psychiatric symptoms or people who have been convicted.  \n\nThe interconnectedness of life fascinates me: from the neurons in the brain to our social world.  I am excited to assist positive change in people's lives utilizing this interplay: whether it is micro-changes having macro effects or vice versa. Because we are inter-dependent, what happens to an individual affects everyone who forms part of their world.  I believe that feeling integrated, having an individual purpose and experiencing a sense of community and belonging is important to our well-being and crucial to our development.   \n\nMy work has mostly been as part of multi-disciplinary teams as a co-traveller in people's journeys of adjustment and recovery.  \n\nBeing new to The Netherlands, I am open to changes and looking for opportunities. I have been improving my Dutch language competency by volunteering at a mental health day centre, doing specialized courses and working as a group assistant on an elderly rehabilitation ward - Afrikaans and English are my home languages.   My broad provides me a lot of flexibility.  \n\nThanks to PsyNed - Psychologist Eindhoven - Mindfull sollutions is the platform from which I provide my services as a Psycholoog NIP to the expat community.\n  \nKeywords - Clinical Psychology / Cognitive Deficits / Cognitive Rehabilitation / Cognitive Remediation / Cognitive Strategies / Brain Working Recursive Therapy/ Trauma Counselling / Cognitive Remediation Therapy / Community Psychology / Lecturing / Multi-disciplinary Teams / Neuropsychology / Research / Risk Assessment / Risk Management / Supervision /  Training / Vulnerability",

It is now also being used for other psychological difficulties such as depression and addiction. It integrates the knowledge from neuropsychological processing and psychotherapy in a way which is can be easily understood by service users.  The intervention can be applied in a short term and provides clear results for clients.  I have started specialising in this mode of therapy because of its relative quick and effective results, that it relies less on language than traditional therapies and translates so well online.  During corona time it seemed suitable to also add BWRT Neuroenhancement Practitioner\u00ae for those people who needed to get the most out of their physical exercises.",

The study attempted to integrate evidence-based principles from neuorpsychology, community psychology and criminology, in a holistic, continuous and multi-disciplinary project.\nA Concurrent Transformative approach was used. This involved participatory action research (PAR), not only as a research method, but as key element of the model and as the intervention to be studied. \nCell monitors were invited to participate in an action research project which included exemplary representatives from the community. The project spanned a year and a half. This included a five-month period of intense practising of executive functions and Ubuntu ethics education and eight months of weekly meetings focusing on the PAR process. \nA variety of qualitative methods and quantitative pre and post measurements were applied to explore the impact of the intervention.\nSignificant changes were found in participants\u2019 reported abilities to relax and their executive performance. These findings can be attributed to the intervention combining mindfulness and ethics education with real-life opportunities for executive functioning practice. This is in line with Triune Ethics Theory, which postulates that ethical selves and communities emerge not from top-down moral education but from real-life experiences that shape brain systems.\nThe qualitative findings unpack: \u2018products\u2019 that emerged from the real-life project, PAR development in 8 processes, 5 levels of transformative community development, the application of an ethical reasoning model, ethics as a spontaneous outcome and the themes that mattered to participants.\nFrom these findings a rehabilitation model was developed that draws on the experiences and insights of incarcerated participants.\nThe thesis concludes that sustainable change is possible if society is included with the incarcerated for  a reciprocal rehabilitation to occur.",
