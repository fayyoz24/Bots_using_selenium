    "summary": "Currently, I am finishing up my PhD project in health psychology at the University of Groningen. My research focuses on the psychological well-being of patients with obesity throughout their weight loss treatment. To understand health and illness, a complete image of humans including physiological, social and psychological knowledge is required. Therefore, in my PhD project, I am investigating various factors from these fields to gain a deeper understanding of obesity, weight loss and well-being among bariatric surgery patients.\n\nI am a persistent, initiative and conscientious researcher with great communication skills and devotion to my work and goals. I am experienced in developing and managing large research projects, meeting deadlines, and presenting our findings to large audiences. I enjoy translating numbers into stories and sharing knowledge with others by giving lectures, workshops or writing articles. \n\nI am committed to contributing relevant research in the fields of health and behaviour and supporting patients and healthcare by bridging the gap between science and practice.",
