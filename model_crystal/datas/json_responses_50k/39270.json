    "summary": "Liebe Kollegen, liebe KollegInnen! \nDear Colleagues\nI studied European Languages and Business from 1987-1991 (BA Hons) before returning to Germany to work for an American company in Frankfurt am Main. As part of my primary degree, I spent my third year in Germany from 1989-1990 where I experienced the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism across Eastern Europe whilst working in a bank in Solingen (Nordrhein-Westphalen).\nHaving returned to Belfast in 1993, I completed a PGCE at QUB and am both a qualified teacher of Modern Languages as well as TEFL trained. I have also worked as a Teacher of English for the Bildungsministerium (Ministry of Education) in the State of Brandenburg. \nI graduated with an MSSc (European Integration-based on the economic, political and social aspects of the EU) from QUB in 1997 and completed a DASE (Diploma in the Advanced Study of Education) in 2001 covering six modules including Special Educational Needs (two modules), Counselling Skills, Early Years, Language Learning and Comparative Global Education. \nI am a fluent German speaker, competent In French with a knowledge of Italian and have been employed at the British Council Northern Ireland since June 2000 as a Programme Manager (APM Qualified) for UK, EU and Global Projects delivered through a Project Management Framework\nI have a track record of delivering quality projects primarily on Education and Skills; and have established excellent working relations with Embassies and the European Commission.\nIn my current post, I manage a language based Global  portfolio with particular responsibility for Northern Ireland and French speaking countries (Belgium, France,  and Qu\u00e9bec) and Italy across the UK. \nI am a champion for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) within the organisation.  I am a member of the Cultural Engagement EDI Steering Group which was established to advise Senior Management on all aspects of EDI within the organisation and to embed EDI throughout the project cycle/customer journey in the UK and with our 15 global partners.\nI have also been trained to roll out Unconscious Bias training to staff in the UK in support of the organisation\u2019s Anti-Racism Action Plan including unconscious interview  training which I implemented recently (April 22).\nAfter careful consideration, I left the British Council in June 2022 on a voluntary exit programme.\nI am now looking forward to new challenges and opportunities within a global project management context for an organisation with similar inclusive values. \nMit freundlichem Gru\u00df\nBest Wishes\nSimon ",
