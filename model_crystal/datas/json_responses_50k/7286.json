The mitigation aspect focussed on drivers of emissions, national policy frameworks (South Africa), influence of the political economy on implementation of policy, IPCC rules, local solutions for local people, solar geoengineering and reducing energy supply emissions. Climate change adaptation in practice, assessing adaption options, vulnerability assessments and approaches to impact assessments. \n\nClimate predictability: delved into issues of time and space scales in order to address the practical issues related to climate information. Explored the underpinnings of climate data, identification of info and questioned the chaos, stochastic, and deterministic predictability, cross scale relationships and feedbacks, the tools and techniques of prediction, translation of projections into the user community including potential impacts and the analysis of potential vulnerabilities. Touched on the social dimension. \n\nEnvironmental Economics: Explored real world problems including the control of pollution, management of mines, forests, fisheries, sustainability, funding biodiversity and putting the environment into project and policy decision-making.",
