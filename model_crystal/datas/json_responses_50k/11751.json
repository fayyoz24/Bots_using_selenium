    "summary": "I\u2019m Chinese medicine, lecturer and researcher since 2011. I lived in Asia for a total of 7 years, during which time I gained extensive and unique academic and clinical practice experiences in Acupuncture. \n\nI live and practice in my clinic in Amsterdam since 2021 and I'm the leader of the Research Task Force of the European Traditional Chinese Medicine Association.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, I studied the Medical Theory of Acupuncture Channels with the late Professor Wang Ju-Yi (\u738b\u5c45\u6613) in Beijing, China. From 2015 to 2021, I completed my postgraduate degrees under the supervision of Professor Yu-Chen Lee (\u674e\u80b2\u81e3) , the director of the Acupuncture department and worked as a lecturer and research fellow at the Graduate Institute of Acupuncture Science, in China Medical University. During my years in Taiwan, I also studied Taiwan Master Tung Acupuncture with Professor Lee Kuo Cheng (\u674e\u570b\u653f).\n\nMy PhD research was about the use of laser acupuncture for chronic facial paralysis. I published 6 scientific papers about acupuncture, laser acupuncture, and Chinese herbal medicine. My research interests involve acupuncture science and the role of connective tissue in the theory of acupuncture channels and the clinical and cost-effectiveness benefits of acupuncture treatment.\n\nIn recent years, I have participated as a speaker in several international conferences and obtained a number of academic awards, including Outstanding Senior Research Award for Clinical Research, SAR International Research Conference 2021; Taiwan Scholarship Outstanding Performance Award for the 2019 academic year; China Medical University Elite Doctoral Students Poster Contest Excellent Work Award for the 2018 and 2019 academic years; China Medical University Xie Fa Cai Alumni Acupuncture Scholarship; and the Chinese Medicine Research Contest of Excellent Work Award, Hong Kong Nin-Jiom Manufacture for the 2018 academic year.",
