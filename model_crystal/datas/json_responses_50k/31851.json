    "summary": "Originally from Cape Town, South Africa - I now live in the Netherlands with my wife. After completing an undergraduate degree in electronic engineering from Stellenbosch University, I pursued a master's degree focused on computer vision and autonomous navigation applications. I spent five years in the telecommunications and intelligence industry working on big data solutions for national governments and the law enforcement community.\n\nAs of December 2021 I have been at bol.com applying my skills in software, data, and machine learning engineering solving problems in the search and recommendations domain.\n\nTake a look at my latest personal website: https://alexanderchiu.github.io/.",

For most of this time I was part of a data integration platform team developing distributed and scalable big data solutions. I was also part of a prototyping team focusing on using machine learning to extract more value from our data, while keeping the majority of my responsibilities from my previous team.\n\nDuring this time I mostly worked on:\n\nBackend microservices: Developed several distributed Java services responsible for both querying (SQL and Elasticsearch) and performing ETL.\n\nAPI Design: Responsible for the design of several gRPC query interfaces. I was also the technical lead on a third-party facing query interface.\n\nQuery Generation: Developed a semantic model abstraction layer for a distributed OLAP relational database to allow the generation of optimized SQL queries from an in-house graph query specification based on real-life entities and relationships.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n- Full life-cycle feature and system implementation (analysis, design, implement, test, support)\n- Development infrastructure (build automation, continuous integration, shared libraries)\n- Release management\n- Mentor for company\u2019s intern programme",
