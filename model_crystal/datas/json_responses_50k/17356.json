Selling good causes required very different approaches depending on the situation. For all of them confidence and creativity were needed to find the path to an agreement. Some required strong reasoning, others required a witty comebacks, most of them required both. Each sale was a puzzle that only good communication skills and creative thinking could solve.\n\n Because of the very different approach compared to my previous sales job. Everyday I kept running into different problems which was hard at first but by consistently improving on my sales strategies and testing it through trial and error I managed to succeed at reaching my targets. \n\nAdding to this I also benefited greatly from the multitude of communication and brand ambassador ship trainings that we're offered to me, enabling me to really bring my skills to the next level.\n\nThis work experience really helped me realise that just working hard is not enough to maximise\nperformance.
