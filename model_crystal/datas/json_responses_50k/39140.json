    "summary": "Results-driven marketing specialist with a background in information management and big data, growth marketing, business intelligence and finance. Originally born Italian and living in the Netherlands since 2015. Naturally I am tech-savvy and analytical, I am always eager to take on new challenges and quickly learn & apply new skills. Currently I am pursuing a Master of Science while working as Online Marketing Specialist at an e-commerce firm. \n\nBy working aside product teams of different business units over the past 3 years, I took ownersip with setting up, growing and optimising a set of 8-figure sales channels for e-commerce business. As the pandemic was in full swing, I also played a critical role in maintaining and preparing three affiliate networks with over 4,000 registered partners in the travel industry for when the sector would recover. I supported key partners accounts worldwide overcoming the pandemic hardship by coming up with solutions that grew the B2B partnerships both ways over the long run (e.g. providing partners with actionable industry insight via targeted emails, 1<>1 syncs, localised newsletters, product updates etc.). \n\nIn 2022 I set aside the security of my job as Online Marketing Manager and begun a Master of Science in Business Information Management at the Rotterdam School of Management while still working part-time. This 1-year full-time program helped developing knowledge in information management such as data-mining and analytics, programming, designing business solutions and understanding disruptive technologies (such as blockchain, AI, VR, web 3.0).\n\nPossessing a high level of energy, a critical set of soft skills, an open mindset, and a positive attitude, I am prepared to excel in roles in growth marketing, product management, commercial excellence, sales and account management.\n\nI speak English, Italian, and Dutch and am based in Amsterdam. \n\nLet's connect to discuss how my knowledge in growth marketing and business development can help your company achieve its goals.",
