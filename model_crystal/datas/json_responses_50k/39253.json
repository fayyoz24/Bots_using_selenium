    "summary": "I am an architect by education, entrepreneur by nature, trusted consultant and manager interim.  Cooperation with me is the best choice for those who see a chance in international solutions (not limited to): Eastern and Central Europe, Netherlands or France.  \nUsing some keywords, it would be #International #management #quality #real estate #stragegy #sales #design #execution. \n\nBeing an architect with Master degree, I used to manage own general design offices in Russia and Ukraine for 7 years and lead complex project for major players in that market. Our specialty was retail, high-end shopping malls, office parks and hotels. The biggest projects (comprising site planning, buildings and fit-outs) were between 100K \u2013 220K sqm. We were working for private and corporate international investors, general contractors and international operators. From the sketch, through a concept, technical documentation up to the mock-up and executive drawings.\nI had been also working for the high-end luxury brands (CHANEL) as its\u2019 manager and part of creative direction; for dynamic corporative investors (AUCHAN GROUP) as its\u2019 expansion director; for the group of private international investors in real estates (MCC Beteiligungs) as the trustee and as general manager for some owned companies. \n\nIf You need on a board someone with large and diverse multinational experience, embracing changes and challenges, good listener with team spirit \u2013 You just found it!",
