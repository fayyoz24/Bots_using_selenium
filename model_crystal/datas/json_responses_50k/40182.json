The project aim was to compare computer simulations with experimental data taken from literature to determine a method of modelling the emissions produced in combustion processes, such as those in combustion engines.\n\u2022\tI developed my independent research skills during the internship as I searched through literature to find experiments that contained data on the emission levels from flame of particular fuels.\n\u2022\tI gained experience programming as I had to teach myself to use the Python programming language in order to construct reaction mechanisms required to model different flame conditions.\n\u2022\tI am passionate about reducing greenhouse gas emissions and selecting a summer project that focused on reducing the pollution levels of combustion processes shows that I am a motivated individual that is proactive in taking steps towards achieving my goals.",
