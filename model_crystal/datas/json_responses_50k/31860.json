The completion of this contract also forms part of obtaining the Chartered Accountant (South Africa) certification. Here I was exposed to clients in various industries including financial services, manufacturing, media, mining and retail. These clients were all reporting under IFRS and included many JSE listed companies.\n\nI moved up the ranks and by the end of my contract I was leading audit teams of up to 8 members and developing audit plans with the managers and partners.\n\nI also performed consolidated financial statements and tax calculations on an ad-hoc basis for clients, which gave me additional exposure outside the audit environment.\n\nI was also a representative on the Employment Equity Consultative Committee for my whole stay with the company, a committee which promotes equality in the workplace on all levels.",
