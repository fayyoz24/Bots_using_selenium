Catherine believes that dance mirrors life and that, in general, we tend to vastly undermine our capabilities. Therefore, her class is designed to enhance one to push through personal boundaries and this includes the progression to movement and technique across the floor, enriching spatial awareness and building confidence. \n\nCatherine's class evolves to the learning of her choreography, intended to challenge the student to expand their consciousness and experience of themselves and their flow in dance. Ultimately, aspiring towards the goal of allowing body, mind and soul to become one.",
