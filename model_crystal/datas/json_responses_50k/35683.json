    "summary": "My current professional focus is to combine my expertises in Design and Adventure. After I graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven in 2012, I started working as a Freelance Designer - focussing on Social Design and Public Space Design. From design my focus shifted to (beach)volleyball and after that I travelled to Namibia and Canada for work. In Namibia I designed and build two playgrounds, on voluntary basis. In Canada I worked for 2.5 years in the Outdoor Retail & Tourism branch and developed myself as a passionate solo hiker and backcountry skier. November 2017 I came back to The Netherlands, where I now live in Zwolle area.",

I was also responsible for all communication and partly for the marketing and graphical design. Among others I made the website (see link), a detailed map of the lake, their newsletters and the social media for both the rental shop and the VPO store. Apart from the management activities there were the normal daily activities - renting the boats and boards out to our visitors and making sure they were safe and had fun! The Beach Shop is only open in Summer time. In Spring 2017 my work visa ended, so I trained new staff to run the shop.",

                    "description": "May 2014 I started working full-time at Valhalla Pure Outfitters New Denver as head of sales. After a few weeks the store moved to a bigger building with more staff and my tasks expended with activities like: warranties, the design of advertisements and product information labels, setting up and managing MailChimp and Facebook. At the end I created a store manual with the complete info of how to run the store and the sales-software instructions.",

One, a survival park, we made for a school in a remote area. The school uses the park for their gym lessons and the play sets are also accessible to the community outside of school hours. The other playground is located in a township and is used by the young children in that neighbourhood. The focus of this project was to involve the local people and make use of local materials. We included a group of women and some children on voluntairy basis and we hired circa ten local men to support us with building the playgrounds. Everyone was included in the design proces, to make sure the community supports the project. To match the local culture and materials, the survival park mainly existed out of wood and ropes. The township playground mainly contains metal framework and recycled parts. During the build of the survival park we stayed with a local family (one woman that looks after 8 children) in Omishe. Omishe has no electricity, barely phone reception and one tap with runnig water for all villagers. In Windhoek we stayed on Penduka\u2019s property, which in located in the township of Windhoek, Katutura. I did this project on a voluntary basis.",
