The group consists of 18 selected, highly motivated students that will work together on various projects over the next eight months. The first challenge for the group is to acquire nine consultancy projects for Dutch companies. Consultancy firms provide several trainings to the students to ensure that the acquisition will be successful. Each duo is then assigned to an appropriate project and will start to prepare for the project with the necessary desk research.\n\nAfter an exciting acquisition period and thorough desk research, the field research in Brazil can start. We will start this period with an opening week, which marks the discovery of Brazil and enables the students to adapt to the local culture, environment and climate. The groups will travel through the country to different locations to conduct their research during five weeks of hard work.\n\nOnce the group has returned to the Netherlands, the final stage of the project will start. The results of the research need to be summarized in a report and the report will be presented to the company. Throughout the project, participants will receive multiple training courses from several large consultancy companies.\n\nhttp://www.fsaresearchproject.nl/",
