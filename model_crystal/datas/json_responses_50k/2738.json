As I believe there's much more potential in a piece of content, I value content repurposing and optimizing content, and make thoughtful distribution plans. Simply because there's so much more than \"just pressing publish\" once.\n\nBefore my professional career in Marketing & Communication, I graduated with honors for my master degree (MSc) in Marketing Management at the Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary, and a bachelor in Business Administration at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. Because of my educational background in international business and marketing and my 2.5 years of studying abroad, I have developed a strong international background.",
