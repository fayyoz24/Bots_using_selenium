During my time working for Kelsey (owner of WolfHouse Productions), my responsibilities were divided between assisting filming of bears, and developing/researching new and existing wildlife series. As a Film Assistant I scouted for locations of polar bears, filmed/photographed polar bears, and worked as bear safety. When not in the field, I organized the logistics of future film expeditions throughout the Canadian arctic. Additionally, I researched and wrote series outlines and pitches for current and future shows.  My work as Film Assistant and Researcher contributed to the development of three separate series: \u201cWild Survival\u201d, \u201cWild Stakeout\u201d, and \u201cBear Road\u201d.",
