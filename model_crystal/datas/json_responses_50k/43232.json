    "summary": "I 'am a professional buildings project manager, delivering projects in time and on budget with the required quality. \n\nMy signature is building the best team because I strongly believe that if you work closely together, every one achieves more.  In bringing the best of all people together each individual team member will reach further then could be realized when left on his own. \n\nI practice what I preach and I work steadily on sustainable relations with all stakeholders. So no hit and run approach is to be expected when I am on the team. \n\nI'am convinced that in the end this approach pays. And during my long career I have seen many proofs of same. \n\n\n",
