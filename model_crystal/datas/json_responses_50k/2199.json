Qualitative studies should be rigorous in method, transparent in analysis, and provide theoretical implications. We welcome innovative research methods and designs. Neither quantitative nor qualitative studies should employ samples based on students.

EDUWORKS brings together researchers from several academic disciplines. namely: Labour Economics, Sociology of Occupations, HRM, Lifelong Learning. Increasing segments of the demand side and the supply side of the labour market are digitized, ranging from job sites and cv\u2019s at Facebook and Linkedin to extensive databases with job descriptions and related skills demands. These developments have led to Knowledge Management and educational challenges in these matching processes. Specifically, EDUWORKS will focus on matching processes at three levels and on one overarching topic:\n\n-Individual level fit between job demands - persons\u2019 abilities\n-Meso-level employers\u2019 demands for occupational skills versus occupational dynamics\n-European and national level labour supply and demand matches and mismatches \n-Knowledge Management for supply and demand matches",

The project, which will last for a period of two years, will be kicked off in October 2012, and will pick up where the successfully completed OntoHR project (www.ontohr.eu), in which Corvinno and the ABS were previously involved, left off. \n\nSpecifically, the Med-Assess project is aimed at facilitating employee selection and individual training needs analysis through the detailed assessment of that job-knowledge that is required for successful performance in specific jobs in healthcare support. Applicants or employees will complete a computerized adaptive knowledge test that will culminate in a comprehensive knowledge profile that may, depending on the requirements of the user, be complemented with an individually tailored training needs analysis. The former may assist HR professional in selection decision making, whereas the latter will be linked to digitized training content and specific courses on offer at institutes of higher vocational education. Whereas OntoHR was focused on the ICT Systems Analyst job role, Med-Assess will be targeting several jobs from the healthcare support job family.\n",
