    "summary": "I always strive to grow more culturally-conscious, politically-aware and socially-empathetic. \n\nWorking towards an understanding of how cultural and sociopolitical insights can contribute to the commercial success of brands without appropriating and (again) alienating the people whose circumstances inform the strategic context. I believe this is only possible by acknowledging the impact of your subjective perspective on the output, making intersectional representation in the workplace my second professional mission.\n\nTo read more about the questions that keep me going (or awake at night): www.luzielouisa.com/blog.\n\n---\n\nBorn and raised in Berlin, Germany, I have lived in Zurich, Switzerland and Arkansas, USA before settling in Amsterdam in 2010. A frequent change in living circumstances required me to re-establish roots multiple times, enriching and simultaneously challenging me in my process of self-development, and significantly forming me into the person I am today: adaptable, fast-learner, down-to-earth, self-reflective and respectful.",
