Indeed, this topic has been extensively studied, for the main reason that new product introduction is a key driver of a firm\u2019s performance and its position in the market. Reflecting the past literature, we also take into consideration the external factors age of the firm and size of the firm, that also have an impact on sales growth.  We collect our annual data from the databases Thomson One, Factiva and OICA. Our research ascertains a negative relationship between new product introduction and sales growth, which is contradictory to the majority of past papers, but is still in line with a few past papers. This implies that several other factors additional to new product introductions should be considered when observing sales growth and different types of new products should be taken into account. ",

Children are thought to focus on personal interaction or on the object of conversation. Since the countries within Europe differ significantly, we decided to focus on Western Europe rather than the whole of Europe and divide them into clusters of culturally similar countries. This clustering system does not work for all worldwide regions; for example when the whole continent has many resembling countries or when there are too many independent countries, which do not have any similarities. However, Western Europe can be divided into three main clusters. The first cluster we will analyse is the \u201cLatin European\u201d cluster, which includes France, Italy and Spain. Secondly, there is the Germanic cluster. The countries involved are Germany and Austria. Thirdly we will examine the Nordic cluster including Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Managers visiting these countries would therefore be informed on the specific country\u2019s cultural trends and the more global tendencies of the surrounding countries. ",
