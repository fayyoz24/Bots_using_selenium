    "summary": "Hi there, I am Gaspard. I was born a creative, picked up the pencils, and did not stop. I fell in love with technology at an early age and enjoy making things in a workshop as well as in code. Working in various industries and diverse teams has made me sensitive to different markets, cultures, and practices, and has shown my passion for making innovative things in a collaborative manner. Having founded startups, I needed to self-learn highly disciplined work methods and leadership qualities. I am driven to constantly learn and adopt new skills in order to lead us to a more balanced and thriving society, and I am eager to join forces with organizations that want to make a positive impact. \n\nHaving been raised Dutch-French bilingually, mastering the English language through my own writings and music, having learned Spanish for business and Bosnian for my new family, I have developed quite a language intuition. Combined with my auto-didactic journey of learning the art of communication from a master coach, practicing public speaking on multiple occasions, studying philosophy and linguistics of the likes of Derida and Lakoff, and going on to teach the art of storytelling at the art academy, I am thrilled that the new paradigm of digital design and programming, fueled by the innovation of the transformer architecture, is shifting towards natural language as the most productive human-computer interface. I look forward to riding this wave of innovation eloquently.",
