    "summary": "Holistic architect with 7+ years of experience in architecture roles and 3 years as a people manager and team coordinator. I add value by setting direction at the crossroads between technology, organisation structure, people & culture, business processes and strategy.\n\nAs an architect, it is my job to create an organizational context which aligns technology, business and organisation to foster innovation. In everything I do, it\u2019s my goal to leverage the potential of the people working in the organisation and to dismantle any structures, processes and practices that waste precious time and energy. \n\nAfter 15+ years in technology roles, I have spent the last few years branching out to management, human resources, product development and business strategy. My wide range of experience, hard- and soft skills and learning mindset makes me an effective problem solver and advisor in a wide range of subjects. I always strife to empower decision makers on all levels, from autonomous teams to executive directors.\n\nIt\u2019s important to me to work on various subjects and constantly challenge myself to gain new insights and look at things from a fresh perspective. Although being an architect can sometimes be quite a solo endeavor, I prefer to be working with or leading a diverse group of talented people and take great joy in achieving shared goals as a group. \n\nTo bring more creativity into the workplace, I love using visual storytelling to make complex things simple to understand and to get everyone on board with a shared direction.",
