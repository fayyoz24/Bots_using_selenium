Subjects range from Oriental manuscripts to Spanish civil war photographs and represent a wide geographical spread that covers the length and breadth of Europe.\n\nFull-text Indexing: This is the first cultural digitisation project that incorporates full-text indexing and searching capabilities. This creates the potential for in-depth academic study of all texts brought together by Europeana Libraries.\n\nRepresentation: Europeana Libraries provided research libraries with a platform to promote their collections to the widest possible audience. It lays the foundation on which a critical mass of research resources can be based.\n\nAggregation: This project unites content from several libraries and creates a single channel for contributing library content to Europeana and The European Library. The model is efficient, cost-effective and capable of being extended to research libraries across Europe.\n\nHigh Quality Metadata: The quality and structure of library metadata will be improved. This will make online searching more accurate and user-friendly. New features such as timelines and maps will also be supported. ",
