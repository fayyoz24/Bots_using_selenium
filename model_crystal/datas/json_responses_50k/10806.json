            "description": "Currently, antibiotics are often misused in livestock farming. This poses a problem because it accelerates the process of bacteria developing resistance to these antibiotics, making it harder to treat the infections that they cause. Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to health, food security and development according to the World Health Organization. Recently, during the G20, the world leaders decided it is time for action! \n\nWe as the iGEM TU Delft DreamTeam 2017, want to contribute to a solution by developing an affordable, user-friendly diagnostic tool, able to detect antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. Our tool will be a big improvement on current methods so that antibiotics can be given to cattle in a more directed way. Such a tool will allow rapid detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria in livestock infections. The project\u2019s name is CASE13a, as we make use of the recently discovered Cas13a/C2c2 which is a variant of a protein from the CRISPR/Cas system. Upon recognition of (antibiotic resistance) target mRNA, Cas13a is activated and engages in collateral cleavage of all RNA in its surroundings. This collateral cleavage allows for conversion of target recognition into an optical readout. Our device is inspired by three design requirements: sensitivity, safety and storability. These three topics form the four research modules of our project, along with an integrating module on the final design.",

Student teams design, build and test their projects over the summer and gather to present their work and compete at the annual Jamboree. \nParticipation in the iGEM competition empowers teams to manage their own projects, advocate for their research and secure funding.
