Validation of such innovative\nsolutions in a realistic test environment including a highly ambitious participant like ArenA would be\nvaluable for both researchers and involved stakeholders to prototype and facilitate fast adoption of\ninnovation solutions. Replication of innovations in this large scale test environment is the next crucial\nstep to determine how these solutions can be made suitable for the future, smart energy system.\nFor the Legal Work Package of the Project, the research question and intended results are:\nWhat are the possible organizational and legal arrangements to enable large urban consumers\nsuch as ArenA to unlock their flexibility potential and remain financially viable?\nIntended results: This research will identify the existing legal boundaries and define\norganizational and legal solutions that will enable the implementation of local markets at minimal\nregulatory costs. In the end, it will provide legal provisions that prevent gaming opportunities.",
