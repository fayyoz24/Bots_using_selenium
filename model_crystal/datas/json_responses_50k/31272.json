    "summary": "A writer and editor specialized in spatial design and products, I'm specifically interested in design projects that deal with sustainability, wellbeing, agility, experience and community-building/co-creation. My areas of focus are retail, hospitality, living, events, culture and offices/workplaces.  \n\nBased in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, I grew up in New Zealand and received my Bachelor of Design (Hons), majoring in Interior Design, from Massey University in Wellington. After working in the fields of interior design, events and product design, I combined my passions for writing and design through editorial work. \n\nI currently contribute to various publications worldwide as a writer and researcher, and create editorial-style content/storytelling for a number of top design brands. I'm also the editor at large for Frame Magazine (https://www.frameweb.com/tracey-ingram), the world's leading interior- and product-design publication, after joining the in-house team in 2010. I have appeared in design-award juries, moderated design-related panel discussions and represented Frame at numerous international design events, as well as assisting in the curation of design-related events.",
