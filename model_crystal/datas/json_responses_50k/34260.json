    "summary": "Mixed methods social researcher and psychologist interested in how values, emotions, relationships and digital technologies shape and are shaped by knowledge about people, cultures, science, technology and our environment amid the climate crisis and rising polarisation. I highly value empathy and collaboration.\n\nI am trained in psychology, science and technology studies (STS) or studies of science, technology and society, UX research, data justice, as well as qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods. In past projects I have explored the development of interdisciplinary and digital social sciences, science and organisational (e)valuation cultures, organisational change management, data ethics, the social dimensions of sustainability, human factors / ergonomics / UX of flight deck interfaces and conducted marketing strategy research. Methods I worked with include interviews, document and policy analysis, focus groups, ethnography, surveys, scientometrics, and statistics done in Python, R and SQL. \n\nPostdoc: exploring how (e)valutation shapes ocean science using mixed methods \nPhD: studied how values are negotiated in interdisciplinary, computational social science using mixed methods\n\nExperience: mixed methods | organizational psychology & organizational change | consulting | policy analysis | science studies | science society and technology | interdisciplinary knowledge transfer | human factors & ergonomics & UX research | market research & marketing strategy | psychotherapy | community mental health | conferences \n\nExtensive cross-cultural experience: Hungary, France, Ireland, UK, Netherlands",

My work focuses on exploring ocean scientists' work by developing combinations of scientometrics (statistics, network analyses) with qualitative methods (interviews, document analysis) and theories from Science and Technology Studies.\n- Studied how marine social scientists develop their work at the intersection of natural and social sciences using a combination of interviews, policy analysis and scientometrics. Marine social science is key to reaching the United Nation\u2019s vision of an interdisciplinary, global and multi-stakeholder ocean science, defined under the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030). However, marine social science is often marginalised in the science system and combining interdisciplinary work at the intersection of natural and social sciences has its challenges.\n- Studied the meaning of the term \u2018ocean science\u2019. Through comparing the term\u2019s policy analysis and its academic uses, I contributed to understanding the coordinative role the term currently plays, fostering interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder research in ocean, marine, coastal and fisheries science.\n- Mapper trends in ocean science using scientometrics \n- Analysed trends in ecological fisheries management proposed by the ICES",

We use proliferating digital data and computational research methods (such as statistics, network analyses, machine learning using demographic or social media data) to inform essential social policies and interventions. However, such computing can only tell partial stories: it only speaks about the users of digital platforms, and only capture count-able aspects of our lives, such as population densities, social media followers or scientific citation counts. On the other hand, caring for and collaborating with each other requires hearing everyone\u2019s voice and understanding the values and emotions that drive us.\n\nMy PhD explored how computational research methods can help explore diverse voices and values in two main ways. First, I developed a novel research design to use computational methods to study the negotiation of values. Whilst previous studies mainly assessed computational methods theoretically, I argued for developing them iteratively in light of \u2018the interpretative context\u2019 which includes the research questions, theories and prior empirical findings. \u2018Qualitative\u2019 methods I used included interviews, document analysis informed by social theories. \u2018Computational\u2019 methods included scientometric citation network analyses and descriptive statistics conducted in R, Python and SQL.\n\nSecond, my case study identified differences in how human geographers who study social media data use computational methods to study places which comprise diverse people\u2019s voices and values. For example, some scholars reflect on computational findings in light of lived experiences, history and study concrete events or locations. In contrast, others assess computational findings about spaces in demographic terms and study abstract spatial units such as \u2018spatial patterns\u2019.",
