    "summary": "An experienced, enthusiastic and committed English lecturer, my skills lie in challenging and engaging students through the development of creative, well-planned lessons. A good rapport and mutual respect are at the heart of my teaching approach. Very much a team player, I enjoy the stimulation of working in a collaborative environment and play an active role in the continual development of the curriculum. I am keen to stay abreast of current educational thinking in order to enable my students to achieve their potential.\n\nI am currently part of the English team in the European Studies programme at Zuyd Hogeschool in Maastricht, where I have worked since September 2021. The programme is taught entirely in English, and our English curriculum uses the CLIL approach where English is integrated with the course content. I very much enjoy the added challenge of becoming familiar with the range of projects the students need to complete, identifying the language necessary, and creating activities that encourage language acquisition. My role entails all aspects of teaching including lesson planning, ensuring the right mix of different assessment types within each year, as well as maintaining a logical and consistent build-up of the curriculum throughout the 4-year programme. We are currently, proactively scrutinising and adapting our curriculum to deal with the challenges of AI. In addition to these core activities, I mentor a group of students, providing advice on academic matters and monitoring student well-being. I am also involved in supervising and assessing final year research projects.\n\nPrior to my current role, I worked for six years as a Lecturer in the English Language and Culture Minor at Fontys Hogeschool in Eindhoven. Here, I created and delivered workshops on language skills as well as on British and Irish culture. As part of the team, I actively contributed to the development of new course material, assessment and rubrics, as well as supervising and assessing research projects undertaken by students. I also gained a good understanding of blended learning and was involved in restructuring courses in preparation for a new, blended learning approach.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, I worked as an English teacher at the United World College (secondary school). During this time, I was closely involved with the development of the Middle Years Programme (MYP) which has a strong focus on student-centred learning and teaching with an international emphasis. I also very much enjoyed the collaboration with other departments on interdisciplinary projects.",
