    "summary": "As a Newfoundlander/Canadian living in the Netherlands, I help women in male-dominated industries survive and thrive in their careers AND I help businesses retain and empower their women workforce. Having personally worked in several non-traditional industries including technology, geosciences, construction and resource development, I have first-hand experience of what it\u2019s like to be a woman in a male-dominated field. I take that practical knowledge and combine it with my academic degrees in Psychology (bachelor\u2019s with a social behavioural focus) and Gender Studies (master\u2019s) to create proven programs and workshops that educate and empower.",
