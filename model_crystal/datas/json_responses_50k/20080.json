    "summary": "I have been described, rather unflatteringly, as a Swiss army knife. I suppose this badge reflects the  two-pronged development of my career. I earned my keep as an English teacher while at the same time pursuing my academic interest in historical linguistics.\n \nTeaching  was never something I felt I only did to finance my research. Far from it. I am from a long line of educators; teaching is in my blood and I always made it my business to become the best teacher I could possibly be. After completing my doctorate, I did a Master in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, with a focus on English for Specific Purposes.\n \nAfter 35 years in mainstream education, I have been 'funemployed' since September 2022. Funemployed is a phrase that has been variously used to describe people just waiting for the next job opportunity and making the most of their free time (Urban Dictionary 2009), as well as  the work-shy offspring of wealthy parents (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/15/clamp-down-funemployment-worklessness-tax-rich) but also as the over-fifties who apparently left the workforce in droves at the end of the pandemic https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/17/over-50s-on-quitting-work-for-good-uk). \n\nNone of these descriptions apply to me.\n\nIn my case, funemployed means being able to do jobs that I really enjoy. These tend to be jobs that  involve teaching or coaching, as well as translating.",

In'to Languages contacted me and my class of ESP trainees to see if we were willing to take on this challenging task. We developed and taught a 'Survival English for Triathletes' course which we took in turns to teach. \nTeaching students with literally no knowledge of English is not something that we are used to in the Netherlands. At some points we even had to resort to Google translate. Looking back, I reckon that the teachers learnt as much about triahtlons, bikes and swimming as Hugo and Rene did about English."
