Currently the only resemblance of improved sanitation in the village is an old public latrine now fallen into disrepair while the most popular method of water collection is from shallow wells where the water is easily contaminated by fecal matter in runoff and other pollutants.\nThe project proposes solutions of increasing complexity and cost concerning sanitation and water supply improvements. The work also includes a stakeholder analysis, the community's participation approach, the promotion strategy and the cost estimation of the proposed solutions.",

The disposal alternatives included different types of recycling of plastic, incineration with energy recovery while the idea of a reusable packaging was also assessed as a more sustainable approach. The combination of the environmental and economic aspect of the assessed scenarios gave a more realistic and sustainable overview to the project. The set up of the environmental modelling and the economic analysis were realized with as much as possible state-of-the-art data sourcing directly from the involved industries and organizations. \nThe project was publicly presented by me to the \u2018\u2019Conference: Plastic waste is the new gold!\u2019\u2019 in Copenhagen.",

The project included the planning, the organization and the implementation of the waste sampling and sorting as well as the classification and processing of the results. The promotion and the explanation of the guidelines to the involved stakeholders was one of the crucial parts of the fieldwork project.\nThe toxic waste was manually separated and weighed over a period of five working weeks, spread in a period of 5 months. Total pharmaceutical waste was classified in two categories: vial waste and syringe waste while the vial waste was further classified in six major categories: antibiotics, digestive system drugs, analgesics, hormones, circulatory system drugs and \"other\". \nThe project was published in the Waste Management magazine and it was also presented at two different conferences (at the 3rd International Conference on Hazardous and Industrial Waste Management. Crete, Greece and at at the 2nd International Conference of Green Infrastructure: \u2018The New Generation of Green Infrastructure Projects\u2019. Thessaloniki, Greece)",
