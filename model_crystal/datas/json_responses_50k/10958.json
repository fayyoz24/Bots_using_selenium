You fully supported the Top Cluster from VHV for the past 3-4 months, meaning the various cluster meetings but also progress reviews. Even with this challenge you managed to connect with the team fast and ensured continuity in the support, but also to let some things run smoother. At the start you indicated timeslots when not available, but fast your dedication was there and even on times not expected you were available to provide the support the cluster needed. You very quickly earned the respect of the Wilton EXE team members as well as the DM staff of Louis Lu. Your innate ability to understand a topic quickly proved valuable to our cluster. Your interfaces were so seamless that we did not notice that you were 3000 miles away. Thanks a lot Andrea!",

Moreover, your drive for efficiency created time for you to take on an additional assignment of supporting the Technology program. Never afraid to ask, you kept on challenging us and our teams on our way of working, and the finance department on the quality/content of their reports, but always in a constructive and collaborative way!
