My volunteer activities included animal feeding and dog walking (there are many dogs in the shelter in cages all day long, and their opportunity to walk is mostly when volunteers visit the animal shelter for this purpose) and taking care of different animals. These animals require care, but unfortunately the workers cannot provide this care for all of these animals by themselves, so they definitely need volunteers. Also, I helped them in a fund-raising event  in order to support the good work at the shelter."
