    "summary": "Next to making designs for the masses, my core competence is bridging the gap between visionary design/ideas and engineering. \nThis includes the implementation of Functional Creation Processes (FCP), Product Creation Processes (PCP), a healthy focus on DFM,DFA, regulations and Lean Six Sigma, covering IP, finding the right suppliers for parts (CM, OEM and ODM), visiting factories in Europe and Asia and doing most of the involved paperwork (NDA\u2019s RFI\u2019s etc)\n\nCurrently passing my knowledge on to a new generation of designers, feeling fortunate that they allow me to do so. \n\nCompetences: Rhino 3D CAD. Designs for the masses. A solid feeling for marketing and the ability to make any engineering and manufacturing team understand the do's and don'ts when dealing with the aesthetics of a product during the development and manufacturing phases. \nNext to this, an eagerness to learn about new products and technologies, while sharing this knowledge, when applicable for development or improvement.",

They sold over 5 million of those bulbs around Europe with very little call rate.\n\nUnfortunately all R&D activities were moved to India in March 2013, so our Dutch team, which had the most energetic fighting spirit I had ever encountered until then, fell apart. \nI wish the India team all the best in the future.
