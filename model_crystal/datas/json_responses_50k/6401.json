Performance Site. \n\nArtistic Statement\nRonald Bal is a visual artist mainly focusing on live art, storytelling, installation and lens-based media. His work deals with danger and fragility in intimate systems and natural events. Inspired by social exchange, health, cyborg, history and ecology in the field of anthropology, he is currently focusing on the organic body and digital text. Simulating the physical and the virtual by re-animating personal data combined with live events, on the border of theatre and visual art. His work often leads to installations where repetition of images and body movement are combined to support its narrative structure. \n\n\n\nWebsite:           www.ronaldbal.com\nAdministrator:  www.performanceart.nl",

            "description": "My recent project World in a Cocoon acts as an umbrella for a growing series of project proposals to identify various concepts of the cocoon. The project features installations, performances, text-based and choreographic works, films, soundscapes and (online) conversations. In doing so, technology and natural resources (ceramics, wood, glass, etc.) are deployed in social simulations within public and private spaces.\n\nInspired by Maya Deren's film 'At Land' (1944) -which presents a dreamlike narrative where the actress travels and meets other people and other versions of herself - y project can be seen as embodied narratives, where the \"documented\" is solitary and isolated and the \"digital\" is multifaceted and multi-dimensional. My project will built on and bridge the gap between descriptive processes/ mechanisms/behaviors and social reality.\n\nThe project gradually develops works that seeks to question forms of surveillance and objectification based on the proposition of \"witnessing\" as phenomenological truth and historical fact. Kelly Oliver states that 'witnessing has both the legal connotation of seeing with one's own eyes and the religious or now political connotation of witnessing that which cannot be seen'. In doing so, I focus on eyewitnesses and testimonies as a route for the project: eye - witness \u2013 testimony:\n- Eye: Technology, (cyber)system, Tracking, Perspective, Knowledge, Power, Data and Image;\n- Witness: Statement, Script, Choreography, Interpretation, Justice, Fact, History, Performance, Archiving and Setting;\n- Testimony: Movement, Affect, Embody, Flashback and Stage-set.\n\nTo support these structures of progressive transformation, the cocoon becomes more and more an unpredictable tool that creates alternative architectural spaces. From there, forms of surveillance can be situated that transcend legal boundaries by operating in and communicating through spaces that until recently were considered strictly private.",

Now that artificial body parts can be cultivated in laboratories, the perception of the body in general, and of organs in particular, is changing. In my research, cyborg, the cybernetic organism, plays a key role, in which the cyborg is considered a hybrid machine and organism in one. The cyborg is a model for the mechanical expansion and metamorphosis of nature in the human body.\n\nDuring the research I collaborated with scientists from the Neuro-imaging Center and the Institute of Diagnostic Radiology of the Technical University Dresden (TU Dresden) specializing in CT scans and ultra-sound. With this technique I was able to make scans of multiple body parts, including my organs and brain. These photos have been converted into 3D models and with a 3D printer into organic sculptures, using machine learning systems at the residency Sundaymorning@ EKWC in Oisterwijk, The Netherlands.\n\nBy converting CT scans into ceramics, the \"inside\" of my body is transformed into a visual \"outside\". In this way I create a metamorphosis from the inside out. In addition, I use natural materials to make the virtual \u2013 not visible \u2013 interior visible. In other words, by printing with natural materials I come close to staging organic processes.\n\nThe aim of the Cyber Story | Series is to create new works of art in which nature (human and non-human) and technology (machines) form an alliance, in the sense that it is \"created\" in an area of virtuality beyond that conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital representation of reality.",

            "description": "\u2018Schommel\u2019\n\nHet lichaam en het contact tussen lichamen staat centraal in mijn werk. Hierbij onderzoek ik vooral de interactie tussen mij, mijn werk en de toeschouwer. En de interactie tussen mensen en groepen in het algemeen. In mijn werk gebruik ik vaak het lichaam van de toeschouwer, om iets aan te drijven en te bewegen of de toeschouwer te laten bewegen. Uiteindelijk is de interactie met de toeschouwers het werk. Het onderzoek vormt zich vaak in een installatie en/of performance.\n\nHet werk dat ik voor Flevoboulevard wil maken, is een soort schommel.  Het zijn twee oude scheepsbalken  waar mijn lichaamsvorm is uitgevreesd. En waar ik  tussen hang tijdens de performance. Mensen kunnen mij wiegen.  Tijdens de performance ben ik machteloos en overgeleverd aan het publiek. Zoals boten overgeleverd zijn aan de zee. Na deze performance kunnen mensen zelf op de balken schommelen. Het word een plek waar mensen even kunnen uitrusten. En van de omgeving kunnen genieten. De confrontatie tussen de schommel en de toeschouwer is waar het werk over gaat. Zo wil ik dat het werk onderdeel word van de omgeving.",
