    "summary": "Friendly and energetic, with a strong background in physics, software development, neurotechnology and data science. I have a creative twitch and a broad interest in everything related to science, technology and innovation. \n\nMy current passion is building the next numerical computing ecosystem at ASML. We are bringing modern software tools to ASML, solving the two language problem with the Julia language and bringing engineering competencies together. All to make our algorithmic software products faster, better and smarter. I am leveraging my many years of technical and entrepreneurial experience for this mission.\n\nDue to my neverending curiosity I have experience in many technologies, including programming languages such as Python, R, MATLAB, C/C++ and Julia language. Many years of software development experience in multiple production environments. I taught myself data science, machine learning and AI. I know my way around DevOps. As architect I love to focus on improving our developer experience.\n\nMoving between engineering and business competencies, I learned how to pitch ideas and communicate clearly. I have experience leading and coaching technical teams of various sizes. \n\nMy professional blog is: scientificcoder.com\nMy private blog: functionalnoise.com\nMy older medium blogs: https://medium.com/@matthijs.cox\n\nI always enjoy coming into contact with new people, ideas and cultures. Would you like to know more about me? Or just want to exchange ideas? Please feel free to contact me.",

Making engineers effective and happy, so they can create the best outcomes for ASML. The best outcomes are highly valuable products. Since I work in the ASML Metrology department, those products are all about sensors, science, software, data, machine learning and more. All to keep our lithography machines cutting edge while keeping our developers productive. We get there with programming languages, development environments, fast feedback loops, test driven development, continuous integration, DevOps, CICD, Agile. Whatever tool or technology is required to get the job done, I learn it, coach the engineers to use it and streamline the development. All for the best possible outcome.\n\nMy favorite engineering outcomes so far:\n- Started a multi-competence development team to build products with new tools and technology.\n- Happier customers: Together with this team developed backend services for applications that improve our customers user experience, allowing faster issue resolution times.\n- Happier engineers: Introduced the Julia language and other tools at ASML, to boost collaboration between engineering competencies. We now have an inner-source ecosystem of >100 Julia ASML packages.\n- Faster development: Ongoing exploration on how to deploy code in multiple ASML platforms at once; in embedded devices, cloud microservices, distributed computing platforms and more.",
