    "summary": "An experienced professional and environmental enthusiast with both an engineering and management background, I have 10 years of experience in the development and implementation of sustainability and environmental programmes, with a particular focus on industry (energy, refining and chemicals). In this context, I have gained a strong expertise in the management of environmental and climate change projects in line with corporate strategy and operations. I have gained throughout my career an in-depth knowledge in the technical evaluation of international and European policy frameworks on climate change and environmental protection and their application in operations. Having spent the majority of my career in international companies, this experience has helped me to gain insight in different cultures as well as managing different stakeholders in my projects. \n\nAreas of expertise include strategy & concept development on research, technology and innovation, policy and regulatory framework assessment, sustainability and environmental reporting frameworks and mechanisms, market and competitive intelligence, life cycle assessments, development, coordination and management of projects on environmental management, energy and carbon footprint, and IP management.
