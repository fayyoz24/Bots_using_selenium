I coordinate and execute projects for Safety, Health and Environmental issues. An important responsibility in my job is a change management program to increase the safety culture of the Heineken Zoeterwoude brewery. In this program I lead, in collaboration with a team, the development of management training programs and coach managers to learn more about safety and their responsibility in safety. Cases based on practical situations are used in this program to keep it simple and accessible to apply. Accident investigation, doing risk analysis and analysing safety data are also responsibilities in my job. In preparation of the \u2018Safety day\u2019 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 I played a coordinating and executing role in the organizational workgroup. My main goal is to support the brewery management to a top class safety performance, in reaching zero accidents.\n\nThe implementation of the environmental pillar and a sustainability program, which is based on the Brewing a Better World program, to increase the environmental performances of the brewery Zoeterwoude is also a key focus in my job. In collaboration with the province of \u2018Zuid Holland\u2019 and the University of Wageningen I coordinate and participate in a diversity of projects to improve the (internal and external) environment of the brewery.\n\nAs a TPM Facilitator I support the Safety pillar to roll-out the TPM methodology and training the Safety pillar members in their role. Advising and coaching the Brewery Manager, department managers and safety pillar members to prioritize on TPM subjects and safety issues. I facilitate safety improvement teams within the brewery and train the team members on TPM procedures and in using TPM tools. Also tasks as auditing and leading safety and competence gap reduction teams are part of my job.",
