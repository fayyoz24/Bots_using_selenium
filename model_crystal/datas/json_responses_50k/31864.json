    "summary": "Curtleigh Alaart (he/him) is a 3rd year Public Management and International Relations student at the University of Pretoria, currently on exchange at Leiden University, Netherlands. \n\nHe has a keen interest in Public Policy, International Relations, Macro, and Labor Economics. Curtleigh grew up in busy North London, England, and later moved to humble Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, and has thus been exposed to both sides of the economic spectrum. Coming from a family of academics has positively influenced Curtleigh's outlook on the value of education, particularly areas that constructively contribute to the fight for economic equality for all people.",
