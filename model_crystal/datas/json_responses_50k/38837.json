    "summary": "I am passionate about sustainability, particularly about sustainable development in the global south. The environmental, economic, and social effects of global trade as well as the teleconnections between the global north and south resulting from globalised trade are currently at the focus of my research. With my research I aim to advance our understanding of un/sustainable developments ranging across time and space to eventually better govern global connections.\nBesides my PhD research I am passionate about the issue of reducing food waste and changing western food systems. \n ",

The general concept of Foodsharing is commonly known in my home country Germany, but the movement is only now starting in the Netherlands so that we were one of the first initiatives. The main objective is to fight food waste by collecting food from shops, hotels, restaurants etc. that would otherwise be thrown away. With a team of volunteers we pick up food around 30 times per week to redistribute it for free.\nI have been leading this project parallel to my Bachelor and Master studies. Hereby, my tasks include: social media (facebook), coordination of a team of around 30 volunteers, negotiating deals and contracts with shops, external & internal communication, leading team meetings, and recruitment of new volunteers every semester.  Besides, quite frequently we organised events, information markets, or I hold presentations informing people about the challenge of food waste and how to avoid it in the future. \n \nLeading Foodsharing shaped me and made me grow immensely as a person. It continuously challenged me and taught me a lot about leadership, time management and communication with my team and external partners.",
