The project and the board were designed to raise awareness for the great problem of plastic litter ending up in waterways and eventually in the seas and oceans affecting one of our more important ecosystems. Thousands of bottle caps and hundreds of bottles found on the Dutch shores were used to create this unique board alongside sustainable materials such as PLA based biofoam, cork and flax.\n\nThe biggest challenge was to keep the enormous board light enough to be handled. A lot of research has gone into its development; from sandwich constructions of caps and glassfibers to a pneumatic machine lasercutting thousands of caps to half their weight. An aluminum rig has been designed to make a 3D scan of the board and define the segments of its hollow construction. The video below shot and edited by documentarist Eelke Dekker shows some parts of the process. The combination of 3D scanning with CAD and eventually CAM technologies has been a very interesting and essential part of the project.\n\nAlthough the board started its journey with a delay from Germany it made hundreds of kilometers to the salt waters of the North Sea. Thanks to the hard work of Merijn Tinga and Eelke Dekker the documentary inspired thousands of people and politicians by displaying it at the Dutch Parliament and even the United Nations in Gen\u00e8ve. The board now rests at the Science Centre of the TU Delft, with 50.000 kids walking passed it each year we hope it will keep on inspiring them to use less plastics with more care.",
