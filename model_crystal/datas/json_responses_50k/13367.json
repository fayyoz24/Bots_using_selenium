    "summary": "\u201cAlways see the bigger picture with every design and layout, you will know when something feels right\u201d - Saskia Duckworth\n\nI love throwing myself into new things that take me out of my comfort zone, after being the most un-athletic person on the planet, I have now run over 15 half marathons, swam in 2 long distance races and have now taken on the challenge of learning to ride a bike\u2026. again.\n\nWith 15 years experience in the design industry, I am constantly evolving with new trends, while learning how to adapt when your gut tells you something just isn\u2019t working.\n\nI've had the honour of working for some incredibly talented creative leaders as a senior Art Director in many international agencies, the rush of a new brief still sends a shiver of excitement down my spine and a quick brainstorm is always a good time. It still amazes me where great ideas come from where inspiration can be found.\n\nI have definitely learnt the most from running my own business, nurturing client relationships and working with small and medium sized business\u2019s to develop a creative voice in the market, happy clients give me a massive amount of pride. I have the ability to take on any sized project and develop it from brief to completion efficiently across all platforms, no matter how big or small! \n\nI have just taken on the adventure of a lifetime in moving to Amsterdam and starting over.  I\u2019m excited to have the opportunity to use my knowledge and learn from the people who call this creative oasis home.\n\nContact me on saskiaduckworth@gmail.com or have a look at some of the exciting projects i have worked on at saskiaduckworth.com\n",
