    "summary": "I finished my bachelors degree in Educational Science and Child Development in October of 2011. As not everything can be learned in books I went to travel and see more of the world. What started as a 1 year backpacking trip ended up being a 2,5 year solo independent cycling trip in Asia, Australia and Western Europe. \n\nUpon return to the Netherlands in May 2014 I moved to The Hague where I soon found work at Bever Zwerfsport, leaning about and selling outdoor equipment. Something I am passionate about and enjoyed learning more of. \n\nThe opportunity to return to my careworker job in Western Australia came up and I took it. By October 2015 I was back in Australia and worked there for 6 months. Once finished I got back on my bike and started on the next solo independent cycling trip across the red center to the North East of Australia. In 6 months I experienced the dessert at its best, volunteered on live-aboard spearfishing trips and made it by bike to Brisbane. \n\nNew Zealand was my destination for the next 2 years, which meant a lot of cycling, hiking and camping. I found a job in a vineyard doing pruning and wrapping during winter, and continued with the differing seasonal tasks. By the time harvest followed I moved on to a winery for my first vintage. Thoroughly enjoying the physical and mental aspects of the work I have proceeded to do the same in Germany in the fall of 2018 and fall of 2019. \n\nSince January 2020 I work at the Fietsvakantiewinkel, using my experience at Bever and my cycling trips to help others find the gear they need for their next trip.",
