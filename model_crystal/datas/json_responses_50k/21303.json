    "summary": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb and welcome to my LinkedIn profile. Let me introduce myself \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nMy name is Elena \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I was born and raised in Russia. \n\nBecause of my job, I moved to Germany in 2017, and love brought me to the Netherlands in 2019. Moving comes with challenges, also from a professional point of view. E.g. learning and adjusting to different business environments and cultures. These changes helped me develop my professional skills. Throughout my career, I gained experience mostly in b2b sales & customer support, where I assisted the international sales team by:\n- coordinating activities and handling deadlines (time management);\n- contacting customers worldwide (advanced level business English);\n- managing data in CRM and ERP software (key user);\n- and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations. \n\nMy analytical skills, creativity and problem-solving abilities helped me identify possible customers\u2019 objections and find mutually beneficial solutions for all stakeholders involved.\n\nI have Dutch nationality. And currently, I live with my partner and our sons in Enschede, Netherlands. My Dutch level (speaking and understanding) is B1-level. \n\nWhat I started learning at my University (specialising in International Relations) is benefitting me today:\n- about different cultures\n- values\n- and beliefs. \n\nIt helped me become the person I am today: adjusting, tolerant, open-minded and curious. Mostly curious about new tech and the latest software solutions (ChatGPT, AI).\n\nThank you for reading and feel free to reach out \ud83d\udce8 or connect \ud83d\udd17 on LinkedIn.",
