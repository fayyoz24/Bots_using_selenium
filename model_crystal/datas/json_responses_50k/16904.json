    "summary": "Nature is so fascinating! There is always something new to see and discover. There is so much more to be amazed about. I believe that together we have the important task to conserve that fantastic nature. Educated as biologist/ecologist I have gathered a lot of knowledge and I was able to spend my time conserving Dutch nature. As professional photographer I want to reach as many people worldwide and to inform them about and enthuse them for the conservation of nature. My pictures are for sale for usage in media, in the office of just for on the wall at home. From the profits 10% goes to WWF to conserve this nature for the future generations. \n\nI see myself as a hard worker who takes initiative and who takes advantages of opportunities that come his way, as well as someone who creates those opportunities.\n\nKey words include spontaneous, enterprising, helpful, make things my own easily, proactive, social, am not stopped easily.",
