In order to measure its performance, the algorithm was built from the scratch and its execution time was compared with the Look up table Implementation and a Implementation with static array.",

The decision of defining and deploying sub tasks which are responsible for generation and processing of pixels is a difficult task. Therefore, a modeling based on Y chart methodology was proposed by Martijn Hendriks et al. This project aims to develop a library using SystemC in order to model the data intensive application in a high level of abstraction using the methodology proposed and a printer data path case was considered as the example system. Its performance such as simulation speed, scalability, ease of modeling and memory usage was compared when being compared with implementations performed using other high level modeling languages (C++ and Java).\n\n\nKey : SystemC, C++, Java",
