This system performs the required function of speeding up the cash receipts and payments as well as\nprovides for greater accountability, which enables the required personnel in taking the requisite decision. The company also uses a system called CMS being provided by HDFC.\n\nIndian oil has around 540 locations around India which serve as an outlet for the finished products. These locations receive collections and make payments on a day-to-day basis. State Bank of India (SBI) is one of the primary bankers of IOCL and offers various facilities under the Customer Accounts Group (CAG) facility to the Corporation, the latter being one of the largest customers of SBI.\n\nIndian Oil started the concept of Electronic Collections (e \u2013 Collections), e.g., RTGS, CORE TO CORE, NEFT, INTERNET BANKING, etc. facility with a view to generating the credit receipt to the customer account in ERP at the earliest against the delivery of the product. Around 75% of E-collection occurs through RTGS.\nCash receipt (CR) gets auto-posted in ERP as soon as the credit is received in IOCL Bank Account thus avoiding the money sitting in the bank account to remain idle. The customers, therefore, are able to get the delivery of the products quickly without any hassle.",
