I have developed a crazy passion for watermanagement and for technical subjects such as hydraulic engineering during my tiime at Rijkswaterstaat.\nZN B Vaarwegen performs preservation, maintenance, and conservation of the channels in the southern provinces of the Netherlands, mostly Brabant and Limburg, and to the Meuse. Their work will contribute to a smooth and safe transportation over the water. Within each project, we work consciously of our environment and entire surroundings. This way, we tryto limit the hinder to transportation, recreational boating, businesses surrounding the waters, and residents. Communication is an important part of this. I also help with stakeholder analyses and negotiate with other governmental organizations about the surroundings of our projects and how we can team up as a community liaison.  \nSince November 2017 I advice the teams of ZN A Vaarwegen and Cluster Natte Centrales as well. Both these project teams handle maintenance, and building of (new) waterways, locks and bridges in the south of the Netherlands). It makes me incredibly proud to work on projects that contribute to the amazing way the Dutch handle their watermanagement, now and in the future.",
