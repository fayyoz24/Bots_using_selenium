This plan was followed up by 'Perron Geluk' 2022. With these plans, we worked on prevention themes such as loneliness, alcohol use, (thinking) sport/ movement and loss.\n\nMy role mainly involved supervising the implementation of these plans as a project leader. My team included 2 staff members, 60 volunteers and 3-4 interns from social work or applied gerontology. \n\nFurthermore, my PhD research began in 2020 in collaboration with Stichting Welzijn Lochem.",
