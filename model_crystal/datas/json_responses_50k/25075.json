    "summary": "Growing up with computers I have always been fascinated by the many things technology has brought us. Whether it's a video game, a complex algorithm or just a website: every piece of code has it's own story. Developers are often faced with complex (or very silly) puzzles and I love finding the best solution possible. \n\nDuring my bachelor I have focused on back-end and front-end. I love switching between them and writing code for communication between these two sides, such as REST interfaces. But in the end I like front-end development the most. It's very satisfying when a user successfully interacts with your product. I also love the visual aspect, which is why I have interests in UX and design. Whenever I have time off I enjoy designing websites. \n\nI have a huge affination for working with data since it requires skills from various fields. This is why I chose the biggest Statistics Bureau of the Netherlands as my first employer. With data I can always learn new things, whether it's Data Science or data visualization. \n\nMy goal is to always keep learning and to keep growing as a developer. It might be complex or extremely difficult, but it's never impossible!",
