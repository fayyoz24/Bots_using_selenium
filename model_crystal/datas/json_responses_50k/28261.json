    "summary": "I am a global management professional with 18+ years of experience driving business development operations. I am skilled in catapulting revenues and growing market share via strategic planning and delivery as well as creating and leading high performance teams. \n\nHaving lived and worked across 5 continents in Canada, Singapore, Spain, Brazil and the Netherlands and worked extensively in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, I have had the humbling and amazing opportunity of holding a variety of senior leadership roles in Account Management, Project Management, Biz Dev, Customer Success and Sales.\n\nAlong the way, I picked up a few languages which I can use at a full commercial level. Up until Covid I continued to travel extensively and strived to still find time to enjoy life with my wife, raise two kids and walk a Golden Retriever and Chocolate Labrador Retriever (now sadly gone).\n\nI moved back to Europe mid 2022 and chose the greatest and most dynamic tech hub (only second to London) on the continent as my home. \n\nAlways very interested in expanding my network so please feel free to reach out \n\nSpecialties: Team Culture | Team Transformation | Full Sales Lifecycle Management | e-Commerce Operations | Reporting | Employee Engagement | Customer Service Optimisation | Account Management | Business Partnerships | High-Impact Presentations | Stakeholder Relations | Negotiations | Coaching | Strategy Planning | Product Development | Market Management | Supplier Relations | Channel Management",

As their work grew and evolved over many decades, they learned that lasting change for children requires a plan for the entire community. In 2006, they simplified our name to Plan to better reflect how they work.\n\nToday, they are one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest international development agencies.\nNot for profit, independent and inclusive of all faiths and cultures, Plan has only one agenda: to improve the lives of children.\n\nI volunteered as a translator of their newsletter for members"
