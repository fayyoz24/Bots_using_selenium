    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd Hello, my name is Shardul Dixit. \n\n\ud83c\udf93 Master of Science: Work and Organizational Psychology, Maastricht University. \n\n\ud83c\udf01 I am passionate about employee experience, transformation and change, people analytics and much more. I enjoy exploring innovative and unique ways of adopting HR technology to make the employee cycle more efficient and reliable.   \n\n\ud83c\udf92My university projects and internship have successfully enabled me to develop an entrepreneurial and go-getter mindset. I am a result-driven and action-oriented person. I thrive in an environment with diverse perspectives where I can solve problems together with others. With my open, non-judgemental, and curious approach to life, I can quickly adapt and thrive in a new environment. \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 As for my future, I wish to enable organizations to base their strategies on research and data rather than on gut and intuition. I feel that in our quest to excel in science, technology, engineering and math, we often disregard its driving force- the employees. I aim to tackle this problem by actively incorporating psychological principles in organizational policies and enhancing the employee experience, thereby resulting in organizational success.  \n\n\u2615\ufe0f/\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 In my free time, you can find me at a cafe enjoying my book while appreciating a fresh brew of espresso. You would often find me cooking, travelling, or watching a movie on a random Sunday afternoon.",

Rejection sensitivity was measured using a pre-established Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire developed by Downey, G., & Feldman, S. I (2013) with good reliability and validity scores. Three t-tests were performed to determine if the difference between the obtained results is significant, out of which two were found to be significant at p= 0.08.",
