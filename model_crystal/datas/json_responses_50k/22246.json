    "summary": "Sustainable development is the future. A sustainable relationship between human society and the environment (ocean, animals, climate) is the core of this prospect. Since 2012, I have been enthusiastic about the interaction between human society and the ocean, including marine life protection, offshore resources exploitation, maritime disasters, etc. By employing social science methods, mostly quantitative methods (questionnaire, document coding, media analysis), I investigated how a sustainable relationship between human society and the ocean becomes possible. Besides my research interest, I am also well trained and experienced in teaching bachelor courses and supervising bachelor/master level thesis.  ",
