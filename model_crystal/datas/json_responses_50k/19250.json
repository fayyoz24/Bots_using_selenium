I later sold post cards made from the students' art together with the art itself, raising enough money for 40 students to go to school for a year. Furthermore, I expanded Suryodaya's means of communication by making a poster for the charity, advertising them at events, naming them on the products that came from my project, and intstilling them as my international school's designated charity.",
