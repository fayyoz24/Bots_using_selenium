            "description": "Understanding the meaning of emotions has been widely studied in different fields, such as psychology, marketing, or human-computer interactions. Emotions are not only important for human communications, but it is also critical for human interaction. The field of emotion recognition has existed for a long time, and results have been improving along with the increase in popularity. Recently, there has been an increasing tendency to use state-of-the-art computer vision approaches obtaining promising results predicting emotions using signals such as the audio or the video data. Inspired by this success, in the present work, we propose the realization of a study where we will focus on audio and video and the relationship between them by designing an audiovisual emotion recognition in the wild for small training sets. Contrary to other work that uses hand-crafted audio features, we focus on the automatic extraction of features from the raw audio waveform for the audio modality using CNNs. For the video modality, we use ResNet50. Finally, to take into account the temporal dimension of the video and the audio, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized. When creating the architecture, we try to limit the size of the model to the minimum to create a lightweight model that can be deployed in constrained computers as well. We manage to outperform the baseline for audio and video on the AFEW database. In addition to this, we improve emotion recognition by reducing the impact of one of the limitations in the field, the lack of adequately labelled data. Using a semi-supervised approach, we can use unlabeled data to train the multimodal network reaching a higher performance than the one obtained with the end-to-end model. ",
