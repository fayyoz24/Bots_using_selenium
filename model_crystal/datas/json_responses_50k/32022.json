We recognized a problem that Rotterdam as a city itself is not that well promoted, that is why people leave  and are not very much willing to get to know it. As simple as it is, people want to have everything ready when they go on vacation and the hassle of looking for things to do or places to go is unwanted. On the other end there is Miami which in which people tend to stay. Despite big differences between the two cities, we believe that Rotterdam might learn something from Miami experience. We had an opportunity to go to Miami to do our field research which contributed very well to our project. First of all it confirmed that the information that we have is correct, second we have made useful contacts and last we got forwarded to new sources that will be useful in our project later on. At the end of the project we will deliver a marketing plan in which ways and tools to reach our aim will be presented in detail.",

In this project I have gained experience in working in a team,  analytical skills and primary marketing skills. The main task of my team was to make an unpopular lithuanian magazine called \"Family's Health\" (\"\u0160eimos Sveikata\") more  popular. We had to figure out what people want to read in this kind of magazines and what makes them attractive to people mainly by interviewing people and asking their opinion. Therefore I have  learnt to extract relevant information, to evaluate it objectively from different points of view and to draw logical conclusions in the end.",
