    "summary": "> I am a trained architect and urban planner, but I have been transitioning to the field of data since 2016 \n with my master's and doctoral studies. I am highly specialized in urban analysis and have over 8 years \n of experience in research for real estate, planning, and urban development. However, I can work with \n analysis from various business areas.\n\n> I have participated in innovative research on sustainable housing developments and collaborative \n management through an application to improve community relations and ensure collaborative \n management. Currently, I am incorporating machine learning for predictive scenario building for \n development.\n\n> I have a good understanding of how to extract information from people through briefing techniques \n to assist in designing business problems that can be solved with the help of data. I use programming \n languages like Python, R, SQL, and spatial data analysis to analyze data.\n\n> As someone who views learning as a continuous skill and is always curious, I continue to learn about \n machine learning, statistics, and mathematics and how to present discoveries with data.\n\n> I always strive to optimize delivery and generate visual wealth through graphics and dashboards (data visualization), combining knowledge of aesthetics and graphic representation developed during my studies in Architecture.\n\ne-mail: emiliobertholdoneto@gmail.com \ntelephone and whatsapp - +5511939280397",
