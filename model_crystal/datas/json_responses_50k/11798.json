I founded this company to upscale the service concepts resulting from my Master\u2019s thesis project that I performed in London. With the company I successfully raised 20K funding for a pilot project with multiple organisations in Eindhoven including Salvation Army, Brainport and a regional mental health hospital.\n\n- Developed propositions for all levels of stakeholders including (ex-)homeless users, service professionals and management teams of care organisations\n- Worked closely with software developers to incorporate propositions into a messaging application\n- Rolled out the pilot service across organisations, service workers and clients for six months and evaluated its impact on positive behaviour changes",
