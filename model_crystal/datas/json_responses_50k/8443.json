    "summary": "Until early this year I was employed at the Athena Institute of the Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam, where I am assisting with the supervision of both Master and Bachelor Students, in various degree programmes, inclusive of International Public Health, Management, Policy Analysis and Entrepreneurship in Health and Life Sciences, and Global Health. The modules in which I am paricularly involved are the Disability and Neuropathy, Disability and Development, Human Rights and Ethics.\nAside from my work at the VU, on a very small scale I am continuing with my own consultancy and delivering training to health workers in Communication, Advocacy and Training Skills.\nAfter this I began working with Disability Studies in Nederland researching Inclusive/Participatory Research and Programme Design and Creative Research Methodologies for people with 'non-normative' communication skills.\n\nSpecialties: Communication;Training methodology; Behavioural Change strategies targeting community level; Participatory and Inclusive Research; Creative Research Methodologies",

Additionally, I have developed a passion for communication especially targeting health workers. A few years ago I developed a course 'Training and Communication Skills' that has been delivered for the past three years in Nepal (BIKASH, Training Centre, Pokhara) and also once in Ethiopia (ALERT Training Centre, Addis Abeba). This year, in March 2009, I assisted in the faciltiation of a Training of Trainers Programme in the Netherlands. The programme was designed and delivered by ENABLEMENT, NL, headed by Huib Cornelije, who has vast experience in the field of disability and in particular Community Based Rehabilitation. My primary concern is to contribute to the building of effective communication and training methodologies for those engaged in health and social sciences.",
