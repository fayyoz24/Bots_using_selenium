Besides developing marketing and communication plans, I was also actively involved in the day to day operations and decision making process.  \n\nFurthermore, I managed the website of LawJobs by providing job vacancies and also acted as an online mediator between employers and potential employees within this industry.\n\nSearching for personnel also became one of my tasks at LawJobs and during this process I took the role as a job interviewer.   \n\nFinally, another part of this internship was to write a bachelor thesis about the use of social media by LawJobs in the online vacancy market. More specifically, in this thesis my main objective was to determine if and how social media could give LawJobs a competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis their main rivals.",
