                    "description": "Client: iTV KPN Telecom B.V.\n\nWorked with Apps Squad, a team within iTV KPN. I did the set-up of a new test automation framework using the Robot Framework. Also used it to automate WebTV/PCTV. Tests were written using the Gherkin language. I also used to test the iTV mobile app on Android & iOS devices.\n\nAfter the Apps Squad, I joined STB Squad within the iTV KPN. I am still part of this team. The automation used in this team is a bit different than the regular automation of mobile & web apps. This team is responsible for the HTML releases used in the Set-Top Boxes. My task is to automate the different KPI scenarios for the set-top boxes. I am using a special tool known as StormTest developed by Accenture in order to do the automation. I used Python as a scripting language in StormTest.\n\nHighlights:\n- Test Automation Framework Set-up from Scratch.\n- Automation using Robot Framework & Gherkin for WebTV.\n- Weekly HTML Releases for Set Top Boxes.\n- STB Automation using StormTest by Accenture.",
