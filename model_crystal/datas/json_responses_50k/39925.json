    "summary": "Dutch remedial educationalist (University of Amsterdam, 1985) and a Psychotherapist (Dutch Academy for Psychotherapy 1995). I had my own practice in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and in Marseille, France where I treated mainly immigrants and refugees with psychosocial and psychological problems, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorders. From 2006 till 2009, I worked as a therapist for the Amsterdam Medical Centre, the University hospital. Between 2004 and 2018 I worked with non-governmental organizations (HealthNet and Radio La Benevolencija) within the domains of Sexual & Reproductive Health, Mental Health and Community Development in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Cambodia, Colombia and the African Great Lakes. Between 2014 and 2018 I was active as Head of Mission in Burundi and Rwanda. Since 2018 I am the co-founder of Culture 4 Change, an International Platform that aims to act as a bridge between research and the implementation of tailor made activities within the realms of mental health and psychosocial well-being.
