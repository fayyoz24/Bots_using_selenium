    "summary": "My experience working within several operations teams in a very successful, dynamic, multicultural, demanding and challenging environment taught me that operations are truly vital for the success of any business in any sector, big or small. \n\nAs a company grows and the business focus changes, there are always operational issues and risks to go along with the progress that it has made. Issues like complex processes, legacy, outdated systems, manual workload, scaling up, not having the right team with the right skills at the right time, the misalignment of expectations between the relevant stakeholders, the compliance risks and much more of the common operational challenges. These challenges if not dealt with properly, it will not only slow the business down but it will also affect the staff\u2019s ease of working in addition to the partners/customers experience.\n\nThe exposure to the several operations challenges during my career helped me to develop the right attitude and the necessary skills in order to manage these challenges successfully whether individually or within teams. I have been exposed to the majority of these issues in which I have found my passion in solving and gradually started seeking these challenges out. I am all about the eye for details, the innovative spirit, the continuous learning, the analytical and data driven mindset, the business awareness, the ruthless prioritisation, the resilient attitude, the servicing nature, the always on problem solving mode, the connection seeking, the leading passion and always doing the right thing attitude.\n\nPlease feel free to drop me a message, if you want to know more!",
