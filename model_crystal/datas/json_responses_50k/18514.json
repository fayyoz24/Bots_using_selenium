    "summary": "My life is driven by experiences, by trying new things, new solutions, and finding out what works and what doesn't. During the last 4 years, I was focused on transforming the skills and knowledge I have gained along the way into creating something new, something of great value for people I work with and people I work for. \n\nMy career milestones:\n\u27a1\ufe0f Moved away from Poland to build my future in 2013. \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Lived for last10+ years in various countries: Denmark, Scotland, Netherlands\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f 04.03.19 was a key day for me as I started my journey in IT by joining Texaport in Edinburgh\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f 08.06.20 was the second key day, as it opened doors to significant growth, both personal and professional at Eagle Eye Networks. In January 2022 I got promoted to L2 engineer which confirmed its the right place for me. I run training and supported internal and external stakeholders which gives me lots of joy and satisfaction \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f On 1st November 2022, I officially became the EMEA Technical Support POD Lead and I have been running the team since then. I have been active in other regions by helping with training curriculum, technical interviews and assist with creation and implementation of global process.\n\nA bit about me: I am an A+ and IPVM-certified, multi-skilled IT professional. I'm an enthusiastic fast learner with a strong desire to challenge myself every day. My biggest strength is a combination of a technical and analytical brain with a customer-focused heart. This collaboration allows me to understand the customer's perspective through empathy and address the issues they have raised in a professional and efficient manner. Currently, I educate myself about networking and cybersecurity within the cloud-based CCTV industry to build foundations for my next milestones.",
