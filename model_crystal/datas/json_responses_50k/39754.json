    "summary": "I have over 20 years of professional experience in managing inter-agency processes within social, licit drugs circulation and arms control, secure energy supply areas, as well as developing recommendations for improving national legislation and procedures in the areas I was responsible for. \nI have an extensive experience of working with intergovernmental sensitive politico-military issues in a international environment. As a member of the Lithuanian delegation, I regularly took part in the negotiations of different arms control-related documents, such as the UN Firearms Protocol, the OSCE Document on Small Arms and Lights Weapons and others. \nAt the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, I participated in the development of relevant documents in the framework of the UNSCR 1540 extra-budgetary project (from drafting project proposal and annual work plan to providing regular inputs for the Secretariat\u2019 management) and made a significant contribution to its successful implementation.  \nAs the OPCW Programme Officer in the International Cooperation and Assistance Division - the Organisation\u2019s capacity building hub for the design and delivery of programmes to ensure full global implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention - I conducted global and regional courses on different CWC\u2019s issues and contributed to raising awareness about it at national, regional and global levels. I applied Results-Based Management approach in programming, planning and monitoring of the Technical Secretariat\u2019 trainings and capacity building activities. \nApart from my Law Degree, I also did research in International Relations at Stockholm and Oslo Universities, successfully completed \"Leaders of the 21st Century\" course at G.Marshall College. \nI speak Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, English and my French is adequate to read professional literature.",
