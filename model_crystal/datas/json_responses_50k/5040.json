    "summary": "Experienced manager (commercial /operations / people / project / strategy) with a technical and innovation background (Ph.D. in Engineering), working in an operational business environment. \n\nI have been working and collaborated with multinationals, start-ups, R&D institutes, government agencies, engineering and consultancy firms in Europe, Africa and the Americas, working for Renewables, Oil & Gas, Infrastructure & Utilities projects, onshore and offshore. \n\nI bring lots of hands-on experience in management: operations, general, people and project management, change and crisis management. I have been engaged in M&A activities and have an affinity for the entire Mergers & Acquisitions process, including integrations and operational restructurings.\n\nBeing exposed to such divers and challenging environments, I have learned that success is an iterative process that can be achieved with high doses of proactivity, genuine leadership, EQ, cultural intelligence, adaptability and a passion for change. \nStrongly focused towards ensuring business strategies get well defined and implemented, that company mission and vision are attained, I am making use of my managerial skills to not only ensure smooth operations but to continuously improve. I strive to enable personal, professional and organisational growth through a balanced self-renewal and towards creating a safer sustainable future.",
