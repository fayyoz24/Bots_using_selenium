    "summary": "Arnold van Stuivenberg is the assistant dean of Stann Creek Ecumenical Junior College. He holds a M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics and a professional degree in Education from Utrecht University. His thesis focused on statistical modeling with neural networks. He started his career working at AKZO Research Laboratories (Arnhem - The Netherlands) and after arriving in Belize he got enrolled in teaching. For the past 26 years, Mr. van Stuivenberg has been a dedicated junior college teacher with a proven track record of commended performance teaching in CSEC Mathematics and CAPE Pure & Applied Mathematics. Many of his students obtained the \u201cBELIZE CAPE subject Award for Applied Mathematics\u201d for obtaining the highest score in Belize. He currently occupies the chair of ATLIB Mathematics. He is an advocate for a shift in math education from mathematical content to mathematical learning environments, where a whole range of processes take precedence: formal problem solving, use of heuristics, estimation and approximation, optimization, use of patterns, visualization, representation, reasoning and proof, making connections, mathematical communication. \n\nBeing the assistant dean, he enjoys working with staff and students to successfully (and precisely) organize events, complete administrative tasks, create agendas, and be a great advisor/resource person for the SCEJC family. He is passionate in making decisions that are data-driven \u2026 consequently he produces an annual statistical report for SCEJC encompassing numerous demographic and academic data indicators. His free time is spent with his family and reading predominantly astrophysics books.",
