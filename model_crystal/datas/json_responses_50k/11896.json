And we want to make fitness as accessible as possible.\n\nWe want to solve 3 problems\n1.The usage paradox: The fitness industry suffers from a basic dilemma \u2013 the more you use the services, the worse it is for the service provider. Because most services rely on subscriptions. We want to break this paradox. We WANT you to use us more.\n\n2.The accessibility bottleneck: Time and space constraints limit fitness to one (or two) activities. However, fitness and wellness is a combination of multiple aspects of your lifestyle. We want to make all these aspects accessible. We WANT you to explore.\n\n3.The cost fallacy: The cost of fitness is high artificially. We want to make serving so easy that service providers are able to reduce costs. We will use technology to democratize the industry, thus expanding the network while reducing costs. We WANT you to pay less.\n\nHow does this benefit suppliers?\n1.Higher occupancies: We will leverage idle capacity to make sure you don\u2019t have to rely on \u2018peak\u2019 seasons and times.\n\n2.Expansion possibilities: As users experiment, demand for alternative means grows. Our data and analytics will allow suppliers to find their niche and grow within.\n\n3.Higher share of voice: Our suppliers will get access to a never-before-seen social platform where they are not just passive shopkeepers, but active influencers.",
