Within the CSE sector, the Demolab offers our customers the possibility to get early access to the newest tools to get a head-start on their own production research. \nAs an application engineer I was responsible for the preparation and execution of customer demonstrations of ASML\u2019s latest hardware. This ranges from demonstrating the latest control mechanism (Baseliner) to specialised imaging upgrades (FlexRay and FlexWave) and demonstrations of ASML's latest tool: the EUV pre-production NXE:3100. \nTo support my work in the Demolab and broaden my knowledge within the lithograpy field, I've been involved in a variety of Developement&Engineering activities.",
