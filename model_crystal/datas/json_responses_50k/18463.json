The principal goal is to keep solid & efficient communication between the service and kitchen staff so that the service runs smoothly, and the guests have the best experience they could have.\n\n\nTHE DUCHESS has been awarded with one Michelin star for gastronomic recognition several years in a row since 2018.

THE DUCHESS resides in one of the best-kept historic gems, the former KAS Bank in W Hotel Amsterdam, providing guests with the elegance of traditional London hospitality balanced with Viennese grandeur.\nThe royal nature of THE DUCHESS is captured in the refined flavours from Southern France and Italy, known as Nouveau-Ni\u00e7oise Cuisine.
