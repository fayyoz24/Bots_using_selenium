    "summary": "My perspective as a designer is that at this moment timing is perfect to rediscover products and processes which are already existing. We should find ways on how to use these in the most optimal, sustainable way. With my projects I'm mostly researching existing production systems, and looking for ways on how to create innovative plans which companies can implement to make their product or process more durable. Waste is a great raw material, we just have to give it new value, and a new destination.\n\nSocial Design is another thing that keeps me busy. Using storytelling and human interaction to start a conversation, and create new insights makes me very much an encourager of doing field research in order to understand my projects, subjects and users.",

We arranged an outside event and made sure all the participating people would receive their own headphones. Outside there were three dj\u2019s playing, and the people could also request songs they\u2019d like to hear.\nWith these events we wanted to bring people joy during this difficult time, while obeying the governments rules and making sure there would be no noice nuisance.",

So why not get rid of it in a reusable way? Time to show the circular richness of production waste while closing the loop on big scale!\n\nWhile being asked to make new products out of PU waste material, Willeke Segers decided that it would be better to find ways to reuse the pristine PU waste material in the original production process. Out of her experiments and eventual collaboration with the company UNILIN, she developed two innovative approaches; \"adding\" and \"pressing\". These new circular production methods are created by reusing a waste stream of insulation material as raw materials. This approach shows how waste can flow back into production as new material, while adding value to the cycle. This also shows the value of waste.",

I noticed that when I was designing my own products, I could most of the times use the help of people who knew something about a specific material or method. Mostly these were people who were actually practicing their hobby at home, who taught me best.\n\nBuurtblik is both a travelling \u201cblikwerpkraam\u201d, and an online platform on which you can search for products which are made by your neighbours.\n\nThe purpose of this platform is to promote hobbyists, and to raise awareness for local production versus mass production. This awareness takes place because there is an overview of local hobbyists and their work on the online platform. We also continue to work in a sustainable manner\nas we exclude transport. You can pick up your lifestyle product at your neighbours, or ask if the neighbours can drop it off at your place.\nSocial cohesion is an important factor within the project. We connect neighbours in a new way, and at the same time they create a community of creatives themselves.",
