Among other things, I answered questions, took some pupils asides who needed extra assistance or an extra challenge, marked homework and tests and helped in the preparations for the musical. Every day, I was in a different grade ranging from grade four (seven/eight-years-olds) till grade eight (eleven/twelve-year-olds). Besides the regular tasks, I helped in the organisation of the UEFA Euro 2020 North Macedonia-Netherlands that we watched with the pupils and teachers from grades seven and eight at school and I went on a school trip to 2SUR5 where several outdoor activities were organised for the children."
