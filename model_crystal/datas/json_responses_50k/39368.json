    "summary": "Since 2014 my career focusses on Master Data activities, which has become a passion for me. I had the opportunity to work with multi skilled teams based across various countries. I have been able to use my knowledge and experience to help the companies I worked for to improve their Master Data activities and support harmonization and correct data access. Over the years I build up a vast experience in data & team management. All roles required a strong ability to be problem solving, manage complex situations and lead teams to success. What appealed to me about my roles is that it required me to be creative, social and interactive, manage teams and be highly self-starting and persistent.",
