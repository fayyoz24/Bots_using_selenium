Xbee modules were used for the transmission of data.\n\nMy role was to determine the optimal positioning of sensors on the copter and to analyse the air flow around copter using ANSYS CFX so as to ensure that air displaced by propellers doesn't affect sensors on this copter.This analysis is also applicable for successive copter models which houses pyranometers and ethilometers.\n",

A few algorithms currently used for pose estimation are Super4PCS, ICP and particle filter. These methods often do not capture the accurate ground truth pose, thus necessitating the investigation of deep learning algorithms which also tend to be a more generic solution.",
