    "summary": "Currently highly interested in transitions in society and its effects on work, I am thrilled by the multidisciplinary input of ecologists, behavioral scientists, historians, philosophers, artists, transition experts as well as grass root experiences which I use in the development of new (blended) courses on this theme for higher education students. \n\nWith a background in communication and social sciences, I started as an independent professional in 2001 with a focus on complex and innovative community development projects in Rotterdam and Amsterdam. After moving to Morocco in 2004, I dedicated myself to the initiation and development of Dutch Moroccan partnerships notably in the field of higher education and civil society sector. Besides building bridges between my two countries, I work as an expert in organisational development and capacity building in the civil society sector. I very much like the analysis part of this type of missions and the exchanges with all types of stakeholders about how moving forward as an organisation and how empowering individuals to make a meaningful contribution to society. In August 2018 I moved back to The Netherlands and started as a lecturer at the Saxion School for Human Resource Management in Enschede. This turned out to be a great career move. I am passionate about teaching and coaching young people during their first steps in their career, preparing them for the changing world of work.",
