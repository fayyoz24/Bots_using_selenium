    "summary": "It\u2019s in my blood to be service minded and to act on the customer\u2019s best interests. This was one of the main reasons to study international tourism with my major in international marketing. Eventually I\u2019ve combined two passions: customer interest/service with ICT. Up to the present day I have noticed that I have a different experience of customers than (ex) colleagues that are 100% ICT. I therefore excel on the line between ICT and business and have moved into information security and cyber security (2018). \n\nI believe in the new leadership where a manager is there to provide guidelines (vision and/or mission), support and coach to let the specialists and professionals excel at their jobs. I will ask the tough and annoying questions to help them see their broader picture of a situation and then let them do what they are good at, what they love, and enjoy.",

My largest project has been the market investigation to profile a hybrid SOC concept, which was then published and contracted through a European tender. The contracting was completed in December 2022 and the implementation of the hybrid SOC with a large MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) was initiated in January and completed in October of 2023. During the implementation it turned out that a data orchestrator was required to send the log data to the SIEM of SVB and the MSSP so we purchased and implemented that as well.",

This was not so much a technical challenge but more a people and processes one, yet it got done.
