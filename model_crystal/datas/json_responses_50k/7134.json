    "summary": "Although my formal education has been in the fields of aerospace engineering and spacecraft subsystems, I have always had a passion for all engineering fields, specially software and electronics engineering. As such I decided to pursue an education in the field of aerospace engineering due to its multi-disciplinary nature. However, this did not stop me from spending all of my free time on learning various skills required from software and electronics engineers; all of which make me a uniquely capable engineer in most fields of engineering. \n\nWith more than 10 years of experience in software development and six years of experience in electronics\ndesign and development, I am highly adept in taking a design from concept to production. My affinity with\nspace as well as complete comprehension of software development process, means that I have a better\nunderstanding of the requirements and preferences of the various engineering teams that are working on a project. Having studied or worked in the US, Canada and the Netherlands, I have grown \n accustomed to and can thrive in an international environment.",
