The shacks they were living in previously were very unstable and prone to collapsing in the rainy season. Together with 64 of my peers we traveled to Vietnam in order to not only build these houses but also to experience their culture and live among them. We were the first foreigners the locals on the island had ever seen and overall it was an incredibly rewarding experience. We also donated, and spent the day with disabled orphans that had been thrown out of their family\u2019s homes due to their disabilities. At first the situation took me aback and was honestly quite frightening, but I soon got over the initial shock of those poor forsaken children and had a heartwarming and truly unforgettable day with them."
