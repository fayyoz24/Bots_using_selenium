My experience of managing budgets, leading innovation, bidding for funding in the R&D space, and the complexities of stakeholder management with industry and academic institutions, comes from a background in the Maritime Industry and academia alongside EU R&D Projects. \nIt is this experience in the fields of composites and fluid structure interaction, in projects as diverse as aerospace, racing yachts, hydrofoils and aviation that enables me to assume technical leadership.",

The first - as winner of a UK DTI SMART Award Winner 2000 - for a feasibility study of the wave piercing and dynamic winged sailing yacht, involving extensive testing of composites for out of plane impact and the tank testing of a number of different wing configurations. The second - EU SAFECOMP 2002 - where we worked extensively with the Advanced Composites Group, testing a variety of low cost tooling methods for use with ACG's VTM low temperature series pre-pregs.\n\nThe result, the OUT95 racing yacht with a rigged displacement of less than 900kg (360kg ballast) for a 9.69m vessel.  The boat needed to be road transportable requiring the primary structure to be modular with removable wings.\n\nHull - carbon pre-preg/nomex honeycomb\nRudder - carbon pre-preg\nKeel - carbon pre-preg\nWing mast (2 part) - carbon pre-preg/nomex honeycomb\n\nSails were developed with Elvstrom Denmark using the wind tunnel facility at the Yacht Research Unit in Kiel. The primary focus of this work package was the optimsation of the mainsail roach profiles and headboard width. Secondarily, a number of close reaching headsails were tested. Following VPP analysis, the resulting selection enabled boat speeds in excess of 14 kts in just 8kts of true wind speed.\n\nFootnote:\nIn 2012-2013, development was continued with the addition of T-foils mounted on the wing tips to reduce dynamic displacement and increase righting moment. Needless to say, by reducing drag and increasing power, the results were impressive, and finally the America's Cup caught on..........",
