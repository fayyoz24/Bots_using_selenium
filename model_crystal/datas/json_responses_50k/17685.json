    "summary": "Ambitious person who loves to learn, travel, discover new places and find new adventures along the way. \n\nI have found that nothing satisfies me more than meeting new people, developing new relationships and experiencing more about people, cultures and languages every day. \n\nMy intellectual curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner. I have recently earned my BBA from TIO University of Applied Sciences, with an honours degree and graduate certificate in International Tourism Management. And I am currently earning my BSc from Utrecht University, with a graduate certificate in Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology. \n\nI enjoy seeing the world for myself and improving my vision and grip on reality. Furthermore, I find pleasure in dreaming big, reaching for new challenges and accomplishing life goals. So if you ever want to exchange ideas or experiences, please feel free to contact me: naomigroenendijk@hotmail.com",
