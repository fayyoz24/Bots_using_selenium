However, the estimation of a sound\u2019s location constitutes an ill-posed problem, which means that there are infinitely many potential solutions for the same spectral and temporal acoustic cues. In other words, from a mathematical point of view, accurate sound-localization should be impossible. Yet, humans usually localize sounds remarkably well. The auditory system, therefore, seems to carry a bag loaded with sophisticated tricks to do what it is supposed to, but through which neural mechanisms and strategies they accomplish this is still unclear. Using psychophysical experiments in humans, targeted intervention with the source and receiver, and neurocomputational models I addressed the mechanisms of sound source localization and learning in the auditory system. The results showed that :\n\n The auditory system performs a weighting operation on the entire sensory spectrum, in which the regions with the strongest spatial information content adopt the strongest weights. \n\n The auditory system has learned to adopt various non-acoustic priors about sound spectral and locations, and that these priors are under adaptive control. \n\n The auditory system reweighs its priors on sound spectra even in the absence of explicit feedback (such as visual feedback).\n\n The auditory system reweighs its internal priors regarding the binaural differences cues and monaural head-shadow cues.\n\nNeuro-biologically realistic models that incorporate Bayesian inference can account for the rich behavior observed in the human sound-localization responses.",
