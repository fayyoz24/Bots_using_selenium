    "summary": "A small story about my passion;\n\nWhen I was 18 years old I worked for one year as a repairman at a service point of Nokia. It was there that I realised what I wanted to do with my live. Everyday I got dosens of people complaining about small or big problems with their phones. At one point I realised that still so much could be improved about the usability of these electronic products.\n\nThats why I started to pursue a career in User Experience and Interaction design. During my studies Industrial Design Bachelor at the technical University of Eindhoven and Deisgn for Interaction Master at the Technical University of Delft, I have done various project in this field.During these 7 years of designing interactive products or installations in various projects, I acquired a specific skill set:\n\n_ I have strong knowledge of user-centered design.\n_ I can think creatively and have the ability to explore and solve complex user experience and interaction design problems.\n_ I\u2019m able to work in an agile (rapid and iterative) product design and development context\n_ I have the ability to facilitate requirements gathering, ideation and collaborative workshops with stakeholders and users; I have strong communication skills with technical and non-technical people.\n_ And I am always enthusiastic for working collaboratively with other user experience designers, information architects, graphic designers, researchers, developers, and team members.\n\nAs a designer my vision is that technologies can enhance a humans life but only when it is designed with the right goals in mind.\n\nwww.memberservicedesign.com\n\nUser Experience Design   ///   Interaction Design   ///   User-centered Design   ///   Service Design",
