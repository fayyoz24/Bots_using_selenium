    "summary": "Even though my studies were firstly focused on Computer Science and Bioinformatics, sooner or later, I found out how much I am enchanted with Business and Management. Just a few clicks away (being tech-savvy helped but keep it secret!) I discovered that learning how to operate a biological venture (be it a pharmaceutical one or a biotechnological one) is my ever-dream and I have to pursue it.\n\nI frankly believe that each enterprise -regardless of its scale- has a unique story to tell. Whether it is a newly emerged start-up or a firmly established multinational, each one was first an idea, which was initially believed by its founders and then, it was trusted by its clientele. Most entrepreneurs agree that there is no perfect recipe for a company to thrive. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that what is really needed is just to be confident and not to give up on any upcoming hindrance.\n\nBearing knowledge in the epicenter of Informatics, Mathematics as well as Biology, and after working committedly on my assignment for the course \u201cEntrepreneurship & Innovation'', I particularly deducted that digitalization is more than powerful to drive innovations and to help a company bloom, as well. In reference to that assignment, I virtually established from scratch a pioneering fast-food enterprise selling homemade artisanal fast-food. Nevertheless, it is a matter of fact that a company is based on teamwork, and as such, each member should possess a strategic and meticulous mindset for the sake of the firm's prosperity.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading books, discovering new coffee places or traveling around taking stunning photographs. Oh, and by the way, feel free to suggest to me which should be my next must-go destination.\n\nInterests: Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Business Logic, Causal Inference, Bioinformatics, Genetics\nSkills: (Bio-)Statistics, Statistical Quality Control & Systems Reliability, Numerical Analysis, Systems & Molecular Biology, Java",

And that\u2019s because I worked for the first carbon-negative vegan ice cream start-up in Greece, a strenuous yet delightful work!\n\nMy daily tasks included the communication with all partners (small businesses and corporations included as well) to make the deal on the prices and the quantities of all our products that they would be provided with as well as the communication with all suppliers to agree on what merchandise and in what prices our start-up needed. Additionally, I was appointed as the social media and all communication channels manager engaging in conversations with customers, colleagues and suppliers even about any complaints and unforeseen difficulties. Equally important was the discovery and communication with various sweet spots, food and beverages stores as well as restaurants to propose partnerships and provide details about our frozen products.\n\nTasks' list also entailed organizing and regulating the network of daily delivers of our products within and outside our headquarters\u2019 district, even in Greek islands and other remote Greek regions. Furthermore, I worked on our start-up\u2019s involvement in festivals and many other festive activities for children, youngsters and adults. \n\nIf though I had to underline a very particular assignment that I am frankly and boldly proud of, that would be the launch of the first carbon-negative vegan ice cream store in the historic center of Athens, Greece, entirely and solely offering vegan and artisanal delights and ice cream and enchanting coffee. Particularly, in close cooperation with the CEO of the start-up, I took care of everything a store needs to be fully operational, namely from the design and the decoration to the equipment needed as well as the search for staff, so that I could ensure that all customers would be exceptionally assisted and fully satisfied.",
