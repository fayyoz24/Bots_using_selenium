    "summary": "Explainer animations, strategy visualizations, educational comics, commercial storyboards: they all tell a story.\nVisual Storytelling is a the heart of what I create. Every story feels like a new journey to discover the tone of voice, style and design that fits your story and your audience. We share the same goal: to immerse your audience in your world, your vision.\n\nDuring the creation process, I keep an overview of the main story and regularly take a step back: is the message clear? How does this image fit in the flow of the story? Does it match the target audience? Sketch, write, build and correct, until all pieces of the puzzle connect together. I believe that text and image should create a synergy, where they mutually strengthen each other. I\u2019m looking forward to visualize your story.",
