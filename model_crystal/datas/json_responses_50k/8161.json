    "summary": "As an interdisciplinary designer, cultural worker, and part time map-maker, my work centers around subverting dominant narratives about people and their relationship to place with a special interest with communities from tropical environments. With an academic background in sociology and art, I am interested in how artistic processes can provide creative interventions to social problems. My interest in the design has led me to artistic projects from Italy, Oregon and Massachusetts, to the Philippines, and to Taiwan.\nI specialize in creative qualitative research as well as the design of workshops, programming, events, and community development.\nVisit my art portfolio at: https://cara-cecilia-flores.myportfolio.com/",
