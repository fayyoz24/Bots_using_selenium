    "summary": "As a former academic researcher, with over 20 years of experience in product development, publishing, and academic & governmental relations, I have ample experience in building and maintaining networks around the globe (e.g. US, Europe, China, Japan, Brazil, Australia-NZ). These personal interactions allow me to acquire a deep-insight into a customer experience and consequently turn opportunities or concerns into new (or improved) products or services (from conception to product launch). \n\nI thrive on setting out long term global strategies with regards to outreach, networking, growth and revenue. I have extensive experience in leading international teams working at various locations and have a strong focus on people development. I work well under pressure, am very much result-driven and I have a passion for winning. \n\n \n",
