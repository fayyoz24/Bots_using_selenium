    "summary": "I have worked in the wind energy business for more than 19 years. I started in USA with onshore project development and moved to the Netherlands to dive into the technology of offshore wind turbines at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).  Afterwards I spent 6 years at DNV GL, as part of the Turbine Engineering Support team, consulting on Operation & Maintenance, reliability and their impact on Cost of Energy for onshore and offshore wind turbine technologies.  I felt the need to learn more about the operational side of the business and that took me to Ingka Investments, where I was responsible for managing the operation of IKEA's renewable energy portfolio in different countries, working closely with the acquisitions team in contract negotiations, handover of projects to construction and to operational phases, and as the portfolio grew, working together with the team to transform the asset management strategy to increase the profitability of the portfolio.\nCurrently at Shell New Energies I am working together with Shell's internal and external collaborations to drive forward new technologies and research initiatives that positively impact the offshore wind turbine performance, Operation & Maintenance, and therefore Cost of Energy.\n\nI consider myself to be an analytical person with a strong technical and commercial background. I believe my career in wind energy gives me strong qualifications and skills to interact with different stakeholders to renewable energy assets, to provide strategic advice, to communicate technical aspects and to report to different audiences.",
