Representing the Netherlands, the students were divided into separate companies comprising of international students 10 other countries: USA, Portugal, China, UAE, Indonesia, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Finland and Russia.\n\nThe students had to create a virtual company to compete against each other on an internally administrated market place, selling technological products across the world. The company required financial control, human resource management, logistical management, sales, marketing, production and market research and analyses.\n\nMy responsibilities as team manager and CEO of the company was to establish a vision and direction in which our virtual organisation would operate. In addition, I was responsible for analysing the market performance and conduct a competitive analysis to identify whether or not our business was operating as intended, ensuring market penetration in the technology industry. My leadership ensured all group members had the required tools and guidance to conduct business operations.\n\nThe event was a large scale social experiment, as we were placed into diverse groups comprising of various nationalities and educational backgrounds. We had to function and collaborate together as a single unit competing for consumer awareness and profits",
