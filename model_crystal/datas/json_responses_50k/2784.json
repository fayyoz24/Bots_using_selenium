    "summary": "Petra Ardai is a theatre-maker, scenario writer, and science communication professional. She is the artistic director of the SPACE rooted in Amsterdam and Budapest. Petra's background is in documentary theatre. She creates immersive storytelling experiences in various media, like live games, interactive performances, multimedia installations, online art, heritage apps and podcasts. Petra is specialised in (future) scenario\u2019s of radical changes and builds imaginary worlds around the question: \u2018Who owns the Future?\u2019 \nThe narratives of the projects balance on the border between fiction and reality, making complex social issues relatable in an intensely intimate but playful manner. Topics such as polarisation, inequality, migration, unprocessed historical past and climate change are brought close through the politics of the personal. \nPetra collaborates with cross-sector partners from the field of art, science and NGO\u2019s.\nPetra is advisor at the Amsterdam Fund for the Arts (AFK), founding and board member of Plurality U+, a global diverse and open network to mobilise the resources of the imaginary to widen space of thinkable alternative futures.",

Over the next two years, in collaboration with the VU University Amsterdam and international partners, SPACE is developing and researching a storytelling format that brings people from diverse backgrounds into dialogue with each other around current polarising themes. Central to this is listening to the voice of the other, to people but also to other life forms such as the animals and landscapes around us. \nSPACE - Explorers of the Continuous Present is an internationally oriented art initiative, headquartered in Amsterdam. Based on the belief that art can question dominant narratives.\nSPACE focuses on artistic, theatrical research into complex social issues. SPACE develops immersive, activist art experiences that bring together theatre, spoken word, experience design and visual art. \nOver the next two years, artistic director Petra Ardai and spoken word artist J\u00f6rgen Gario, together with artists, writers and activists in the Netherlands, France, Hungary and Slovakia, will produce story circles with young people, policymakers, prisoners, migrants, farmers, politicians and anyone who wants to lend an ear.\nAll the stories, conceived by different communities, will appear online, accompanied by drawings by Stella de Kort. VU University's Faculty of Social Sciences is conducting an impact study, the results of which will be published in late 2024.\nFor more information and news: www.spaceexplorers.nl\nCGD is funded by Creative Europe and is a collaboration of:\nWe Are Space (NL), Vrije Universiteit (NL), Subjective Values Foundation (HU),Plurality University Network (FR) and Divadeln\u00e1 Nitra Festival (SL)\nAssociate partners: Tolhuistuin, Sztorim\u00fchely, Karrewiel, Climate CleanUp, Baltan Laboratories, F\u00dcGE Productions, Plateau Urbain",

SPACE and the public have to set up the first model colony on the red planet.\nThe theatre is the spaceship and the span of the performance covers 9 months, the time it takes to travel to Mars. The powerful video installation taking up the total width of the stage is an important element of SOS EARTH \u2013 99 % resilient.\nEleven people, who in real life had to flee from their home countries and currently live in The Netherlands, reflect on fear and resilience in a striking kaleidoscope of personal experiences.\nArdai has assigned a special role to these eleven people in her dramaturgy: they are The Council, a group of experts with a true understanding of what it means to leave all what is familiar behind and face an unknown future. The Council supports the audience in their preparation, to become resilient for the upcoming \u2018interplanetary human migration\u2019, the new life ahead and the designing of a blueprint for a new, fair and sustainable society on the unknown planet.\nWhile focusing on real, existing social issues SOS EARTH - 99% resilient evolves around hope.\nOn Mars humanity can reinvent itself. Humanity can make a step in the evolution and figure out how to shape this second chance.\n\u201eWho owns the future?\u201c is a relevant question that connects the fictitious and documentary line of the narrative. The emptiness of the red planet shows us that we need to be inclusive to be able to survive.

STATS is an interactive meeting point in the public space that shows the vibe of the (city) surroundings through real time statistics and invite the public to a dialogue.\n\nIn the press:  \n\n\"The documentary theatre of Stats is no doubt fascinating. The sheer numbers of  how much people drink, eat, spend on social media, transpire, visit prostitutes or are a prostitute, scam insurances, indulge on Facebook or visit dating sites is dizzying: sometimes the numbers go up to billions and they just keep on spinning. These 'real time statistics' have a beneficent effect on the audience: you realize that as an individual you are a part of this amazing machinery that is called humanity.(...)\"\n\n@Theaterkrant, July 2014\n\nConcept: SPACE Text: Petra Ardai Research: Marike Splint  Dramaturgy: Anna Veress, Felix Ritter, Marike Splint Set- en graphic design: Rozi Szeleczki Data design en programming: Billy Schonenberg Sound and technical support: Luc van Loo Performers (additional moderation): Marta Pisco, Petra Ardai, Luc van Loo Management: Nora Duijf\nSTATS is a collaboration with the Rotterdamse Schouwburg for Imagine 2020. www.imagine2020.eu",

But where to start? How to find tools and collective mechanisms to anticipate and adapt to transformations needed? To figure out novel directions for change, they need to be imagined: and the journey begins with individual and collective imaginaries.\n\nIn academia, the arts, politics, science, or grassroots movements, calls for \u201cnew narratives\u201d and for the \u201crenewal\u201d or \u201cliberation\u201d of imaginaries express a shared intuition: that any significant transition towards different and hopefully better futures, requires the ability to question inherited meanings, values, representations and finalities, and imagine completely new worlds and new ways of functioning. The Plurality University Network works towards putting these intuitions into action by creating the conditions for the emergence of new imaginaries, alternatives for action, and common paths for future transitions.",
