Besides keeping track of time, cost and risk, my main task was to manage the relationship with customers.\n\nTwo projects from this period of my career have stayed with me in particular. My collaborations with Ericsson in Kumla in Sweden and Jabil in \u201cT-Town\u201d in Hungary have been especially gratifying. Both customers were of Key Importance to Assembl\u00e9on due to their application and highly demanding production requirements. Establishing a long term partnership between Assembl\u00e9on and these two factories is a result I am very satisfied with.",
