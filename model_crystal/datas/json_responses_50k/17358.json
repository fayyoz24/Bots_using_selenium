Besides this we also implemented a Server Based Computer farm to host proximately 1000 users.\nDuring this project I wrote a lot of scripts to make the actual migration as smooth as possible. I build the cluster and did a lot of other things to complete the migration and not to forget I wrote the concept of the migration plan. And as everybody, nobody can do this alone, we did this as a team and we did a very good job.",

Now I'm keeping the overview of the project and in that role I'm the teamlead of the building team.\n\nThe indepth troubleshooting of SCCM 2012, App-V, Windows 7, SCVMM, Hyper-v server 2008 R2 SP1, XenApp 6.5 and XenDesktop and the overview makes this a very complex but most challenging project.\n\nThe migration and integration of the daughter company MVVL (Martinair Flight Academy) was a part of the project. At the end I was able to successfully tranfer the environment to the new administration party. \n\nLooking back at the project, it was a lot of work in a pretty short periode of time and I'm proud the result. Some things can always be better but it is at least the quality Martinair asked and needs to be in business.",
