    "summary": "I'm a Product Owner for NPI D&E Sequence Engineering at ASML since January 1, 2023. Within one roadmap, within a team, I ensures partial product delivery. I handle relationships with stakeholders on an operational level as part of my planning and prioritizing and stakeholder management work. In addition, I collaborate with the Manager to make decisions based on priorities for efficient product back log management, what has been done and what has not been done by following the rules of Agile/Scrum.\n\nPast\nI worked as an experienced mechanical and test sequence engineer for ASML from 2017 through and including 2022.  In the semiconductors sector, I learn a lot.  I had experience with SAPME, Indicenter, Arbotekst, the Graphical Routing Editor, the Automatic Recovery Engine, and other SAP/ASML applications in this position. I gained a lot of knowledge about D&E methods and thoughts while working as a sequence engineer. For instance, the need of delivering quality, gaining cycle time, improving procedures, time management, persuading without using force, delivering on schedule, and responding to escalations, among other things. I delivered sequences as a sequence engineer for pilot systems, upgrades, and recoveries. For assy's, fasy, test, prepack, and installation. \n\nPast\nI've been employed with ASML since 2010. I began working in the cleanroom as an operator. I assisted in the dismantling of ASML systems as an operator. I frequently traveled to the customers' sides in Israel and the United States of America throughout my time at Prepack.  I was promoted to Prepack Coordinator after two years. As prepack coordinator, I oversaw the prepack process and was in charge of up to six operators. After working as a coordinator for two years, I wanted to challenge myself even more, so I returned to school, and in 2018 I received my Ir. Industrial Engineer (HBO) degree. After transferring to D&E, I was hired as a sequence engineer by the D&E PI DUV Industrialization department in 2018.",
