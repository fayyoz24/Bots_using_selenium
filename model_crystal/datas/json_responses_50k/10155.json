In my 7 years of experience, I\u2019ve photographed over 150 portrait sessions, 15 weddings, and 20+ stylized commercial and lifestyle shoots. I pride myself in my participatory creative process\u2014I coordinated with clients from every stage of the creative process, from conceptualizing the project, empowering them to feel comfortable and confident during the shoot, the editing process, and delivery of the final product. I also managed the logistic communications, including scheduling consultations, photoshoot details, invoices, deposit/payment status, contract completion, and other relevant details.\n While I started my photography business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I\u2019ve have had the privilege to work on projects in Los Angeles, Chicago, and even Taiwan. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve been able to apply these creative story-telling skills in other aspects of my work and research as well.",
