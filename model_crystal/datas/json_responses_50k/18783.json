For me, it is extremely crucial to take advantage over the opportunities provided, and place as much effort as possible into them, to avoid regretting the chances you didn\u2019t take in the future.\n\nNonetheless, if I had to describe myself in three words it would be; Passionate, Dedicated and Open Minded.\n\nFor instance, to showcase my passion towards digital marketing, I had decided to become a content creator on TikTok (@74ka_gr). Whereby, I would utilize the diverse sets of knowledge/ skills and experiences from my bachelors degree in Marketing Management to optimize my contents. \n\nMy career ambition would be\u2026\n\u201cTo become a successful digital marketer packed with extensive knowledge and experience\u201d",

Essentially, at the beginning, it was a struggle to gain followers due to the lack of consistency and account associations. Therefore, I had decided to determine my niche target group based on the contents which performed the best, taking into account TikTok's analytics and insights. This way it would then be possible to determine the types of viewers who are interested in which specific type of topics and to create content tailored towards the viewer's demand. Eventually, the main target group formed was Thai users ages 16 and above who are interested in studying English. However, as the main target group has been established sub target groups had also been formed to gain additional source of followers. In this case the added contents were contents related to studying abroad and conspiracy theories. Ideally, the key achievement from this experience is the exponential increase in followers from 20K in 2020 to 313K in 2021 (as of 20 / Oct/ 2021).\n\nThis is the link to my TikTok account \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@74ka_gr?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc",

During the client briefing, Peek had informed that their main question was \"How can the current CDI Peek platform take a next step to a blended (partially e-commerce) platform?\". Alongside Peek had also requested to seek out solutions to solve the extremely high logistics costs. As the market researcher within the project I was responsible in determining the potential  Business to Customers and Business to Business for Peek. Essentially, I performed an external analysis on the African market in terms of the internet penetration rates, mobile payment adoptions, imports and exports of South African consumers goods, and a competitor analysis on successful African e-commerce platforms such as Jumia and takealot.com. By identifying the current trends within Africa made it possible to determine the potential Business to customers countries in which Peek could penetrate into being; Libya and Mauritius. On the other hand, advice was also provided for Peek to scale up to China once the e-commerce platform has been established. The substantiation for this advice was based on the analysis that within China there was a high demand for handicrafts taking into the total amount of users accessing the handicrafts e-commerce platforms within China.  Nonetheless, I was also responsible in the customer journey optimization process, whereby I interpreted the current Peek platform design taking into account the three phases of the sales funnel; awareness, consideration purchase.",
