    "summary": "As a progressive designer, I am passionate about exploring the boundaries of design through the use of adventurous methodologies, emerging technologies, and sensory qualities that enhance the user experience. I am particularly interested in the intersection of design and artificial intelligence, and I have been exploring the use of food and speech as design mediums in my recent projects.\n\nOne defining characteristic of my design process is my open-mindedness. I am willing to take risks and spend more time exploring, experimenting, and working in an unstructured manner in order to achieve the greatest iteration, innovation, and development in my projects. I am also committed to adopting a collaborative mindset as a designer, focusing on usability, accessibility, and functionality for users.\n\nIn addition to my interests in AI and user experience, I am also passionate about branding, visualisation, graphic design, and entrepreneurship. I believe that these disciplines are crucial for creating impactful and successful design projects, and I am constantly seeking new opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge in these areas. I am excited to continue exploring these interests and bringing my unique perspective to the world of design.",
