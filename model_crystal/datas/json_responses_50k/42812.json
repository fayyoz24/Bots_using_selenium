    "summary": "I started my professional journey dedicated to impacting the lives of children and teens as an educator. As I worked closely with students, I realized the larger socioeconomical barriers they faced on a day-to-day basis within their schools, home lives, and communities created obstacles that would not only impact their individual learning and opportunities, but also limit the economic and cultural vitality of an entire region. Therefore, in order to make a difference in future generations' lives, I've decided to change trajectories so that I may focus on more leadership positions, research roles, and policy-making initiatives to create a more equitable society for students to thrive in. By pursuing my Master of Arts in History and now a Master of Science in Data Science degree, I have gained valuable research and presentation skills within a multidisciplinary field, studying not only history, but politics, foreign policy, culture, economics, data analysis, data visualization, and social science; I hope to use these skills to develop public policy initiatives, or participate with organizations/businesses that aid in improving our society.",
