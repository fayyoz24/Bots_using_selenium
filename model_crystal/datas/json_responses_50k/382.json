    "summary": "Passionate about empowering a new generation of feminine leadership, through identity empowerment and ancestral wisdom. A firm believer that solutions to the challenges that many individuals, organisations and societies are facing today can be found in ancient tribal wisdom. A life-long learner and researcher, always reading a least 2 books at a time and perpetually getting lost in research articles.\nI am also an intercultural, strategic connector with a passion for identifying unforeseen synergies.\n50% Dutch 50% Persian. 100% proud solo mother of 3 teenage sons.\nFluent in Dutch, English, Farsi, Spanish and impact diplomacy. On a conversational level: Arabic, French and German\u2026.\n\nAs a certified executive mentor, I work with women of colour, on the intersection of cultural identity, professional leadership and personal development through the nush:u mentorship programme. Acting as an external sounding board for professional women of colour, empowering them to unlock their full potential, reaching their aspired roles as their authentic selves, not despite of their multi-faceted identities but because of their multi-faceted identity and unique origin story.\n\nAs co-founder of the human-innovation design collective Asei-Salehi I work together with Steven Asei-Dantoni Nku\u00e9 on re-imagining systems and constructs within organisations through human innovation and corporate anthropology. Putting humanity at the core of business to improve employee wellbeing, team cohesion, retention and performance.\n\nAs a keynote speaker and guest lecturer I cover topics such as feminine leadership, identity empowerment and corporate anthropology. On request, I share my vision on D, E & I from a design thinking perspective.\nAs a moderator I facilitate symposiums as well as complex stakeholder dialogue sessions. My background in constructing multidisciplinary consortiums (at OMA/AMO, architecture/urban design), contract negotiations (between Dutch and MENA based companies), as well as catalysing public-private coalitions for social impact (Coalitions for Impact) have equipped me with an unique array of knowledge and competencies to successfully take any multilayered stakeholder impasse to a next level.\n",
