Miami Beach Square involves bringing to life one of Miami Beach\u2019s most underutilized public sites with a fully-revamped convention center capable of luring major events from around the world, inviting green spaces, and cultural venues. Miami Beach Square serves as the pivoting point for all activities around it. \n\nThe main streets are connected across the square for pedestrians and bicycles \u2013 and vehicular access. The Soundscape is connected across the square to The Botanical Gardens and the Holocaust memorial. Pennsylvania Avenue is connected across the square to Convention Center Boulevard. The shortcuts and connections define an urban block structure of building and landscapes.\n\nRather than a great green empty void, the public realm is programmed by patches of landscapes and buildings connected by plazas and paths. Some of the patches of park are peeled open to accommodate for small-scale community owned businesses: a shake shack, a bike rental, a small gallery.",

In order to accommodate both local and foreign visitors, the approach to this park design requires correlating multiple design priorities.\n\nThis park represents different stories about Taiwanese daily life, and the richness of Taiwan's natural environment. It renders visible a unique local history, and nourishes the potential of cultural life in the presence of a powerfully iconic tower, two major museums and a movie center and a commercial and business center.\n\nThe design of the park is divided into six areas with distinct atmospheres; The Orchard, The Babylon Stones, The Cascading Waters, The Bouquet of Culture, The sport facilities and The Wetland Gardens. Arrayed in sequence, they gradually blend into one big linear park with a total length of 2.5km. Flowing and retaining water is one of the key themes of the park, stitching together the different atmospheres of the park with bodies of water, further creating the illusion of the Taiwanese landscape with swift cascades, gentle creeks, a meandering forest river and striking reflection ponds.",

During the last few decades the city has been plagued by a steady decline in population, a neglected innercity and the loss of its relation to the surrounding sea. The task ahead for Den Helder is to rethink her content and character as a Maritime City.\n\nIn our design to revitalize the city centre of Den Helder and reposition it towards the sea, we proposed several key objectives. In the city center our main ambition is to restore the existing urban tissue, housing and public space, densifying the existing commercial program and the addition of a central park. Our ambitions for the harbor and its docks is to develop a full-fledged and complete city quarter with a mix of functions, dwellings, commercial and recreation. Central to this development is the embedding of a strong cultural program, spearheaded by the development of a new theater at the former naval base.\n\nSince West 8's involvement of the project from 2006 there are several milestones achived in the course of years. One of the first projects that has been delivered was the new Stadspark completed in 2009, characterized by its prominent trees. The elms are planted in an eight degree angle, as if they were formed by the onshore wind. It refers to the leaning trees that can be found in the surrounding landscape of Den Helder. \n\nIn 2014 the Beatrixstraat, the city centre's shopping area regeneration project has been completed and at the former naval yard Willemsoord, a new City Theatre was also opened in 2015. in May 2016 a re-programmed liburary building SCHOOL 7 has been opened also and forms another catalyst in the new city center of Den Helder. \n",
