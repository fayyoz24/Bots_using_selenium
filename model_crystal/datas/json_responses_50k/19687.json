    "summary": "Jasper van Luijk (1987) studied dance at the ArtEZ Dance Academy. When he was only 24 years old he was selected by Korzo to participate in the event Voorjaarsontwaken 2011 to create a choreography. This resulted in the piece Too many new beginnings, which was very well received.\n\nCommissioned by Korzo productions he created the duet About There and Here which premiered during the Holland Dance Festival 2012. In the same season he created commissions for Brand New #3 (co-production Conny Janssen Danst and Dansateliers) and Festival a/d Werf. In 2012 Jasper received the ITs Choreography Award, a price for graduating talent in choreography. After his graduation, he decided to focus on choreography full-time. With Korzo, he created work for Here we live and now 2012, 2013, and CaDance 2013 and 2015. Quite Discontinuous originated at Generale Oost and Dansateliers and was selected for the Dance Roads tour to places such as Canada, Turin, and Bordeaux. Between 2015 and 2017, Jasper was supported by Korzo Productions, MAAS Theater & Dance, De Nieuwe Oost and Het Huis Utrecht. Highlights from the past year are the solo performances Yonder and The Definition of Now in theatres, and the youth performances Kraai (Oerol Festival) and Happily Ever After.\nIn 2015 he received nominations for the BNG New Makers Award and the prize of the Nederlandse Dansdagen.\n\nIn 2017 he started the Utrecht based company SHIFFT, together with business manager Lisa Donia. SHIFFT is a dance company and creative hub based in the heart of Utrecht. A young and ambitious dance company, dedicated firmly to the here and now. The productions we create often flirt with new media such as the combination between dance and live photography and digital space design. In addition to creating and producing dance productions, we organise a range of activities aimed at development, encounter and reflection.\n\nwww.shifftutrecht.com ",
