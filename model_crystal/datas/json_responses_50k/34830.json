    "summary": "I am a scientific publishing professional with project management, relationship building, and academic research experience. \n\nDuring my PhD I became interested in academic publishing and have since worked for the Parliamentary of Science and Technology in London, Cambridge University Press, and Elsevier in various editorial roles. Since January 2021 I have been working at Leiden University Library supporting medical researchers with open access publishing and open science pursuits.\n\nI graduated with a degree in Archaeology and English Literature from Memorial University of Newfoundland, and continued on to complete an MPhil and PhD in Archaeological Science at the University of Cambridge. Most of my academic work has involved coastal societies and maritime archaeology. My research has included  isotopic analysis of fish bones to study trade routes and computer simulation of Viking ships on the open ocean to understand Viking Age navigation. I have taken part in fieldwork in diverse locations ranging from the Jotunheimen mountains in Norway to the pyramids at Giza in Egypt.",
