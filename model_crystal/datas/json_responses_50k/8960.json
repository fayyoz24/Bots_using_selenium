Each student was put in a group divided over five different cases (around 5 groups per case).\nIn my case this was a car exhaust manufacturer who saw several market developments, each with its own pros and cons. The task of the students was to (based on research and assumptions) form recommendations and a final advice. The recommendations were then presented to the group handling the same case and a winner was chosen. After this, each winner of each case competed against each other for the overall 'victory.' In December 2012, this was me and my group.",
