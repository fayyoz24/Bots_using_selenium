    "summary": "At a very early age I was already interested in aerospace and passionate about technology, which has not changed since. I am eager to learn something new and I am very motivated to understand the way things work. During my BSc I enjoyed working in team projects, while in my MSc I took a special interest in the control and simulation part of the aerospace sector. In addition, during a year on the board of a student volleyball association, I gained valuable experiences in dealing with a lot of responsibilities.\n\nI recently completed my Master's degree in Control & Simulation, and I am currently looking for a challenging engineering position within a motivated team where I can apply and improve my knowledge of autonomous control systems, human-machine interaction, and simulation software. Next to software programming I would also like to work with hardware.",
