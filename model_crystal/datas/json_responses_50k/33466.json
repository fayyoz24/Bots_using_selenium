We strongly believe that there is plenty of unused potential among refugees, recent migrants and young unemployed Europeans. Enabling more people to enter the world of entrepreneurship will not only benefit individuals but society as a whole. \n\nAs pre-incubator program we open our space to people that do not yet have a business idea or a functioning team and provide them with the opportunity to overcome these entry hurdles. Besides teaching tools of design thinking and the lean startup, we also work with our students on their self-development. In several weeks students will learn all that it takes to build a solid business idea based on their passion, to engage with real customers, to prototype their ideas and to pitch their solutions to a jury of experts. It is DELITLABS mission to get potential entrepreneurs to the starting line and to empower them to run their race. \n\nFor more information please consult: www.delitelabs.com and find us on facebook.",
