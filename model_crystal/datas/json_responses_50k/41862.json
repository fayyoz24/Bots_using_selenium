The Program Manager had already met with many stakeholders and found support for the idea but we needed to define the concept behind the user experience, the roadmap, the technical architecture, the front-end delivery system, and extend the design system component library with stunning visual elements.\n\nThe new intranet would have to support a wide variety of users, from flight attendants to engineers and HR staff. We proposed a concept where highlights of relevant content as well as the status of work-tools were shown as cards on a dashboard, with both types giving access to more details. This concept meant that other applications would slowly have to change technically (including provisioning APIs) and adopt design principles to create one seamless experience. We also merged our concept with a new search engine, chatbot, and account systems.",
