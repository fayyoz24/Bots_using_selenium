    "summary": "Willing to relocate for the postion!\n\nAfter realizing that a career in politics or political culture wasn't my calling while working in a call center, I redirected myself towards business and managements. I successfully completed a Pre-Master and Master of Science in Human Resources Management, with little prior knowledge in business. All through which I engaged in volunteering activities and committee work.\n\nThanks to these multiple experiences, I have acquired a thirst for challenges and continual learning, as well as acquired many skills. Among others, this includes rapid skill acquisition, being a team player and a leader when needed, managing multiple tasks and deadlines, and good customer/people relation. \n\nContact: manonsieurin@gmail.com",

During these 6 weeks, events would occur and affect the portfolio. The end product was to deliver a report defining our strategic choice of portfolio and advice for Shell to deal with these events, to meet with the growing demand for energy and to be more economically, environmentally and socially responsible. These results and advice were presented in front of a panel of Shell senior executives and FEB-professors.\n\nThe competition included company visits, guest lectures, coaching, mentoring and workshops.  The competition also provided insights into the energy industry, through these 6 weeks of part-time research for Shell. Certificates were awarded at the end of the competition, vouching for the attained skills.\n\nThe consulting project was supervised by the EBF association, University of Groningen, the Career Company, and Shell.",
