    "summary": "Currently looking for a new opportunity! \n\nIn my last job venture my motivation came from growing client and colleague relations. This excelled my desire to build trust and commitment from both, naturally laying the foundation of a devoted account executive. While analyzing their current business process in place and focusing on their pain points through our solutions and benefits. I quickly offered ways to streamline their current workflows and offered insight into the market by constructing new revenues through other offerings. While always making time to listen, I was considered their trusted advisor and go to person for advice. I always take notes and construct the right team to get the job done, learning and seeking advice is key in this business. Taking time to listen to all my clients makes the difference.",

I fitted the rooms comfortably and built small kitchens in every room to make it more convenient and ultimately more private for guests. I ran the bnb on my own and earned everything back within a few months. I decided to stop as I saw this model of converting a private house into a bnb was not responsible. Used sites such as Airbnb, 9flats, wimdu, FlipKey. Gained more then 88 reviews with 99% satisfaction. With this new cash flow I decided to move to Australia and received a job at Centrespace.",
