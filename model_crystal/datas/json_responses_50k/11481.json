My IT career started with Infosys as a Software developer moving on to testing and automation solutions to Retail customers.\nI\u2019ve been exposed to interacting and working with internationally diverse clientele across the US, Australia, Europe and Asia. Multi-tasking and working under pressure has been part and parcel of my previous job and the core technical skill of a consultant lies in problem solving, agility of learning new technology & products, and flexibility to adapt to new situations.\n\nKey Result Areas:\nCustomer Success through Satisfaction Survey Score\nImproving Operational Efficiency for cost savings\nTotal consulting hours target\n\nAchievements:\nAchieved top range scores in greater than 95% projects executed.\nIdentified reusable components from past projects to implement in new projects resulting in saved costs of up to $2 million USD across projects in the organization.\nAlways achieved at least 120% of the set target consulting hours.",
