Designing started as a hobby, but the demand for my 'maps' quickly outgrew my capacity. Especially in my late teenage years I used this demand by monetizing my time, experience and knowledge. It soon became apparent that this was a lucrative undertaking, and thus I spent a lot of time on this hobby for several years. Nowadays I mostly work just on passion projects and on commissions by returning customers. Throughout the years I have worked for big customers, including large content-creators and influencers, Mojang partners and even for KFC Gaming. I also provided some maps for the official Mojang 'Realms' service, where several maps of mine have been published. I have also contributed to the official Minecraft annual in 2018 (if my memory serves me right). I have always worked on a commission-only basis. I have not been employed by any of my customers for extended periods of time, nor for the developers themselves.",
