My particular group focused on the problem of adminstrative Europe - is it adaptive and does it learn? \nThe group consisted of participants of the Charlemagne Youth Prize, who run various projects which aim to unite Europe, and young people from the area of Maastricht (which included myself) who have experience in the themes of globalisation, integration and critical thinking. \nThe conclusion of our discussion was the following:\n1. In order to adapt, administrative Europe should familiarise itself with the target group it is aiming for, in this case young people, who in many cases do know of or even care about the administrative part of Europe. Once they know their target group institutions like the European Parliament can amend their information and communication in order to better fit their audience. \n2. Administrative Europe should focus on communicating the shared values of different member states, as this seems to be lacking in current information and policies. This is important because shared values would create an idea of unity among voters, instead of the current situation where the majority of young people base their european 'ideas' or stereotypes on what they see in the media.\n",

My background in freelance writing, marketing and the arts helped me massively in understanding, and taking part in the conference. I was able to gain the relevant information for the official report as part of a team and develop my understanding of British-Dutch communication. \n\nThe theme was extremely interesting and very relevant to the Eindhoven area: Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the UK and the Netherlands. I found this theme particularly interesting as it covers the areas I particularly work in, and can be applied to almost any of my future career choices. I also found the variety of attendees extremely insightful as there were guests from all levels of business, government organisations, NGO's and education. This made for rich and beneficial discussions throughout the three day event. \n\nWriting the official report has helped me in developing my journalistic skills, as well as my networking skills. It was a fantastic opportunity and a pleasure to be involved in such a stimulating, inspirational and engaging conference. \n\n",
