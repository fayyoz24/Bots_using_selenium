Since its inception, Rib has employed an evolutionary logic instead of a thematic succession; exhibitions, collaborations, recurring (online) residencies, long-term projects and off-site interventions all interlock to animate this living organism. Founded by Maziar Afrassiabi in 2015, Rib is housed in a former butcher shop in Rotterdam-Charlois. http://www.ribrib.nl/\n\nMy role is mainly to take care of the space during opening hours (Friday and Saturday from 2 to 6) and to inform visitors about current programmes and exhibitions.",

I\u2019ve signed up as a mentor because I personally benefited from this programme when I first started university, so I wanted to help the upcoming students as well. I\u2019ve worked at the Bootcamp with my fellow mentors to create fun and engaging activities and an overall unforgettable experience for our new friends. We've created a network where newcomers could reach mentors to ask questions, seek help for their issues and to familiarise with the university life."
