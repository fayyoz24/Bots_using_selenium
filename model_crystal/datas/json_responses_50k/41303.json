    "summary": "I am a research, monitoring and evaluation specialist who is passionate about ensuring that under-heard voices are meaningfully heard in research and by practitioners and decision makers. I have over 15 years' experience in government- and NGO-based roles focusing on social exclusion. My areas of experience include youth participation, sexual and reproductive health and rights, homelessness, criminal justice, welfare, gender issues and service user involvement. My proven skills include academic, participatory and policy-focused research; monitoring and evaluation; political influencing; strategic planning; Theory of Change; stakeholder relationship development; programme and project management; fundraising and funder reporting.\n\nI'm also a coach, providing spaces for people to find their inner spark, to find creative solutions to challenges in their lives and to find ways to be true to their values and live more fulfilled lives. I provide sessions online or in person in the Amsterdam area.",
