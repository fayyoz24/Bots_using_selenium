    "summary": "After finishing my bachelor\u2019s degree in Forestry and Nature Conservation, doing a minor in Marine Living Resources, I went on to do a master\u2019s in Aquaculture and Marine Resource Management, focusing on marine governance. I have a keen interest in sustainable management of marine resources and believe that addressing the current local social, political, and economic situation is essential in planning any successful management initiative. \n\nIt is impossible to create change without an understanding of the status quo; having the information to hand, in a useful and accessible format is essential for effective marine resource management. With seafood being a major source of protein world wide, and a food industry that is rapidly growing, the sustainable sourcing of seafood is of increasing importance to food security and the health of the marine ecosystem.",

                    "description": "Age-length keys (ALKs) are important tools for assessing the numbers-at-age for commercial fish populations, as they allow for translation of length measurement samples to age based structures. Age-at-length data are generally not weighted against other external factors, under the assumption that differences between gear type, region, quarter of the year etc. are not influencing the proportions of age classes at a given length. Nonetheless, several studies have shown that regional, seasonal and gear differences exist for several species in both age-at-length and relative abundance-at-age (Stari et al. 2010; Kvist et al., 2000; Berg and Kristensen, 2012; Gerritsen et al. 2006).  \n \nIMARES\u2019 current method of attributing ages to length samples for discard data includes secondary factors like metier and quarter. The validity of this approach as well as incorporating these particular variables and their individual significance have never been investigated. The influence of external factors on the age-length relationship were explored in order to establish which variables are significant to include in an age-length model. This is done by using general additive models based on the works of Berg and Kristensen (2012) on North Sea plaice discard data. The most appropriate model is chosen based on AIC score. This model is used to estimate the numbers-at-age on sampled trip level, which are then compared to IMARES estimated outcomes. \n\nThe GAM reveals that location and quarter are found to be important factors influencing the relationship for discarded North Sea plaice. There was a slight variation in the age-at-length between genders. Gear was not explored, due to lack of significance. Concerning the comparison of outputs, the GAM method estimates higher numbers-at-age for the ages 0 and 1 than current IMARES methodology. In terms of stock assessment, this result entails that the GAM is estimating higher recruitment levels than IMARES.",

                    "description": "There is an increasing demand for sustainable seafood products, including pole-and-line caught tuna. Expansion of pole-and-line activities however appears to be hampered by limited bait availability. While the pole-and-line\u2019s advantages of creating social and ecological benefits have been widely researched, limited information exists on the effect bait fisheries have on local bait supplying communities. In order to understand the socio-economic implications under increased pole-and-line production, this thesis uses the sustainable livelihood framework to map the conditions of beach seining fisheries in the North-Sulawesi, Indonesia. Based on the local conditions a SWOT analysis is made to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the beach seining communities, and the opportunities and threats they face regarding an increasing demand for pole-and-line tuna. \n\nThe results revealed a skewed situation of communities only having one livelihood strategy that suits the challenges resulting from an increased market demand, making the communities highly vulnerable and hampering their ability to counter threats, which would eventually lead to a further reduced capacity to safeguard the future of their livelihood. An opportunity would be creating social structures through organisation and participation, but communities appear to lack capabilities to do so, leaving beach seining communities deprived in terms of social inferiority, isolated in relation to the institutional processes and excluded from benefit sharing mechanisms. \n\nThese results raise questions on how global environmental sustainability standards are influencing local socio-economic conditions and whether striving for sustainable seafood products actually contributes to overall sustainability. Without proper institutions in place, it is unlikely that the local impact of an increased market demand on the socio-economic conditions and the adaptive capacity of beach seining communities will be beneficial.",
