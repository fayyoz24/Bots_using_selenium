Over time, this texture undergoes many changes that if proper policies are not taken to preserve and maintain this texture, this texture will disappear.\nIn this project, each building of this 350-hectare texture was updated in GIS and analyzes were made based on it. Based on these analyzes, policies were made to preserve this historical texture, and in some areas, designs were proposed to prevent excessive erosion of the texture. The output of this project is supposed to be one of the alternatives offered to UNESCO.\n#GIS_based_analysis #policy_making #the_survey_of_current_situation",
