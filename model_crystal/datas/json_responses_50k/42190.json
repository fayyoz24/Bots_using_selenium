As the name suggests in Dutch the district has an ideal strategic location, to the south of the city centre and in close proximity to Schiphol Airport.\n\nKnowledge and business centre\nZuidas is best known as a top-level international knowledge and business centre. Over 700 companies, many of them leading names, are already established here. They include Google, AkzoNobel and ABN AMRO. While the district's main focus is the financial, legal and business services sector, these sterling names are attracting an increasing number of companies from other sectors to Zuidas.\n\nA great place to live\nZuidas provides an excellent residential environment, with ample hotel and leisure facilities. With between 8,000 and 9,000 homes by 2040, Zuidas will soon be Amsterdam's second most prominent housing location. \n\nZuidas under development\nZuidas continues to get bigger and better. The district has a total capacity of up to 4.2 million m2 of real estate, including existing properties and those that are under construction or in the pipeline. It is expected to reach its full potential in around 2040.",
