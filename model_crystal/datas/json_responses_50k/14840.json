I have unlocked various sources such as Google Analytics, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pardot (email), Salesforce (CRM), Google Data Studio (Paid Media) and websites using Python, Power BI and Salesforce Einstein Analytics. In parallel with above, I have improved and prepared the data to create various robust dashboards, such as for example;\n\n- Social Media Dashboard | PowerBI | users can make trends and insights at both a global and detailed level intelligible in an easy and attractive way for Twitter and LinkedIn;\n\n\u2012\tOnline Media Dashboard | PowerBI | users have a powerful tool to closely monitor an external (online) media agency and quickly make the effectiveness of the online media budget intelligible at global and at detailed level (per country, digital channel, medium, websites/partners, campaign, advertisement);\n\n\u2012\tSales Priority Dashboard | Einstein Analytics | developed an universe with recipes, which created a bridge between marketing (email) activities within Pardot and sales activities within Salesforce. The interactive dashboard on top of that universe provide users a real-time 360-degree view of both existing and potential accounts and all underlying personal profiles. The engagement of not only existing contacts but also prospects and leads from Pardot are taken into consideration. Engagement over time at multiple and different levels such as country, sales entity, defined segments, accounts and contacts are easy to generate. Even per strategy, campaign, subject or kind of content. Easy to use for qualifying prospects or leads and monitoring open opportunities, contacts or accounts by providing combined overviews of marketing- and sales activities and the resulted engagement.\n\n\u2012\tTools/skills: Python / Pardot / Salesforce / Einstein Analytics / SQL / Power BI",
