Alfons van Blaaderen, part of the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science. During this research project, I attempted to develop new microscopy-based methods for measuring the interactions between colloidal nanoparticles, and to link this to the ability of nanoparticles to form complex structures.\n\nMy scientific activities included:\n\u2022 Advanced chemical synthesis of colloidal (nano)particles, primarily gold and silica based, and characterisation using a wide variety of techniques including UV-VIS spectroscopy, dynamic and static light scattering,\n\u2022 Quantitative optical microscopy using a variety of techniques including widefield fluorescence microscopy, high-speed and/or super-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy,\n\u2022 Characterisation of nanoparticle systems using electron microscopy, including high-resolution SEM, volumetric SEM (FIB-SEM), tomographic (3D) TEM\n\u2022 Image analysis of large (>1 TB) microscopy datasets and extensive data processing and visualisation using Python (including authoring several Python packages)\n\u2022 Simulation & analysis of colloidal dynamics using C++ and Python\n\u2022 Regularly presenting my work within the research group and at several conferences\n\nOther activities included:\n\u2022 Teaching: I helped set up and was teaching assistant for a graduate level course on advanced microscopy techniques as well as supervising undergraduate physics labs and several smaller student research-projects\n\u2022 Supervision of graduation projects of 4 students (2 undergraduate, 2 graduate and 1 external internship) as well as performing part of the supervision duties for several others\n\u2022 Organising various social activities",

For the first of these I was assistant director, the next two I wrote and directed by myself. Additionally I was involved in production taks, in which I was supported by a dedicated committee of students.\n\nI have always loved theatre, and being able to bring my creative vision onto the stage was a long time dream after many years of amateur theatre experience on stage as well as behind the sound or lighting desk. There's nothing quite like writing a play, from scratch, and seeing those characters and the story brought to life by some of the most fun and motivated people I've ever encountered. Directing the cast, many of whom had never acted on stage before, also gave me valuable experience in teaching, communication and leadership."
