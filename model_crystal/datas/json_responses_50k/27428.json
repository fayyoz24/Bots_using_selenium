    "summary": "3rd year PhD student at VU Amsterdam, in the group of Chase Broedersz. My research focuses on understanding chromosome organization and dynamics through data-driven theory and simulations.\n\nI'm curious about extracting more physical insight from different structures on Hi-C maps, both using data-driven methods, as well as creative analytical approaches.\n\nI also love creating simulations of toy models, aimed at trying to explain emergent biological phenomena using only a few physical principles. I have experience in modelling using C++, Python, and Julia.",

The programme included a training week, after which I familiarised myself with JSC's facilities.\n\nMy project included developing C++ code for exporting data about Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations on a graphene lattice into Matlab, and implementing the EIg-CG iterative method for solving large systems of linear equations.\n\nI gained skills in parallel computing and using standard algebra libraries (LAPACK, BLAS). I also had the opportunity to learn how Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations are used to solve lattice-discretised quantum problems.",
