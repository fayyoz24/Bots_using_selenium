    "summary": "As an external consultant at Adelphi, I work on various projects that aim to accelerate the sustainability transition and foster international development cooperation. With a Master of Science in Development Economics and International Development from the University of Amsterdam, I have a solid academic background in sustainability studies and a keen interest in driving positive change and making a lasting impact on the world.\n\nSome of my recent achievements include developing a green eligibility checking tool and taxonomy for Ugandan banks, co-leading project impact assessments for biodiversity-finance initiatives, and conceptualizing, developing, and writing a proposal for a climate adaptation project in East Africa. I have also gained valuable experience in creating and delivering non-financial support services for enterprises, business development providers, and financial institution stakeholders, focusing on circularity, biodiversity, and waste management.\n\nI possess strong analytical, communication, and social sustainability skills, which enable me to understand the intricate connections between social, economic, and environmental factors, and devise innovative strategies for sustainable development. I also have a proven track record of effective project management, sustainability consulting, stakeholder engagement, and business development, working with diverse and multidisciplinary teams and partners. My interdisciplinary approach, coupled with my practical experience, provides me with a strong foundation to contribute to the sustainability transition and international development cooperation efforts.",
