    "summary": "Julius Brenninkmeijer is a visionary entrepreneur hailing from Amsterdam, Netherlands, with a diverse background in business management, innovation, economics, and entrepreneurship. As a Clark University alumnus, Julius has built an impressive career by identifying opportunities and driving change across various industries.\n\nHis entrepreneurial journey began with the establishment of a pizza restaurant, followed by a foray into the bicycle industry. This experience ignited Julius's passion for promoting global ridership, leading him to co-own Banker Supply, a boutique lifestyle bicycle soft goods and repair shop. \n\nRecognizing the potential of real estate as a means to secure his investments, Julius created a property portfolio in 2012 and co-founded WPB Vastgoed in 2016. He successfully expanded the portfolio to include commercial properties, launching the Mr. Lewis Hotel in Overveen in 2019 and Rotterdam in 2022.\n\nJulius's keen eye for innovation extends beyond traditional business ventures. As an angel investor, he has supported small and medium-sized businesses through Ourcrowd. His fascination with the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency has led him to invest in and research web3, defi, and DAOs. Currently, Julius is in the process of establishing his own venture capital firm to further enable innovation by investing in disruptive companies with the potential to reshape industries.\n\nA true entrepreneur at heart, Julius Brenninkmeijer continually seeks new opportunities and innovative ways to make a meaningful impact in the world.",
