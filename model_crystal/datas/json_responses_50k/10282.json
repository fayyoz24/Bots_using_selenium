    "summary": "My Name is Erik Nijkamp and I am finishing my masters in Chemical Engineering in October 2024, and then I will be starting my internship. (Perhaps at your company!) My specialization and passion is using computers and models to optimize and improve chemical processes across many scales. This allows for process improvement that could not be done using traditional methods. One of my qualities is that I am always curious, and am always asking questions and looking to understand the things around me. \n\nI have been very busy in my study time, as I have been an active member in my study association. My largest committee is the Study Tour Committee, where I am the chairman and we are organizing a trip to Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore for 28 students and 2 professors. I am also a proud co-founder of Team Better/e, a student Team aiming to make grid-scale energy storage more affordable using redox flow batteries.",

Originally focusing on a novel technology, the teams focus is now on redox flow batteries.  As a co-founder, my role is very flexible, and I wear many hats, however my focus is mainly on the technical development of an all-iron redox flow battery, while also sometimes managing or leading part or all of the team.",
