    "summary": "I am passionate about helping leaders and their teams stay connected and productive in a constantly changing environment. Getting a better understanding of team dynamics, beyond the standard personality models, brings sustained transformation. At the heart of this is a deeper insight in \u2018self\u2019, to understand what pushes our buttons and why we react the way we do. Bringing the theory of psychoanalytical models such as Transactional Analysis and Sub-personalities alive through practical exercises, I ensure that specific organizational requirements are met. \n\nI combine an open, empathic and fun approach with a pragmatic, highly analytical business oriented mindset. As an astute trainer and coach, I have extensive experience in people and management development including creating management assessments and team productivity exercises. I'm a seasoned professional who has held leadership positions in International companies in various industry sectors: Banking, Insurance, Mobile Telecoms, FMCG.
