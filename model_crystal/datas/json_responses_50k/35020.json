    "summary": "I help leaders and their teams to create high value and reach excellence in a complex and fast changing world. If you feel attracted to this, let\u2019s set up a conversation to explore what is possible.\n\nI believe that it is critical for organizations to create a work environment where people feel safe to bring their whole person and where they are supported and encouraged to speak their truth, in order to tap the collective wisdom. These so-called systems inspired organizations are very agile, get optimal results, and are key for a better, more conscious, and sustainable world.\n\nI build on my experience of working with thousands of leaders and teams with diverse backgrounds, being their trusted advisor, sounding board and coach. I also benefit a lot from my education as an organizational psychologist and leverage my more than 25 years of international experience in Human Resources with Shell, exposing me to working in complex, global organisations and providing me with challenging, multi-cultural assignments in The Netherlands, UK, Belgium, Malaysia, and Gabon. \n\nMy motto is \u201cServing Courageously with Resonance and Impact\u201d. I am always in service of my clients and pushing them out of the comfort zone is an important part of this. I help my clients to realize the results they want, in a way that energizes them and connects them to their purpose.\n\nWhat else is useful to know about me?\n\nI am the first author of the best-selling and groundbreaking book \"Systems Inspired Leadership\"(2021). System Inspired Leadership is an alternative leadership model that sees leadership as a role of the system (rather than relying on a top-down, the-leader-knows-it-all approach). It teaches in practical ways how to tap into the collective wisdom of your team or organization. \n\nI am also co-author of the book \"Leading Innovation (2016; in Dutch) and the article \u201cLeadership 4.0: A review of the thinking\u201d (2017).\n\nI love speaking engagements.\n\nI live in the Netherlands and work in English, French, German, and Dutch.\n\nI am married to my wife Vera. And we have two children who have left home to do their studies. \n\n=> Interested?
