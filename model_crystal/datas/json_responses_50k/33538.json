I am goal oriented and enjoy having the chance to use my leadership skills, acquired through many years of competitive sports, to motivate colleagues and overcome challenges. My education in problem based learning (PBL) has given me the skills to prioritise and multitask, and the ability to analyse and work through complex problems. Having grown up in Malaysia, Thailand, Switzerland, and Rotterdam, I have a global outlook and am eager to work in a multicultural environment where I can collaborate and share ideas, working towards common goals. I enjoy a learning curve and create fast productive relationships, helping efficiency in a work environment. ",
