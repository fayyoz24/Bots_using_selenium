A jury annually visits all art academies with a photography department and select 5 talents. \n\nThe work of the nominees of 2011 was exhibited in the Dutch Photography Museum / Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam from 03 sept 'till 30 okt 2011. \n\nSteenbergen Stipendium jury commentary for 'Dissimilitude', \nby Kim Knoppers, Colette Olof & Koen Hauser:\n\n\u201cIn her project Sanne Kabalt portrayed two young women, in black and white, during a long period. Sanne Kabalt\u2019s presentation was simple but very beautiful. In a closed room the portraits were shown as slides, in a quiet but well-balanced rhythm. Sometimes you saw three, sometimes one, sometimes there were three pictures of the same woman, sometimes you could compare them. The work shows how the same person can be so different and how different women can be so similar. The work is thus also about the passage of time. Furthermore, it is an investigation into the genre of portrait photography. The jury wants to emphasize that they value the work in the exhibition a little more than the book.\u201d",

                    "description": "Sanne Kabalt (Amsterdam, 1989) is a Dutch artist who works with the medium of photography, often accompanied by writing. When describing what photography does, the verb often used is \u2018to capture\u2019 something, though, problematically, this suggests the imprisonment of the subject matter. Once something is captured, it is no longer out there, no longer wild, no longer free. Thematically, she is engaged in the realms of illness, death, madness and loss. In her work she is continuously rethinking photography, striving to unsettle capture. Kabalt received her bachelors degree from the Utrecht School of the Arts (HKU) in 2011 and her MA from the Dutch Art Institute (DAI) in 2018. Kabalt's HKU graduation project 'Dissimilitude' was nominated for the Steenbergen Stipendium. She has exhibited her work in group exhibitions at the Nederlands Fotomuseum, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag and Art Rotterdam and in solo exhibitions in Upominki, De Balie and Het Pompgemaal Den Helder. She was one of the winners of Vrij Nederland Fotoverhaal 2015. Recent exhibitions in 2018 include Yellow Brick (Greece), Nes Listami\u00f0st\u00f6\u00f0 (Iceland) and Karthuizerklooster (Belgium). Kabalt has worked as an artist-in-residence in Romania, Iceland and Norway. An important residency for her was at Het Vijfde Seizoen (Den Dolder, NL) on the terrain of a psychiatric institution, the outcome of which is an artist book titled (in Dutch): \u2018Zolang je niet zo over problemen praat zie je er toch niks van\u2019, which roughly translates to: \u2018As long as you don\u2019t talk about problems so much you won\u2019t see them anyway\u2019, a title that brings to doubt the capacity of photography to give a form to something as complex as madness and thereby questions Kabalt\u2019s own medium and work. \n\nwww.sannekabalt.com",
