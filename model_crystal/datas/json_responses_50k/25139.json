This is a documentary about food waste that addresses the issue from both a birds-eye perspective by looking at the food chain and a personal perspective where we follow Jen and Grant in their challenge to only consume food waste for 6 months. Before the movie I gave an introduction talk about food waste in a local context (such as the Foodsharing Wageningen Platform) and presented two books about cooking with food waste to browse through during the break. The movie was followed by a 20 minute conversation about our food waste which I facilitated. The 40 to 45 people that attended this screening felt that they needed to change their behavior and saw food waste not just as an inefficiency but as an ethical issue. Practical advice on how to ask shop keepers for food waste was exchanged, as well as an academic discussion on the role of population in food scarcity was held. Other feedback included remarks on the role of Wageningen University and its focus on the production of food in its research and education, underplaying the importance of the food waste crisis. The argument was made that a cultural shift towards a more sustainable society has to include how we treat and consume our food. ",

            "description": "In the end of 2016 there was an uprising in the United States over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. A group of Native American tribes, environmentalists and journalists aims to protect the sacred burial grounds, protect their water and to uphold their rights to the land as granted in 1868. What started as a conflict between a company and a group of concerned citizens has over the course of a few months escalated into an armed siege facing the Standing Rock community. \nOn Thursday 3 November RUW Foundation and OtherWise Wageningen hosted an information meeting about this situation, followed by a Skype session with the people at the front line. Our keynote Chihiro Geuzebroek, an expert on indigenous culture and history in the context of environmentalism, provided us with context to understand this situation. She first explored the narratives of indigenous rights, climate justice and colonialism. \nA recurring theme in her talk was genocide. Both in the literal sense where colonists were rewarded for killing Indians during the \u2018wild wild west\u2019 era, but also the cultural genocide taking Native American children and putting them in special schools. A remarkable example of genocide was the killing of the bison, the main source of food for many Native Americans. Chihiro described this as a  purposeful act of ecocide with the aim of causing genocide. The rise of capitalism was a turning point when it comes to how Native Americans were valued. From being seen as savages by the colonists, they were now seen as a cheap source of labor. The combination of systemic racism and capitalism resulted in far-reaching efforts to make Native Americans part of the lowest working class.  Today, many the Native Americans see the violent attempts to remove them from their ancestral land in the context of colonisation. The battle they are fighting to keep their land is no different to them from when their ancestors fought to defend this land from invading armies.  ",

This is a collaborative introduction to the many green initiatives, places and people of Wageningen. Key organisers were Wageningen Environmental Platform, Fossil Free Wageningen and DWARS. RUW Foundation took on the role of promotion by creating and distributing the greenactive flyer and hosted the two capacity-building and community mapping sessions.\nOn Saturday the 10th I introduced the green active network to the new students of the Wageningen University and provided an overview of the current state of activities in Wageningen. After giving 8 different organisations 3 minutes to pitch what their initiative does, needs and wants a speed-date session between the new students was hosted. Several organisations have found interested people for their student boards and gained volunteers during this afternoon.\nOn Sunday the 11th of September I organised a workshop in which green and ambitious plans for the next academic year were made at Thuis Wageningen. The participants of the Re-greening weekend and representatives of the green organisations all hosted an \"open space\"  in which they were to discuss their ideas for the next academic year. In 4 rounds of open spaces many alliances were formed between people, places and organisations, several ideas for upcoming activities were created and solutions for unsustainable situations were discussed.\nThese sessions formed the reflective part of the weekend and the outcomes from both sessions are collected in a harvest document. The re-greening weekend was well received by both the participants and the organisers and it is intended to make this an annual recurring event that is up to par with the introduction weekends organised by the student associations.",
