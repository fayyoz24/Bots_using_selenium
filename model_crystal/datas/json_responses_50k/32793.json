    "summary": "I am a skilled architect specializing in collaborative housing design for hazard-prone areas. With a strong background in neighborhood planning and building design, I am passionate about working towards adequate and affordable housing through community collaboration. Currently, I am pursuing PhD in architecture at TUDelft and KITLV Institute, where I am researching innovative ways to develop housing design in the Caribbean region. My focus is on enhancing collaboration and implementing circular design practices to build hazard-resilient communities.\n\nWith my academic background and experience in Delft, Wroclaw, Turin, and other locations, my expertise spans across various areas including parametric design, low-income housing, and adaptive reuse of vacant structures. My academic and professional journey has provided me with a diverse skill set and a global perspective in addressing complex challenges in architecture and design.",

We aim to enhance these qualities by exploring the potential of circular design practices while studying self-initiated and collective housing practices on the Island. Our objective is to establish a new approach to housing design that fosters collaboration, promotes the circulation of materials, and addresses the challenges posed by earthquakes and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change.",
