    "summary": "As a Junior Legal Consultant at AFS Group, I provide legal and compliance advice to a leading financial services provider in Europe. I work with the Legal and Compliance team to ensure that the company's operations, products, and services comply with the relevant laws and regulations in the EU and other jurisdictions. I also support the company's strategic initiatives and projects, such as green investments, ESG, and financial innovation, by conducting legal research, drafting contracts, and negotiating with stakeholders.\n\nI have an interdisciplinary academic background, combining law and economics, with a focus on competition law and market regulation. I am currently pursuing my second master's degree in Law and Economics from Utrecht University, where I have completed a postgraduate dissertation on the evolution of SPACs and how they can support ESG factors. I hold a first master's degree in Commercial Law from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and a bachelor's degree in Law from the same university. I am fully qualified to practice law in Greece and in the EU, as a member of the Thessaloniki Bar Association. \n\nI am passionate about sustainable economic growth, financial innovation, and entrepreneurship. I have developed strong analytical, financial, and creative writing skills, as well as a growing knowledge of EU financial regulation, such as AIFMD, UCITS, MiFID, CRR/CRD, etc. I have also gained valuable experience in corporate investment and real estate law, working as a junior lawyer and a trainee lawyer in two reputable law firms in Greece. I speak Greek (native), English (C2), and Dutch (B1), and I have lived, studied, and worked in two different countries (Greece and the Netherlands).",
