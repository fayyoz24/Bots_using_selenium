The jury found that \u201cthe agency and client went all out to execute an idea that brings relevancy to their partnership. A Letter to Brabant is a well-researched work and has excellent execution from a craft point of view. And, even though the strategy to link ASML and the Van Gogh Museum feels a bit far-fetched, using an influencer post-mortem is not your typical influencer strategy, so all out credits for this too.\u201d",
