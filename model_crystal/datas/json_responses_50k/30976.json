    "summary": "Growing up within a large urban setting in the United States has instilled a drive and desire to make an impact on the future leaders of our communities by pushing them to perform their best and nurturing a sense of self-worth about their lives and abilities. I wish to motivate and drive them to excel in their performance and carry those abilities with them moving forward in their lives.\n\nMy over 12 years of retail experience has taught me how to work well with others and be successful in meeting goals as a team, as well as developed the skills needed to communicate well with others. The training I have received throughout college and higher education setting at university has allowed me to develop and sharpen strategies needed to accomplish demanding projects with strict deadlines. Working with various schools across all grade levels has given me the exposure to many types of settings and environments in a variety of socioeconomic communities, gaining experience and appreciation for the skills required to succeed across the board.\n\nI have been working diligently to enhance my skills as a mathematician, as well as develop the skills needed to be an effective educator. Throughout my education, there has also been an emphasis on learning methods as well as childhood development theories.\n\nMy successes have come in the form of persistent push and drive that have placed me on the other side of high-level courses at the university, and some unforgettable experiences teaching lessons to high school students and watching them become excited about new material and learning something new.\n\nMy desire is to become part of a passionate and dedicated group that is committed to providing a quality education to students within an enriching learning environment. Weather this is in a school setting or as a part of another driven and ambitious community, I would love to be a part of it.\n\nPlease consider me as part of your team and reach me via\nEmail: richardmattvela@outlook.com ,\nWhatsapp: +12817851757 ,\nDutch Phone number: +31687068259.",
