Sourcing the right electric vehicles, securing a sufficient charging infrastructure at our units. But apart from these obvious sustainability related topics, I've been dealing with budget forecast and follow-up, developing financing options for our transport partners (lease vs investment), supporting Legal with new contracts based on electric delivery, strategic and ad-hoc cost impact analyses, TCO calculations and emission saving analyses. And from a fulfilment perspective supporting the implementation of a radical new fulfilment set-up, incorporating electric vehicles with range limitations.
