The approach has been tailored such as to approximate most closely the situation of carrier transport through a single well-defined molecular chain. Therefore, in the growth a segment by segment buildup by self-assembly has been adopted, yielding excellent control of the formed molecular system. As for the electrical transport the tip of a Scanning Tunneling Microscope has been taken as the counter electrode to aim for the highest spatial resolution.",
