    "summary": " Whenever I go, I try to bring positive change and bring positive people. I know that business is as much about the product, as about the community - and that great atmosphere is a key part of every encounter. I have over 3 years of combined experience in hospitality and sales, from holiday food stands and farmers markets to high-end chocolatiers and concept cafes. I helped each of those places grow by building a community around it and making sure it remains vibrant and energized. \n\nThat's why I also love organizing events - be it for friends, NGOs, or local businesses. They're a magnet for amazing individuals, who want to truly engage. The rush of ideas, frantic planning, and excellent execution give me true joy. I want to have an impact and make a change - however small it may seem.",
