    "summary": "I am always actively looking for new opportunities in strategic planning, policy writing, communication and design development in companies that specialise in sustainable and balanced urban development located in the Netherlands. I am interested in international projects that address the social, economic and environmental facets of sustainability through effective urban governance and spatial strategies.\n\nI am a strategic and spatial planner from India. In 2014, after completing an under-graduate degree in Architecture (B. Arch) from New Delhi in 2014, I gained experience working on architecture, urban planning and interior design projects. In 2016, I moved to the Netherlands to pursue a Master of Science degree from the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft, specialising in Urbanism. I graduated with Master thesis that sought to investigate and counter urban biases in metropolitan planning that leads to unbalanced urban-rural growth in Indian cities. \n",

The premise of a value-based design model is that by beginning creative design processes with values (like \u2018tolerance\u2019, \u2018hope\u2019, \u2018healthiness\u2019 \u2018empowerment\u2019) can result in more inclusive, equitable and just outcomes for society. \n\nThis is relevant because the way we design for our environment takes cues from economic driven models that do not fit the needs of the 21st century society. This is a century where the lines are blurring, between urban and rural, between economic classes, between gender roles, between cultures, between societies. But what happens the when our methods for creation make it hard erase these lines? We end up creating a built environment that does not fit society, resulting in injustice, inequity and segregation. This inequity is often more visible in biases observed in the design of computer software and AIs (for example, male bias in resume checking programmes). Similarly, such biases (against gender, race, elderly) also exist in the design of the cityscape. \n\nHow? This studio builds upon my collaboration with the Just City Lab @ Harvard GSD, the Veldacademie and the Architecture Institute Rotterdam (AIR). This collaboration resulted in research into the Just CIty Index developed by the Just City Lab. The Index features 50 values linked to idea of just cities and encourages urban designers to design using value-based conversations within communities of difference. But experience using the values while conducting various workshops has shown that values have potential beyond urban design.",
