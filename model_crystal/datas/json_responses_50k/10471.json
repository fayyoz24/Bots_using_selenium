On a societal, organisational and personal level.\n\nI get inspiration from challenges in unknown territory, to keep extending the boundaries of my comfort zone. I greatly enjoy acting as a guide to create a path together with others.\n\nDuring all my journeys I have seen many innovations come to life. I like to look at challenges from a variety of perspectives to select a well-considered, effective plan of attack.\n\nI believe we are capable of creating our own future.

Made new hires and was HR responsible for the team for almost 2 years. Grew the team to 11 data scientists. Organized a data science education curriculum. I was part of the leadership team to lead an agile transformation for about 70 people. The agile model is based on Spotify but we customized it to have a better fit in the organizational environment. Our transformation has resulted in the birth of a new business unit named Data Intelligence (DI).\n\nIn addition to the leadership challenges I designed the main business model for data science; \u201cSmart Connectors\u201d, which are customized API\u2019s that take data as input and can be integrated in frontend and administrative systems to improve efficiency or enable new functionalities. The data science environment was built on top of the centralized data hub, Data Core. Being a scalable system that minimizes the time from a pilot solution to a productionized data science solution, resulting in fully governed smart connectors.\n\nOn the application part, the first two years were focused on innovative applications and pilot projects to deliver business value. A backlog of several successful pilots were ready to deliver continuous value. The bottleneck at the time was the fully governed data part, since the demand far exceeded the supply.\n\nThe first 1.5 years, this role held a broad responsibility with many major decisions to take. Once DI went live, the role became more narrow and facilitating towards the business. This did not fit my own profile and strengths well. Therefore, I supported the new lead in taking over the data science team and helped him merge it with the data analytics team.",
