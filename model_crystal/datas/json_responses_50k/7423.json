    "summary": "The past year I pursued one of my biggest dreams : buying a 4x4 car and travel through Australia.\nAustralia and it's extraordinary animals really left their mark.\n\nBeing back in NL, I'm eager again to make a difference in the workforce! What do I bring to the workforce? I will tell you. \n\nMy biggest strength is that I can create clarity in the midst of chaos. You can leave me in the lion's den, I will come out victorious, wearing a new fur coat. I strive for improvement and efficiency. Therefore, I do not mind to see unnecessary meetings and wasteful processes go. I plan, organize, bring people together and come up with solutions to our problems. I stay curious, I am critical and honest, but still flexible.\n\nI'm a beloved colleague as I'm always there helping them. I really like to coach colleagues and bring everyone up to speed, so we can achieve our goals together as a team. I'm ready to be your colleague!",

After an extensive analysis of the file, a report is made and presented to the Dutch police force. There have been cases in the past that were reopened due to this report. I was a part of this project for nearly 9 months and gained a lot of experience with extensive analysis of a complex file.\n\nAfter I graduated from Maastricht University the project was renamed to \"Dubieuze Zaken en Cold cases\".",
