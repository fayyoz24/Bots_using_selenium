The project brings together the voices of different social groups, allowing them to meet, engage in a conversation, and create proposals of specific solutions and system changes which we aim to implement in real life.\n\nAs part of the first edition of ODCC, more than 200 people joined our team and Open Dialogues happened in 10 countries on 3 continents. We summarized the outcomes and presented our international recommendations during an official side event at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, titled \"Raise your voice, join the conversation! Open Dialogues on Climate Change\".\n\nAs the Founder of the project, I also serve as the main International Coordinator, and a National Coordinator for Poland. I am responsible for coordinating the implementation of the project around the world, supervising a diverse international team of volunteers, partnerships, media relations, as well as policy and advocacy coordination.",
