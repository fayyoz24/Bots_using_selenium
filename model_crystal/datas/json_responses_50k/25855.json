The system was then used to dissect the nucleation, elongation and dissociation kinetics of tropomyosin on actin. Finally, the assay was further used to test whether certain anti-tropomyosin compounds (potential anti-cancer drugs) could affect any of these steps in the formation of the actin-tropomyosin polymer.",
