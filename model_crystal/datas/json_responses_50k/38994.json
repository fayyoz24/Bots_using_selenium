    "summary": "I'm French, and I've spent 8 out of the last 10 years living and working outside of my native country. I'm passionate about business development in the tech industry. \n\nIn 2022 I secured the highest bookings ever recorded by an Account Executive operating on the French market at Momentive. I've been promoted three times in 2 years, and I'm now taking care of our most strategic accounts in EMEA. Although I'm today focusing mainly on improving myself as an Account Executive, my background is in sales management and strategy.\n\nI like consensus in a team, I lead by example, I'm obsessed with improving performance. I think I'm doing a great job at translating product breakthroughs into fast and efficient Go-To-Market strategies across EMEA, preferably in France.",
