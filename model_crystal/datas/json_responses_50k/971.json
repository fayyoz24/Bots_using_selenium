    "summary": "I am a full professor of Public Administration with a focus on digitisation and public policy at the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, Leiden University (The Hague Campus). I have a multidisciplinary background in IT and Policy sciences and my work is on the interface between digitalisation and government. How digital innovations challenge established practices and institutions of public governance and how these innovations can be used to support good and effective governance, is the core of my research. Current research include several projects on the politics and use of big data and algorithms in a public governance context. My research is multidisciplinary with teams comprising of policy and governance scholars alongside computer scientists, AI-experts and philosophers.\n\nSpecialties and research interests: digital governance, collaborative digital governance, AI, GovTech, algorithmic governance, public policy, digital platforms and infrastructures, public sector innovation, cybersecurity governance, big data, public-private collaboration.",

They can greatly support and enhance cooperation between organisations, compliance and government supervision. PPII consist of components owned, operated and maintained by various organisations; public and private.  However, there is no central control and existing governance arrangements are not necessarily applicable. Hence, governing PPII is a huge challenge and the tools used for the governance of PPII need to be acceptable for all key stakeholders, given the collaborative setting. \n\nIn my VENI research, I combine insights from the field of interorganisational systems with literature on governance and public-private collaboration. I aim to find tools of governance that can be used in PPII and assess their applicability based on factors specific to the field of interorganisational systems. I will study multiple case studies in the domain of international trade, where multiple initiatives are undertaken to develop and adopt public-private information infrastructures. A survey will validate the outcomes to assess that the governance arrangements are acceptable to the key players involved. \n",

This system is completely connected to all the procedures for reliable and cost-effective chains. This streamlines customs, fiscal processes and physical movement of the loads. This streamlining offers a main port a competitive advantage, because it is quicker, easier, better and cheaper.",
