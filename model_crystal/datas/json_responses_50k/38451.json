    "summary": "10+ years of working experience as a project manager, coastal & river engineer and GIS expert in a broad range of international, integrated and multi-disciplinary water projects. Obtained two Masters\u2019 Degrees at Wageningen University (MSc Geo Information Science and MSc Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning). \nPassion for improving the quality of our living environment with water as main element. The increasing challenges and pressures by climate change and urban development in the coasts, deltas and rivers domain fascinate and urge to take action for inclusive, sustainable and resilient development.\nGIS is one of the main tools to conduct spatial analysis, link numerical models and transform data into self-explanatory visualisations to bring across the core of the message. Connecting and managing people, technology and disciplines through convincing communication, demonstrated by numerous roles in projects as team leader, coordinator and liaison in international teams. Strong at integrating engineering, spatial and socio-economic aspects.\nDrive to study and design for implementation of blue and green/ nature based solutions. Creative and gears flexibly between the holistic bigger picture and pragmatic detailing, working in the entire project cycle from conceptualization, design, feasibility, to construction supervision while keeping an eye on required institutional settings.\n\nSpecific expertise in:\n- River engineering and flood risk assessments (river and floodplain planning, flow modelling, flooding and inundation, statistics)\n- Flood resilience and climate change adaptation (vulnerability assessments, spatial and urban planning, resettlement, adaptation, mitigation and protection measures)\n- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis\n- Coastal and port engineering (breakwaters, dredging, land reclamation, navigational design)\n- IWT Transport (logistics studies, accessibility and navigability)\n- Surveys (topography, bathymetry, UAVs, hydrodynamics etc.)\n- Technical and economic feasibility, design of measures, cost estimation, assessing benefits and co-benefits",
