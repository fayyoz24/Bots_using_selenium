    "summary": "For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in sustainability and entrepreneurship. These passions have first led me to the EM Strasbourg Business School, where I followed the programme Bachelor Young Entrepreneur and to University of Strasbourg, to study Economics and Management.\n\nAfter having obtained the double-degree bachelor diploma, I decided to move onto next challenges. I have already completed my first Master's degree in International Business and Management from the University of Groningen, and am currently pursuing another Master's degree in World Economy at the Fudan University in Shanghai, China.\n\nI am most comfortable in diverse, international environments. My international experience started at the age of 14 when I left my home country of Slovenia, and moved to France. There, I started attending the European School of Strasbourg in 3 tuition languages with schoolmates from all over the world. Since then, I have completed academic programs in both English and French language, while also learning Chinese and German on the side. Today, I can very comfortably communicate in Slovene, English, and French, and a little less comfortably in Chinese and German - but I'm getting there!\n\nIn addition to that, I am obsessed with sports! When I\u2019m not studying or thinking about how to save the planet, you can find me on the ski slopes, football fields or tennis courts, or even just running around your city.\n\nOnce I graduate, I want to work on innovative projects in the field of sustainability. As you might have guessed, I am particularly interested in the industry of sports. My goal as an ex-high level athlete is to make sports more environmentally sustainable and accessible for everyone. So, if you want to chat about it, I would love to get in touch!",
