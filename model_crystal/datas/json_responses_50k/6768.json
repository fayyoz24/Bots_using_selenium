    "summary": "My ambition is to make a valuable contribution with my corporate, media and not-for-profit experience to enhance a sustainable economy and society while taking care of our environment. I believe sustainable development is a key driver for innovation and growth and sustainability should, and can, be embedded in the core of each business or organisation. While connecting people and managing change in a holistic way I tackle challenges purposefully and solution oriented. \n\nAs an impact oriented person I question the status quo to make more conscious decisions.I differentiate myself by the way I place myself in one\u2019s perspective, my optimism and curiosity, the natural ability to work together with different key groups, and the balancing of empathy and my result driven business mindset. \n\nI have contributed to different (sustainable-) business innovation projects. My most inspiring assignments include the analysis on sustainable business models for natural capital at Rijkswaterstaat. And my project management for IKEA Portugal and Spain, where I learned to initiate and implement projects into different contexts and drive a behavioural change. As a leader I gained experience from my time as sales manager for IKEA in Russia empowering my team and driving results.\n\nThrough my professional and voluntary experiences I came to develop skills and competencies such as a helicopter view (strategic thinking), leadership, analytical approach, negotiation, storytelling and presenting, stress resistance, critical thinking and consensus seeking.  \n\nFields of interest/experience: corporate social responsibility (CSR), programme & project management, sustainability assessment, strategy and visioning, sustainable business strategies, social entrepreneurship, sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMP), feasibility studies, biobased economy, natural capital analyses (e.g. sustainable business canvas, ecosystem services)\n\nPlease feel free to contact me via liard.kranen@gmail.com",

By helping the ICLEI Network to become sustainable,\u200b low-carbon, ecomobile, resilient, biodiverse, resource-efficient, healthy and happy, with a green economy and smart infrastructure, we impact over 25% of the global urban population.\n\nThe Governance & Social Innovation team develops, coordinates and implements projects and services focused on societal and governance aspects of sustainable development in European cities. \n\nI supported local governments in developing innovative, integrated and participatory management and planning systems. Our team explores issues such as demographic change, social inclusion and new forms of self-organisation in civil society. Activities range from involvement in global advocacy and European projects to services for national and regional governments and individual cities.\n\nAt ICLEI I gained experience in the conceptualisation of guidance materials such as case studies, drafting of reports (e.g. policy briefs), dissemination of information on projects and more generally on issues of Governance and Social Innovation, writing of news articles, the exploitation (business models) of EU projects, I contributed to the acquisition of future projects and writing of project proposals (e.g. H2020), collaboration in the development and delivery of services for local governments (sustainable innovation focused)  in the area of Governance and Social Innovation and the Circular Economy.",
