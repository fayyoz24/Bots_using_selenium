    "summary": "I am an emerging public health specialist, bringing public health (PH) and clinical experience to women\u2019s healthcare and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). I have worked in settings varying from preservice healthcare professional (HCP) training to secondary and tertiary clinical care settings to community-level service delivery in Europe and 4 African countries (Tanzania, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ethiopia) for the last 20 years. At present I am lead-researcher in mixed-method research on contraception and abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with an international team of researchers at Share-Net International (the knowledge platform on SRHR). Also, I supervise students on their master thesis with focus on SRHR and I provide clinical care as medical specialist in a 2nd line gynaecologic outpatient clinic in the Netherlands. I have applied my specialization in gynaecology (2010 onwards) to women\u2019s health and safe motherhood in the Netherlands and low-income countries, combining patient care with PH work. From 2011-2018, I supervised a team delivering women\u2019s healthcare. I introduced innovations such as an advanced approach to laparoscopic gynaecologic surgery and evaluated its effectiveness over the next 2 years. I conducted service audits for 3 years to ensure service quality and improvement. As board member of the Working Party on International Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health (WP ISM&RH) we established a collaboration among 4 international parties in 2015 to improve maternal health in Gondar, Ethiopia with World Vision Ethiopia, Gondar University Hospital and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. We introduced an innovative training for midwives on emergency obstetric and neonatal care. The program transitioned to the national partners after 5 years. I am involved in a working group on the prevention and elimination of cervical cancer at the Global Health Forum, and I am reviewer for BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth. I am fluent in professional written and oral English, writing project proposals, reports, and refereed journal articles. My native language is Dutch. I speak conversational German, French, and Kiswahili (B1 level).",
