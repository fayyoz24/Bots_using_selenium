This included a preliminary design, detailed implementation plans and a pathway to implementation. Deltares' role was to review the first conceptual designs of the envisioned redevelopment of the Manhattan south side. The purpose of the redevelopment is to minimize flood risk to the Financial District and South Street Seaport neighborhoods resulting from daily tidal flooding, coastal storms, and changing precipitation under current and future conditions due to sea level rise. The review focused on affirming or questioning the selection of alignment for the flood protection in the project area from the perspectives of: flood risk, hydrodynamics, scour, ecology, water quality, climate adaptation planning, green infra alternatives.\n\nMy role as a flood resilience expert focuses on strategic advice, critical review of general practice in Manhattan and abroad, formulating recommendations.",

The general objective of this project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation Philanthropy Advisors, was to contribute to the recovery of the hydrological system and the restoration of the Heritage Zone, in order to become resilient to climate change, geological (earthquake and subsidence) risks, socio-economic and environmental issues. A vision for the Heritage Zone was developed integrating resilience, taking water as a main axis to develop the area. A hydrological analysis was undertaken based on groundwater modelling of Mexico Valley and hydraulic modelling of the Xochimilco area. A Water Resilience Plan was developed defining the strategic actions to protect and restore the Heritage Zone\u2019s hydrological system, as part of Mexico City\u2019s Resilience Strategy.  \n\nMy role focused on overall project coordination, hydrological analysis, vision development, stakeholder engagement, leading participatory workshops, and formulation of conceptual project proposals.",

The project design integrates flood protection into the community fabric, improving waterfront open spaces and access. \n\nAt the request of the NYC Manhattan Burrough President's Office, I conducted an external review of the concerns surrounding the ESCR project. I held interviews with representatives of residents, interest groups, community boards, and government officials from the City, State and Federal level. We discussed the project proposal with representatives from the Mayor\u2019s Office, the NYC Department of Design and Construction, NYC Parks, Manhattan Borough President\u2019s Office, and several third-party entities. The input from the stakeholder interviews, the perspective of the City and the project documentation were then combined in an analysis of the concerns surrounding this project relative to the principal objectives stated for the ESCR Project\u2019s design. Finally, we formulated recommendations for improvement of the ESCR project implementation. The New York City Council Newsletter reported on November 12, 2019, that the review report has been critical in reaching agreement between Council Members Chin, Powers and Rivera with Mayor Bill de Blasio on a wide range of community investments and commitmments tied to the construction of the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project.",

Objective of the project, funded by the Municipality of Curridabat, was to contribute to the development of a master plan on urban water management. Elements of particular importance were the river that connects the city with other cities in the same river basin, the biodiversity, a sustainable water infrastructure, and social cohesion. Hydrological and hydraulic models were deployed to model flooding from rainfall and river discharge. The most acute problems were then identified and recommendations were formulated for the city\u2019s master plan. The outcomes of the model calculations were validated during field trips. As a result, urban water management is tailored more closely to the city\u2019s biodiversity ambitions. \n\nMy role as a team lead and urban water expert focused on understanding and analysis of the urban hydrology, leading of participatory workshops and technical sessions, and identification of interventions.",

The goal of the project was to investigate how to tackle this paradox through the use and design of vibrant public space. The project developed generic proposals for implementing blue and green infrastructure in various districts of the city, by combining quality of public space, problem solving water management strategies and creating socially sustainable places in the urban public realm. The project resulted in a strategy for a water sensitive public space in Mexico City.  \n\nMy role as an urban resilience expert focused on hydrological analysis, formulation of urban water management strategies, co-design of blue and green interventions, and presenting in participatory workshops.",
