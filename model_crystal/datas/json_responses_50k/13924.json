    "summary": "Since 2014, Prof. Paul Planken is a group leader at the newly established Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL) in Amsterdam and, simultaneously, holds a position as a full professor at the University of Amsterdam. ARCNL is a center formed as a public/private partnership between the universities of Amsterdam and NWO on the one hand, and the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (Veldhoven) on the other hand.\nHe got his MSc degree in Physics at Leiden University and his PhD from the University of Amsterdam, for work performed at the FOM-Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam.\nFrom 1998-2014 he worked on terahertz generation, detection and applications at the University of Technology Delft, where he was appointed Antoni van Leeuwenhoek professor in 2008. From 1993-1998, he spent five years doing semiconductor experiments at the free-electron laser for infrared experiments FELIX at the FOM-Institute for Plasma Physics Rijnhuizen. \nFrom 1991-1993, he was a postdoc at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, working on coherent terahertz emission from semiconductor hetero-structures under the supervision of dr. Martin Nuss. \n\nCurrently, he works on the ultrafast interaction between light and metals for metrology applications.\n\nProf. Planken has published some 95 refereed papers. He enjoys teaching courses in which he tries to make a connection with the research taking place in his group. \nHe is member of the Optical Society of America (OSA) and was elected fellow of the OSA in 2016.\n\nTopics:  Pump-probe metrology, laser physics, semiconductor physics, non-linear optics, near-field optics, THz science and technology, and nanotechnology",
