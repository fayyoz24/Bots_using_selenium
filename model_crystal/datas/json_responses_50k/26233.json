It was a great opportunity to dive into an intense work setting and to learn and develop my skills through project work. In particular I learned a lot about the principles of optical and mechanical designs, drawings, tolerances and international standards. I was delighted to have the opportunity to present my work at the National Earth Observation Conference in Birmingham University.",

I was assigned the project of investigating the utility of an apparatus including a HeNe laser as a diagnostic tool for combustion experiments. Though a good deal of the work was conducted independently I kept in close contact with the other members of the group and found it great to be able to exchange ideas on not just my own project but on other group members' projects too! At the end of the project I presented my work to the group. During these two months in the group I have developed existing skills such as research, data analysis and communication skills, and learned and improved on relatively new skills such as presentation skills and the running of quantum chemistry simulations. The system that I helped develop is currently in use in combustion experiments in the centre's shock tubes and rapid compression machines.",
