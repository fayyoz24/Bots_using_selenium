S.L. Kerstens acted as a Senior Developer, Scrum Master and Product Owner of the BI&A team that enables DDDM within the CFRO domain of Van Lanschot Kempen, using the Azure Cloud & Microsoft Power Platform.\n\nAt Vanderlande, Sander got the chance to build a central D&A organization from the ground up.

This allowed my colleagues and me to design and build a robust Data Architecture leveraging Data Mesh principles and a surrounding operating model. From this, the Central Analytics Organization (CAO) was born, tasked to increase data accessibility by processing, transforming and enriching data from our source systems into data products in the cloud. To do this, the CAO consists of data engineers, scientists and analysts grouped into several scrum development teams.\nOur stakeholders consist of representatives of all internal business domains like supply, sales, hr, finance, etc. They leverage our products to support decision making on strategic, tactical and operational level.",
