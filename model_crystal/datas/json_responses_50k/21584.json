I provided visa and arrival support, found free accommodation for the interns, and helped them integrate into the local culture. To create a program of the internship, I cooperated with schools, universities, museums, cultural institutions and NGOs to find teaching and cultural exchange opportunities for the interns. Lastly, I also conducted seminars and workshops to assist the interns in the development of their leadership skills. It was an immense learning experience that improved my organizational, management, leadership and intercultural skills."
