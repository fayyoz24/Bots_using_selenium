    "summary": "I am fascinated by science & technology and motivated to integrate applied physics and learning algorithms to solve real-life problems. Passion and curiosity are aimed at translating scientific principles into useable technology which can support critical sectors. \n\nAlong with an applied physics and electronics background, I got both industrial as well as research experience in working with computer vision, AI, and control algorithms. \n\nWith an ambitious personality, I love to face challenging problems around us and drive towards unique solutions. Nature is my inspiration, everything we perceive around us is connected and holds boundless mysteries to be solved. I strongly believe that becoming a keen observer in following fundamental laws of nature will allow us to solve challenging problems in our society.\n\nI usually enjoy everyday challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and gain new experience in my field of work. I love to work towards bridging the gap between academic research and industrial products thereby transforming ideas into innovations for the people.\n\nTools - Python, OpenCV, MATLAB/Simulink, Eclipse Platform, TensorFlow/Pytorch, CANanalyzer, AUTOCAD, ADAMS, C++, ROS, and Git/Gerrit\n\nScientific Interest - Sensor signal processing, Applied Physics, Biomedical systems, Machine learning, and AI, Advanced control systems, and Embedded systems.\n\nTechnical Skills - Computer Vision, Image/Signal Processing, Machine / Deep Learning, Control theory, Sensor Fusion, 2D/3D Modelling & Prototype development, Mechanical & Mechatronics systems.",
