The organization noticed that a lot of extra paper is unexpectedly used for the production of these labels. It was my job to reduce the costs resulting from extra paper consumption, while at the same time working in a sustainability framework. During my internship I have:\n\n- Analysed the printing processes in order to trace the causes of the extra paper consumption\n- Developed solutions to lower the extra consumption of paper\n- Designed an implementation plan on how to reduce the extra consumption of paper. \n- Wrote with the information above a consultancy report for the organization\n-  Finished the internship with a management presentation, presenting all the results and conclusions regarding the extra paper consumption",
