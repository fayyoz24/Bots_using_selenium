    "summary": "I am an MSc student at the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. I work in the faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering and am pursuing the Energy, Flow and Process Technology track of Mechanical Engineering for my master's.\n\nMy general interests lie in the field of continuum mechanics. Throughout my undergraduate years at the Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad, I have explored both the major subdisciplines of continuum mechanics, i.e., solid mechanics and fluid mechanics, via courses, course projects, research internships and my undergraduate thesis. Particularly, I am fascinated by fluid mechanics and its numerous applications in a diverse range of fields. The research projects on fluid mechanics, that I have worked on during my undergraduate years focus on fluid-structure interaction, flapping-wing aerodynamics, room ventilation and computational fluid dynamics. In the field of solid mechanics, I have worked on impact mechanics, fracture mechanics and mechanical vibrations. Currently, I am working as a research intern at Erasmus MC and am researching on cardiovascular blood flow simulation.\n\nApart from research and regular coursework, I enjoy reading, watching movies and learning new languages so as to better understand the world around me and hence shape my academic interests toward its betterment.",

Investigation of degree of freedom of the multi-mass-spring-damper system was performed. Thereafter by using the selected generalized coordinates energy equations of the system are derived in order to obtain Equations of Motion of each generalized coordinate by the Lagrange method. After obtaining Equations of Motion, linearization of mass, stiffness and damping matrixes were  performed around the equilibrium point. Finally, by using these linearized matrices, undamped and damped eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes  were obtained. It was observed that the system did not experience any rigid-body mode and it was slightly damped since the resultant eigenfrequencies of the undamped and damped cases were very similar. Also, the corresponding damping ratios of each eigenfrequency are obtained on the damped case. Finally, after observing that the modal damping assumption holded for the given system, a simulation of the undamped system was performed for unit impulse input for each eigenfrequency. This project was done as a part of the course, Engineering Dynamics ME46055.",

It was observed that the numerical model exhibited the material behaviour of the alloy under dynamic torsional loading, similar to that indicated in experiments, however, a disagreement between the yield stress predicted by the numerical simulation and that reported in experiments was observed. Possible sources of error in the numerical model were cited and further improvements in terms of contact algorithms and meshing strategies were suggested.",

The data regarding the dimensions of the university lecture room were taken for a real classroom at UTokyo.\n\n-Conducted a non-buoyant steady-state simulation, in ANSYS CFX, of air entering through the inlets of the ventilation system and exiting through the outlets, with doors & windows closed. Steady-state simulation of mixing of droplets coming from the ventilation system and that released from a person standing at the door was also conducted to visualize the droplet transmission phenomenon. The mean age of air was calculated to be approximately 5 minutes. The mass fraction of water droplets was found to be between the orders of  1 to 10 microns in the seating region of the students. Examination of the local age of air revealed that it is the highest in the region where the professor sits & the lowest in the students\u2019 seating area.\n\n-The calculated mean age of air and low local age of air in the seating region for students suggested that the ventilation system renewed the air in the room quite quickly and allowed the least exposure in the seating region. The fairly low concentration of water vapour in the seating region of students suggested that there are fewer chances of exposure to contaminated air when the ventilation is operational. The high local age of air near the professor\u2019s desk suggested that CO2 meters should be installed there to monitor air quality & prevent exposure to contaminated air.",

Further modified the algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the data extraction process. Contributed to the development of an extended Euler-Bernoulli beam model of the phenomenon, which was solved numerically and theoretically. Assisted in the data analysis of the data extracted from the image analysis algorithms. This data was later compared with the predictions of the numerical simulation & the theoretical model. Co-authored a paper discussing the said investigation. The paper has been published in Physical Review Fluids (PRF).\n\n-It was found that for a wide range of parameters (such as wave frequency, wave number, amplitude, and fluid layer height), the model agreed with the experiment both qualitatively and quantitatively, without any fit parameters. The results revealed the absence of resonance in the drag-dominated regime. The response of the fibre with the inclusion of inertia effects is also presented. It was concluded that the oscillation of aquatic plants in real flow scenarios is viscous-dominated and hence cannot exhibit a sharp resonance.",
