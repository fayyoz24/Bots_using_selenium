Especially, the area of material procurement and fibre production is getting increasing attention from companies; investments in research and development on materials science have been accelerating. Companies are exploring sustainable substitutes as alternatives to commonly used materials. R&D focuses on development of new fibres, textiles, finishes, as well as other material innovations. \n\nThe objective of this research paper, therefore, is to assess the lifecycle of materials used in fashion, thereby to identify any sustainability trends and challenges related to sustainable fibre production and end-of-life of materials. Moreover, the authors want to explore the possibilities of extending the lifecycle of materials and to move towards a more circular economy through approaches like recycling and cradle-to-cradle. Besides, the objective is to further identify and assess sustainability measures used by companies in the fashion industry.",

At this point, the processes of handling in-kind donations at Caritas Wien have developed in a rather \u201cgrown\u201d manner along the years of operating. There is neither a clear nor concise big picture of the supply chain activities involved, and they wish to reorganize the handling of its in-kind donations.  \nHence, the objective of this project is the documentation and visualization of the current processes to handle in-kind donations, but also the identification and assessment of proper concepts and methods to improve the handling of such processes at Caritas Wien.",
