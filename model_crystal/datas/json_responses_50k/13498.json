In cooperation with other board members and volunteers, I developed, implemented, and managed various campaigns, events, and seminars that advocated Agenda 2030 and raised awareness of the UN. In collaboration with the Chair, I wrote the UN Youth of Helsinki's annual work plan as well as the annual report and contributed to resource mobilization. As a team, we successfully fundraised donations for a development cooperation programme in Zimbabwe. I participated in organizing two study trips: a UNSCR 2250-themed excursion to Copenhagen and Sustainable Food Production-themed excursion to Rome. In Copenhagen, we visited UN Women, IOM, and UNFPA and discussed the thematics on youth, peace, and security whereas in Rome we learned more about sustainable food production from FAO, WFP, and IFAD."

I facilitated advocacy messages and created visual and written content for social media channels (Facebook, Instagram & Twitter), maintained and updated the UN Youth of Helsinki's website as well as created newsletters. In addition to the awareness-raising through social media, I gained event management and organizational skills by planning and executing various campaigns and seminars. The events I was part of organizing included seminars on Climate Change and Resource Wisdom, Children's and Adolescents' Mental Health from Human Rights perspective, and, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, in which I also facilitated the expert panel discussion. I also designed and implemented a zero-waste advocacy campaign and handled various administrative tasks. Further, I represented the UN Youth of Helsinki in different events, such as UNDP's 'Journey to Extremism in Africa' report launch and 'Survivors' photo exhibition. In a meeting with the UN Under-Secretary-general and Executive Director of the UNFPA, Dr. Natalia Kanem I discussed SRHR and youth involvement in decision making. As a volunteer of UN Youth of Helsinki, I got valuable experience in programming, project implementation, and management as well as working with different partners and stakeholders."
