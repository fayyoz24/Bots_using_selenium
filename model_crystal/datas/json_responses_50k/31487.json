As a guest lecturer at this department I teach the students on the latest developments and industry improvements and help them to get ready for the corporate world.\n\nTeaching at this University is a challenge and also a privilege. Dealing with the differences in language en culture makes this an interesting job and it is fun to be different in the way of teaching. The university teaches knowledge from science where I apply the practical daily knowledge and experience from the field. This makes an interesting combination for teaching and as I like to experiment in the classroom, the students seem to like the different ways I take.",
