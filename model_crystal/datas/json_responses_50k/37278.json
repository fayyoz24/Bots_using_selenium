    "summary": "Extensive experience with capital markets, fund raising (raised over \u20ac40 million for more than 200 clients and owned companies) and financial reporting for companies operating at a global level in different stages of their life cycle. Profound interest in Africa and Aquaculture as fields to make a sustainable impact.   \n\nDuring my studies I started with my two business partner RotaSocio Holding BV, a company that focuses on the development of innovative mobility solutions. The first project was StudentCar, the car-sharing provider for students in the Netherlands. After a round of business angel funding we were able to grow StudentCar to more then 1.000 users in 12 cities. Later on we introduced the first electrical shared car in the Netherlands. In 2012 StudentCar/RotaSocio Holding was being acquired by the second largest car-sharing provider in the Netherlands, ConnectCar/KAV Holding.\n\nAfter that I was delighted to be able to contribute to a new era of finance within Symbid, an equity crowdfunding platform I co-founded. We envision a world with transparent financial markets, where entrepreneurs and investors collectively realize their dreams and create sustainable value. On our funding platform we build trustworthy connections between ambitious entrepreneurs and investors looking for business ideas they believe in. \nStarted in 2011 as one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms in the world, so far we have successfully funded over 230 innovative business who all want to make an impact to the world. A total of over \u20ac32 million was invested by our networks of over 55.000 connected investors. Successful exits have been realized by investors. Symbid was acquired in 2019 by ILFA group. \n\nAfter the acquisition of Symbid I became CFO at the Ilfa group. Ilfa is a treasury and funding specialist offering services to SME's, corporates and non-profit organizations. Ilfa has mediated over \u20ac2 billion in funding for its clients over the course of the years. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 showed me I wanted to spent some more time with the family. For 6 months we took a long break and toured around with our camper, which ended up being an amazing time off with the family discovering some of the most beautiful places Europe has to offer.\n\nIn 2021 I started as CFO / COO of AfricaWeb, where I have been contributing to the growth of the company to 100 FTE by becoming market leader in online news in several African countries. I love to work together with my colleagues in different countries like Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Nigeria.",
