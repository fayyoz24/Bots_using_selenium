    "summary": "A decade ago, I started my career as an Industrial Design Engineer working on the development of new products. What started to irritate me was the hypocrisy of sourcing virgin materials from distant countries while walking to the plastic container once a week. \n\nTogether with like minded engineers, I Co-Founded better Future Factory, a product design & engineering studio helping brands and organizations make the switch to sustainable plastic products. We believe that plastic is a unique material which can be part of a sustainable and circular economy. \n\nI am a hands-on Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with a strong analytical mind. With an engineering background, a curiosity for plastic and over 10 years experience in sustainable product development, I am specialized in moving companies forward to a world were we use plastic in the best possible way, not the worst. \n \nArea\u2019s of expertise \n- circular economy\n- new plastics economy \n- sustainable use of plastic \n- processing recycled plastic \n- sustainable packaging\n- plastic recycling\n- 3D printing\n",

Through developing the Broodnodig 010, a digester that turns bread waste into biogas, bakers can use their discarded bread to power their ovens.\n\nYURKO's role within BroodNodig is mainly supportive, helping out with its market research, guiding the interns' research projects and maintaining the website's blog and other communication channels.",

Our team was responsible for setting up the first brand for 3D-printer ink that is made from fully recycled plastics.\n\nThis required research and development to use fully recycled plastic as filament for FDM 3D-printers, setting up supply chains & quality control and branding & sales of products. Refil was the first brand to implement fully recycled cardboard spools as packaging which has become an industry standard.\n\nRefil was discontinued in 2020 since its sustainable innovations were widely adopted by the market. The team of Better Future Factory now focusses on new area to innovate in plastic recycling.",
