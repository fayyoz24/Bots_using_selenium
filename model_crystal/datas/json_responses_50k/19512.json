                    "description": "Very early on Satyakam Mohkamsing showed a keen interest in Indian music and arts. At the age of seven Satyakam travelled with his parents to Varanasi in India, where his father was doing research on the Natya Shastra, an ancient Indian work on the performing arts, including theatre, dance and music. During this prolonged stay of about nine months in Varanasi, he took his first lessons in visual arts and music. Soon he developed a passion for the Indian violin and began his musical training under the guidance of Satyaprakash Mohanti, an advanced student of Dr. N. Rajam, one of India\u2019s leading violinists. \n \nBack in the Netherlands, he became a student of Ms Lenneke van Staalen, herself a Dutch virtuoso student of the renowned Indian violinist Pandit D. K. Datar. In 2004 Satyakam migrated with his parents to Surinam, South America, where he immediately joined the local Indian Cultural Centre (ICC) for musical training. There he studied under highly qualified vocalists such as V.K. Sambyal \u2018Rangilewale\u2019 Thakur and Rita Bokil. In 2006 Satyakam returned to the Netherlands to pursue his formal musical training enrolling in Codarts, the former Rotterdam Music Academy. He studied Indian violin under the guidance and supervision of the legendary Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia and Pt. Dhruba Ghosh. As Satyakam combined his studies in the Netherlands and India he also received training from Dr. N. Rajam until 2011.  In 2010 Satyakam obtained his BA from Codarts and his Masters in 2012.  Satyakam received training from Pt. Dhruba Ghosh and continued his studies in Mumbai at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan until 2017. After the sudden Demise of pt. Dhruba Ghosh (07/10/2017)  Satyakam decided to continue his studies in India and transferred to Delhi to study at the Shri Ram Bharatiya Kala Kendra as a student of the Sarod maestro Pt. Biswajit Roy Chowdhury to the present",
