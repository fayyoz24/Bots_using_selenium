    "summary": "I am a senior software engineer and consultant based in Amsterdam working at Reaktor. In addition, I am a member of the Netherland-America Foundation Alumni Committee to strengthen ties between the US and the Netherlands. I am also an ambassador in the Young Minds program at the John Adams Institute, the cultural and academic extension of the United States Embassy in the Netherlands. \n\nIn 2022 I completed my postgraduate Masters in tech, learning design and innovation Harvard University as a Netherland-America Foundation & Fulbright Scholar. I also studied tech public policy at MIT. I performed research on the root of the gender gap in the technology industry and developed an inclusion in tech hackathon to foster a sense of belonging for high school students globally who otherwise would never consider further education or fulfilling careers in tech. \n\nI am a committed diversity in tech ambassador, and have organized and participated in many community events, workshops, hackathons, panels, talks and helped publish a book on Women in Tech for the British Computer Society. I have had the pleasure of teaching Python and web development to over 400 women since 2015, and have greatly enjoyed watching their growth as engineers and tech educators. Most recently I organised a global hackathon with Reaktor and the SheSharp community for women in tech.\n\nAwards and Honors\nWomen in Software Power List Winner (2020 and 2021), TechWomen100 Winner (2019), Scotland Women in Technology's Rising Star Finalist (2019), Top 25 under 30: Code First Girls' Ones to Watch List (2019), University of St Andrews Student Leader of the Year (2017), Scotland Women in Technology's Gender Diversity Champion of the Year (2017). etc.\n\nPersonal website: sjoukje.netlify.com",
