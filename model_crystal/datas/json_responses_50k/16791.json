    "summary": "\u2605 Where there's a will, there's a way \u2605\n\nA phrase I like to keep in mind. I really believe that if your are determined enough, you can find a way to achieve what you want, even if it\u2019s very difficult! \n\nOne of my ambitions in life is to be actively involved in conservation activities aimed at halting the loss of biodiversity. I would love to conduct conservation research to contribute to a better understanding of animal populations (both in the wild and in zoos) and to organize campaigns to educate people about biodiversity and nature conservation. My aim is to create awareness, in order to protect our beautiful nature.     \n\nDuring my studies, I have developed most of my interest and skills when it comes to setting up researches and analyzing the results. Furthermore, as a manager at Bison Bowling Maarssen, I gained experience with leadership, developing & organizing campaigns, external communication through websites & social media, and liaising with suppliers, guests and business relations.\n\nI would describe myself as and enthusiastic, positive and results-oriented person, with a great sense of responsibility. I have a love for nature, like to socialize with friends and to travel the world to experience new things. \n\n============================================================================\nContact information:  \u2709 rowan_stolwijk@hotmail.com\n============================================================================\n\nKey words: nature conservation \u22c6 animal behavior \u22c6 biodiversity \u22c6 scientific research \u22c6 zoo conservation \u22c6 breeding programs \u22c6 population management \u22c6 nature education \u22c6 marketing \u22c6 communication \u22c6 ethology and welfare  \n\n\n\n\n",

One of these threats is natural predation, which can increase when humans interfere by introducing new predators or increasing natural predators in numbers. The goal of this research was to investigate the influence of natural predation on marine turtle populations nesting in Suriname, in order to develop new conservation strategies. Field monitoring was performed to assess the current situation at the two major nesting beaches of Suriname. Data on the nesting sea turtle population were collected and signs of predation were recorded. Using this data, it was tried to determine the vulnerability of sea turtles nesting in Suriname to natural predation.",

Since conflicts are stressful, victims of conflicts engage in post-conflict social interactions like reconciliation and redirection to reduce their stress response. In this research, I tested the hypothesis that post-conflict social interactions cause a faster termination of the stress response because they reduce the risk of renewed attacks. Furthermore, I investigated the influence of social deprivation on post-conflict stress behaviour, since socially deprived monkeys show socially incompetent behaviour, intense anxiety reactions and no reconciliation. An observational study was conducted with socially reared and socially deprived rhesus macaques, in which data on stress behaviour of victims was collected using the PC/MC method.",
