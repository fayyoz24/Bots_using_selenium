In this project, the effect of different lesion-filling methods on the performance of several common non-linear registration methods was assessed. Lesions were simulated and then filled, and registration performance was assessed through Dice overlap and Haussdorff distance for a number of anatomical regions. Results show that generally, performance of the registration methods was degraded by introducing lesions, but largely restored by lesion filling.\n\n\nUpdated 9th of July: Last week I defended my 10-month during internship at the VUmc as a MSc student with a final mark of 8,6. My written report was marked with a 9.0 by both reviewers. My thesis was about \" the effect of lesion-filling on non-linear registration methods in Multiple sclerosis\". \n\nFeedback from the supervisors: \"Rick has shown to master a complex project in fine detail. He clearly demonstrated this in the question round providing to-the-point answers.\" \n\nI want to specially thank my first reviewer Hugo Vrenken and second reviewer Joost Kuijer for the coorporation and possibilities achieved within the MRI field. Besides, I want to thank Alexandra de Sitter for the daily supervision and all other colleagues of the RNG department whom were related to my research.",
