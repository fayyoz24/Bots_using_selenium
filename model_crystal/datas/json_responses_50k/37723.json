    "summary": "I help organizations that desire to move beyond the traditional management hierarchy. By using structured forms of self-management (such as Holacracy), I help you make the leap to a next stage in development. Organizations I work with become more oriented towards purpose, unlocking the huge potential and creativity of liberated and inspired people. I am a licensed Holacracy Coach and certified Integral Coach.\n\nInspired by numerous life-events and career-experiences, I am passionate about the evolution of individuals, organizations and humanity. I believe we are in the middle of a collective breakthrough and I want to contribute to that, bringing my own presence, experience and gifts to the organizations and people that cross my path. Integral philosophy, Reinventing Organizations and Spiral Dynamics are some of the sources of my view on personal and organizational development.\n\nBefore starting as an independent consultant/coach, I was a consultant and manager in Accenture's Health and Public Service division in Amsterdam for four years. I lead projects on analytics and data science. I made a six-month trip through Africa following my work in water management and diplomatic service for the Dutch Government in The Hague and Tokyo.\n\nMaster of Science degree in Physics and Astronomy (Cum Laude). Fifteen years working experience in various parts of the private and public sector, consulting, IT (data science) and international experience. I speak Dutch, English, German, Japanese and some French.\n\nEmpathic and intuitive heart combined with a strong analytical mind. Other passions include meditation/yoga/tantra, space (science, travel, technology),  development/integral philosophy and nature (landscapes, mountains, vastness). I live in Rijswijk and co-parent my daughter (8).",

A first step is often to capture the purpose and the work that is done by your organization into a dynamic, explicit and clear set of roles and accountabilities. This enables new ways of communicating, more autonomy, clarity and co-creating.\n\nI often collaborate with specialized bureau's such as Energized.org, Synnervate, Het Eerste Huis and others.",
