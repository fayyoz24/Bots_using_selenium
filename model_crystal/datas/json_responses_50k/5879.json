An additional objective at the center of this work experience was the improvement of my written and spoken skills in French. By actively working in a professional French-speaking environment, and with one day a week designated to French classes, I was able to improve my French to a professional working level.\n\nThe experience included a training and preparation period at the IRC Headquarters in The Hague, followed by a placement at IRC's Burkina Faso country office, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",
