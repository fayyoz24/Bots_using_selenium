PaJMa\nenables to represent the process based on the patient view, which leads to a deep\nunderstand of the process and improvement suggestions. The statistical analysis and\nsimulation are indispensable to quantitatively evaluate the emergency care process,\ndetermine patient arrival rates, waiting time and staff performance. The goal of this case\nstudy is to apply Patient Journey Modeling, statistical analysis and simulation to model a\nreal case and analyze it. Since these tools are effective to study and represent\nemergency departments\u2019 process, the simulation results were compatible with the reality\nof the Walk-in clinic and what-if scenarios could be developed in order to suggest\nimprovements. The PaJMa of the Walk-in clinic developed with Visio software indicated\nthe different steps, documents, staff role and technology involved in the clinic process.\nStatistical analysis and simulation led to important results as well: there is a discrepancy\nbetween morning and afternoon shifts and how an extra doctor in the busiest hours can\nhelp to reduce the clinical visit queue.",
