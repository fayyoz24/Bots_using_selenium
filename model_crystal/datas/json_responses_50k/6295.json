    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Andrea, an award-winning Executive Producer and Change Agent that\u2019s produced impact-driven and branded content for a global audience for 20 years. \n\nMy work is social and viral, including stand-alone short films as well as episodic documentary series.  I\u2019ve focused on topics related to the increasing climate crisis: from keystone species awareness, to the illegal pet trade, to the stories of activists and environmental leaders.  As well as a feature documentary on the Pope, just in case.\n\nI\u2019ve met and worked with a lot of talented people and have a knack for assembling teams with strong chemistry and passion of the work.  I work closely with client partners to help you tell your story: balancing creative, strategy, and impact, with your budget and production.  Wherever feasible I look for low-carbon solutions to help tread more lightly on our friend the Earth.\n\nI'm currently producing short films and content on our global food systems, geeking out on how we can help mitigate the climate crisis through our food choices.\n\nPowered by sunshine, plants, and nature.",
