It started off as an initiative by a Palestinian and an Israeli student who overcame their preconceptions of each other and culminated in a three-day event with student-led workshops and guest lectures from experts in war journalism, development work, politics and diplomacy. The highlight was the opening of an Israeli-Palestinian Youth Parliament, which will serve as a forum for youngsters to voice their opinion about the ongoing conflict and search for solutions. In the years to come we will be building upon the foundations laid by the first organisers and we have already started working on next year\u2019s conference. After having co-organised 4 peace conferences at UWC Atlantic College and supervised another 4 peace conferences at UWC Maastricht I have passed on the staff supervision role.",

            "description": "On the weekend 06 April, the Global Faculty organised a workshop at UWC Atlantic College where 30 students were trained in meaningful volunteering abroad, instead of \u201cvoluntourism\u201d.  The weekend was all about intercultural engagement and volunteering. Willy Oppenheim from OMPRAKASH was invited to the college to discuss gap years, international volunteering, and bigger questions about the purposes and possibilities of our own formal and informal educational experiences.  Through a series of workshop-style activities, Willy encouraged the practice of 'looking deeply' at our own intentions and the world around us, and by doing so will push UWC Atlantic College students to think beyond the gloss of popular buzzwords like 'global citizenship,' 'service-learning,' and 'empowerment.' You've probably already heard people say that 'knowledge is power,' but Willy took this insight a few steps further by using Paulo Freire's idea of 'praxis' to ask what it means to 'know the world,' and what it takes to open new pathways for change. Overall, Willy's goal emphasized that as privileged 'global citizens' we need to worry about the fact that good intentions are not enough, and that they can have unintended consequences\u2014 but rather than let this recognition make us cynical or passive, we should let it inspire us to become more humble, reflexive, and critically-informed social actors.",

Students took part in the activities by exploring different political systems and discussing to what extent our voices are being heard. A range of various specialists were invited to join the conference to share their experiences and offer their views on what is happening around us.\nJan Egeland, who currently serves as Human Rights Watch\u2019s executive director of Europe, opened the conference. He gave the students 10 valuable lessons from the peace processes he has been involved in, from \u2018Make an effort to fully understand the conflict,\u2019 to \u2018You can only achieve peace when the parties are really ready for it\u2019. Srdja Popovic, executive director of the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) and student leader of the non-violent protests against Milosevic in Serbia, talked about how and why non-violent protest is better than approaching a conflict violently. William Schabas, Professor of International Law at Middlesex University, offered an insight into what should happen to a country once the violent conflict has ended. The guest speakers allowed the students to look at conflict through the eyes of a conflict mediator, an activist and an international lawyer. The overall message of the day was one of empowerment. One student said, \u201cI had become a bit cynical seeing so much conflict and violence happening around the globe. Today has given me the strength and faith that I can make a difference and shouldn\u2019t wait for others to confront those who oppress us.\u201d The conference provided an increased knowledge and understanding into how conflict can be approached non-violently and how confidence can help in the role that we can play.",

That, at least, is how the international Catholic peace movement Pax Christi sees it, as they encourage congregations across the world to reflect on the World Peace message of the Pope. But what is peace? Does military power promote it, or hinder it? And in what ways is it possible for ordinary people to make a difference? This week Roy Jenkins brings together four people who have each been engaged in the struggle, albeit in very different ways, to discuss their concepts of peace. Pat Gaffney is General Secretary of Pax Christi; Matthew Dobbs, served as an officer in the British Army in Kosovo and Bosnia and is now an Anglican priest in South Wales; Jane Harries, from Bridgend, is a Quaker and peace activist; and Chiel Mooij teaches at Atlantic College at St Donats in the Vale of Glamorgan, where he\u2019s Head of Peace and Conflict Studies.",

In the first year, over 35% of students at UWC Atlantic College have decided to take the course, at either Higher or Standard Level.\n\nThe study of Global Politics enables students to critically engage with new perspectives and approaches to politics, in order to better make sense of this changing world and their role in it as active citizens. Global Politics is an exciting dynamic subject which draws on a variety of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, reflecting the complex nature of many contemporary political issues. It explores fundamental political concepts such as power, rights, liberty and equality, in a range of contexts. \n\nThe course allows students to develop an understanding of the local, national, international and global dimensions of political activity, as well as allowing them the opportunity to explore political issues affecting their own lives. It helps students to understand abstract political concepts by grounding them in real world examples and case studies. It also invites comparison between such examples and case studies to ensure a transnational perspective.\n\nThe core units of the course together make up a central unifying theme of \u201cpeople, power and politics.\u201d The emphasis on people reflects the fact that the course explores politics not only at a state level but also explores the function and impact of non-state actors, communities and individuals.",

The course was founded at UWC Atlantic College and as School Based Syllabus has fed into the new Global Politics course, intended to be offered worldwide from 2015.\n\nPeace and Conflict Studies demands a transdisciplinary approach, combining elements of subjects such as History, Economics, Political Thought, World Religions, Social Psychology and Anthropology. The course is \u2018value-based\u2019 insofar as it encourages peace rather than violence, but the intention is not to \u2018pacify\u2019 students or to persuade them to ignore or avoid conflict. Indeed, Peace and Conflict Studies values conflict as a means of achieving positive change. The course will inevitably concern itself with the analysis of aggression and violence, since only by understanding those phenomena can students learn how they might be reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe educational philosophy that underpins this course values student discussion over lecturing by the teacher, and values learning through experience over the studying of vast amounts of content. The teacher should therefore set out to create a learning environment where students feel free to speak their minds and engage in critical and constructive debate. This will enable students to learn from peers who might have different or even contradictory perceptions of peace and conflict. By using different instructional formats, Peace and Conflict Studies will be a real learning experience that will encourage students to think and reflect on their own and others\u2019 attitudes and behaviour.",

It is the process of recording, reconstructing and interpreting the past through the investigation of a variety of sources. It is a discipline that gives people an understanding of themselves and others in relation to the world, both past and present.\nStudents of history should learn how the discipline works. It is an exploratory subject that poses questions without providing definitive answers. In order to understand the past, students must engage with it both through exposure to primary historical sources and through the work of historians. Historical study involves both selection and interpretation of data and critical evaluation of it. Students of history should appreciate the relative nature of historical knowledge and understanding, as each generation reflects its own world and preoccupations and as more evidence emerges. A study of history both requires and develops an individual\u2019s understanding of, and empathy for, people living in other periods and contexts.\n\nThe Europe and the Middle East option covers major trends in Europe and the Middle East in the period from the mid 18th century to the end of the 20th century. Europe and the Middle East are geographically close, and their similarities and differences have resulted in periods of cooperation and enmity. Major developments included revolutions; the decline of empires and the establishment of nation states; political, social and economic reforms; and the emergence of dictatorships and the re-emergence of democracy.
