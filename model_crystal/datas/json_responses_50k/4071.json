    "summary": "Hozan Zangana was born in 1983 in Kirkuk. In 1998, at age fifteen Hozan Zangana fled Kurdistan and applied for asylum in The Netherlands. There he studied at the esteemed art and design universities Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam and Design Academy Eindhoven. \nAfter his graduation Hozan Zangana was awarded a grant for Talent Development Creative Industries (Stimuleringsfonds). This allowed him to realise his first collection of abstract objects inspired by the original 7th century Kufic script titled \u2018Shaping from Intuition\u2019, which he went on to show in Dubai, Milan and New York. His first commissioned work, \u2018Arbela\u2019, was by the Ministry of Culture of Kurdistan, Iraq. It was inspired by the old Erbil citadel and presented on site in 2018. \nHozan Zangana\u2019s singular practice of heritage-based design has steadily evolved to include an ever-wider range of materials, techniques, collaborations, and contexts. The works, inspired by language, traditions, and rituals, offer new life to ancient heritage; silent objects in a wounded world that encourage human connection.\n\nwww.hozanzangana.com",
