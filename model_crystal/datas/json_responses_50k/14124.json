    "summary": "The vision of EbiyeTours is one of enabling individuals, families or groups to increase their satisfaction and stress relief by providing opportunities for wellness, recreation, and health through tourism. I graduated from InHolland University studying international business management. \n\nMy course subjects involved considerable marketing, finance and logistics. I valued the opportunity to work intensively in a team environment, enhancing my interpersonal and networking skills. This was also reflected in my participation in 'Energy Battles' with GasUnie and my participation in the 2001 Rotterdam Cultural of Europe. I now hope to make a difference and contribute positively through the world of travel",
