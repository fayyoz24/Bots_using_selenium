    "summary": "Throughout my life I have always had two great passions; learning about the world by traveling\nand gaining first-hand experiences, and science through understanding what is known and\nbeing naturally curious of the unknown. After completing my bachelor\u2019s degree at Trinity\nCollege Dublin, I took a year out and attempted to circumnavigate the globe by bicycle. Exciting\nas this adventure was, I still found myself trying to stay updated with the world of physics in\nany way that I could. I kept in contact with colleagues in the academic world and I also brought\nsome books along with me, including one of my favorites which is Lev Landau's Course of\nTheoretical Physics.\n\nAfter this trip an opportunity to teach English in Japan arose which I decided to take on a fixed-\nterm contract. This allowed me to travel more in Japan and learn the language. However, as\ntime went on, I could soon see that my passion for physics grew deeper and I realized that my\nlong-term ambition is and always will be, a career in physics. I soon decided to give up the life I\nhad been building and asked my wife to join me as I enrolled in the Physics and Astronomy\ncourse here at Radboud University. I have not regretted this choice.\n\nWhile I have a very broad interest in Physics as a whole, I have focused heavily on gravity and\naim to complete the \u201cGravity +\u201d specialization uniquely offered at Radboud. I\nam also working on my thesis on continuous gravitational waves (CWs) and I am gaining a lot of\nexperience working with modelling and data analysis techniques. In particular I am working on proposing a search for CWs by reducing the theoretical parameter space using more accurate models and using modern software packages such as LalApps. \n\nNaturally, working on my master thesis project has allowed me to become familiar with the literature on CWs and has given me first hand experience with modern data analysis software, primarily written in Python and the C programming language.",
