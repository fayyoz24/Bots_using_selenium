More than two years ago, Atelier HSL (they provide art projects around the Hi-Speed train Amsterdam/Paris) decided to ask Jan de Bont to create a \"speed\" experience. And to their great surprise, he said: \u201cyes, that sounds like fun!\u201d... Jan then put a proposal on paper, followed by the associated (art) budget. Jan de Bont: \u201cA year and a half later, the telephone rang and \u2013 which I had not expected at all \u2013 Nelly Voorhuis from Atelier HSL said that she had collected the money and that it could now happen very quickly\u201d.  The 3rd part, the projection, was perhaps the biggest challenge. How do you show four 3D projections at the same time? It's never been done before, so no one could guarantee it would work. One thing we knew for sure: we didn't want active 3D (with a transmitter that sends a signal to your glasses). We were pretty sure that wouldn't work with multiple 3D projections. So we opted for passive 3D, but for that you suddenly need 8 professional projectors and it was only when Paul Pasveer of JVC-Benelux offered to sponsor the project that Atelier-HSL gave the \"go\" to actually implement the project.  In the end we worked for three days with nine people in LP2 (Rotterdam) on the construction of the installation. On Tuesday evening Jan arrived (directly from LA) to have a look at his installation for the first time. Until now everyone had only seen the separate parts and for the first time everything came together. Jan de Bont: \u201cThat was truly a magical moment\u201d. The \u201cmaking of\u201d can be found at www.lp2.nl and at www.vimeo.com. You can see an impression of the installation at www.DWDD.nl (the Jackals of October 8, 1011).",
