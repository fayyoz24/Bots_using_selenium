    "summary": "Angelina Kozhevnikova is an Artist and Researcher and is the Founder and Director of Animaspace, a Rotterdam-based studio exploring human-machine-environment communication, collaboration and co-design.\n\nBeing simultaneously an artist and a female scientist at the forefront of technology, she offers a unique and sometimes radical perspective on our relationship with machines and the environment. Her projects challenge technology's role by offering open-ended and collaborative scenarios to imagine alternative possible applications and modes of relation to emerging technologies. Communicating these ideas with the help of mixed media (film, prototypes, interactive installations and performances), her artistic practice becomes an experimental field research lab in a constant transition.\n\nShe holds a Master of Architecture and Urbanism degree with Distinction from the Architectural Association Design Research Laboratory in London (AA DRL) and a Bachelor of Architecture from Moscow Architectural Institute with the Research Exchange in Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo.\n\nHer work was exhibited at the Venice Biennale, London Design Biennale, Kaliningrad Regional Museum of History and Art, Semibreve Festival, Oyoun Berlin and Zaha Hadid Gallery. Publications mentioning the studio's projects include CNN, Wallpaper*, DesignWeek, Clatham House and CLOT Magazine.\n\nShe is the Winner of the Edigma Semibreve Award (2022) and nominated for the Lumen Prize Interactive/3D Award (2022). Additionally, she was awarded the HVA Research of the Year Prize (2023) (as part of AUAS Robot Lab) and was listed as the author of one of the boldest design proposals of 2021 by CNN, along with Tesla, BMW and Sony's innovation groups.",
