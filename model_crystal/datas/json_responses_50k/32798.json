    "summary": "I'm a third-year Aerospace Engineering student at TU Delft with a keen eye on teamwork and critical thinking. At this point in my studies I have the most experience with system design, especially when concerning eVTOL design as I've spent the majority of my Honours program researching mission uncertainty quantification and how this effects the convergence of the design. I'm currently seeking an exciting internship or student team opportunity preferably in the Aerospace field for my next academic year. As I'm planning on taking a break between my Bachelor and Master degree.\n\nIn addition to my studies, I'm also actively involved in the Honours program at TU Delft, serving on the Honours board and working to improve education on behalf of all the Honours students. I have a strong background in Python and am always looking for ways to expand my skills and knowledge.\n\nI'm excited to explore new opportunities and make meaningful contributions to the aerospace industry!",
