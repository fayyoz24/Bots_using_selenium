    "summary": "I am a French student currently completing a MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft University in the Netherlands. I am specialising in Control theory and Simulation. I completed my bachelor in Aerospace engineering and a Minor in Computer Science with a specialization track in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, and am currently working as a simulation engineer at the Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) dream team.\n\nI was exposed to a particularly international environment early on, starting in Paris (France), where I was born, to successively Doha (Qatar), Casablanca (Morocco), Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and finally Delft (Netherlands). This constant exposure to new contexts and mindsets, along with me studying in two different educational systems (the French system and the IB) gave me the chance to greatly foster a curious nature and an open-minded attitude. It also gave me the opportunity to learn to approach, analyze, and ultimately solve complex problems in an effective and organized way.\n  \nIn addition to that, I spent a significant amount of time gaining experience in a number of various fields, including academic work (e.g. scientific papers, minor studies), and practical experience (e.g. design exercises, personal programming projects) in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, and (big) data analysis. I also spend my free time developing skills in my personal interests, with fields such as economics, new technologies (e.g. blockchain, and cryptocurrency) through reading, and trading as a hobby).\n\nBeing curious in nature, I am looking forward to pushing forward research, development, and ultimately progress through an atypical background combining my knowledge of Aerospace Engineering, the power of Computer Science, and an overall curiosity for what the future holds.",

Notable ones include:\n\n- A fully autonomous navigation system for a racing drone competition, based on various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithms used include Double Deep Reinforcement learning (with prioritized replay), and Deep Deterministic Policy gradient methods. The project was done as part of the final bachelor project. \n\n- An advanced version of the trading algorithm started during my minor, including a powerful evolutionary algorithm implementation, a completely re-written for efficiency economic analysis tool along with a number of trade simulations and backtesting strategies. The algorithm also attempts to leverage the power of lstm networks to generate further data abstractions.\n\n- An aircraft noise time-series analysis, focusing on evaluating various aspects of the sound spectrum to attempt at quantifying noise annoyance generated by aircrafts takeoffs.",

A Q learning algorithm was implemented to allow for training bots to evolve in a intelligent fashion, however the relatively high complexity and the dynamic properties of the environment combined with the challenges of crowd learning requires more advanced learning methods (deep Q learning is currently being developed)\n\n-  An elementary but modular implementation of a personal virtual assistant, capable of picking up and recognising simple pre-written commands such as queries on personal calendar, processing them by fetching events online and producing a spoken response",
