I won the battle and was chosen to represent Focus and WTV all summer through their social media channels. All summer long I cruised around in West-Vlaanderen to different kinds of events (big festivals, small local events, concerts, kidsevents, etc.). \n\nAs their online reporter I was updating their channels in real-time. This turned out to be easier said than done! My task upon arrival was: finding the right people to interview, taking cool pictures (transform into right formats), adapting the content for the different channels and different target audiences and come up with cool ideas that translate the vibe of the event into social content.\n\nBesides on-the-spot content creation, the most challenging aspect was getting out of your comfort zone. Going to events alone, daring to take your place among professional journalists, interviewing artists, interviewing regular people, turning flat situations into online content with entertainment value, etc. Since that summer, I've never been nervous anymore to dive into the unknown.\n\nAll of my work is still online at: http://www.focus-wtv.be/dossier/focus-en-wtv-festivalzomer",
