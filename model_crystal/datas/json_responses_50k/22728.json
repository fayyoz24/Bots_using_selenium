    "summary": "I am fluent in sustainability and interested in its translation to business. I use knowledge to create bridges between disciplines and as a result create innovative solutions. Currently, I am in my second year of Forest and Nature Conservation at Wageningen University and Research. Next to my master, I am doing the entrepreneurs track and am a co-founder of the start up BrewRight. \n\nI have a bachelor in Watermanagement bachelor of science, majoring in Aquatic Eco Technology at the HZ University of Applied Sciences. I have always been involved in many extracurricular activities, such as chairwoman of DASA (student association), student representative and joined the Honours Program by making a documentary in sustainable fashion in 3 metropolitan cities. For my bachelor thesis I created a sustainable bioplastics to replace current plastic used for embellishments. \n\nI have an international mindset and am a well rounded person. I lived abroad in Australia, the UK and did my minor in Canada at the University of Waterloo. Overall, I am interested in topics such as conservation, sustainable fashion, sustainable agriculture, spatial planning and ecological engineering, circularity and the bio-based economy.",

My focal species is the Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni) by looking at both the zoo population (EAZA zoos) and private collection. Giving insight into the origin of individuals by utilising mitochondrial DNA and creating a haplotype network. Haploytpe knowledge is important for breeding strategies between EAZA zoos. Additionally, I created a standardised method to take pictures of shield morphology (phenotipic). This method is now integrated in the species guidelines (EAZA). These pictures are the data set used in a machine learning program to determine wild from bred tortoises. In the future this program be continuously trained in order to give more useful insights into problems related to conservation of the species. This strategy has the potential to be applicable to a wide range of species.",

The main focus of this project was to answer \"What is the importance of aquaculture in the fashion industry to combat climate change\". The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter after the oil industry as well as plays a huge contribution to the issue with micro plastics in aquatic water bodies. My motivation was to find ways in aquaculture to solve some of the biggest issues. \n\nThis journey started with an extensive desktop research into the fibers, pigments and binding material that can replace some of the polluting and backwards methods used in the fashion and textile industry. \nBased on the theoretical part afterwards I made the switch to application and practical side. This started with brainstorming of multiple solutions, validating the opportunities on feasibility, drafting plans of action, developing a leading concept to test in the lab, development of a prototype, testing the prototype on a few basic material parameters and finally started to do market research.\n\nThis is the first pilot Honours thesis, meaning that it was a continuation of my Honours Program topic: sustainable fashion which is linked and integrated in my studie field of Watermanagment. Therefore, rather than doing my thesis for half a year ended up taking more than a year go through multiple steps in research and product development. This represents more closely an entrepreneurial journey.",

The commitment level was one day in the week to discuss the homework (products and deliverables) that help shape and define all aspects of a company.\n\nLessons learned:\n- validate every step in the solution - problem fit with your market (every step in the production chain)\n- find partners in the company that have complementary skills and that you work well with \n- find a commitment level that works for everyone in an equal balance\n- every experience you learn and those lessons you take with you to the next venture\n- the first company you start will most likely not be a success\n- find learning institutions to help shape the development of your business (research and development)",

This led to new insights into the interaction between different ecosystems and oppurtunities to combine knowledge.\n\nI followed 5 subjects from three different departments Biology, Geology and Environmental Studies. The sources selected were not available at our university but are further interests of mine that I wanted to pursue. I took two second year courses: Introduction to Sustainable Agriculture, which i scored 89% as my final grade. Also, Fundamentals of Microbiology, which I got 65% on. Additionally, two third year courses ReWilding and Ecological Restoration, which I scored 81% on and The Cryosphere with a final score of 90%. Lastly, I took a fourth year course called Biosphere Reserves as Social-Ecological Systems with a final score of 89%.",

Gained more insight into the sector by attending conferences that the company had links to, or attended by managing a booth on the conference. Learned a lot about the sustainable agriculture sector and the processes involved, and I was able to apply what I have learned in my study in current relevant projects.",
