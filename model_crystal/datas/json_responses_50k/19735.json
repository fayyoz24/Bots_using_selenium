In collaboration with German and Dutch experts from Committee of Pharmacopoeia, I led a team of 20 professionals and industrial partners in five organisations across countries and initiated this project. Through proactively communicating with the authorities and stakeholders to understand the requirements and interests, I structured and oversaw each step of the research plan, prepared SOWs and agreements with different parties, designed the scientific experiments, and arranged the task to each party. Systematic literature review, microscopy, TLC, HPLC, and other qualitative/quantitative analysis were applied to obtain data and develop the standard in compliance with the legal regulations. Other relevant achievements include:\n- 4 scientific publications, \n- 1 patent based on the quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker,\n- mentoring 4 master students,\n- securing funds exceeding \u20acXX0,000.",

Using chemical analysis, bioassays, and spectrum-effect analysis, we identified key bioactives responsible for different functions. Certain saponins in PN exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects, while others played roles in immune enhancement and anemia alleviation. To understand the mechanisms, we utilized in silico analysis, cell-based assays, and animal models to identify target pathways, proteins, and influential cytokines, contributing to the following pre-clinical research. These insightful discoveries propelled our research forward, enabling us to publish over 10 impactful scientific papers. In the process, I authored a comprehensive book encompassing our findings, mentored 6 exceptional master students, and was invited to present the research at several international conferences. Furthermore, my innovative contribution to the field was evident in the development of the \"Effect-constituent Index,\" a novel quality control and evaluation method that I pioneered in 2014. In this project, I optimized this method further, elevating its utility and relevance. It is gratifying to note that this revolutionary approach has been embraced by over 20 scientists from various organizations, who have incorporated it into their own research endeavors, further validating its significance and impact.",
