    "summary": "I have an overall work experience of 8 years in multiple domains and am currently pursuing my MBA from XLRI Jamshedpur (Aug'21 - June'22)\nFor the first 4 years of my career, I worked as a Business Analyst after completing my CA & CS degrees. \nHowever, 4 years into this, I realized that my passion actually lies in running the business, instead of only accounting for it. Hence, I decided to move to a Sales & BD role where I could work on business strategy and execution. Soon after taking this step, I got a chance to create a GTM strategy for a new business vertical in the Northern region of India from scratch and established a new revenue channel for the company. This was my first experience with a zero to one project.\nI handled responsibilities such as sales & growth, building customer relationships, and managing end to end customer services from lead management to delivery along with being responsible for the P/L of the segment. I also worked on the overall strategy and vision for the business including analysis of value-added products, profitable markets \u2013 based on geography & segment; and creating the product-market fit.\nIts been 4 years in this role and it has made me realise my love for sales and my passion to help fuel growth. That's how I decided to pursue MBA to gain an overall management experience. I feel all skills are transferable and having 8 years of work experience in diversified fields, I have built the right creative intellect to innovate and solve complex business problems. \nApart from work, I would define myself as a people person, with a love for travel and new experiences. I also write on LinkedIn about my experiences & learnings. Follow #TalkAboutExperiences to know more.",
