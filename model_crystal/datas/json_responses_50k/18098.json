    "summary": "I believe that \"Human Capital Excellence\" is the most sustainable competitive advantage there is. \n\nIn the end, doing business is about achieving results, whether that is in terms of people, planet, profit, or all of them. In my experience as an external and internal consultant on business performance, I have personally witnessed that eventually, it's human behavior that will determine failure or success for organizations. It is my passion to explore and influence the link between People and Performance, and to help organizations optimize the engagement, productivity, and potential of their workforce and fuel change that leads to sustainable business impact. \n\nWhy is it that organizations seem to neglect this obvious link between human behavior and business performance so easily? The answer is simple. Strategy, structures and processes are just so much less complex than human behavior... \n\nMy expertise includes several areas of HR and Organizational Development:\n-  Learning & Development\n-  Leadership Development & Management Development\n-  Talent Management & Analytics\n-  Change Management\n-  Organization Design\n-  Organizational Culture\n-  Performance Management\n-  Training Delivery, Facilitation, and Coaching\n-  Shaping Strategy and Roadmaps",
