The biggest challenge was to create synergy by introducing a new methodology of working in the different countries (Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands) with the intention to create one pool of employees to cover the markets. The unit managers had to work closely together to achieve this goal. The cooperation with the international teams I found very enjoyable. This position could best be characterized as a combination of internal management and customer-oriented management. The size of this team was 61 FTE of which 28 FTE in the Netherlands, 18 FTE in Germany and 15 FTE in Denmark. After the organizational changes in 2013, CSC has been transferred into country oriented units which meant the end of this international position.\n\nFocused on international growth, organizational change and people development.",
