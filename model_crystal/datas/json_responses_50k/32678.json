Crafting a compelling strategic narrative is essential to generate domestic public support for such wars of choice, but in an era in which communication happens in a complex and unpredictable media environment, policy makers struggle to control how their strategic narratives are projected in the media. This dissertation addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining what embedded journalism can do for the promotion of strategic narratives. By analysing how the content of moving images in the shape of documentaries can challenge or support strategic narratives, it moves beyond existing research in the Dutch case, which exclusively focuses on newspaper discourse. This dissertation argues that documentaries by embedded journalists can be a powerful medium to promote strategic narratives by providing visual proof but can be dangerous if the strategic narrative does not correspond with reality, as they can reveal the disconnect with the situation on the ground. This study therefore recommends that future strategic narratives focus on what can be demonstrated to the public. ",
