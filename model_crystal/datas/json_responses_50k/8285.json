    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Gareth, and I bring 15+ years of experience in the design industry, (currently as the team leader of a physical product team) who aspires to level-up and engage with large design agencies and high-end consumer brands to steer digital and industrial design operations. \n\nWith multi-faceted experienced spanning across both physical and digital design, I underpin my credentials with a MA Industrial Design from Central Saint Martins in London. From consumer electronics and wearable technology to UX UI, branding and commercial interiors, I see every design challenge as an opportunity to weave ground-breaking designs that make industries stand-up and notice.  \n\nMost recently, I have been behind the development of new products for Photobox Group generating new products, and developing product and category strategies for Europe\u2019s largest personalised printing group, serving 7 million customers.\n\nI love to be at the forefront of design, with a personal passion for open-source technology, sustainability design in consumer electronics and opportunities to exploit technology from 3D printing. In fact, my master\u2019s thesis pioneered the use of 3D printing of tools for use by chefs in live kitchens. \n\nBy blending my expertise in e-commerce, product management, and cross-functional team leadership, I have successfully delivered impactful solutions throughout my career. Leveraging my skills in product strategy and manufacturing, I have consistently driven innovation and achieved remarkable results.\n\nIf you're interested in connecting or exploring opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me at gareth.ladley@gmail.com. I look forward to collaborating on exciting projects and making a lasting impact in the world of design.",
