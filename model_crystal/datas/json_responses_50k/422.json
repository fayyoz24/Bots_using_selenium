    "summary": "Hi! I'm Kira, and I'm fortunate to have lived all over the world: in Malaysia, Qatar, Brazil, Germany, and the Netherlands. My international experience and being from both Germany and America have inspired me to pursue becoming an international primary school teacher, which led me to study in the Netherlands. I am currently working as an English and swimming teacher. I look forward to hearing your stories!\n\nWorking as a student-teacher and assistant-teacher at international and bilingual schools in Germany,  I was able to be a part of the first step in a child\u2019s education and inspire a love for learning. My international upbringing and experiences have prepared me to be a diligent international primary school teacher through my developed knowledge of cultural and social diversity through working with multicultural students and colleagues. \n\nHaving completed my IB Diploma Programme at the International School of Stuttgart from 2016 to 2018, I have studied the International Teacher Education in Primary Schools (ITEps) program in Meppel, the Netherlands, at NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences. I have learned to be balanced and open-minded, and this conscientious mindset makes me a dedicated teacher who supports learners to achieve their full potential.",

Aside from my regular training, I spent two hours each Saturday morning teaching six to seven-year-old girls how to do synchro. In order to achieve my certificate, I had individual and group training to learn how to be a synchronized swimming trainer and lifeguard training. Synchro teaching involves creativity, activity, and service: I need to be creative and create choreography, be active and swim, and conduct service through being a trainer and advisor.",
