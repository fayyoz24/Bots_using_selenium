As partner of a TNO lead international public private partnership I contribute to the design, development and scaling of a model for cricket rearing, processing and marketing in Kenya and Uganda, with the ultimate goal to establish a sustainable and inclusive value chain. We have presented the Flying Food project during the International Symposium: Insects to Feed the World, that was co-hosted by WUR and FAO in May 2014. \n\nIn Kenya and Uganda, one third of the population does not meet their energy need of about 2100 kcal per day. Far more people are lacking either proteins or micronutrients in their daily diet. Rearing of insects in these countries can provide a solution for both problems. At present, insects are consumed after catching them in the wild, an insecure and highly seasonal protein source. Rearing them instead will provide a year-round protein supply. TNO in collaboration with Dutch and African partners will set-up the value chain from rearing insects to the consumer. This includes rearing (55 tons of crickets per month by 4000 farmers in Kenya and Uganda), the processing of crickets by (local) companies, food design and the marketing of the new cricket food products.",
