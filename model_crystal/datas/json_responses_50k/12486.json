The Talysh individuals skillfully crafted a variety of decorative items like earrings, rings, and bracelets, as well as household goods such as bags, baskets, and plates from these plants. This craft became closely associated with the cultural identity of the Talysh region in Azerbaijan.\n\nHowever, in the past three decades, the interest in wicker working has declined due to the increased use of paraffin and plastic products. To revive the popularity of this traditional craft and also raise awareness about the issue of plastic pollution, a community called Leyne.Co was established. This community comprises 15 women from vulnerable groups, including refugees, individuals with disabilities, and members of the LGBT+ community. Together, they work towards promoting eco-friendly items and reviving the forgotten cultural heritage of the Talysh people.",
