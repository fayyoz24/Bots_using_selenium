    "summary": "With my experience of 50+ brands, 10+ years, 3 offices I learned a lot. A lot. Founding my own brand agency, running globally now. Diving into 50+ different organisations, businesses & brands. In different sectors, sizes, and countries. I am here for visionary brands and leaders who put branding as their priority.\n\nNow, I am sharing my 10+ years of experience, 50+ brands of expertise, and my most insightful learnings with 2 brands a year. It gives me enough time to run the agency Ode to A, and to make space for my own creativity. Creativity for me is a way of being. \n\nI am hopeful and proud that we are living in an era of transformation. Of change. Of evolution. Realizing that our outer world is our inner world \u2014 it\u2019s how we perceive the world. So, we have the power and potential to change from the inside out. Let\u2019s change our perception into visionary perspectives.",

The SDG Action Day was held in 2020, making this the decade of transformation, realizing we need to urgently change. More than we did. \n\nThe world asks for new perspectives. New leadership. Leaders who turn challenges into change. Letting go of the old in order to create the new. Changing mindsets, behaviour, and systems.\n\nI spoke about the importance of feminine leadership in this masculine-rooted leadership landscape: bringing feminine qualities at the forefront, such as equality, collaboration, and connection. \n\nIn a broader context, I hope that leadership becomes ownership. That we don't lead others, but lead ourselves in the very first place. I believe that true ownership means ownership on every level. Owning your vision, your values, your expertise, your time, your energy, etc. Both professionally and personally. If you show true ownership to others (other leaders), you bring up something immensely powerful \u2014 trust. And if people (other leaders) can trust you, they enable you to take full ownership since they can let go of control.\n\nWe need leaders who take full ownership and lead challenges, who lead change, who fire up change. Luckily, shifts are taken place. And you, too, are part of it.\n\nSpecial thanks to former Vice-President of the World Bank Oby Ezekwesili who really inspired me, what a woman! And to Minister Ljupco Nikolovski who brings hope and trust to the table. An honour to be part of it and to be on the company list with Ode to A (before I was even ready), having my first exposure!"
