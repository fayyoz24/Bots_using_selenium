    "summary": "I am currently working as the safety coordinator at Topaz, a care organization in Leiden and the Duin- en Bollenstreek. Here I strive to assure that clients can live their final years in a safe environment, both physically and mentally. In addition ofcourse, the safety of the Topaz employees is a highly important concern. Trough organizational climate determents such as involvement, responsibility and teamwork I try to clear the road for any barriers to continuous quality improvement.\n\nIn March 2015 I graduated from the Master\u2019s programme Crisis and Security Management at Leiden University. This study taught me a great deal about various academic disciplines, particularly on the topic of (counter)terrorism, radicalisation and public-private partnerships on security related issues. For my thesis I took part in a Capstone project supervised by Prof. Dr. Edwin Bakker (Directeur Centre for Terrorism and Counterterrorism).Together with five fellow students I did research on how various Western governments are dealing with Muslim radicalisation and the related contemporary national threat this potentially poses.\n\nDuring my previous education (Safety and Security Management at The Hague University) I learned to deal with various security issues. I have learned to map safety issues and to come up with proper advices to help solve the issue in question. Doing so, I have an eye for legal, financial, organizational and administrative matters. As a safety and security manager I oversee the whole chain of actors within the line of safety/security management and the associated terms of quality. \n\nSince the beginning of 2013 I have earned the title of Bachelor in Business Administration. I have earned this degree after the successful completion of my thesis. For this thesis I have done research on Dutch voluntary citizen participation in public safety, and if/how this creates a bridge to society.",

The management of this ''hard side'' of safety has to be coordinated in order to keep the overview for long term operations and to comply with the rule of law.\n\nIn addition, from my own perspective I put a strong focus towards the ''soft side'' of safety.
