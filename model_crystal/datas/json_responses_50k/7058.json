They have accidents, like we all do, but these result in big laughs as they react, retaliate and respond by using rubber frying pans, plumbers wrenches and hammers to sort it out.

Utilising all the best concepts from The Clown Town Crime Watch Show, this slapstick flower show has a completely different story line and agenda making it ideal when two different shows are needed in the arena.\n\nStarring Dingle Fingle as the Clown Town Gardener who has to look after the Mayor's prize flower whist he is away on business.  New on the job Dingle is unaware of the problems associated with tending to such a large bloom \u2013 i.e. the parasites, pests and bugs that want to feed off this \u2018largus squiticus flowerous\u2019.  Keen to do the job properly he enlists the audience's help to safeguard and keep a watchful eye out, of course let him know if they see any thing untoward that might be a threat to the prize flower!  Good job too because Clown Town has some huge aphids and very nasty insects that bestow themselves into battle for the flower.  Never fear Dingle FIngle is here to save the day (with the watchful eye of the audience) and return the flower back to the Mayor safe and sound at the end of the show!\n\n20 minutes of Fun & Flower Frolics for All the Family.",

With these moments the clown acts on what his feelings tell him to do and shares this with his audience with humorous interpretation. The clown is pure, unconcerned and unprejudiced, always paying attention to both individuals and the group as a whole whilst orchestrating the class and putting humour into whatever happens.\n\u2018Organic Humour\u2019 as Stephen calls it!\n\nEvery class is treated as a learning experience for everybody.

            "description": "One of London's newest attractions takes on a suitably scary twist this Halloween as Up At The O2 cranks up the fear factor for brave thrill-seekers. As with the regular climb over the grand O2 Arena, participants begin at 'Base Camp', which has been given an appropriately spooky renovation for the Halloween season. The story goes that in 1983, five explorers disappeared in an icy wilderness and now your job is to find out what happened to them. Along the climb, you can expect a few surprises - tricks, treats, scares and shocks - before you're given a Gothic-style map at the summit, pinpointing some of London's horror hotspots. The climbs are available from 10am to 10pm - scaling the O2 at any time is always going to be a thrill but a night-time climb will be particularly atmospheric. Children must be 10 years or above and at least 1.2 metres tall.\n \nAbout O2 Walkway: Up At The O2\n\nVisitors to The O2 will soon be able to see the famous domed structure from an entirely new angle - from 53-metre high Up At The O2 suspended from The O2's distinctive yellow masts. Open on 21st June 2012, the guided walk over one of London's most successful music and entertainment venues will give visitors amazing views over the great domed building designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners and beyond.\n\nBEFORE DARK:\n\nExperience a voyage into the unknown. Trace the steps of the Terra Ignota team safe in the knowledge that you have the tools to make your way out of any sticky situation. Perfect for families and people focussed on the climb.\n\nAFTER DARK: THE FINAL ASCENT\n\nNot for the faint of heart. You'll be guided across the walkway and straight into a hub of terrifying live action. This is an immersive experience with horrifying scenes and bloodcurdling screams. Can you handle it? ",

Like many Bush songs, it has an atmosphere all of its own. The 2011 retwizzle is two minutes longer, seems to have a new vocal and, naturally for the music climate of today, a lot of vocal processing and vocoder. The chorus is much more explicitly meant to be a conversation between human and computer: \"I bring you love and deeper understanding\" croons the machine like a malfunctioning ZX Spectrum.",
