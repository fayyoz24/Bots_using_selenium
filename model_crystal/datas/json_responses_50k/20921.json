            "description": "In 2011 more than 700 million people visited zoos and aquariums worldwide. For the majority of urban people zoos represent the one and only place where they can encounter animals. The way this encounter happens has a huge influence on the ways of being of humans and animals, both in material and discursive dimensions. Established as places where captive animals were exposed to people to gaze at, zoos nowadays evolved in institutions with educational and conservational ambitions. Spatially, some of them progressed from caged designs to naturalised enclosures where animals are separated from humans by glass or moats. Both the discursive (from entertainment to education and conservation) and spatial shift brought in new ways of interacting and becoming for both humans and animals. Studying them might help to pave the way to more fair zoos of the future, reaching far beyond the initial stigmas of domination and gaze.\n",

So, my main task as an intern was to develop a questionnaire for Russian-speaking visitors of the zoo, interview them and analyse the results. Furthermore, I assisted the educational department in translation of interpretation materials from English to Russian. To maximise the outreach of Helsinki zoo to Russian-speaking visitors, I've created a Vkontacte-based public group 'Friends of Helsinki Zoo' to post updates of the Zoo in Russian.\n\nSee the final presentation: http://prezi.com/yjdohbuktg95/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share "
