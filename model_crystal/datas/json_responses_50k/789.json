The resort's design was conceptualized and executed by Christian Liaigre, who is regarded as possibly one of the most important designers of our time. Working for Le Sereno for half a year as a guest relations agent, showed me the true meaning of hospitality. During this internship I broadened my knowledge on the operational focus within hotels and learned what terms as: \"taking the extra step\" and \"thinking outside the box\" truly mean. Providing 5+ star level of service at a 'Leading Hotel of the world' was a completely new and exciting experience.",
