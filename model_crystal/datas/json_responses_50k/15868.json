While newly built buildings will be of nearly zero energy standard by 31 December 2020 (public-owned buildings after 31 December 2018), new buildings form only 1% of the addition to the existing building stock which implies that to attain nearly zero energy standard for all building stock, large-scale renovations must be performed. However, the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard is not yet cost optimal. To improve the economic feasibility, it is important to find the parameters that have an impact on the cost-optimality of nearly zero energy renovations and the extent of their impact, the results of which can be used to drive the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard in an economically feasible manner. The primary objectives of this thesis are the identification of the most important parameters influencing the cost-benefit analysis of renovating houses in The Netherlands to nearly zero energy standard and the extent of influence of each parameter on the economic feasibility. Five key parameters had an impact on the NPV- energy price, energy consumption (presented as four separate sub-parameters: electricity and gas consumption both before and after renovation), renovation cost, project life cycle and discount rate. In absolute terms, gas consumption before renovation had the highest impact followed by, renovation cost, electricity consumption after renovation, discount rate, a shift of energy price to the low price scenario, life cycle of the project and electricity consumption before renovation. The gas consumption after renovation and the shift of energy price to the high prices scenario did not have a significant effect on the NPV.",

It is known that electricity can be created from ocean currents, but the technologies are still developing. Tidal power is an example that is developing rapidly in the Netherlands, but it is still a small niche in the sustainable energy market. This research identifies what the drivers and hurdles are that tidal power companies in the Netherlands facing with respect to the Dutch energy market.  A social technological overview of tidal energy in the Netherlands is derived and with that information, a Function of Innovation System analysis is executed. This is combined with a multi-level perspective analysis, which is used to identify different regimes within the tidal power sector. The preliminary results of the research show that three functions there are the key drivers for tidal power in the Netherlands. These are knowledge diffusion, guidance of the search and mobilization of resources. The barriers are the market formation and support from advocacy coalitions. The multi-level perspective analysis shows that the general driver on the development of tidal energy is the general opinion that the embedded fossil fuel energy should be replaced or significantly reduced. To overcome the barriers, it is important that a market is going to be created which will attract more entrepreneurs. This will in turn lead to an increase in the number of demonstrations thereby proliferating the knowledge acquired and increasing the support for the tidal energy sector in the Netherlands.",

The key parameters that govern the performance have been identified following a simple reduction of variables. Among the different parameters, melting temperature of the PCMs, latent heat and melting temperature difference between two consecutive PCMs (\uf044Tm) were found to have a significant influence on the performance. A case study considering a 3-PCM unit to study the effect of key parameters during melting has been presented. The results show that for the 3-PCM unit, the performance is better when the second and third PCMs have their latent heats larger than the first PCM. It has been recommended to have \uf044Tm1 > \uf044Tm2 for the 3-PCM unit in order achieve more melting.",

The equations were solved adopting an alternate iteration between the temperature and thermal resistance. The thermal performance of the system was investigated for four different cases viz. (i) Shell side filled with single PCM without interspersed high conductivity particles, (ii) single PCM with high conductivity particles, (iii) shell side containing multiple (three) PCM without dispersed particles and (iv) shell side containing multiple (three) PCM with dispersed particles. A comparison between the four cases was made investigating their individual and combined influence on the performance of the unit for a set of input parameters especially the Biot number (Bi) and Stefan number (Ste). The results obtained showed that the performance of the multiple PCM with dispersed high conductivity particles was appreciable compared to the single PCM with or without dispersed high conductivity particles.\n\nIn the experiment, the entire shell and tube heat exchanger setup was broken down into three canisters for the convenience of adding or subtracting any PCM of interest. The temperature of the PCMs at set points and  the temperature of the HTF at the entry and exit of each canister were measured. The experiment was carried out for a total of 150 minutes and the temperature of the PCMs and HTF were noted down, initially at an interval of 3 minutes for 30 minutes and later at an interval of 5 minutes. A plot of the HTF temperature at various times showed that the system approached steady state. A comparison of the PCM temperatures at the various points showed congruency in melting.\n",

A parabolic satellite dish serves the purpose of a solar collector and polished mirrors adhered to the surface of the satellite dish are used to reflect the solar energy. A black body containing water is kept approximately at the focal point of the satellite dish. The water gets heated depending on the intensity of solar energy it takes. Subsequently the water is distilled and is collected elsewhere. Applications include converting brackish water in to clean water and heating of industrial oils.",

A quasi steady state approach has been followed to arrive at the system of governing equations. The equations were solved adopting an alternate iteration between the temperature and thermal resistance. The thermal performance of the system was investigated for three different cases viz. (i) Shell side filled with single PCM with no particles (ii) PCM with particles and (iii)shell side containing multiple PCM with didpersed particles. A comparison between the three cases was made investigating their individual and combined influence on the performance of the unit for a set of input parameters especially the Biot number and Stefan number. The results obtained showed that the performance of the multiple PCM with dispersed high conductivity particles was appreciable compared to the single PCM with or without dispersed high conductivity particles.",

While newly built buildings will be of nearly zero energy standard by 31 December 2020 (public-owned buildings after 31 December 2018), new buildings form only 1% of the addition to the existing building stock which implies that to attain nearly zero energy standard for all building stock, large-scale renovations must be performed. However, the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard is not yet cost optimal. To improve the economic feasibility, it is important to find the parameters that have an impact on the cost-optimality of nearly zero energy renovations and the extent of their impact, the results of which can be used to drive the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard in an economically feasible manner. The primary objectives of this thesis are the identification of the most important parameters influencing the cost-benefit analysis of renovating houses in The Netherlands to nearly zero energy standard and the extent of influence of each parameter on the economic feasibility. Five key parameters had an impact on the NPV- energy price, energy consumption (presented as four separate sub-parameters: electricity and gas consumption both before and after renovation), renovation cost, project life cycle and discount rate. In absolute terms, gas consumption before renovation had the highest impact followed by, renovation cost, electricity consumption after renovation, discount rate, a shift of energy price to the low price scenario, life cycle of the project and electricity consumption before renovation. The gas consumption after renovation and the shift of energy price to the high prices scenario did not have a significant effect on the NPV.",
