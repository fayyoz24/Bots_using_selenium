    "summary": "I am a researcher in the Greenhouse Technology group at Wageningen Research, exploring how to optimize the optical and material properties of greenhouse covering and screen materials to move towards more sustainable, energy-efficient greenhouses.  \n\nI got my PhD in Physics at the Radboud University Nijmegen in 2022. In my thesis I investigated the possibility of using ultrashort laser pulses (shorter than 1 billionth of a second!) to write and store bits of digital information in magnetic media in a faster and energy efficient way, and to reduce the bit-size to the nanometre scale using plasmonic nanostructures.\n\nI have more than 6 years of experience in experimental condensed matter physics, exploring physical (electric, magnetic, optical and magneto-optical) properties of materials with various technological applications.\n\nMy academic training has helped me develop various skills such as experimental, technical and programming skills, data analysis, project management, academic writing and presentation as well as collaboration. \n\nI am looking forward to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting to pursue some of my interests including: sustainability and energy research, education, science communication,  illustration and writing.",
