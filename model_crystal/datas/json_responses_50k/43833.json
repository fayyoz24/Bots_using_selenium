Anti reflection effect of rough interfaces plays an important role in the process of the absorption of light inside the solar cells. Computer modeling can help in finding an optimal structure for the device and investigating the limits of new approaches. \n\nMy objective was to figure out possible models for simulating the anti reflection effect in thin-film solar cells and try them out using Advanced Semiconductor Analysis (ASA), as well as to compare the results obtained from the optical modeling with the measured data from experiments conducted in the lab.\n\n",

The various ways of human exposure to radiation as well as the risk of various isotopes and their implications on the environment and human health, were analyzed. The calculations were made with the help of the codes ORIGEN II and RESRAD. ORIGEN II simulates the nuclear fuel cycle, while  RESRAD is an assessment code of the radiological consequences after a nuclear accident in the area that it happened (on-site) and in a wider area as well (off-site). The analysis was made for two types of nuclear reactors: pressurized water reactors (PWR) and fast reactors (LMFBR). A sensitivity analysis on many major factors was also realized. The thesis concluded with a comparison between the two different types of reactors.\n\nChapter 1: Nuclear Reactors and Accidents\nChapter 2: Diffusion Mechanisms/Ways of Exposure to Radiation and Consequences to the Environment\nChapter 3: Assessment Codes (ORIGEN II, RESRAD - literature analysis)\nChapter 4: Calculating the consequences of a nuclear accident (PWR and FR / on-site and off-site / sensitivity analysis)\nChapter 5: Conclusions \n\n",
