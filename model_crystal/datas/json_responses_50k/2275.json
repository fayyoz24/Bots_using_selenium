The goal of the CCI is\nto address the need for culturally appropriate work in a variety of professions by training\nstudents to be culturally competent practitioners. In the Fall of 2010, the Urban Affairs and\nPlanning Department at Hunter College joined CENTRO as a partner in this initiative. Full time\nProfessors Sigmund Shipp, Laxmi Ramasubramanian, and Tom Angotti worked with graduate\nassistants Angela Tovar and Marly Pierre-Louis on a year-long inquiry of cultural competency\nwithin the department.\n\nIn the Spring of 2011, Marly Pierre-Louis and Angela Tovar, supervised by Professor Laxmi\nRamasubramanian, developed and conducted a student survey and face-to-face interviews with\nfaculty members to assess existing practices within the department and how they can be\nimproved to effectively prepare the student body to understand and engage with diverse groups\nof people. A presentation of findings for both the student surveys and the faculty interviews are\nalso included in this report.\n\nThe following report documents this year long effort to engage in discourse and to incorporate\nstrategies to effectively introduce cultural competency into the urban planning curriculum in the\nUrban Affairs and Planning Department at Hunter College \u2013 City University of New York.",
