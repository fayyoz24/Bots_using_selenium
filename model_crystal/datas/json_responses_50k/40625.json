    "summary": "Ever since I can remember I have been a passionate explorer who wanted to create a change in the world and who sees opportunity in everything.  \n\nEager as I am, I got my Master's Degree in Industrial Design and travelled around the world. As much I have loved these adventures, now I am looking for the next challenge to create the biggest change possible. \n\nI always love to take on challenges I have never faced before. My broad interests grant me the possibility to acquire new insights and knowledge from different disciplines. Taking a birds-eye view, I can redefine solutions and concepts to fit the stakeholder\u2019s values and needs more accurately. I am eager to find meaningful solutions for every problem I take on, by integrating skills and knowledge from the fields of Industrial Design, Psychology and Entrepreneurship. I do this with a lot of passion and attention to detail.\n\nCurious about what I can do for you?

Stubbed butts, plastic bottles, bags, etc. We as people prefer to stay away and do not know better than everything lying on the floor is dirty. This mindset must change if you want a cleaner Ede.\n\nI propose to do the following to change our view on a litter through making cleaning playful with Scatter.\n\nScatter is an application which explains the importance of cleaning and challenges the people of Ede and their surroundings to a cleaning battle. Who will be the first to find the items on the list of the scavenger hunt? Who is the quickest in finding five different items? Alternatively, simply, who will find the most litter? Through making the photo as proof, it will make the litter more artistic and approachable. Scatter will show it thanks and will inform of the effect the people have. However, these pictures are not only evidence of the battle, but also they tell a story; Who picked up what, where and when. Scatter can not only show in this way its effect on a map but also identify the source of the litter. People can use this to take action and stop it from becoming litter. Creating an active and aware community.",
