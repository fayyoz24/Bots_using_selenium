Palm oil is a key ingredient in many consumer products, and the growing demand for this commodity has created a need for more land for palm oil plantations. Palm oil is associated with problems such as deforestation, haze and carbon emission by draining peat land and social exploitation of plantation workers, leading to a public call to ban or replace palm oil for other fats and oils in especially foods.\n\nAt the same time, palm oil offers a number of key benefits. It is a very versatile oil and and has important functional properties in foodstuffs. It is a very efficient crop to grow, requiring 5-10 times less land than other vegetable oils and fats with minimal use of pesticides and fertilizer. In the countries where it is produced it boosts socioeconomic development and helps fight poverty. \n\nIn view of the global role of palm oil in supplying vegetable oils and fats for food, feed and home and personal care products, the solution is not to end palm oil production, but to make it sustainable. In the European Palm Oil Alliance each member joins the move to a 100% sustainable supply chain and shares fact based information on all aspects of palm oil to enable better common understanding. \n\nMore and more stakeholders are living up to the challenge and help create the urgently needed change. This has resulted in 2021 in a 93 % uptake of certified sustainable palm oil for food, feed and oleochemicals in Europe, a remarkable achievement for a voluntary certification scheme!",
