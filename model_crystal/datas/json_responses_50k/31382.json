Inspired by this commitment, the German government initiated the SUN global programme. Within its framework, GIZ and UNHCR are working together to develop and test new ways of supporting refugees and implement these strategies. The lessons learned are subsequently shared with the international community. The focus of these new solutions is on integrating the perspectives of humanitarian assistance, development, and peacebuilding (triple nexus). The project is engaged in four thematic areas: Supporting the inclusion of displaced people, promoting sustainable energy solutions, providing technical and human resources support to UNHCR, and capacity building with host governments.",

Therefore, it is impossible to state whether CoI increase or decrease. The Member States of the EU have no statistics and figures about the development of Conflicts of Interest (CoI). However, ever-new scandals, growing media attention and changing governance concepts create new ethical challenges and conflicts of interest. As such, detecting, managing and measuring CoI policies involve some of the greatest challenges and difficulties in legal, political, organizational, behavioural and administrative sciences. This international and empirical research examines the causes of conflicts of interest and discusses concepts, innovative instruments and new ideas on how to enhance the effectiveness of policies.\"\n\nResponsibilities (selection):\n- Conceptualising a questionnaire for public officials\n- Literature research\n- Data collection\n- Data analysis/statistical analysis and interpretation\n- Writing parts of the study (analytical chapter)\n- Presenting the study at a joint session of the AFCO-JURI committees of the European Parliament",
