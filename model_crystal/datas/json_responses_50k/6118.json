I conducted extensive research, wrote creative and well-written project proposals and periodic reports, kept a detailed donor database, followed up on donors and potential donors, delivered presentations at local schools and organizations, organized advocacy events, managed inventories for donor gifts, organized press conferences and workshops, wrote press releases and news articles, liaised with the press and assisted in the creation of communications material. I wrote content for pamphlets and posters and scripts for awareness-raising videos. \nAs spokesperson and fundraiser for this project, I delivered face-to-face fundraising presentations on vessels that visit the remote marine park. \nIn addition, I created and implemented a successful fundraising internship program and recruited, trained and managed several national and international interns. I produced training material for interns that includes a guidebook and video.",
