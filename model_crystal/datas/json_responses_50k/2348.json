    "summary": "Let's transform healthcare together! \n\nMy mission is to help people create optimal health for themselves. As a scientist and an epilepsy patient, I study how targeted data collection during lifestyle interventions helps people gain insights in their own physical condition, empowering them to regain control over their health. I also teach several courses on qualitative research methods and academic writing.\n\nI work at the intersection of nutritional science, IT and cognition, creating an integrated research approach to personalization of healthcare. A crucial concept in this framework is Citizen Science, in which citizens collaborate closely with scientists to collect data. This is invaluable to understanding how lifestyle interventions work outside of the controlled laboratory setting. \n\nI highly value interdisciplinary connections. I have a background in IT, business and cognitive psychology, which I integrated in my PhD research, studying how people process abstract information while analysing complex business problems. \n\nI have experienced first-hand that the highest ambitions are worthless without robust health, which led me to reinvent myself and shift my focus towards healthcare. My expertise in research methodology and my skills to analyze problems from multiple perspectives have allowed me both to create an effective strategy to conquer my epilepsy, as well as lay the foundations for a unique approach to personalized health embracing citizen science. \n\nI have acquired several projects in this field, in which we collaborate with medical professionals, technology partners, interdisciplinary researchers and citizens. Our vision is to lead the way towards a system in which patient empowerment through reliable data collection creates a positive attitude towards health, improving treatment outcomes and spurring further scientific research. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to connect, please drop me a line.\n",

The role of technology to enable smarter personalised healthcare is a central theme, focusing on personal data gathering, the use of citizen science methodology, leveraging patient potential through communities and 'buddy' constructions and providing deep insights in a patient's situation in order to help healthcare providers deliver more effective treatments. \n\nProjects I am working on: \n- Collaboration with physical therapists to study how HRV data can help clients recover faster and how this enables therapists to better monitor and tailor the client's recovery process. \n- Exploratory study on how to apply the N-of-1 methodology in clinical practice. There is potential to use the N-of-1 in a more informal manner to gain personal insights to help patient and physician improve their treatment based on data and shared decision making. \n- Dietary interventions in migraine healthcare, and how to monitor these using eHealth and the power of patient communities.",

The game has been designed for a real industrial environment. \nThis task involved integration of IT and psychology theory, requirements gathering, organisation and facilitation of brainstorm sessions and translating research findings into practical guidelines.",
