    "summary": "Rob van Ede is a physical geographer-turned spatial data specialist who is currently taking some well-earned time off to travel a bit through Europe, improve his home towards energy independence, ponder exciting next steps and enjoy a long summer outside.\nFor the last 10 years, he has been working with with TNO \u2013 Geological Survey of the Netherlands. He has experience in field research, modeling, spatial IT and data harmonization and has worked in the Netherlands, many European countries, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Rob\u2019s assignment included data analysis, conceptual data modeling, data harmonization and visualization and project management for TNO \u2013 Geological Survey of the Netherlands. He has written a road-map on data management for offshore wind-farm data and participated in a consultancy project in preparation of a new data repository for the Saudi Geological Survey. Furthermore, he has participated in international projects on data harmonization such as the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) and as facilitator for the INSPIRE Energy Resources thematic cluster of the EU JRC. Under the GeoERA project, he has successfully compiled the HIKE European Fault Database.\nIn the past, he has worked on different environmentally related subjects such as: satellite remote sensing of soil moisture, coastal water quality and coral bleaching, conceptual modeling of geotechnical and geological surveys, modeling of oil and gas production, harmonization and migration of geodata at the Dutch national airport and spatial software development and data analysis for local Dutch municipalities.\n\nApart from his work in geography, Rob has had an interest in sound reproducing technology for a long time. He spent a lot of evenings during his study working as (licensed) 35 mm film projectionist (a trade that no longer exists now that cinema's have turned digital) and as sound technician in a movie theater, and has been designing and building high-quality loudspeakers for many years, something that eventually led to the founding of Throb Audio, a small company that specialized in the design of high-quality loudspeakers and live sound recordings. \n\nRob is also an outdoor enthusiast and avid bicycle user, using the bike for commuting as much as possible and sometimes for more serious expeditions; In 2012 he embarked on a solo bike-trip that brought him from Ulm (Germany) to Istanbul (Turkey) in five weeks on a recumbent bike, and a folding bicycle trip from Mumbai to Goa (India) in 2015. He also held a paragliding pilot license and flew under his own wing for many years.",
