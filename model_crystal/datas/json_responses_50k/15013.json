I believe that giving opportunities and responsibilities to my team members benefits their growth and development.\nIn addition to my team members, I pay a lot of attention to both internal and external customers. They provide a lot of valuable information about how you can make the products/services even more successful.\nAlso I am very interested in the processes surrounding product development and the use of the products/services at the customer. I believe that in these processes you can guarantee the quality of the product, improve it and perhaps even accelerate the development and/or delivery. These processes can also be a place to safeguard knowledge.",
