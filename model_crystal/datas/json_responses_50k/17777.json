    "summary": "Most of Willem\u2019s research focuses on the genesis, backgrounds and consequences of cultural conflict and discontents, taking the importance of cultural framing into account.\n\nMethodologically, his research ranges from in-depth qualitative case studies to analyses of large-scale internationally comparative survey data and survey experiments. Substantively, his current research consists of three branches:\n \n1) Value polarization in western countries, scrutinizing e.g. public conflicts on issues of migration and integration, social order, crime and punishment, gender, and sexuality. How did opinions on these issues change, which groups are pitted against each other, and what are the causes and consequences of these social conflicts, for instance when it comes to societal discontents and voting behavior?\n\n2) The way in which characteristics of cities and neighborhoods impact citizens\u2019 fear, discontents, health, value orientations and voting behavior. In exploring these issues, he pays ample attention to the way in which contextual and individual-level factors interact in producing various outcomes.\n\n3) Information provision and cultural frames. Research inspired by the highly influential \u2018information deficit model\u2019 suggests that people\u2019s opinions on new technologies, policies, and institutions are hardly or not affected by the provision of new information. However, Willem\u2019s research, which builds on insights from cultural sociology and communication science, evidences that information provision actually has strong effects, but that these depend on people\u2019s cultural frames, which influence the way in which information is processed.\n\nNext to his research, Willem teaches in Erasmus University's Master specialization Politics & Society and the top-rated Research Master in Sociology of Culture, Media and the Arts. Willem also serves on the editorial boards of two peer-reviewed journals: Sociologie and Sociologos.",
