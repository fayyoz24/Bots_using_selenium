Targeting customers with relevant upgrade proposals is essential for successful marketing from both sales and customer satisfaction point of view. Moving from a manual, unstructured approach to advising customers on the next best purchase, we strived to develop an underlying mathematical algorithm which would give usage-based upgrade advices. The team set off to build a system to assess current software/hardware configuration, monitor utilisation data flow, learning how and what a particular machine(s) is used for, and provide a meaningful upgrade advice from both efficiency and performance points of view.\nMy role in this project was to design algorithms for clustering MR clients depending on machine utilisation patterns. Namely, customer utilisation was analysed for time efficiency, clinical anatomies range, equipment availability (MR coils), etc. These clusters of clients becomes target groups, which share same patterns and therefore can be targeted with the same upgrade advice, then deployed to the sales force.",
