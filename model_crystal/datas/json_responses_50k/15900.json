As temperature of the wall remains above WAT, thereare no conditions, which would lead to wax deposition. To maintain this desire temperature, an external electrical heat source is required. The amount of electrical heating required is calculated. \nAlso, a parametric study has been performed for testing of variations in different parameters that affect heat transfer from the crude oil flowing through the pipe to the surroundings and consequently observe the variations in electrical heating requirement. The technique of electrically heating a pipeline in order to prevent wax deposition could prove to be a resourceful solution.",

Different dosages of alum were added to the water samples having different pH values and turbidity of each sample was tested consequently. ANOVA tests were carried out in order to study the main effect of pH and alum dosage on turbidity as well as the interaction of pH and alum for each sample. It was observed that there was no effect of pH and alum individually. Also, there were no interaction effects between pH and alum for each sample.  ",

Also, the data was studied in order to conclude whether it best fits Langmuir or Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The graphs for adsorption isotherms were plotted in order to get the adsorption constants. On Regression and Residual Analysis, it was concluded that the Freundlich isotherm better fits the experimental data as compared to Langmuir isotherm. ",
