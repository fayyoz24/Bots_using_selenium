We find a strong positive relationship between artists\u2019 perceived attractiveness and how \u2018their\u2019 music is evaluated. While this is true regardless of DJ gender, attractiveness benefits male artists slightly more than female artists. These findings provide further empirical support for the notion that audiences include non-musical traits about artists in music evaluation processes.",

Schaap has already been presented with several awards, such as his graduate school\u2019s 2019 Thesis Award and the Preamium Erasmianum Society\u2019s 2020 Dissertation Award. Both organisations found his work to be interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and highly innovative. The 2020 Research Prize will help Schaap expand the scope of his study on the impact of music on social and psychological well-being and what differences can be observed between groups of people of different ages, ethnicities and genders.",

A maximum of five prizes of \u20ac 3,000 each are awarded to young academic researchers who have written a PhD dissertation of outstanding quality. The relevant faculties of the Dutch universities are asked to nominate candidates.\n\nJury report:\n\nThis dissertation researches to what extent and in what way ethno-racial divisions in music reception are constructed, maintained and/or dismantled. The thesis examines two central puzzles: our taste in music is not genetically determined, so what causes correlation between music and ethno-racial traits? And how is it that while some musical styles are correlated with ethno-racialities (rap, klezmer), others, like rock and country are not, in mainstream understanding? \n\nThe thesis shows, focusing on rock music as a genre, that invisible markers of whiteness do dominate the consumption of rock music. Both declarative and non-declarative preferences of Americans and Dutch consumers of rock music are analyzed. The author uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods skillfully and by doing so, created a unique dataset which took the dissertation beyond narrow case-studies. In addition, the jury praised the fact that the thesis is beautifully embedded in scholarly methods and literature, whilst still being an exciting and readable book for non-specialists. A remarkable and original dissertation with great international social importance.  ",

In an interactive debate, academics, music professionals and musicians discuss these topics. Each session is organized by scientists of the Erasmus University Rotterdam (Department of Arts and Culture Studies), in cooperation with WMDC/Grounds (location), Roodkapje (artistic contextualization), and other partners from the Rotterdam cultural field. \n\nMusic Talks is funded with the generous support of the City of Rotterdam, SG Erasmus, Erasmus Trustfonds, Stichting H.M.A. Schadee-fonds and Stichting Elise Mathilde fonds.",

As such, this song addresses many issues in the production and reception of popular music in the contemporary globalized world. Yet, recent developments in the field of music have changed the \u2018way to the top\u2019, such as governmental policy on music, the rise of new media, and the growing number of music festivals.

Indeed, ever since historically black rock and roll has been appropriated by whites \u2013 the \u201cElvis Effect\u201d, few non-whites have managed to infiltrate this music genre. Even if they do, they risk double marginalization: whites want to know why they are not listening to rap music, while non-whites accuse them of being an Uncle Tom for enjoying the wrong kind of music. The main research question is therefore: To what extent and how do nonwhites and whites construct ethno-racial boundaries in the reception of rock music in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands?",
