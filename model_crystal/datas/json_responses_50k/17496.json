    "summary": "I am a researcher and lecturer with a broad training in the social sciences (sociology, anthropology, methodology, politics, and European studies). I'm passionate about research methodology and asking questions that matter. Over the years, I have accumulated experience in research design, analysis, advice, lecturing, working across disciplinary and national boundaries, and in the organization of various universities and institutions. I like to bring people together to collaborate on projects (workshops, edited books, journals, research design, data collection). My expertise is in research methodology, inequality, gentrification, European studies, politics, and identity. I have particular research experience in Poland (2007-2008), Estonia (2009-2013), Italy (2009-2014), and the Netherlands (2010-present).",

Examples of such specific groups are working class vs. political/cultural 'elites', ethnic/national minorities vs. majorities, and more. 'Europe' means something different according to all of those characteristics, and the central objects of study in this project are those patterns, their relation to national and European identities, and to people's political behaviour. The empirical approach is 'mixed' (both quantitative and qualitative), and is followed up by a 'social networks' component. The project has its roots in sociology, anthropology, and political sciences, but 'borrows' from a number of additional academic fields as well. The project is initiated and run by Jeroen Moes, who works at the European University Institute (EUI) in the department of Political and Social Sciences (SPS).",

With a grant from the Diversity and Inclusivity Initiative at UM, this research has received funding to find policy recommendations to support the study experience of First-Generation Academics (FGAs). Research in this field has not yet been conducted within the UM community and prior empirical studies do not account for application procedures or the course of study specific to UM. Conducting semi-structured individual interviews as well as focus groups to obtain insights into individual study experiences. These qualitative findings indicate that FGAs are lacking guidance throughout their studies yet are resilient and adaptable in accommodating for changing environments in the familial as well as the academic sphere. A quantitative survey distributed among UM faculties yields significant results in the perception of what it means to be a FGA. It also highlights further hurdles in the academic career of FGAs. Lastly, the research suggests preliminary policy recommendations to be implemented at a university-wide level to improve FGAs study experience at UM.",
