Due to my media and communication background I joined the team as a consultant in order to provide a creative edge. My main contributions to the project were developing texts for the website showing their mission and developing a presentation that would help them better explain, promote, and sell their product during sales pitches. Unfortunately it was decided that due to circumstances the service would not be continued. Nevertheless it was an educational experience to be able to work on such a project.",
