In the past, \"literally\" with its faculties and buildings between the inhabitants such as the Oude Delft 95. At the time of the Technical University (1905), the faculties and education buildings have slowly shifted to the current TU campus and TU Delft is aiming for it still to be a good neighbor. My ambition is to establish a good relationship and connection from my functions and network within TU Delft and the city, contributing wherever possible to the goals of SCMD. I am convinced that visibility and involvement of TU Delft in Delft City can lead to a new boost and attractiveness for tourists, but also to encourage the \"proud\" feeling of the Delft inhabitants.",
