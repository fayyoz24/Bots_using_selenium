    "summary": "A driven Project Manager with 4 years of experience in manufacturing and FMCGs, and a genuine interest for continuously learning new things. My desire to be part of the development of new solutions with the use of technology has led me to engineering, and by being close to innovation I can give use to my creativity and problem-solving skills. Extensive experience with an international environment drives my belief that by efficiently sharing knowledge and collaborating, we can achieve greater things. \n\nI advocate solving issues from a customer\u2019s perspective and the importance of starting with the end in mind. Having experienced a broad variety of roles has given me the abilities to handle multidisciplinary projects and quickly understand and adapt to changing circumstances, while not losing the goal in mind. \n\nMy interest lies in the digital development of the manufacturing sector (Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing) and unlocking the use of data where applicable. I use my skillset to design, develop and implement analytics solutions in an agile manner, and in close collaboration with my team and our customers.",
