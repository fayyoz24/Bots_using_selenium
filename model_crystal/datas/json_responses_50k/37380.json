    "summary": "Over the past ten years I have worked in the domain of soil and water resources management and governance \u2013 covering water and agriculture (irrigation), groundwater, drinking water supply, landuse and catchment management. I have been involved in both on the ground projects such as irrigation feasibility studies (field and stakeholder) surveys; as well as the preparation of sector studies such as National Water Integrity Studies (Ghana and Kenya) and Irrigation sector diagnostic and strategy study (Yemen); and strategic policy studies such as the Multi Annual Strategic Plan (Netherlands Embassy in Yemen).\nCurrently I am involved in a.o. in Tanzania, developing district and village level NRM action plans as well as Farmer Field School trainings; and in Ethiopia, developing water sources protection plans.\nOver the years I have acquired well balanced experience in both subject matter as well as project formulation (proposal), project coordination and management aspects. He is a member of the 3R secretariat - with 3R standing for Recharge, Retention and Reuse \u2013 aiming to put groundwater recharge, retention central in agriculture land and water management.",
