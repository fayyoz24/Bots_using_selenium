    "summary": "I am a professional with extensive experience as a servant leader leading co-located and distributed agile teams. Technically, I am backed by Agile methodology and its implementations but interestingly I acquired experience in people coaching skills by holistically understanding and dealing with their daily challenges. I always find it exciting to work with people.\n\nMy experience in working with global development teams has allowed me to interact and harness the best of the people, bridging the work cultural gaps and motivating them to put their discretionary effort into the work. I am a great link that connects business and people. I believe culture and work relationship has a strong connection and if that becomes a mystery, it should be unraveled through more integrated training & coaching.\n\nMy diverse and rich experience makes me the ideal candidate to help you with your agile and people coaching needs.",
