    "summary": "The last fifteen years of my career I have combined teaching in the Netherlands and abroad (Universities of Sana\u00e1, Venice and Chicaco) with management positions, the latter always being concerned with academic education. I have published extensively on this topic (in both academic and popular journals) and I feel it is a privilege to be able to provide young people with the knowledge and skills necessary for living and working successfully in a highly complex world. To this I have dedicated my career.\n\nIn 2006, when I was appointed as program director for the BA and MA in Sociology at the Tilburg University faculty of social sciences, I was invited to design, in collaboration with colleagues from other faculties, an educational Liberal Arts and Sciences program. After the accreditation of the program in 2007, I was appointed Vice-Dean of the LAS program. In January of 2012 I became Dean of LAS and in 2013 was appointed as Educational Professor at Tilburg University, the designation indicating that it is a professorship not involving research. \n\nI am currently Dean of the Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) Bachelor\u2019s program at Tilburg University. As such I bear final responsibility for the educational policy of Liberal Arts and Sciences in Tilburg and its implementation in the program. Under my leadership the LAS program in Tilburg has flourished: the program scores high in national rankings (having been officially recognized as a top-rated program since 2014), our student inflow has been rising steadily, and our graduates are not only admitted to prestigious (research) Master\u2019s programs both in the Netherlands and abroad, they are also very successful in them. I am proud to say that our students are very enthusiastic, that the courses in the program get excellent evaluations, and not least of all that the quality of the teachers is rated as outstanding.\n\nSee: https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/a.vlenning-1.htm for a full list of publications.\n",
