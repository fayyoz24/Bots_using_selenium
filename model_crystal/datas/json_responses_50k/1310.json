The research took place at Besi APac (Asia-Pacific), a subsidiary situated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Management asked for a reduction in the high excess obligation as a result of frequent purchase order cancellations. Through research, the root-causes of these cancellations were identified. Having the root-causes clear, optimizations to Besi's procurement process were proposed. The proposals led to a reduction in processing time in cancelling purchase orders and through an improved approval flow of purchase orders, the risk of excessive obligation could be reduced in the longer term. The internship was part of the Design Project, a course module of 25 ECTS in the second year of the master Industrial Engineering and Management.",

Producers bid a function relating the amount and price of electricity. Game theory is applied to model the bidding process of two producers to establish a (Nash) equilibrium of strategies, and an algorithm was developed to model the dynamic behavior of the bidding process. Simulations were done to illustrate the convergence properties of the algorithm to this Nash equilibrium, and to illustrate the consequences for the economic welfare in the electricity market.",
