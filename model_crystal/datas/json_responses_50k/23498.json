    "summary": "I am a Graduate Aerospace Engineer from the Delft University of Technology. With my inquisitiveness and dedicated efforts, I look forward to being able to help bridge the gap between academia & industry as an instrumental part of the Aerospace society.\n\nThrough various coveted internships and projects I have garnered a fare share of experience in both Academia and Industry. A bulk of the projects I have undertaken through the last 8 years have been inspired by the fact that sustainable development, time and efficiency are the underlining factors for any design methodology. Having had the good fortune of studying under some brilliant professors and my interaction with Aviation luminaries during various internships and work projects, I have developed a deeper understanding towards problem based learning in multicultural environments.\n\nMy areas of interests include:\n-- Gas Turbines\n--  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\n--  Turbo-machinery design",
