His outstanding professionalism and dedication is evident not only in the long hours and quality output at work but also in the prioritising of the office's operations even in times of challenging workload. \nFakhri is an excellent team player. This was very evident when dealing with 12 members of the Committee without any problem, and when working with staff from different offices, as well as dealing with delegations from States Parties. Fakhri responsibly and on many occasions has shown creative problem solving ability, and well within the rules.

He has undertaken not only additional duties as OiC GSS which he has delivered outstandingly but also taken much of the CAS workload Fakhri's leadership delivered on the mass checkout of Police and Justice component of several throusand over 4 week period. Fakhri's knowledge and depth of procurement, finance, property management and personnel rules is well above average and has been extremely advantagous to the mission operations and decision making process in his AO responsibilities. Fakhri was given the lead for the DMS reconfiguration workplan to coordinate the planning and implementation for the drawdown of UNMIK assets, premises and personnel in accordance with the Sec-Gen instuctions and budget limits.   This has required indepth knowledge of property management rules, legal paramters concerning premise owndership, and HR rules and regulations related to reconfiguration. After the departure of the DMS AO, Fakhri additionally took the lead in the AO/DMS projects and responsibilities which included coordination with EULEX, focal point for the mission's Audit responses and daily rapport with the CTSS Section Chiefs.  This included the advisory role on Results Based Budgeting and implementaiton of expenditures in accordance with the budget. Fakhri responsibly and on many occasions has shown creative problem solving ability, and well within the rules, as for example was the solution he successfully proposed to EULEX to agree to reimburse UNMIK for a short period (of several days) prior to termination date of UNMIK's camp services supply contract during the transitional period of overlap between UNMIK formed police units and EULEX takeover under SCR1244, saving the organisation monies and avoiding any termination penalties as full contractual notice period was honoured with this solution.

Key economic institutions are entrusted to Pillar IV, which is a large and complicated pillar.  Mr. Dajani had a good understanding of the nature and complexity of these operations in a short period of time.  The audit of UNMIK Pillar IV focussed on key areas of risk emerged from a risk assessment.  Mr. Dajani\u2019s work focussed on the Economic Regulatory Bodies.  The audit presented a number of challenging situations, in which Mr. Dajani demonstrated a high degree of professionalism and competencies in gaining an understanding of the client\u2019s perspectives.  He communicated well with the client and kept his team informed of relevant information and developments during the audit as well as showing initiative in contributing to the overall team performance.  The outputs of the audit of Pillar IV, including the risk based approach, were presented by the Service Chief during the retreat of IAD in New York in December 2007.  The results of the audit are included in a report to the General Assembly.\nThe comprehensive nature of the assignment required strong skills in assimilating data, synthesizing the information, and assessing processes and controls. Mr. Dajani demonstrated competencies in analyzing business processes, sharing knowledge, coping with pressure and difficult situations.  He contributed to the success of the assignment and his findings on weaknesses in internal controls at Regulators are included in the Report to the General Assembly.  I thank Mr. Dajani for his hard work and contribution to this achievement. Mr. Dajani acted professionally when he represented the Office of the Resident Auditor and showed particular strengths when dealing with administrative matters. Berner Matthee-2008",
