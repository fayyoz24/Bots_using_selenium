Vice Versa also publishes special editions of the journal to stimulate learning throughout the sector. One of the upcoming publications will focus on (sustainable) cacao and chocolate.\n\nThe special cocoa edition of Vice Versa will critically reflect on what has already been done to achieve a sustainable cocoa sector and will look ahead on what will be the strategy for the coming years. It will provide knowledge on the developments of the cocoa sector and stimulate the discussion on how this sector can become more sustainable. This will be done i.e. by creating background stories in which the global trends of the cocoa sector are described, and by reporting about concrete projects and initiatives that should lead to a more sustainable sector. \n",
