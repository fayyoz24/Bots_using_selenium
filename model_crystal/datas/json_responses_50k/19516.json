For I am continuously amazed and in awe at the struggles people face in their lives.\nAs a choreographer I am averse to established structures and conventions. I enjoy exploring the surreal reality of the subjective and unconscious. There is a magic and poetry inherent in the living of life, and this I want my audience to experience. I use metaphors, references to iconic imagery and humour, often ironic, to communicate this. I hope in this way to take my audience on a journey, so they will discover a personal and deeper meaning to the narrative that is unfolding before their eyes. \nIn 2012, as part of my  Masters in Art Education, I researched the effects of interacting with the public during dance performances. Public participation is a surprisingly powerful tool, capable of galvanising the audience\u2019s emotions, which is why I like to use it. Sometimes the dancers in my pieces perform amidst the audience so the sensual experience of watching is heightened. Sometimes the audience is given an object to look after or a task to carry out which has a particular relevance or symbolic value for the piece. \nBelow are photos from pieces which I choreographed in collaboration with the dancers. Some of the pieces were conceived by me. Others were collaborations with artists from various disciplines during which we explored the underlying theme as a team. \nIf you click on the photos you can read about the various pieces and the issues they were raising.",

The information gathered from the interviews suggests that interaction helps an audience become more motivated and attentive in their choices, arouses their emotions and generates energy. An intense relationship sometimes develops between audience and performers, allowing for audiences to be manipulated into undertaking actions they would not normally consider. The article also considers the dilemmas around ethics and authorship that arise for choreographers when interaction is employed.",
