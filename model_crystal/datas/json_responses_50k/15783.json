Once built, the facility will be among the biggest of its kind in Europe and will produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste. The facility is designed to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2,800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, the equivalent of taking more than 1 million European cars* off the roads. \n \nThe new facility will help the Netherlands and the rest of Europe to meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets. It will also help Shell to meet its own target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society\u2019s progress towards achieving the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.  Advanced production methods will be used to make the fuels. The facility will also use technology to capture carbon emissions from the manufacturing process and store them in an empty gas field beneath the North Sea through the Porthos project. A final investment decision for Porthos is expected next year.\n\nProject competitiveness will be reached by applying new ways of working covering Agile/Scrum@Scale, integrated team working, focussed contracting, Lean Agile Tendering, Data centric engineering and delivery and Systems Engineering.",
