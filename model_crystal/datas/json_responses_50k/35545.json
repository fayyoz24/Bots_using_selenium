I participated in this simulation twice. The first time was during my second year at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen. This simulation was mainly focused on putting the theoretical part supply chain management into practice. Most decisions were related the quantity and quality of the raw materials, choosing the right carrier, deciding safety stock levels and production levels. \n\nThe second time I encountered this project was during  my specialization in Finance. This time the simulation was more comprehensive. The project not only encountered parts of supply chain management but also included running a business from a financial point of view. As a group we were responsible of paying out dividends, negotiating loans based on our credit ratings, making investment decisions and deciding if there would be a salary raise.  \n",
