    "summary": "Skilled communication professional with a focus on sustainability, climate change, the energy transition, CSR, and social entrepreneurship. I am experienced in crafting compelling stories and visuals tailor-made for the strategic goals of diverse organisations. Whether it is a social media post, a webpage, a presentation, a report or a video pitch, I can adapt to any format and make it serve your purpose.  \n\nI believe that businesses and non-profits can only be successful if they have a truthful story behind them. A story that resonates with clients and partners, one that we can tell our friends around a bonfire. To create such stories, I get to the bottom of things, I research, check facts, interview people, compose a compelling structure and write, including to a tight deadline. \n\nMy passion for communications and sustainability guided me through the work with diverse international teams united by a common goal: to make the world a better place. Through these experiences, I acquired a profound knowledge of climate change, water and sanitation, gender equality, social entrepreneurship, green energy, Asian and African affairs.    \n\nDo you want to share knowledge or cooperate?
