From colleagues I have received feedback that I am easy to get along with and am able to perform well autonomously. I have a BSc of Science from Hogeschool Leiden and a MSc of Science from the prestigious  Leiden University.    \n\nI have been involved in an early stage drug characterization study, examining the effects of a novel anti-angiogenic antibody in both pancreatic and colon cancer using in vitro cell culture experimentation and animal models. I have also been involved in business development at NLC, including; updating the Intellectual Property (IP) knowledge bank for colleagues and IP strategy for venture CEO's, responsible for collecting and curating several hundred biotechnology articles for a new sourcing strategy, involved in technology assessments and responsible for Termsheet deal analysis. \n \nMy main purpose is to make a difference in the world by helping new innovations and inventions reach patients to provide them with a better quality of life. I am driven by novel scientific discoveries and have a desire to learn more about new innovations and technology in the healthcare sector. I enjoy writing, presenting and discussing ideas to come closer to the best possible solution. With my determination, there is not a challenge I cannot overcome.",
