    "summary": "I have completed a Bachelor's program in artificial intelligence with cum laude, honours,\nand an 8.5 grade point average and now am continuing my studies as an AI Master's\nstudent. My proficiency in this field stems from me having taught myself programming at\na young age. I have been coding for more than 10 years, throughout which I have been\ncontinually improving these skills both in theory, via books and study, and in practice, by\nundertaking numerous programming projects. Furthermore, I consider myself\nacademically minded. It is another area of interest in which I have honed my skills since\nchildhood. The acumen and affinity for academia is substantiated by my achievements in\na variety of tournaments and Olympiads in mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.\n\nSome of the projects I have worked on can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/ChackMociute",
