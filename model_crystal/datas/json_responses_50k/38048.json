I could not find significant evidence on the use of NTFPs as a social safety net.\n\nThe implications include a better understanding of the role of NTFPs in forest livelihood diversification and the (economic but also ecological) limits to using this strategy to improve livelihoods of people living in and around the Gola Rainforest National Park.",
