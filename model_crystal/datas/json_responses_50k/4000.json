    "summary": "Meet Swapnil Baste, an aspiring agripreneur and dedicated agribusiness student with a burning passion for sustainable food production. Born in India and raised in a farming household, I always had a deep-rooted connection to the land, and a profound respect for the agricultural profession developed witnessing the hardships of farmers in my country. \nDriven by the desire to make a positive impact on the farmer's condition in India, I embarked on a journey to study agribusiness in the Netherlands, recognising the pivotal role it plays in transforming the way food is produced and consumed. With an unwavering commitment to sustainability, I want to create a future where farmers can thrive and where consumers can enjoy nutritious, ethically sourced food. My quest for knowledge extends beyond the confines of the classroom. \nI actively seek opportunities to engage with farmers, industry experts, and policymakers to gain practical insights into the challenges and opportunities within the agricultural sector.",

During the event, which takes place on October 13 and 14, I and other students tackled challenges that affect our daily life:\n\n1. Diversity and Inclusion\n2. Hybrid Society\n3. Living\n4. Climate change\n\nWe worked for 2 days in a great location with a team of dedicated professionals and a program that inspired us to come up with solutions never thought possible. \n\nI and my team worked on the topic of Climate change and we proposed the idea of Student Impact.\nStudent Impact is a startup that is taking on the challenge of low pickup of sustainable products among young consumers. The primary hurdle in achieving this goal has been the high cost of such products. \nTo address this issue, Student Impact plans to subsidize these products through government and private funding sources and sell them at a comparable rate. The company aims to achieve this by setting up stores that offer easy-to-understand labeling of products and their environmental impact ratings. \nIn addition, the supply chain will be fully transparent, allowing customers to make informed decisions. The stores will have screens where customers can access the value chain of the products and their impact on the environment to make sustainable purchases.   \nWith this innovative approach, Student Impact is determined to make sustainable products accessible to all and empower young consumers to make responsible choices.",

We proposed a business plan for diverting the segregated organic waste from food businesses, which would otherwise end up in landfills, to process it using the black soldier fly insect. \nThe insect larvae feed on the rejected food and make it into a healthy, protein-rich, high-quality animal diet. At the same time, a by-product of this process is that the food gets converted into plant nutrition and soil additives. This would reduce the burden on landfills and put the food waste back into the food chain, making it circular. \nOur idea received a lot of votes from the audience and we won the People's Choice award.",
