    "summary": "I am a medical doctor that also studied biomedical science and is trained in microbiology. I am currently working as an occupational physician not in training. My interests include occupational health, dermatology, medical devices, disease prevention, early detection and diagnostics using novel imaging methods to improve patient outcome. I am a high-energy, enthusiastic and confident individual who enjoys problem solving.\n\nDuring my PhD I have been fortunate to work within a hospital collaborating with clinicians and collecting central venous catheter samples from adult and paediatric populations (mostly from oncology, pulmonology and chronic-care). In addition I spent time at the National Centre for Advanced Tribology within the engineering department at the University of Southampton developing catheter-vein flow models to further advance biofilm detection within central venous catheters. In addition I developed a novel protocol using x-ray micro computed tomography to detect biofilms within central venous catheters non destructively.",
