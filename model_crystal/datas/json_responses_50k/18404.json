    "summary": "Myrthe Glasbergen is an Occupational Health Psychologist (Msc.), coach, singer and creator who is fascinated about the awakening and healing of humanity and the activation of the creative potential that is living inside all of us.\n\nAs a young child she already saw society for what it truly was: demanding, fear-based, (mind-)controlling, individualistic and emotionally immature. \n\nShe also saw that our society was (and is) teaching people from a very young age that something is wrong with them, that they are incomplete, and that they should live in fear and shame and work the rest of their lives to compensate that, without providing them the safety and attachment they need and teaching them about a deeper sense of meaning or purpose in life.\n\nLiving in a very unsafe, oppressive, unnatural and dysfunctional society like this has made us believe we are small, helpless, worthless and powerless individuals, separated from each other, who have to run and fight for their lives.\n\nBecause of this we have been living in survival mode for way too long.\n\nAt the same time as a child we are not being taught how to express and regulate our emotions, feelings, boundaries, desires and authentic self properly and in a healthy way. In fact, we are (mostly unconsciously) shamed, rejected, ignored, overlooked, ridiculed or even punished for showing vulnerability or expressing our emotions, desires, boundaries and our deepest truth(s).\n\nThis has stripped us of our life force energy and blocked us from truly LIVING and creating, and it has made us stressed, anxious, burnt-out, lonely, unfulfilled, depressed and traumatized.\n\nBecause most of us are not aware of this, we are unconsciously repeating these destructive cycles (and systems), or \u2018repeating history\u2019, and passing on trauma from generation to generation, unintentionally perpetuating it. This can only stop when someone becomes aware and decides to break the cycle. \n\nBecause Myrthe strongly believes that healed people heal the world, she has made it her mission now to help heal as many people as possible. So that they will break cycles and become authentic, free and empowered human beings who use their talents and gifts to make the world a better place.",

I discovered that singing and learning how to use your voice and find your sound are a wonderful means for personal growth. Confidence, fun and growth were therefore central to my lessons and I worked with my students to discover their own sound and finding the confidence to express it.\n\nIn addition to the private lessons, I led a singing group. Here too, fun, trust and growth were central. Singing together is mindful and a wonderful way to clear your head, release endorphins and get into the moment. And especially if you do it together! The power of singing together is sometimes indescribable, you really have to experience it.",
