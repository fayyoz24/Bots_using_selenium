The commodity type sealing solution applied in the pumps of this specific system uses a specific gland design with four 'fingers' for tightening the gland against the pump cover. \n\nIn case of a reactor scram, a limited percentage of the total steam volume created in the steam generators is dumped into a large tank filled with cold demineralized feed water. This dumping of steam is an extremely violent process, whereby the pumps downstream of this tank, face significant waterhammer and pressure pulsations. Estimations are that the additional pressure may be 30 bar or more. These pressure spikes cause the fingers of the original seal gland to simply snap off and the seal to prematurely fail.\n\nA new sealing solution was proposed using a normal full traditional seal gland with holes, designed for peak pressures up to 80 bar. Besides an upgraded seal design, also the seal plan was massively improved going from a seal plan 21 to a seal plan 23. The pumped feed water has a normal temperature of 160 \u00b0C with a sealing pressure of approx. 28 bar.",

As sea water sitting in stagnant areas can become aggressive due to lack of oxygen, more exotic type alloys might be required to withstand a specific form of corrosion. The Pitting Resistance Equivalent Number (PREN) for the alloys to be applied has be sufficiently high to prevent corrosion. In this case 316Ti was replaced with Superduplex metal parts. And in order to ensure the seal faces would be lubricated during the initial start of the pump where the water column needs to build inside the pump special provisions were made to keep the seal faces flooded at all times. Currently, the new Allpac type mechanical seals are meeting the 6 year maintenance intervals, which coincides with the maintenance work done on the cooling water pumps. Given the excellent results, similar mechanical seals have now been installed on the main cooling water pumps in other Swedish and Finnish nuclear power plants.",

In August 2015, these special seals were removed and showed that the tantalum coating could survive the electro corrosion observed in reactor water feed water pumps. One rotating seal face was in good condition, but the second rotating seal face was damaged. \nA detailed examination later on confirmed that the quality of the CVD made tantalum coating was below standard in the sense that the coating was not uniform, causing the electro corrosion to eat into the SiC base material underneath. Two spare mechanical seals with the identical tantalum coated rotating seal faces were installed and the pump was successfully taken back into service. \nAn inspection in December 2017 of the non-drive end seal showed that its tantalum coated rotating seal face was in pristine condition, proving that the solution actually holds up in feed water used in a boiling water reactor.\n\nThe remaining two reactor feed water pumps have also been converted to the new sealing solution. To date, all six mechanical seals are working flawlessly. On top of that, a second BWR nuclear plant in Finland also installed the same sealing concept back in May 2021 and the results in comparison to the original sealing solution have been excellent. Average sealing temperatures are 10 \u00b0C lower without any visible leakages. The research project has been closed.",

Originally, the pumps were fitted with single Flowserve DHTW high pressure pusher type seals, but their reliability was poor, also because the seals were simply selected during the OEM Project phase from a sales catalogue without prior lab testing or indepth engineering analysis of the seal's design. The barrel type pumps handle 300 C hot water at a suction pressure of 145 bar and have a discharge pressure of 155 bar. Sealing pressure is 145 bar using a seal plan 23. Seal failures would show sudden explosions of high pressure steam clouds and hot water. In order to protect operation and maintenance personnel a provisional wall of steel sheet plating was erected. Frequent seal failures lead to high cost in repairs and the end user was requesting improvements in mechanical seal reliability.\n\nProject approach and solution:\nA site visit was made in June 2016 to the power plant to view the situation firsthand and get the latest operating data from the end user. It was noticed that the seal cooling capacity was undersized (as is often is the case in such OEM projects), but also that the combination of sealing hot water at 145 bar pressure with a relative low speed (2070 - 2400 - 2680 RPM) requires a thorough review of the seal's design. A proposal was made for an improved seal design including extra safety features and increased seal cooling, which was accepted by the end user. Laboratory testing under real operating conditions was included to provide the optimum guarantee for the end user.\n\nProject status:\nThe new, optimized mechanical seal design is currently under laboratory testing and new, larger capacity seal coolers have been supplied.

            "description": "A European PWR is using a total of six so-called shutdown pumps. These pumps are also known as residual heat removal pumps and are combined with low head safety injection service. These 260 kW end suction type pumps normally only operate when the nuclear reactor is shutdown providing cooling to remove residual heat from the fuel in the reactor vessel. Their second function is referred to as low head safety injection. \n\nProblem description:\nIn 2006 and recently in 2015, bearing cages of the axial thrust bearing were found broken after only a few hundred hours of operation. RCA support was requested what may cause the problem.\n\nProblem approach:\nAn engineering study conducted by the bearing supplier hinted that bearing cage damages to the outer bearing of an angular contact bearings put in an O-type setting are typically the result of parasitic radial forces resulting from increased tolerances of the individual pump parts. Also, historical files showed that the bearing fitted were fitted with a larger internal play (type CC), while these days such a pump would be fitted with normal internal bearing play (type CB). Fitting a CB bearing instead of a CC bearing does mean an official change in the pump's design for which nuclear regulatory approval needs to be sought. On request of the end user a detailed plan was prepared that showed a combination of theoretical studies and practical testing to demonstrate that this change in bearing play would be possible and safe to conduct.\n\nSolution applied:\nA thermal finite element calculation using a 3D model of the pump with an analysis at normal room temperature, as well as LOCA condition verifying thermal expansion of the different pump parts justifying that the installation of a CB type bearing is possible.\n\nStatus:\nThe first CB type bearing was installed during the 2018 outage, but today all other pumps have been converted as well. The bearing problem is considered solved by the owner of the nuclear plants.",

            "description": "Description:\nWhile both power stations are individual case histories, they are linked by the fact that in many Original Equipment Manufacturing deliveries cooling for the mechanical seals on critical boiler feed water pumps are often regarded as a closing post in the contract negotiations. During the OEM and Project stage, End user/Owners and Contractors often have a common goal to keep the capital expenditure (CAPEX) as low as possible while assuring future functionality and reliability of the power station. This is sometimes conflicting and can lead to selections of hardware by the OEM Suppliers which in reality fall short of their goal. Contractual requirements often have a limited time restriction before the warranties run out, while power plants have a 40 to 60 year operation window set during which this critical equipment should function in a reliable manner. Mechanical seal selection, but more prominently the crucial cooling system for the mechanical seals are an example of such hardware. \nIn both power plants mechanical seal reliability on the main turbo feed water pump was low caused by relatively high seal operating temperatures and low margins when seal leakage increased due to wear.\n\nSolution applied:\nRemove the existing seal plan 23 system completely and replace it with new larger diameter tubing based piping system. Install a Graham Heliflow type seal cooler with more than 3.5 times the cooling capacity of the old seal cooler. Ensure interconnecting piping has a continuous upslope to allow regular sparingly venting of the system.\n\nProject status:\nBoth power plants are today operating with significant lower seal loop temperatures, which will improve overall mechanical seal reliability. More seal coolers have been purchased for the second power unit at Milmerran PS.",

One of the pumps showed black coloured lubrication oil with copper particles found in the oil sump. The damage appeared to come from the oil rings installed inside the bearing housing which splash oil inside the bearing housing for lubricating the ball bearings. The second pump would show hardened elastomer O-rings around the suction area of the pump. As both pumps were out of warranty, the end user requested a solution for these problems.\n\nSolution approach:\nFor both subjects a solutions matrix was developed with solutions ranging from good - better - best. This to present all options to the customer and have their input during the selection process. A decision was made to make changes that would seem effective and not too intrusive and complex.\n\nSolution applied:\nDesign two new journal sleeves with guiding chamfers and two new trapezoidal shaped oil rings without ID grooves and a deeper submergence into the oil bath (shaft diameter is different on both sides of the pump).\nFor the elastomers, after deliberation with the original elastomer manufacturer, is to use a Perfluoroelastomer material suitable for use in hot water and steam, but only to replace those O-rings near the pump suction part as these appeared to be suffering the most. The end user suspects that this problem is related to a plant system design problem where steam may form at pump suction under specific operating conditions, as similar damage has been seen in another PWR plant using different heater drain pumps.\n\nStatus:\nNew oil rings and journal sleeves have been installed, next to the Perfluorelastomer O-rings during 2018 outage. The owner of the power plant will also check and verify if both pumps are indeed installed level as they should be.",

            "description": "Problem description:\nA global oil company has a platform off the East Coast of Sakhalin Island and uses two crude oil pipeline pumps to pump the oil to a processing unit on Sakhalin Island where it can be processed. From here the processed oil is transported to loading facility in the south of Sakhalin Island for shipping the oil across the globe. The pumps are competitor pumps, multistage, axial split, between bearings, API type BB3. They have been fitted with dual pressurized mechanical seals using seal plan 53B, but these seals regularly fail. Repairs are conducted locally due to remoteness of this location. End user is requesting RCA input into the mechanical seal problems.\n\nRCA approach:\nAll seal inspection reports made during each repair were studied. All the individual seal failures were noted and tallied showing that the largest cause for failure was the same. All mechanical seals are lubricated by an independant and monitored sealant system. It uses a water-glycol barrier fluid due to the cold ambient conditions and any contamination of a dual pressurized seal with crude oil means that reversed pressure from the pipeline system must have occurred pushing the unprocessed crude into the seal and sealant system.\n\nSolution proposed:\nRecommended a WANDA hydraulic study of the pipeline from the pumps on the platform till the onshore processing unit to examine the hydraulic conditions during pumping and transients. It is suspected that rapid closure of a valve downstream of the platform, may cause a pressure spike in the system pushing the oil into the mechanical seal. Broken silicon carbide seal faces on the product side, which would become pressurized from the inside when subjected to a reversed pressure condtion, seem to subscribe to this root cause.\n\nStatus:\nRecommendation was given to the oil company, but no hydraulic study has been performed yet.",
