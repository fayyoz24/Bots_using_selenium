    "summary": "I am a PhD researcher at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), The Hague. My research is on the indigenous social movements in the eastern state of Jharkhand in India. I affiliate myself to the field of development studies, socio-cultural anthropology, indigenous studies and conflict studies. \n\nBesides my academic expertise, I have several extra-curricular interests that I am currently pursuing. I am the co-founder of Namhai Education Consultancy (based in India), which aims to empower the marginalized communities through educational tools. Through this platform, I also provide mentorship and guidance to students who intend to pursue higher education in a foreign country. \n\nI am also the co-founder and co-editor of Jan Sangharsh magazine - a digital and print platform to raise the issues of indigenous communities in Jharkhand and in India. Jan Sangharsh is a monthly magazine that aims to deliver news, issues and information in an accessible format to the rural indigenous population. \n\nAt my current institute (ISS), I am part of the Creative Sessions team for my research group, where I design activities that are intended to create informal healthy spaces between faculty members and PhD researchers, such as to contribute to a caring environment in the institute. Previously at ISS, I had functioned as the Chair for the 15th annual PhD conference (referred to as 'Development Dialogue'), where over 50 participants came together from over 30 countries across the globe. \n\nI'm enthusiastic, hard-working, team player, ethnographer and researcher with inter-disciplinary interests. \n\nMy previous work experiences point to my interdisciplinary tract. I have earlier worked as a research assistant in the President House of India, on writing a book on foreign affairs. And prior to that, I have also worked as an intern with the Defense Ministry's think tank - Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis. \n\nMy life concerns can be summarized in two overlapping points - social justice and environment. \n\nWhen pursuing my undergraduate studies, I was the Director of Enviro Club of my college for two years. It was here that I found my passion in organizing activities towards sustainability. This passion has continued over years, and along with concerns of social justice, it reflects in my academic research as well.",
