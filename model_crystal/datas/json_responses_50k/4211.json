DanDrone is one of the leading suppliers of drone equipment and drones in Denmark and Scandinavia, delivering for both business and private sector. The course introduced the history and approaches of user-driven innovation (usability engineering, participatory design, design anthropology, lead-user approach and others). It discussed how these approaches play out in an industrial organisation: The uptake of provocative user knowledge, collaborative sense-making, user empathy and identity forming, social shaping of innovation, participatory business modelling. As the drone technology is becoming mature and reaching more popularity worldwide, the project's aim was to investigate possibilities to expand the technology by adding useful features to the current remote controlled drone.",

Scientific knowledge suggests that there exists, besides genetics and environmental factors, a pathological significant relationship to the digestive system in triggering autoimmunity. Relatively little attention was paid to its huge impact on the thyroid gland function.\nOBJECTIVE: By mapping the current state of research, this scoping review aimed to shed light on the underestimated potential of treating thyroid autoimmunity in pregnancy from a clinical and public health perspective based on an ever-growing body of evidence. The main objective was to examine how the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis (HT) interferes with the health of mother & child, during and after pregnancy.\nMETHODS: This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for identifying, screening, and assessing eligibility of relevant literature. Obtained data relied on extensive literature screenings of two databases to identify all relevant sources: MEDLINE/PubMed combined with Google Scholar.",

In spite of the ever growing body of a health-conscious attitude among consumers, health promoters and food manufacturers face major challenges in the commercialization of these products. Hence, this research conducts, as the main part of this thesis, a qualitative research among younger consumers in Southern Denmark (students, parents, and employees) which delivers valuable insights into the consumers\u2019 dietary behavior and their attitude towards health-enhancing foods. The qualitative results are presented in a critical viewpoint based on consumers\u2019 experience and are being compared with considerable aspects of a comprehensive literature review. Furthermore, a quantitative survey on a small scale (Southern Denmark and Copenhagen) underscores the argumentation in terms of managerial relevance to support health promoters and food producers in the development of smart marketing strategies for healthy nutrition products.",
