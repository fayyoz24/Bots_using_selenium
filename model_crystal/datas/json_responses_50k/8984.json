    "summary": "I am a performer, maker, workshop teacher and artistic director with a special interest in the human voice and the interdisciplinary craft of improvisation. I have been creating performances in music, (visual) theatre and dance for the last 20 years. Since more than 10 years, I have been developing the work of the Genetic Choir Ensemble (genetic-choir.org), and brought this unique blend of instant composition philosophy and technique to countries such as France, Italy, Czech Republic, England, Germany, United States and Japan. \n\nIt fascinates me to use an artistic view on improvisation in areas outside the arts, such as developing ways of interacting with people who's verbal abilities have been impaired in the Stem&Luister project (stem-en-luister.nl). I also enjoy teaching professionals and organizations of any trade how to be centered and clear in relationships and work modes, how to be sensitive as well as bold, yielding as well as leading. How to be in connection with others while being yourself and following your heart.\n\nAs founding member of WhatIIIF? - an international, nomadic improvisation research festival now in its fifth year - I am part of an eager, international community of researchers and artist and I am applying my 25 years of aikido experience (a Japanese martial art) where ever it fits. \n\nSee www.genetic-choir.org for most of what makes me happy right now.",

It was formed in Amsterdam in 2007 when Thomas Johannsen invited musicians and actors to investigate the use of the human voice through non-idiomatic improvisation. Over the years  the Genetic Choir has evolved into a diverse group of vocal improvisers investigating the dynamics of open systems, self-organization and complexity. This open and eclectic approach results in a certain amount of complexity in the composition process, creating at times both rich and empty, both organic and erratic compositions. No single human sound is excluded and no musical genre is forbidden or favoured. Foremost, we strive to trust our intuition throughout the improvisation process in order to maintain vocal authenticity and intense contact with our audiences. Each Genetic Choir concert is a unique work and unrepeatable in its exact musical content.\n\nThe ensemble sings fully improvised concerts, but also collaborates within multi-disciplined fields; exploring semi-open structures like graphic scores and using the architectural-acoustic properties of a building to create site-specific aural experiences. Additionally, the Genetic Choir method has been employed as part of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (UK), the Grachtenfestival Amsterdam (NL), the European Choir Festival (IT/NL), Hlasohled in Prague (Czech Republic) and at Robert Wilson's Watermill Centre (NY, USA)\n\nwww.genetic-choir.org",

Together with artists from other disciplines they are looking for relating more dynamically and intimately with their audiences.\n\nOur base is Radio Kootwijk, an old radio station build like a cathedral, situated on the edge of the nature park De Veluwe near Apeldoorn, Netherlands.\n\nOn this unusual location, there are several Laboratorium sessions each year in which we develop new material and interact with invited audiences and fellow artists. By now there have been several spin-offs and concerts (like on the Huddersfield Festival for Contemporary Music 2010) while we also have found a committed partner in the Vredenburg, Utrecht who will program regular concerts of RKL under the motto 'Carte Blanche' in the Leeuwenberghkerk this and next season.  (see vredenburg.nl)\n\nThe approach of Radio Kootwijk Live is defined by an open view on what musical performance could be. Collaboration of professionals from varying disciplines and an unusual trust and openness to different approaches that do not have to cancel each other out but can live next to and enrich each other are the trademark of RadioKootwijkLive. The fact that we are always looking for a connection with our audiences, involving them, rather than playing 'at' them means that each performance is a special experience, for both performers and guests.\n\nOver the last few years, I have been involved in several installments of the RadioKootwijkLive sessions, in varying roles:  as Musician/Singer, Voice instructor for audiences, but also creating and defining concepts, producing shows and supporting the artistic processes from the role of stage director, talk facilitator and dramaturg.\nMeer info / films / photo's van de sessies: \n\nhttp://thojoh.wordpress.com/radiokootwijklive/",
