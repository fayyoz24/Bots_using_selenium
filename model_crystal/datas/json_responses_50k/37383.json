    "summary": "Jan Nieulant improved and extended the database applied for production- and cost calculation of dredging projects executed with CSD\u2019s and TSHD\u2019s in NL and Bangladesh.\n\nHe designed the cradles for the renovation of the slipway of the Takoradi Shipyard in Ghana and guided the installation team in the assembly of the cradles. The calculations for the strength of the cradle were verified with a Computer Aided Engineering program.\n\nHe designed the Roller Sluice Gates for the Gezira Irrigation Scheme in the Sudan and was responsible for the quality control during the construction of the doors and the operation system.\n\nHe designed a general design for a grab dredge with a cargo hold on a self-propelled pontoon. The pontoon has to discharge her cargo either over a ramp on the beach or by the grab crane. The pontoon needs to be capable on discharging when sitting on the beach.\n\nHe carried out a study into the management of the two open sea disposal sites for Geotechnical Engineering Office of the Civil Engineering Department, Hong Kong. The study examined current legislation, allocation / licensing conditions, controls and management principles adopted for open sea disposal of uncontaminated dredged material in Hong Kong. He has provided assistance in analysing the data collected during the Plume monitoring test in Hong Kong.\n\nHe assisted in preparation of specialist advice for the Container Terminal 10 & 11 Detailed Design Study for the Civil Engineering Department of the Hong Kong Government. He carried out assessments of volumes and validated data with specialised computer packages for several alternatives for the dredging and reclamation of an extension for the Port of Rotterdam and for the reclamation of a cement plant site in Bangladesh.\n\nHe advises clients on spare part stocks and procurement and oversees the ordering and dispatch of dredging equipment for overseas clients.\n\nKey words;\n- Dredging\n- Irrigation\n- Mechanical Engineering\n- Production & Cost Calculation",
