    "summary": "I am more than interested in everything that has to do with science about plants, in particular succulent plants. \nI have a degree in Plant Biology, Biochemistry and specialized in Plant Tissue Culture techniques. and first year of Spanish language. Inventor of induction of variegation patterns in plants by means of tissue culture. High interest in the use of succulent plants for pharmaceutical purposes and to help to end the destruction of habitat growing plants.\n\nSpecialismen: Founder of the technique to introduce variegations patterns in plants. Highly specialized in Plant tissue Culture, even recalcitrant species. Also founder of a system that enables activation of difficult dormant buds/axils in tissue culture.\nOur company produces over 3000 different (succulent) plant species in tissue culture, mostly all on a small, collectors scale. Some in larger amounts. Most of our products are exported worldwide.\nOur main current activity is sales of our unique produced variegated plants on our private auction site at our website. See: www.succulent-tissue-culture.com/en/auction\nWe continue to develop new Plant Tissue Culture methods, both by implementing new physical parameters in the growth vessels and new types of light as well as completely new tissue culture media inventions.",

I was active in the lab preparing my new project which supposed to be something real new; and it became (unwanted) a very new project; Heart.\nAt about 8.15 I felt an increasing pain in my chest. Unusual. I decided to do it a little slower but the pain increased and I couldn't stand it anymore. I rushed to call 112 (the Dutch 911). My wife got very nervous and so did I. In minutes the ambulance arrived. In minutes it was clear for the 2 experienced persons; they stitched all needed on to my chest and rushed to Breda to the nearest hospital where a possible heart surgery could be made. In the ambulance I got the nitro sprays.... and before I new I was on the operation table with a group of doctors all around me. In no time I got multiple infusions and whatever necessary and in 8 minutes a large stent was placed in the blocked coronary artery. I was than brought to another hospital closer to our home and plugged-in in whatever machine I remember with these terrible beeb-sounds. They injected all sorts of medications and after I had to take 1 'brown' tablet I was 'gone'; I fainted, slided into 'whatever'. I remember me saying; 'I go' and for a short period of time I was 'there' and before I knew they had my heart back on the rail again beating like it should. Vomitting, feeling sick, wondering why I was 'back' I saw the face of my wife and all the doctors around me, the beebs and I knew i felt back in life. \nSeveral recovery days started in the hospital and the remaining recovery had (and has) to take place at home. Coming home last week I went in the lab. I noticed something odd; the lab-clock stood still at 8.20 A.M. since that saturday. It must be an empty battery......\nProject 'heart' had started and will continue. I am not done here yet. There are still things to do.\nThanks you guys from the ambulance and all the staff in the 2 hospitals.\nAnd thanks 'Dmitri'..",
