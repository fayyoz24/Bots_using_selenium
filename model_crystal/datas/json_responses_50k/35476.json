    "summary": "I love to read, work in the garden and spend time with my family and friends. I love writing. We have a wide variety of friends in different cultures and with different backgrounds. I truly believe this colours the world and makes life more beautiful. Mutual respect is at the heart of everything I do and what I teach my children.\n\nI have excellent communication skills in both Dutch and English. \nAlthough I haven\u2019t used my German and French vocabulary recently, the words I know help me relate to people on a personal level quite quickly. I can read German on a proficient level.\n\nI am a fast learner, very autodidactic and broadly interested.\nI am very proactive when I see opportunities for improvement both in business and private life. I believe in an ongoing development and constant evolving.\nI love to work closely with colleagues to find solutions for difficult problems.\nI am direct, open and honest and love to use humour to put things in perspective.\n\nIn work, I go for the bigger picture without losing focus on the details.\n",
