    "summary": "HAARLEM, NETHERLANDS, September 9, 2014, Martine Elizabeth van Santen, Artistic and Business Director of Dance in Art has been recognized for showing dedication, leadership and excellence in choreography and business management. Ms. van Santen wears many hats as the artistic and business director of Dance in Art. (WORLDWIDE Who\u2019s Who registry of executives, professionals and entrepreneurs)\n\nFor Martine van Santen, an internationally renowned dancer, choreographer and instructor, art allows her to express the essence of her existence in this world. She enrolled in a master\u2019s program at the Utrecht School of the Arts while teaching dance at Transvaal College and completing an apprenticeship with Young in Prison. Little did she know that working with these groups in tandem would provide her with the insight and experience to establish Dance in Art, a center for dance, art education and performance training. Ms. van Santen encourages her performers to research various modes of art to actualize their full potential and find their artistic points of view. She developed this learning model while working on her master thesis, which focused on dance expression and art methodologies for young offenders and young adults with severe psychiatric disorders. Applying what she learned through her research, Martine has helped dancers from various backgrounds find their unique styles and develop their personal abilities.\n\nLooking back, Ms. van Santen attributes her success to her education and her experiences working in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and New York. \n\nMs. van Santen received a Master of Education in Arts from the Utrecht School of the Arts in 2012, as well as a Bachelor of Performing Arts in contemporary dance and choreography from the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, where she graduated with honors in 2004. In years to come, Ms. van Santen would like to expand the company and incorporate different types of art into the company\u2019s performances.",
