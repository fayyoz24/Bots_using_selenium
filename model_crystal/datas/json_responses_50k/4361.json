Besides the Recruitment responsibilities, I focused on Employer Branding initiatives, where I brainstormed and later presented the ideas to my supervisor regarding various Employer Branding initiatives for Boehringer Ingelheim. \n\nI can surely say that I took a lot out of this internship, mainly discipline, attention to details, and seriousness of meeting the deadlines.

Almost all of the students I took in 2019 stayed with me till my last day at the company.  \n\nThe reviews I got from the students when I was leaving the company were really positive, with people highlighting that they found working me easy and reliable. Moreover, they complemented on my people skills, as well as the ability to guide with the material in the way that fosters learning in its best way. After leaving the company, 3 of the students decided to stay with me and keep having classes on my self-employed basis.",
