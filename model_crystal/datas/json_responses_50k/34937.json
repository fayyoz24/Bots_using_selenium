    "summary": "Hello, I'm Niek van Hoecke. I live in Hoek, a little village down in The Netherlands nearby Terneuzen. Currently I am working at DOW Terneuzen, as ERS Maintenance Engineer. Next to my job, I have a lot of other interests as well. I am mad about cars, engines and everything that produces a raw noise and a lot of speed. I also like food, and being busy with food, so in my spare time I have worked at a butchery for 8 years. As long as I can be creative I am a happy person. Being busy with my hands makes me just as happy as being busy with my mind. \n\nAfter finishing secondary schooI in 2009, I have chosen for the education 'Automotive technology and design' at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. I have also lived in Rotterdam for four years, so I left the country side for the 'big city'. I've finished this study in July 2013, and I was ready for a new challenge . That's the reason why I've started a new study, in Antwerp. Although, after a year I have stopped studying, as some courses were way beyond my field of interest. But learning new things always triggers me and keeps me going. \n\nIn November 2014 I started working for Leroy-Somer Holland. I moved to Zwijndrecht and left my roots in Zeeland again. I learned a lot about electric motors and alternators, and came in touch with some very interesting applications and inspiring people. Due to an upcoming reorganisation, I made the choice to begin a new challenge. \n\nFrom June 2016 until January 2022 I have worked for Draftec in Middelburg, as a Mechanical Engineer. During this period I learned a lot about offshore systems, winches, cranes, cable laying equipment and all sorts of other offshore related systems. Together with my colleagues I was responsible for the mechanical engineering part of several different hydraulic- and mechanical systems. This period was very versatile, with a lot of different tasks and projects. \n\nSince February 2022 I have made the step to start working for DOW Terneuzen as a Maintenance Engineer. A different working area but also a different opportunity to evolve myself and to begin a new challenge!",
