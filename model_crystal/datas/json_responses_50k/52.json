    "summary": "I completed my studies in Boston, Massachusetts. There, I attended Berklee College of Music graduating with a Bachelor of Music in Performance, Magna Cum Laude and a minor in musical theater, as well as Boston University where I earned my Master of Music in Voice Performance degree, Pi Kappa Lambda. My own performing experience has been very diverse. I have worked on workshop performances of new musicals, voice acting, opera and recital, and for the past years I have been exclusively working as a classical lyric baritone singer.\n\nAs a singing teacher I have been very fortunate to have worked with very talented singers who have gone on to successfully audition or have graduated from institutions like the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts and Berklee College of Music. An opera and musical theater voice specialist, I have also offered voice lessons to a few singer/songwriters and pop artists in the past. I take special interest in the Italian and French operatic and song repertoires and lyric diction. I offer extensive knowledge of French m\u00e9lodie as a means to build and develop the singing voice in a most functional and colorful way. \n\n\u200bOutside of the teaching studio and when not singing myself, I offer career coachings on a limited basis. Former clients have been accepted into Longy School of Music of Bard College, Conservatorium van Amsterdam, and various other universities in the United Kingdom and the United States, both for undergraduate as well as for graduate study and in most cases with significant funding. \n\nI invest a lot of time staying up to date with the most current vocal pedagogy research, and I maintain a selective private voice studio in Vienna, Austria, as well as an online studio welcoming clients from all over the world.",
