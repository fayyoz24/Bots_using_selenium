    "summary": "Currently working as a Mechanical Engineer in ASML to control the internal environment of EUV machine and infrastructure design. \n\nPreviously worked as a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) researcher in University of Twente, Netherland. PDEng is a post master's research work which is mainly based on practical assignment and highly concentrated on design work. During the PDEng research, I gain experience related to project management, design methodology, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculation, FEM numerical simulation and systematic design approach. Moreover, the research work builds a bridge in between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of analytical knowledge.   My research is run by Nonlinear Solid Mechanics group in UTwente and a company MAATS.\n\nEarlier studied my master's study in Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden), Germany, on Computational and Structural Engineering (named ACCESS). During the study, I learned computational methods in engineering and numerical simulation experience of different structural engineering. My engineering life started through the Bachelor studies in Bangladesh University of Eng and Tech (BUET),  in Bangladesh, adopting Structural Engineering as a major subject. \n\nCareer goal: A position that requires analytical reasoning and creativity, where I can apply my academic knowledge effectively and efficiently. I am passionate about programming, design analyzing and improving, FEM calculation, FEM simulation and working with a new & challenging assignment. It is appealing for me to work in a friendly environment. Future goal is to establish me as an effective, professional and suitable engineer.\n\nKey Skills: Experienced with\n-  FEM calculation\n- FEM analysis by ANSYS & ABAQUS\n- 3D plasticity modeling by MATLAB, FORTRAN & FEAP\n- 2D & 3D drawing software like SolidWorks, AUTOCAD ",

According to cold-bending process, it is difficult to bend a 4-5 ft diameter pipe with steel grade X80 or X100 without any physical damage. It will be convenient to reduce the bending moment by 20 - 30% with high internal pressure. Developing a technique, that will be able to apply high internal presssure, is also challenging.",

For a large amount of gas transportation, the dimension of these pipes are large; such as diameter 48\"~60\" and wall-thickness 0.5\"~1.5\".  Those pipes are bent by a hydraulic bending machine. Bending of these thin-walled pipes is very difficult due to different physical damage; such as buckling, ovality, eccentricity and wrinkling. \n\nThe aim of my project is:\n- A prototype test in the laboratory with small pressure\n- Numerical simulation of high-strength steel pipe with high internal pressure by ANSYS Workbench\n- Numerical calculation to determine the relationship between different parameters\n- 3D plasticity modeling by MATLAB programming\n- Finding different ideas and discuss with stakeholder's\n- Choose a solution and perform analytical and numerical simulation by ABAQUS\n- Make a design proposal for the technical solution\n\nResults: High-amount of internal pressure will reduce the bending moment by 20~30%. Additionally, the solution will work with the existing system and it will save the machine and the reduce operation time.",
