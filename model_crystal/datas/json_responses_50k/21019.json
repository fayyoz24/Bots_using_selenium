The subject of the website is European elections of 2014. The customer was conserend that the last elections were not popular among students. The aim was to make students more aware of their right to vote and the impact of (not) voting on the society. Together with students from European Studies program at Maastricht University we could build a team of enthousiasts who spread the word. Below you can find some material we have made. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGN1HtML5YA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV1zeC36G4s\n\nThe most interesting from this project is the fact that I needed to be more than just a webdesigner. All of a sudden I was a project manager. I needed to find enthousist who would like to be in the team and focus them on the things we need to do. Because of this project I could practice my management and communication skills. Looking back on the done work I could have done many things differently, and I will try to use this knowledge in my future projects. ",

The project required getting familiar with the Bureau van Dijk API (Moody's Analytics Company), the UiPath RPA development suite and the proprietary software SupportCentral which also communicates via a SOAP API. The project required to work in a team environment using SCRUM methodology. Thanks to teams extraordinary efforts the Innovation Lab has grown in team members as well as in funding.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned project a second large project in which I was involved and had the leading role is the development of an application in Access 2013, which replaced a bulky Excel file. Adding new data and running reports was never so easy and quick.\n\nThe final project that is worth mentioning is a reconciliation of sales that were generated through iTunes and YouTube. The most difficult part is handling of a large amount of data, up to 6GB!! in Excel format. To speedily process all the data several automation techniques were used, like RPA. Furthermore the data was processed, analyzed and manipulated or better to say wrangled using VBA and the MicroStrategy software.",
