    "summary": "Artistique:\n\nI was born in 1988 in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. I started studying music at the age of 6; I was playing the flute.\nWhen I was 14 years old I got interested in dance and I started learning hip hop which I have done for many years. In 2008 I followed the dance teacher bachelor program at Codarts, school of Arts in Rotterdam. One year later I decided to study modern dance at The Theaterschool in Amsterdam. I will graduate in June.\nRecently I have worked with Itamar Serussi Sahar (ex dancer of Batcheva dance company, Israel); He choreographed The Stravinsky\u2019s opera: Pulcinella, a collaboration between 3 dancers and 3 singers.",
