In order to foster healthier diets, going beyond expanding the diversity of products on the supply side, or raising awareness on the demand side is therefore necessary. HealthyFoodAfrica aims to increase the resilience of food systems, and to link food production to nutrition performance, thereby increasing the range and quality of food products for a healthy diet. To achieve this, it engages with farmers, food processors, retailers, civil society organisations (CSOs), policymakers and local experts, and helps them create, and test, innovative technologies, practices and governance arrangements that contribute to a more sustainable, resilient and healthy food system for all.\n\nWhat will HealthyFoodAfrica do to achieve the desired impacts?\n\uf0b7 Create 10 Food System Labs in 10 cities and 6 countries in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa. Each lab will bring together local stakeholders \u2013 farmers, entrepreneurs, businesses, and policymakers.\n\uf0b7 With the support of local and European experts, labs will tackle particular locally relevant food system challenges, from consumer awareness to sustainable production, local food diversity, improved post-harvest technologies and food safety.\n\uf0b7 HealthyFoodAfrica will connect actors from across the supply chain for joint actions to achieve viable transformations in municipal, regional, national and cross-national food systems, connecting consumers and producers, urban and rural dwellers, and local initiatives across Africa.",

The aim of the RETHINK project is to explore the meaning of agricultural development, and of agricultural modernization, at a time when the agricultural sector must respond to increasing scarcity and distributional questions. \n\nRETHINK connects the development of agriculture with the wider societal and policy goal of vibrant rural areas. It explicitly recognizes the complexity of challenges, the diversity in situations, and the multidimensionality of strategies forward. The project's aim was translated into a set of common research questions, and these were used to select 15 major case studies, one in each participating country. The case studies will improve our under\u00adstanding of the multiple mechanisms underlying rural prosperity and resilience. Each case is an expression of innovative development trajectories, highlighting potential synergies between farm modernization and sustainable rural development.\n\nRETHINK combines an explorative perspective with an action-oriented policy and governance orientation: right from the start, decision-makers from the public and private sectors will be involved, shaping the implementation of the project. RETHINK wants to facilitate an informed and productive interaction among industry, government, academic institutions, civil society organisations and farmers. It understands the discourse about the future of European agriculture as a strategic opportunity for all actors involved in project implementation. ",
