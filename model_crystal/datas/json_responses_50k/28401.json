Post-implementation manuals generated for each software component.\nExperience with software architecture AUTOSAR compliant for application software component using the dSpace SystemDesk tool.\nVehicle experiments and software tests on Hardware In-the-Loop simulator using INCA from ETAS in order to watch and log real time execution data and CANalyzer from Vector in order to check and log the CAN bus dataflow. \nExperience at the Chrysler Technical Center in USA for 9 weeks. The firsts 5 weeks (Jan \u2013 March/2017) working on software validation on HIL (Hardware In-the-Loop), the HIL was a Scalexio from dSpace that I could interface using ControlDesk tool.

Several studies have shown that the largest vector of hospital-acquired infections is in the hands of health professionals, thus the simplest and most effective way of combat this issue is to clean the hands in the correct manner and frequency.\n\nThe frequency of hands hygiene is monitored through a radio frequency identification (RFID) system contained in the lavatory and badges. In this way an integrated computational system shall expose each employee's cleaning frequency information individually. The system intend to be easy installation and using, also not affecting the dynamics of the hospital.",
