    "summary": "Gerald is an experienced urban political anthropologist with over 20 years of inter-disciplinary experience in citizens engagement, social inclusion & integration, inclusive governance, smart cities, urban poverty, and the localisation of SDGs. He has worked with different international agencies in over 25 countries in Africa to promote inclusive service delivery and local economic and social development together with local and national governments. Gerald also works with civil society organisations and knowledge institutes to design and implement curriculums on inclusive approaches and solutions for service delivery. As an urban development professional, Gerald works at the interface between practice, policy, and research going from university lecture halls, to policy boardrooms, to the \"embryonic thinking\" of community project start-ups. \n\nMy key skills include promoting inclusive local governance, project management, research, training, lobbying governments and civil society organizations, and impact studies.\n\nI am driven by a core belief that a more fair, healthy and sustainable world is possible and that, inclusivity represent (or should represent) the very essence of our human existence.",
