I took the initiative to research organizations that shared a similar vision as Booking.com and organized volunteering projects regarding cultural heritage, environment and social topics around sustainable tourism. My goal was to engage my colleagues to volunteer 8 hours to one of these projects. \n\nI acted as a liaison between Booking.com and the organizations. I was responsible to coordinate all things related to the execution of the project, from transport, lunches, clothing, to updating our internal system with a description of the project to promote the activity among my colleagues. In addition, I kept track and reported the progress of the project to the Booking Cares team. This experience taught me how to be comfortable leading volunteers and making sure that the goal of the project is achieved. I truly enjoyed dealing with different organizations and coordinating projects. I wish to continue this line of work as it is part of my professional and personal ambition. \n"
