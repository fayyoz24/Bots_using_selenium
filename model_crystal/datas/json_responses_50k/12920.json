My traineeship at Ubifrance has shown me that clear communication, whether to and with colleague or clients or citizens, should not be underestimated. \nIt can be of crucial importance to make yourself understood in a clear way and to make a positive contribution to the proficiency as well as efficiency of a company. \n\nMy desired position is within a company where I can work with people and with lots of variety in tasks. Preferably in an international company, because my know-how focuses on French language and culture, business administration and business cultures.",
