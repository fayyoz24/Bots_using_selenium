We propose that instead of promoting \u2018improved health\u2019 as the main motivation to engage in healthy behaviours, communication might be more meaningful and persuasive if it emphasizes the immediate benefits that are most compelling to the distinct value types (e.g., increased vitality, stress reduction, enjoying life, focus at work). Segmenting a population based simply on health-related motive orientations might be a very useful strategy for understanding exercise behaviour.",

The research project seeks to examine how social norms can be used to encourage health-related behaviours in public environments. Four field experiments are designed to investigate the effectiveness of signs and posters (different comm. channels can be used), which are asking participants to comply with a special request \u2013 to improve their health-related behaviours by making healthy food purchases.\nThe findings of the research might have implications for public treatments and programs targeted at improving various health-related behaviours (i.e., buying and consuming healthy food, exercising regularly, etc.). Specifically, it is proposed that such treatments might be more effective if they use normative information in attempt to simultaneously change peoples\u2019 attitudes, beliefs and control standards, by creating situational circumstances which are promoting self-regulation as a behaviour that is both socially approved and performed.\n",
