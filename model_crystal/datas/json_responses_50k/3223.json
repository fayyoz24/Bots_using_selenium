This vision led to the birth of EasyGreen Packaging, a pioneering reusable packaging solution. Coupled with an optimized delivery process and cutting-edge IoT infrastructure, EasyGreen Packaging empowers our clients to ship sustainably, effortlessly, and securely, eliminating the need for inventory management or imposing extra tasks on their customers.\n\nBesides an impressive 95% retention rate, our solution significantly reduces empty packaging miles, slashing cleaning and refurbishment needs due to the inventory management tool we developed. All these make us the sustainability frontrunner in reusable packaging.\n\nAs the solution's founder, I've embarked on a journey of intrapreneurial success, gaining hands-on experience in sustainable innovation project management, collaborative customer and sales team engagement, end-to-end packaging process oversight, and seamless supply chain management. Implementing EasyGreen Packaging across DHL Group's diverse business units has deepened my insights into warehouse operations, pick and pack processes, and distribution logistics.\n\nIn addition to driving EasyGreen Packaging's success, I've played an active role in shaping sustainability regulations. My contributions encompass work on the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation, Circular Economy for Sustainable Development (CSRD), and national packaging regulations. My commitment to innovation extends to a patent application for an adaptive, space-efficient reusable packaging solution, underlining my dedication to sustainable packaging advancements.",
