Belgrade, 1974) graduated in 1999 from the Royal Academy of Art (KABK), The Hague, after which she obtained a Masters in painting from the Frank Mohr Institute, Groningen in 2001. In 2002 and 2004 Medic was a resident of the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, where she still currently lives and works.\n\nMedic\u2019s decision to touch upon different levels of our perception is visible in all of her works. She often plays with the thin line between our 3-dimentional and our 2-dimensional experience of an image and the space depicted in it. \n\nThrough her work she also addresses the notion of time and memory; constantly searching for new ways of embodying time into form, and being interested in the influence of time on our reading of the work. As a reflection of these interests, Medic often makes in her work the use of repetition, pattern, rhythm and sequence, as well as  \u2018deviations\u2019 within these systems.\n\nMedic has made numerous designs for art in public spaces throughout The Netherlands; a video projection in the Parliament building in The Hague, an interior for the waiting room of the train station in Breukelen, as well as a ceramic fa\u00e7ade library in Amsterdam. In addition to her large-scale works, Medic also creates collages, photos and drawings.\n\nShe exposed her work among others at Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam, Fries Museum in Leeuwarden, and the New York Photo Festival. In 2004, Medic was awarded the Uriotprijs award.",
