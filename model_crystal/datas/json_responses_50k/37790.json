As student representatives we are also closely involved in the organisation and especially evaluation of all educational aspects of the network, including the conference. \n\nMy main activities were international meetings to design proposals on how to improve the network, drafting strategy-documents and participation in international meetings to defend the earlier mentioned proposals.  \n\nhttp://www.euroleague-study.org/",
