    "summary": "\"How to learn to have a Good life\" and \"How to organize a Good life\" are the questions I focus on. \n\nAs more and more people experience stress and everyone likes to increase their value and happiness, it becomes vital to learn about self-management and what could improve your own life. Additionally we see the costs of healthcare increasing evermore for diseases that can be prevented. Lifestyle interventions can also be used curatively and increase the patient's autonomy and self management.\n\nWith Shoshin we try to (re)design and co-create innovative solutions the public and medical domain. We focus on healthcare where we sustainably improve health and help making the transition from curative to preventive care.\n\nI have an academic background in business & innovation, learning and philosophy. I try to keep up with the science and technology of vitality, happiness and behavioural change (MOOCs, books and papers). By principle I actively experiment myself with everything I read and learn. I experiment with all kinds of quantified self technology. I also invest significantly in martial arts, meditation and retreats.\n\nFor more information, please view www.shoshin.nu and www.timhaarlemmer.nl.",

It is our mission to help society in innovating in complex matters. \u2018Shoshin\u2019 refers to the \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind\u201d in the Zentradition: to look at and experience something as if you see and experience it for the first time. With this open mind we can find new perspectives, co-design solutions and make sure the adoption of the users and professionals is realized. \n\nWe are specialized in mental healthcare (youth and adult) and our most common challenge is waiting time. We work in the transition from curative to preventive care (a.o. lifestyle). The essential challenge is to iteratively redesign current social institutions: starting with what is possible now and building towards the future. Waiting times are a specifically interesting topic that can stimulate the step towards preventive care.\n\nIn the domain of youth (mental) health services (Jeugdzorg) we are national ambassador against waiting times for the Ondersteuningsteam Zorg voor de Jeugd (OZJ), working also for the Ministry of Health and the national association for municipalties (VNG)\n\nIn adult mental health we are scaling up our best practice of the innovative lifestyle clinic.\n\nWe have won several awards, such as the \n- 'Koploperinitiatief in de zorg' for elite innovation in healhcare (Actie-leernetwerk, by the Ministry of Health)\n- Bronze awards for Learning Professional of the Year by the Learning & Performance Institute (LPI, London)\n- VGZ Good Practice (health insurer) for exemplary innovation",
