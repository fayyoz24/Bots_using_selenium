    "summary": "BIM Modeler & Event Manager: Combining Technical Expertise with Creative Vision\n\nAs an ambitious Architectural Technologist with a passion for both BIM modeling and event management, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, creativity, and leadership to my work. \n\nMy education in architecture has given me a strong foundation in the technical aspects of building design, from urban planning to creating accurate and detailed 3D models of buildings and other structures. Additionally, my education has honed my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are essential skills in both architecture and event management.\n\nAt the Event Academy, I earned a Diploma in Event Management for Marketing & Communications, which has given me valuable transferable skills that intersect with my work as a BIM modeler. Specifically, my experience in event management has honed my ability to collaborate effectively with diverse teams, manage projects under tight timelines and budgets, and communicate clearly with clients and stakeholders. In turn, my technical skills as a BIM modeler help me design and visualize event spaces.\n\nIn addition to my technical, creative, and transferable skills, I have a keen eye for aesthetics, which has been invaluable in my work as an event manager. I have experience working in teams on a variety of different projects and have demonstrated my leadership skills by managing a volunteer team in one of the largest youth-run organizations.\n\nWith a continuous process of learning, I am always eager to find new ways to develop my professional knowledge and explore the intersections between these two fields. I invite you to connect with me to learn more about why I am so passionate about both architecture and events, and how my unique blend of skills and experiences can benefit your next project.",
