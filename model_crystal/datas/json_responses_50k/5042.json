In Bhutan the Gross National Happiness is the most important indicator of the country's situation and journalism has a crucial impact on how people see their situation and how they think about things that happen around them. This directly contributes to their happiness and therefore the well-being of the nation. 70 media professionals attended the two day workshop and training.",
