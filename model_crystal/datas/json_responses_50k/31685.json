    "summary": "Experienced Technology Professional | Product Management | Portfolio Management | Solution Strategy\n\nI am a technology professional with over 10 years of experience in product management, portfolio management and solution strategy. I thrive on finding innovative and efficient solutions to complex challenges. Throughout my career, I have held key roles as a Senior Consultant, Solutions Strategist, and Product Owner/Product Manager, working with leading organisations such as FNB South Africa and CGI Nederland.\n\nAs a Senior Consultant at CGI Nederland, I work as a Product Owner/Manager. In this role, I maintain relationships with stakeholders, define and refine backlogs and work with development teams. I ensure transparent and visible backlogs, manage epics and features, and execute product roadmaps by implementing SAFe 5.0 best practices. Additionally, I lead Agile ceremonies alongside Scrum Masters and provide strategic analysis for large and strategic projects. I also play a crucial role in driving business transformation within the business unit and provide mentorship to other professionals.\n\nPreviously, as a Product Owner/Manager at FNB, I led cross-functional teams and successfully delivered high-quality products amongst my other duties. I played a pivotal role in creating and implementing strategies for new business units and new businesses. My efforts resulted in the successful implementation of first-to-country solutions and scalability projects.\n\nMy educational background includes an MBA from Wits University and the University of Cologne, where I focused on leadership, innovation, and technology. I also hold a Bachelor of Business Science (Honours in Information Systems) from the University of KwaZulu Natal, Westville.\n\nThroughout my career, I have honed my skills in leadership, communication, product and portfolio management, business analysis, innovation, strategy, technology, and organisational development. I am experienced in Agile methodologies, SAFe 5.0 PMPO, Azure DevOps, Scrum, and Waterfall. I am also fluent in English, Afrikaans, and have a working proficiency in German and a basic understanding and ability to speak Dutch.\n\nOutside of work, I embrace an active and social lifestyle. I enjoy exploring the Netherlands and Europe, trying new foods, and engaging in physical activities such as cycling and gym workouts. \n\nIf you are interested in connecting or discussing potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me.\n\n#TechnologyProfessional #ProductManagement #StrategicPlanning #BusinessAnalysis #AgileMethodology",
