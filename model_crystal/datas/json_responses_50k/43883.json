    "summary": "I\u2019m a software engineer, programmer and system architect with 8 years' experience in IT, 17 years of overall engineering experience and 11 years' research and teaching experience on academic level. I earned Ph.D. in technical physics.\n\nFor the next few years I'm planning to follow the engineering path with secondary focus on product ownership, architecture and team building.\n\nMy current interests lie in cloud computing, micro services, IoT, system architecture and high throughput environments. My recent professional revelation are Kubernetes and ISTIO and how they simplify and transform cloud operations.\n\nFavourite technology stack nowadays is comprised of Go app running on Kubernetes cooperating with Redis/MongoDB using NATS or SQS. I'm fascinated by internal Kubernetes design and I love working on extending this platform.\n\nBesides engineering work I organise, cultivate and lead software development teams. In the past I worked with product, business and sales people and took part in both customer and partner meetings as a technical liaison and solution analyst/architect.\n\nI often act as a mentor for less experienced colleagues as I love participating in knowledge sharing and working with people. It results in me being part of tech meetups and giving technical lectures.\n\nI used to act as a technical lead in an international project in mobile marketing area, for the enterprise customers. My team created system handling 50 Mio events and analysing 100GB of data on daily basis, which is capable of rapidly dispatching 5 Mio messages without prior notice. Considerable percentage of mobile devices in Germany were somehow communicating with our system.\n\nCompetencies: programming, architecture, micro-services, scalability, Golang (GO), Python, PHP, TDD, functional testing, Redis, MongoDB, AWS, DevOps, Linux, Ansible, Kubernetes (k8s), Cloud Foundry, Docker, REST, Jenkins, Scrum",
