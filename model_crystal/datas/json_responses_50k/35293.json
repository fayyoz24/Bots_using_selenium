    "summary": "WHAT?\nA recruiter with a human touch and 100% focused on improving the candidate experience.\n\nWHY?\nAfter being a copy writer, an assistant, a customer service representative, and something else in between, I accidentally landed in recruitment where I finally found my professional passion. So, when given the chance to join this industry, I promised myself I would do my best to treat people, my candidates, in the same way I would like to be treated (at least, as much as I could). \n\nHOW?\nEven though I\u2019m usually seen as an introverted person, with my candidates I am chatty and curious. I am talkative and ask A LOT of questions, mainly because I love talking to people and learning from others. I get a boost of energy out of finding awesome people with that 'special something' that makes them different, I love listening to their stories and backgrounds, their dreams and expectations. \n\nWHO?\nAlways up for a (loud) laugh, a series junkie, Ikea fan and an avid eater. Because in 156 cm I don't have that much space for many extra kilos, you can find me at a CrossFit box, getting clumsily bruised, or running up, down and around the city, with earplugs on and thinking about that marathon in the bucket list!\n\nIs there anything I could do for you? Feel free to drop me a line with the WHEN and/or WHERE. \nI'd be happy to talk to you.",
