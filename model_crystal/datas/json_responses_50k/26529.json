We study the airflow and exchange between two unmasked individuals conversing face-to-face at short range, which can potentially transfer a high dose of a pathogen, because the dilution is small when compared to long-range airborne transmission. We conduct flow visualization experiments and direct numerical simulations of colliding respiratory jets mimicking the initial phase of a conversation. The evolution and dynamics of the jets are affected by the vertical offset between the mouths of the speakers. At low offsets the head-on collision of jets results in a `blocking effect', temporarily shielding the susceptible speaker from the pathogen carrying jet, although, the lateral spread of the jets is enhanced. Sufficiently large offsets prevent the interaction of the jets. At intermediate offsets (8-10 cm for 1 m separation), jet entrainment and the inhaled breath assist the transport of the pathogen-loaded saliva droplets towards the susceptible speaker's mouth. Air exchange is expected, in spite of the blocking effect arising from the interaction of the respiratory jets from the two speakers.",

            "description": "An experimental study was done with smoke flow visualization, to qualitatively understand the flow physics and observe the flow separation and reattachment on jet blowing actuation. This experimental investigation was followed by a proposal of pulsatile blowing and how an active flow control strategy can be used to remove the separation bubble on the surface of an airfoil at high angles of attack. This leads to more lift production at post-stall angles, thus delaying stall. Numerical Analysis has been done for NACA 0015, using URANS along with Menter's shear stress turbulence model in STAR CCM+. Different mass flow rates are used for both steady and pulsatile blowing within a range of angles of attack varying from $0^\\circ$ to $20^\\circ$. An optimum frequency was empirically found based on the reattachment time, which comes out to be $190.4$ rad/s. Energy expenditure is found to be lesser for pulsatile blowing than steady blowing, with a very small performance hit. The most effective velocity for blowing was found as twice the freestream velocity and the gain in $C_L$ was around 50\\% and $C_L/C_D$ was $82.4\\%$ compared to no blowing case. The stall angle increases by $3-5^\\circ$ with a $30\\%$ gain in $C_L_m_a_x$. Direct Numerical Simulations have also been performed for the isolated pulsating jet with particle tracers using Xcompact3D for the different jet velocities used for stall suppression and are compared qualitatively to the unsteady RANS simulations",

The proposed flight simulation environment is designed to include the effects of controlled vehicle morphing, using a telescopic variable wingspan. This paper focuses on the preparation and design of the closed-loop flight simulation environment designed in MATLAB and Simulink, which encompasses the design of a 6DoF aircraft dynamics model, based on a hybrid aerodynamic model, and a simple flight control system to steer the UAV in predefined paths. A modular design paradigm is adopted for the aircraft dynamics model, which makes it conducive to use the same environment to simulate other aircraft models. The flight simulation environment will be the platform on which dynamic soaring will be performed, and the effects of morphing wings will be studied and quantified by simulating various flight paths and selected critical stages of the dynamic soaring trajectory.",
