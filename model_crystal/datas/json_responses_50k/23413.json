    "summary": "In my pursuit of a career driven by curiosity and a desire for a positive societal impact, I've cultivated diverse interests, all unified by a common theme: the pursuit of knowledge and effective communication.\n\nInspired by physician-scientists at patient conferences, I embarked on my journey to become a researcher. This path led to an Honours Bachelor's with a cum laude distinction in Biomedical Sciences and my current pursuit of a Master's in the same field. Extensive volunteer work in global health honed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.\n\nBeyond science, I have a passion for writing, encompassing creative projects and academic work. My ability to distill complex information for a broad audience was further refined in Master's courses in science communication and public engagement.\n\nAdditionally, language learning and travel have greatly enriched my life. I am proficient at varying levels in six languages, and I'm eager to further expand my linguistic repertoire. My love for languages influenced my high school major and college program, which emphasized interdisciplinary and international learning.\n\nLooking towards the future, I aspire to cultivate a career in which I can combine my love of science with my deep-rooted passion for storytelling and writing. I envision myself thriving in an international environment where my multilingual capabilities can be of use to foster meaningful connections, and the prospect of travel is a frequent occurrence.\n\nIf you share my vision and interest in the intersection of science, storytelling, and global engagement, feel free to connect and let's explore the possibilities of collaborating!",

Towards that goal, I managed petition efforts directed at the Amsterdam UMC in 2020. I co-coordinated the annual \"Access to Medicines\" week twice, including a photo campaign and article publication (2019) and creation of a social media campaign (2020). Lastly, I was heavily involved in the creation of the chapter's Instagram presence and researched, captioned and designed multiple awareness posts about various global health-related topics."
