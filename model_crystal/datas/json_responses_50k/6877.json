    "summary": "Through my studies and experience in environmental science and sustainable development, I have a deep understanding of the climate and ecological crisis and its relationship to human systems.\n\nI am passionate about combining environmental science with technical models and tools to make a concrete positive impact; for example, I worked on integrating climate risk into existing financial tools and developed a new methodology to assess the impact of land use on ecosystem services.\n\nOver time, I have worked with a wide variety of people in different cultural settings: from financial sector clients, academics, technical modellers and designers to military representatives, refugee camp residents, activists, volunteers and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nAaron Pereira and I worked together on climate action and refugee/migrant justice projects, discovering our shared vision and forming a strong team. We decided to form Solid Sustainability Research, where we employ our analytical, technical, social and creative skills in projects that we feel society needs.\n\nwww.solid-sustainability.org\n\nSolid Sustainability conducts independent research and communicates complex ideas that we care about.\n\nOur concrete activities include: research; data analysis; development of web apps and websites; data visualisation; science communication; leading workshops and facilitating discussions; coordinating projects, coalitions and decentralised research.",

We have been active for almost a year in Derveni-Alexyl refugee camp in the Thessaloniki area, Greece. I have spent more than 6 months working in this camp and other camps in Northern Greece.\n\nWe cooperated with the other organizations on site (IOM, UNHCR, Terre des Hommes/Arsis, Caritas, MSF) and filled the gaps that were left by the army and the big organizations. Our main activities were distributing clothes, shoes and other basic neccessities, running a sowing and knitting project, creating a sports area and \"playstation room\". We have also provided kettles, hot plates for people to cook and coffee, tea and sugar, organized dinner parties with the community and refered people to services in the city. \n\nMost importantly, we work together with camp residents as colleagues and are there for them as friends. Everyone deserves to smile at least once a day :)\n\nRemotely, I have stayed in contact with (former) camp residents and other volunteer groups, collecting and relaying information and helping people with building their new life (incl. practising the language). I have organized information and fundraising events, as well as a meet-up between Syrians and Dutch people. In addition, I have been in contact with several journalists and migration researchers and contributed to articles about the situation for refugees in different European countries, in specific Derveni camp and (Northern) Greece. \n\nhttps://www.voanews.com/a/closure-of-greek-camps/4093463.html\n\nwww.facebook.com/everydayjustasmile",

At the distribution I would make sure people/kids would not cut in line and the line would stay orderly. I also drove the van, which was quite challenging sometimes when I would have to park it within the mass of people waiting for the food and when we would have to quickly load it and get away in emergency situations. \n\nSoon after I arrived in Greece I took over the chai tent from the previous coordinator. My main tasks were to buy supplies and drive all the equipment to camp, communication with other coordinators and with volunteers for the chai tent. There was a great team of refugee volunteers who would set up, make the tea and fill the cups.\n\nShortly before Eidomeni got evicted, I moved the chai tent to one of the new military camps around Thessaloniki (Sindos). I had to start over and find a new team of refugee volunteers. During the first days I made the chai myself and explained to the new team how everything worked. After 10 days I could hand over the chai tent to a new coordinator within Swisscross.help, the organization that is active in Sindos. \n\nDuring the days I was in Sindos, I helped the Swisscross with cleaning and playing with the kids. During my time in Eidomeni I spent some time helping other projects, such as putting tarps over leaking tents and collecting usable tents after the eviction of Eidomeni, and I sometimes helped prepare food with a Greek organization. \n\n"

That is why regular citizens have to step up and help. \n\nAll over Holland goods such as tents, blankets, shoes, clothes, personal care products and food were collected and brought to the main location in Bleiswijk. There everything was sorted and packed, ready for transport to Greece. \n\nI helped with these activities in Delft and Bleiswijk and functioned as a coordinator: answering emails from volunteers and being in the warehouse in Bleiswijk approximately 3 times a week.\n\nSince december I live in Switzerland and still send out a newsletter to the volunteers every week and answer emails.
