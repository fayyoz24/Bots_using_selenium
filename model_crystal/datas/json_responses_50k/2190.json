    "summary": "I am a queer Greek-Dominican multidisciplinary performance artist and educator. My diverse background in education, cinema, linguistics, and performing arts has given rise to a unique hybrid approach that challenges traditional notions of art and arts education. Embracing the name 'Performing the Real,' my practice actively fosters a fresh and dynamic conversation between performance art and everyday life, while critically examining their interconnectedness on both personal and political levels.\n\nAt present, my focus centers on community building projects that address pressing social issues, particularly those related to stress, anxiety, and social inequalities. These projects aim to effect positive change within society by harnessing the power of artistic expression and collaborative engagement.\n\nAdditionally, I am dedicated to investigating new educational methods that promote a non-individualistic and non-hierarchical approach to knowledge acquisition, transcending the constraints of capitalism. By seeking alternative paths to learning and knowledge dissemination, I strive to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape.",
