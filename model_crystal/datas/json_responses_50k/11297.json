My responsibilities included contribution to the visual identity of the clinic across their social media profiles by executing the content creation from idea conception and creation until uploading to the profiles. My observations from the social media profiles were then prepared as suggestions for the Manola brand identity and expansion of awareness strategy, while aiming to strenghten our communication with patients and clients of the clinic.\nI was lucky in being able to learn from amazing healthcare professionals like dr. Manola, and perfecting my time-management and creative problem solving skills, and my proudest achievement is coming up with the #manolamonday hashtag!",
