    "summary": "My name is Wesley, I started as an Aviation Engineer but am now working in sourcing and change management projects within real estate. Until recently I also worked voluntarily as an elder in an Evangelical Church. Through my knowledge of technology and organizational psychology I manage to bring people together and motivate them to implement innovative solutions and ideas. I do this by positive thinking, being approachable and solution oriented. My qualities lie in making the mission and vision tangible to the colleagues around me through my communication skills and translating ambition to technical solutions and projects. In addition, I am a strategic thinker, analytical and a real process improver in order to help the organization and the people in their goals. Because the latter, that's where I draw my energy!",

These test facilities with a total test capacity of 120.000+ Antigen Test per day were built and used for the 'Testen voor Toegang' pilot by the Dutch Government via Stichting Nederland Open. The aim of this pilot was to open up activities such as concerts, festivals, museums, monuments etc. to the public via testing people before entrance to these activities. We were also the sole test-partner for the Euro Songfestival. Next to these facilities over 100 test facilities were reserved for commercial tests via the Dutch Government Initiative 'Testen voor je Reis' ('Test before your Travel') and Lead Healthcare Covid Services B.V.. Combined these facilities had a total test-capacity of 40.000+ PCR-tests a day. All initiatives were connected to the Dutch Government CoronaCheck-app. \n\nAs Regional Manager of around 15 small to large test locations and 30 connected BENU Pharmacies, I was responsible over the test locations facilities and over the employees working at these locations. I was also the first point of contact for all facility managers, teamleads &  medical supervisors about questions around planning, human resources, facilities, process, improvements, communication etc. This also included contact with secondmendment bureau's, IT-teams, HQ and third parties. Furthermore, as Regional Manager I was constantly aiming to improve the supply chain and communication in this rapid changing environment of corona testing. \nIn the course of my last month, this included a rapid re-structuring of the whole Lead Covid Services B.V. organisation structure, which was led by me and a colleague to ensure a smooth transition to a new organisation without the need of us, regio managers (and other key-roles). This included all connected departments (internal & external) and roles.",
