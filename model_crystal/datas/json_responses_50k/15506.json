    "summary": "Developing knowledge for better governing green open space in urban regions worldwide. This demands a combination of strong government with multi-stakeholder cooperations; spatial visions for urban regions that integrate knowledge from natural and social sciences, the 3 Ps. As researcher with a background in both domains (society-nature interface) I want to support the sustainable urbanization, taking care of humans and nature. \nI like working with practitioners because they are getting things done. \nIn 2019 I concluded my PhD in Copenhagen on 'Governing and transition of greenspace in urban regions', linked to my work at Wageningen Environmental Research.  I am developing projects that aim for transition in greenspace. One of those projects is The New Gardener. Gardening companies get a more important role in integrated greenspace management, as intermediaries between residents and commissioners like municipalities, housing corporations and waterboards. Another project is the study of personal transport innovations, like beemcars. These may have a huge potential for reducing the urban rural dichotomy, improving quality of life and climate adaptation and mitigation. It might create new economies. This requires substantial research together with travellers associations, transport companies and urban and regional authorities. 'transdisciplinary socio-technical-environmental system research'.",

I coordinated the governance and case study research (2.4 million euros) and organized the interaction between researchers and practitioners. Practitioners brought in their own research questions and criteria for sustainability assessment. The researchers from the seven countries included these in their research on governance and spatial planning strategies. A feedback in terms of recommendations was delivered, also based on scenario development for the regions and integrated assessments. I worked on the international comparison together with Katarina Eckerberg from (then) SEI and Umea University in Sweden. We developed recommendations. see articles. \nI initiated this project in follow up to the Greencluster project which Alterra coordinated. Kjell Nilsson from (then) Copenhagen University was project coordinator of the whole PLUREL project. Some 40 research organizations and enterprises were involved.",

I worked on this project with Anne Haars, from the Support Point for Housing, a residence organization.This kind of work is so incredibly positive that even at eleven in the evening we were still full of energy and entusiasm.\nSimilar projects were about working with children or youth to discuss their ideas for green open space, by means of drawings, taking photographs, putting flags at ugly or beautifull places, etc.",

Communication between urban planners and citizens, but also between researchers and practitioners was studied. Together with Chalmers University, FORS recherche sociale, Helsinki Technical University and Danish Building (then By-og-byg) we did six case studies: Cergy Pontoise, Utrecht-Houten, Gothenburg, Helsinki, Tampere, Aarhus.\nCentral issues were the communicative approach, Tools for Transition versus tools in action and tools for interaction. Especially the tools for transition have my interest. Throughout my carreer I have learned to see the differences in communicative values of different tools. See also the Contractual Approach at ILO. Our involvement in this project (1.5 million euros) was funded by the EC (FP5 Cultural Heritage and Cities of Tomorrow) and the Dutch Ministry of Housing, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality.

We are part of it ourselves.\nI worked here as student and after obtaining my MSc on short term assignments.  I developed different studies, among which an elaborate study on sand mining possibilities around the large rivers (Waal and Maas) in the Province of Gelderland, a market survey for the development of a golf course, design for a fountain at the American Dental Clinic and plantation plan for the village of Geffen.",
