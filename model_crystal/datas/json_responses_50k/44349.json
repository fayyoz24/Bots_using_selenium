Any feedback given was than evaluated by me to our Head Office for implementation and possible improvements on the site. \n\nCreated a Sales Document which calculates sales incentives and this has been widely used or asked for to be reviewed by my peers to keep track of their Sales. I have made a complete Database in Excel to ensure that people become more aware of their production in Back office work. I maintained this database in conjunction with my normal responsibilities. I liaised with Back Office agents on the use and improvement for this database and we achieved a clearer and higher production rate in return. \n\nBeing a controller means you need to control if correct procedures were applied to internal processes. With help of a database cross reference check for example we would control how agents access accounts, if the right credentials were provided and listen back to calls pro actively to ensure correct work ethics and procedures.",
