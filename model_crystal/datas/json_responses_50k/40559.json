    "summary": "Like a curious, some may say annoying,  three-year-old, my work is built upon asking \u2018Why (not)\u2019 to break new ground and open up space for \u2018What-ever\u2019 to flourish. Renowned for my polymath mindset and enthusiasm, I turn worlds upside down, shake up beliefs, reveal naked truths, and strip down ideas to its core, without losing sight of one\u2019s identity, ambition, potential, and environment. Resulting in an intriguing track record of innovative strategies, interdisciplinary collaborations, experimental frameworks and forecast narratives that guide growth and bring values, ideas, goals, stories, and people together. Expect a not-your-everyday yet invigorating rollercoaster ride towards change, (social) innovation and collaboration. \n\nWith more than a decade of experience in change strategy, cultural communications and interdisciplinary development - while also exploring the fascinating worlds of cognitive science, linguistics, philosophy and international education - I developed LiveWired, a life-oriented, 5D-thinking framework that aims to interact with change instead of (only) manage it.",

Janne's objective is to educate others to understand the role of humans in fashion consumption, design, production and disposal. And with this, transforming today\u2019s fashion industry attitudes and issues such as consumer behaviour, body image, environment, health, self-esteem, diversity and creativity, into ones that are environmentally conscious and mindful of social issues. \n\nJanne Baetsen: \"I believe that to engage with today's issues we need to address the way we think, behave and communicate. Although sustainability, transparency and circular economy are important \u2018hot\u2019 topics, I want to go beyond  'labels' and look at them from a holistic perspective. Together with the industry, fashion experts, designers and other (fashion) minded specialists I want to address, analyse, challenge and predict the many questions discussed in today\u2019s society and fashion industry to contribute to a better world. Focussing not only on clothing, trends and styles but also on the complexity of human behaviour, innovation and progress across all aspects of fashion.\"",

Fashion is, besides a billion-dollar industry, the most immediate and intimate form of self-expression. BUT, it has its dark side: environmental impact, exploitation of workers, and impact on self-image. Fashion faces severe global environmental and social challenges, which will only be increasing.\n\nJanne developed a plan for FASHIONCLASH to develop \u2018Fashion Makes Sense\u2019 in collaboration with the Province of Limburg.\n\nAIM: to engage in a dialogue with the audience (consumer-designer-industry-education), with the believe that no change will be possible without interaction with the public. What we wear reflects on how we view the world and how we want the world to see us. Therefore, Janne wanted to inspire and encourage through the subject of fashion the public and the fashion industry to improve insight and engages on the topic sustainability. How? By starting to make the connection between what we (need to) value and what we wear and by re-establishing the connection between creator and consumer. ",

Caroline Zaidan, Isabelle Violet Thibault, Susanne James and Eleftheria Karipid  researched the engagement between fashion and the body/senses and engaged with the public on the issue: How can fashion nowadays truly connect with the body and human beings instead of being just a simple aesthetic of a symbolic phenomenon? \n\nSince fashion is such a multifaceted concept, the ways each of us understands it is quite varied, yet very relevant to the way in which we engage with the industry and the idea of fashion as a focus of study. In the zine that Isabelle, Caroline, Eleftheria and Susanne developed, they explore fashion and its relation to the senses, the psychological concept of enclothed cognition, and the ever-current issue of fashion and the body.  They will also be looking at two innovative Dutch designers who embody the theme of \u2018Fashion Makes Sense\u2019 with their unique approaches to design. With three psychology students and one journalism student, they put their minds and experiences with fashion together to form a review that explores each concept textually and visually; examining the beautiful and ugly sides of a fascinating industry.\n",

Instead of delivering a campaign to attract new restaurants to Harrow, as was requested by them, I advised them to invest in positioning Harrow as a vibrant hotspot for food, drink and gastronomy,  a desirable destination and an attractive place to live, work and invest. To develop a brand that will help target investors to encourage more, better quality, food and drink venues. At the same time, it will work to shift the perceptions and behaviours of locals, with a focus on health, wellbeing and satisfaction.\n\nI advised them to: \n- Develope a wider strategy concentrating on the four key areas: awareness, investment, health, and pay. \n- Create an evocative destination marketing campaign around gastronomy aimed at both a local and regional audience. \n- Focus this campaign further, adding depth and specific details, to increase food investment in the borough. \n- Encourage healthier behaviours and food options by targeting both brand and investment on, and perhaps even incentivising, healthier choices. Similarly, use the campaign to explore the benefits \u2013 both local and business \u2013 of fair pay. \n\nThis wider project could make Harrow the first borough and council of London to successfully develop a stand-out community branding strategy that strengthens its distinctive identity.

The plan focusses on a distinctive brand that will bring people together with an enduring and shared vision, that not only strengthens the brand but builds community, culture and contributes to the creative economy.  It's based on my believes that the perception of a place can be changed by revealing what is already there. The concept will bring out the best in communities and empower them to be better. How? By telling stories, sharing pictures, revealing locations, showing faces and supporting it with figures and results. ",
