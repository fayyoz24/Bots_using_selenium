Mark has extensive experience in the IT managed services sector and has contributed to many IT management frameworks and standards, most recently as Lead Editor of the ITIL\u00ae 4 High-velocity IT module. ITIL\u00ae 4 includes experience level agreements and XLA\u00ae as part of its guidance to rethink and reconstruct IT service management. Mark sees his involvement with Giarte as a continuation of his work to foster new ways of thinking and working: \"The XLA\u00ae Academy is on a mission to educate, enlighten and inspire people to liberate themselves from the oppressive regimes of ineffective Service Level Agreements. The case for XLA\u00ae is compelling. Service experience affects both the direct business impact of IT services, and the broader benefits of meaningful and rewarding employee experience. It appeals to managers and practitioners who are motivated by the privilege of contributing to the well-being and prosperity of digital service consumers.\"",
