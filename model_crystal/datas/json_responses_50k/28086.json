It stores all the sensor data of the registered users in a graph database, and allowing others to subscribe to read and write to those sensors through a defined API, with some added security features. Once the user approved the read or write access to his device for another user, he can take control over the device according to his level of access permission. With the emerging trend of connected devices, this would be the next useful platform to accommodate all the devices and we are the ones who capable of processing all the big data coming from those sensors. We are creating the platform for the inventors and entrepreneurs to use and build their own applications",

With the proliferation of user-generated content, interest in mining sentiment and opinions in text has grown rapidly, both in academia and business. The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, irrespective of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops, battery, screen) and their attributes (e.g. price, design, quality). In aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) the aim is to identify the aspects of entities and the sentiment expressed for each aspect. The ultimate goal is to be able to generate summaries listing all the aspects and their overall polarity.\n\n(1) The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver. \u2192 {SOFTWARE#USABILITY,  positive}\n\n(2) The fajitas were great to taste, but not to see\u201d\u2192 {FOOD#QUALITY, positive},  {FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, \u201c negative }\n\n(3) We were planning to get dessert, but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.  \u2192 {SERVICE# GENERAL,  negative}",

Unlike the state of the art, where no automation exists for guiding a wheelchair in modern buildings, this allows the owner of the least sophisticated wheelchair to explore public buildings with more ease than a normal person. In this project we intend to implement a working prototype, which fulfills the fundamental functions of the system. It can be further customized to the needs of system owners.\n\nSupervised by: Supervised by Dr.D.D.Karunaratne (Cardiff University, UK) and Zone 24x7 Inc.",
