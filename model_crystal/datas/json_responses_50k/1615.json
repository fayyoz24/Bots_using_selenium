    "summary": "During the twenty years I worked for Royal Ahold, I had to deal with almost every conceivable VAT problem and I developed a thorough knowledge of all types of corporate processes. \n\nIt is not only about translating complex regulations into concise, pragmatic and workable recommendations for organizations. It is also essential to have relationships within the professional field to achieve such workable solutions. VAT consultancy requires more than just knowledge and experience, more than anything it is \u2018people work\u2019. \n\nIn October 2016, I started my own VAT consultancy business INSENSE ROADS. \n\nMy focus is on VAT policy and advisory work. I give presentations and offer in-house training to businesses. I also advise on excise duty matters (both B2B and B2C). Finally, my services are also available to VAT colleagues in need of a sounding board or confidential advice. \n\nFor almost two decades, I have been chair of the EuroCommerce Taxation Committee in Brussels and I have also been an active member of the EU VAT Forum, the VAT Expert Group and the Excise Contact Group for many years now. I am a member of the Scientific Committee of the International VAT Association (IVA). Based on my extensive network of relationships throughout Europe, I consult with organizations in both private and public sector on issues concerning (proposed) European VAT and excise duty regulations. \n\nCompanies hire me to assess contracts and to advise them regarding ongoing or new projects (such as promotional activities, e-commerce, new products or services). But other issues might include consultation regarding a VAT or excise duty audit, a \u2018problematic\u2019 case at the Tax Authorities (including conducting legal proceedings) or advice concerning the entirety of VAT governance, including both (the establishment of) the strategic positioning of VAT within a company and advice relating to actual risk management. \n \nFor more information please visit my website www.insenseroads.com. \n\n",
