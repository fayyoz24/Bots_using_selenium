SCUBA will provide a proof of concept of this approach by demonstrating how self-organisation will lead to simpler engineering, commissioning, and flexible maintenance and how cooperation among heterogeneous, multi-vendor building monitoring and control systems will make the system more adaptive and robust, and as an example how this will benefit in making buildings more energy efficient and safer.",

The global trend towards more complex warehouses makes it practically impossible to control all (normal and exceptional) operations in an optimal manner using a centralised control system.\n\nAn alternative is a decentralised warehouse control system which consists of autonomous components (agents), each controlling the operations in a limited part of the warehouse. The Falcon project, which was set up by the Embedded Systems Institute and Vanderlande Industries, investigates the feasibility of holonic warehouse control systems. These can be viewed as a hybrid form of centralised and decentralised control systems. Holons are autonomous and co-operative building blocks for transforming, storing and/or validating information and physical objects. \n\nThe framework has two purposes \u2013 to find a method for migrating to decentralised control and to provide a means for rapid experiments with control strategies. The resulting control systems are robust to exceptions providing graceful degradation. They are flexible, scalable and easily adaptable. The approach allows the re-use of components. The holonic approach and the framework are generic in the sense that they are applicable for other material handling systems as well.",
