This included skills and toolsets usage such as Carbonite, MPX router, OVM, Vcenter Converter etc.\n\u25aa Disaster recovery service: Have designed this service offering was specifically to provide clients with Storage centric DR service which provided assessment, design, build, deploy and testing services across multiple technologies. This service offering usage of various tools and technologies like EMC SRDF, EMC Clone, Multi- concurrent copies, Snap mirror, IBM Flash copy etc.\n\u25aa Backup migration service: I developed this key modernization service to offer our clients with the migration services from traditional tape-based backup into either on-prem modern backup solutions or cloud-based backup solutions. This offering been offered for range of backup products such as Netbackup appliances, EMC Data domain, HP Data protector etc. where it had typical 3 staged approach of discovery & assessment, build and migrations.",

I picked up right from the capacity evaluation, identified hotspots, provided right sizing recommendations while modernizing the infrastructure. I led this project to seamlessly deliver migrations of 1200 hosts from 10 x EMC Clariions, 2 x Hitachi & 1 x DMX3000 arrays into new EMC VNX arrays. With given modernization in place client have had seen massive 43% decline into the high severity incidents related to infrastructure.\n\u25aa Enablement of Capacity management: With the transformation journey, the crucial element was to implement effective capacity management function for BP. I ran capacity evaluations, identified the hot spots, projected the organic growth for next quarter and suggested to have ongoing capacity management service with our client which was gracefully accepted. Due to this service offered to the client, there was at least 23% of Opex savings yielded by the customer where right sizing options were suggested and optimization project was put in place.\n\u25aa Disaster recovery planning and execution: As an appointed DR champion for this client where I led this very crucial activity of updating Disaster recovery plan, defining the RTO and RPO for each application set, updating the scripts and planning and execution of annual DR exercises. The magnitude of this activity can be imagined when there is a potential to impact 28000 users with one error in the DR plan.",
