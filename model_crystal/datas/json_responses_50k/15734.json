Patent is issued, published, maintained.\n\nI have been the co-lead engineer for wind farm control consultancy project with large industry partner. Also, I was subcontracted by NREL for a wind farm control consultancy project with large industry partner.\n\nI have successfully received two grants. I had a lead role in writing the proposal for the European FLOATECH project, with a budget of \u20ac 4.3M. I had a supporting role the proposal for the European WindConners project, with a budget of \u20ac 1.5M.\n\nI received the ``Excellent Young Doctor'' award from the European Academy for Wind Energy. Received IEEE Excellent Student Paper Award. Received PhD Best Poster Award by the TUDelft Energy Initiative.\n\nFinally, I had a lead role in the ``3mE PhD Council'' that facilitates events for approximately PhD students of the Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering. This council enables people to learn, connect, and improve their PhD experience at the university. Responsibilities included organizing monthly lunch lectures, a 4-week meditation workshop, and an annual sports day.",
