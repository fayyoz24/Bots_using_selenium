However, it often proves difficult to predict dementia deterioration because of large between and within patient variability in the rates of progression. Also, studies so far have by a subjective means calculated an early rate to predict future decline and have been unidimensional, e.g. looking at cognition only. Besides disease progression, it is also important to assess mortality and in the future identity factors that reduce the risk of dying. \nThe aim of this study therefore is to evaluate the extent to which an early rate of decline (from baseline to one year of follow-up) in the three domains: cognition, function and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS),  is predictive of subsequent change in these variables and whether the early rate is associated with overall survival, after adjustment for potential confounders. \n\nStatistical Software: SAS program\nStatistical Method:   Mixed models & Survival Analysis\nGrade by supervisor: 8",

It is therefore expected that low levels of free protein S are associated with an increased risk of developing venous thrombosis. Interestingly, a study performed by Pintao et al. (2013) found that not low, but high levels of free protein S were associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. From literature it is known that diseases such as cancer, kidney disease or autoimmune diseases which are all related to high risk of venous thrombosis, are accompanied by elevated levels of pro-coagulant factors, such as factor VIII. A concomitant rise in the anticoagulant factor (free protein S) could therefore be a protective mechanism of the body to compensate for this pro-coagulant state, which is due to the underlying illness. Pintao et al. studied only levels of free protein S and did not further study the relation with underlying comorbidity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether the high levels of free protein S can be explained by underlying illnesses. In this case, high levels of factor VIII are expected with increasing levels of free protein S. We will also investigate how levels of protein C (another major anti-coagulant) are distributed in the patients with venous thrombosis and whether the same pattern is detected as for free protein S. \n\nStatistical methods: Linear & Logistic Regression analysis\nGrade by Supervisor: 8",

Inhibition is one of the components of executive functioning and it is required in everyday life, including in life threatening circumstances. Effectively, unexpected changes in the environment may require the suppression of prepotent or automatic actions that have become inappropriate. The method chosen to study the inhibitory process was the anti-cue task. Since this task was repeated across a series of sessions, a learning effect was expected to occur, which was also analyzed. \n\nStatistical Methods: Repeated Measures ANOVA & t-tests\nGrade by supervisor: 8",
