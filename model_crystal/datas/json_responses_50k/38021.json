The project has supported the Ministry of Education of Mozambique (MINEDH) on improving and expanding their national school feeding program (PRONAE). I was the technical leader of this project and my responsibilities included coordinating the project implementation in Mozambique. As advisor I provided expertise on fields such as school nutrition, nutrition education, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, and project management and participating in studies, program designing, developing strategies and work-plans, following up and evaluating and reporting project results.I have also provided guidance to an international consultant deployed to Mozambique for two years, two consultants in school nutrition, working in coordination with researchers from MSU and Brazilian universities. One result of this project wast exchanging knowledge on planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluation school feeding programs and strengthening the capacity of MINEDH to implement PRONAE trough permanent technical assistance and multiple trainings in school nutrition, monitoring and evaluation. PRONAE\u2019s inter-sectorial planning was strengthened trough developing a multi-sector database that includes data from national census. A model to assess and improve the food safety of school meals in Mozambique was also developed as  by a multi-institutional research team (BR and USA). The final contribution was coordinating a multi-institutional technical team and two international consultants on developing a strategy and implementation plan for improving and expanding PRONAE. This proposal increased multi-sectorial coordination and the alignment of the various partners of MZ Gov. (WFP and NGOs) to the PRONAE. The strategy developed was further presented and approved by the Gov. of MZ.",

During the three month mission, I was responsible for finalizing the consultation on the policy, which included various sectors and levels of the Malawi government, development partners and civil society, and writing the final draft policy. \nThe final steps on developing the policy included: \n1. Designing, conducting, and reporting three regional consultation workshops, for updating the existing draft NSHN Policy. \nDesigning the regional consultation workshops included developing the methodology and programme of the workshop, ensuring that key elements and the five priority areas on policy were discussed and reviewed. Conducting the regional consultation workshops included the training of government staff to act as moderators and note takers, and also coordinating presentations, discussions and activities on the working groups. Reporting the workshop included analyses of the data collected on the discussion and recommendations of working groups. \n2. Updating the draft policy, based on the results on the regional consultation workshops. \n3. Developing the implementation plan, and the monitoring and evaluation plan for the policy. These plans were developed based on the analysis of the results on the three regional consultation workshops. \n4. Designing, conducting, and reporting the national consultation workshop, which involved similar activities on developing the regional consultation workshops. \n5. Writing the final draft policy, according to the recommendations and inputs from the national consultation workshop. \n6. Documenting the consultation on developing the NSHN Policy. This included writing reports, and developing complementary documents, that clearly describe each step on the consultation, assumptions and recommendations.",

In 2011, the government launched the Malawi\u2019s National School Meals Programme, included in the SHN programme. In 2012, the Government participated in study visits to the WFP Centre of Excellence against Hunger. The Government identified the development of the SHN Policy as a priority action. I was hired by the Centre to work in Malawi under guidance of the Government and the WFP country office. \nThe objective of the assignment was to develop and write a draft of the National School Health and Nutrition Policy for the Ministry of Education. The policy was developed through a consultative process at all levels (central, regional, local and school level), including stakeholders across different sectors, and taking into account technical and legal issues along with existing policy documents. \nDuring my mission to Malawi, I was responsible to support the development of the SHN policy. The main results of this mission are: \nThe proposal for developing the SHN policy was presented, approved and was recommended by the Governments School Health and Nutrition crosscutting Technical Working Group. \nThe methodology for consultation on the development of the SHN policy was created and approved by the Government. \nThe First Draft Policy was written and delivered to the Government. \nTechnical meetings with stakeholders (district governments, development partners and school community) were held in Lilongwe and in other 5 districts \nField visits to 5 districts were planned and implemented. Inputs and recommendations for the SHN policy were collected during the technical meetings with the stakeholders, organized and included in the policy. \nA Briefing Note on SHN policy development and the programme for the National Conference on SHN were developed and approved by the Government. \nGuidelines for developing the National Conference on SHN were written and delivered.",

As a result, I've created a proposed action plan to respond to gaps identified in the SWAP analysis. \nThe proposed action plan strengthened the participation of the Guinea-Bissau government and the MoE's Central School Feeding Unit, proposed the creation of a Food Security Council that integrates actions of ministries, UN, and others, above mentioned UN agencies and others institutions. Also, the proposed plan implemented the monitoring system for the school feeding program and integrated the actions of diverse departments of the Ministry of Education and other education authorities within the regional government, school administrations and local communities. I authored a proposal that became law and established the creation and implementation the National School Feeding Program. At the end of the consultancy, a committee was established to review the proposed bill that would be presented to the Guinea-Bissau congress in 2009.",
