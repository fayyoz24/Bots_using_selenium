I have always wanted to run a Japanese restaurant in my home country Bulgaria and thanks to this project I caught a glimpse of what that might look like when it comes to managing it using digital marketing. I was able to create a website for the restaurant on my own and develop influencer and social media strategies in order to boost awareness and consideration for my restaurant. I also learned how to take advantage of email marketing and created my first ever email marketing campaign. \n\nThis project was crucial for expanding and applying my knowledge and sparked my ambition to work in the digital marketing field in the future.",
