    "summary": "Kalyan Ram Madabhushi, 55, is an accomplished CEO and Board Director with more than 33 years\u2019 experience in running global businesses in multi-regional & multicultural environments predominantly based out of Singapore (1995-2006), Europe (2006 to 2018) and now in Mumbai (2018-2023), with expertise in transformation/change and versatility in growing businesses in a variety of industries.  \n\nThe urge to return to India in 2018, having left the country in mid 1990s, was made easy when a challenging assignment was offered at Aditya Birla Group to lead the Group\u2019s $ 3.0 billion Global Chemicals business (Chlor-Alkali & Advanced Materials) together with 3 other flagship entities (Indo-Gulf Fertilisers, Aditya Birla Insulators & Wood based textile filament yarn produced at Century/Indian Rayon entities). \nIt's been an amazing few years with the team, establishing two new major JVs (US partner and German partner respectively), a Technology acquisition (US start-up), 2 divestments (Chemicals & Fertilizers) and ensuring significant investments are committed (securing the business future).\n\nIt's been my pleasure to work with Royal Dutch Shell for more than 2 decades, an organisation that was a learning institution in itself, in various senior leadership roles within Energy & Chemicals Industry. \n\n1. Having had an opportunity to be based in two different continents, initially in Singapore (1995-2006) and thereafter at the Netherlands (2006-2017), I had the privilege of striking wonderful relationships & partnerships with colleagues and customers across Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia Pacific & Middle East.  \n\n2. Every challenge that I experienced in my 22 years at Shell, be it Transformation/Change, P&L roles at Global/Regional level, Board/JV Governance roles in Europe and Mentoring Asian/European leaders thought me enough to start giving back to the new organisation as well as the society large.\n\nTechno-Commercial education with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechanical Engineering (NIT) and an MBA  in International Business (IIFT) and an executive leadership learning at IMD Switzerland and University of OXFORD, helped shape who I am!\n\nI developed aptitude for mentoring young entrepreneurs in Europe/Asia and delivered leadership lectures as visiting faculty for business schools and student communities in France, Singapore and the Netherlands. But I am able to relax and enjoy a work-life harmony when I spend time with family, listen to Classical Music, Reading and learning new developments but an intense Badminton session takes my mind off everything.",
