Bilingual Engineer (studying Dutch as a third language at the moment) with experience in different areas such as Quality, Customer Experience and Manufacturing. \n\nMaking processes more efficient and assuring the quality in all the stages of the process is one of my passions, also visiting new places and meeting new people is part of who I am. I believe that knowing the world and different cultures can help us to achieve better results, in our personal and professional life.\n\nI love making connections and this has been proving during my professional path in 4 different countries. Working in a multicultural environment (Brazil, Ireland, Hungary and The Netherlands) where I have built significant relationships, professionally and personally. \n\nI took a leap year to go to Ireland to improve my English skills and in the meantime I had the opportunity to work as a service provider in a caffee. \n\nBefore this experience I worked for 8 years at PepsiCo Brazil, auditing support activities regards the process, customer comunnication and assessment guidelines, ensuring that the quality thinking and quality standards would be followed during the process were ones of my main activities. \n\nAt the moment, I am working at DSM Biomedical in Geleen (The Netherlands) as a Quality Systems Officer, and guaranting that quality processes and procedures are being followed is part of my daily routine.  \n\n\nContact via: marianacalegari30@gmail.com",
