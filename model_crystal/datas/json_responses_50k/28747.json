    "summary": "I am an ambitious jack of many trades with a knack for creative problem-solving, and a good sense of humor. \nAs far back as high school, I had a knack for programming, to the point where classmates would approach me to write math programs on their calculators. I'd frequently spend my afternoons designing new algorithms for the satisfaction of it, and the joy of gaining insights as to how such programs worked.\n\nThrough studying AI, my joy for programming evolved into a passion for data science, and I took great joy in collaborating in teams on a variety of project topics, including machine learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, and deep learning.\nNext to my academic achievements, I take pride in personal ones as well. I've made an active effort to pursue new challenges, and develop myself through new experiences.\n\nAs such, in an attempt to bridge the gap between student and teacher, I established a study committee, and discovered a passion for teaching and tutoring by organizing support lectures. \nThrough various roles within my committee, I greatly enjoyed collaborating with others towards a common goal, which benefits my fellow students. Not only was it inspiring and rewarding, but it also taught me to be an integral part of a team, manage working groups, and connect with others.\n\nMoreover, I challenged myself to engage in improv comedy theatre, a frightful endeavor to most, yet one which proved to be an excellent opportunity to improve my soft-skills, communication, and interactions with (international) students of wildly different disciplines. \n\nI am eager to cross the gap between academia and industry, and apply my knowledge and skills in a practical environment. I have a passion to inspire and support my peers on both a professional and personal level, and highly value environments that encourage personal development and growth. I'm looking forward to collaborate with ambitious colleagues and various experts to deliver innovative, impactful solutions to diverse AI challenges, and contribute to a fun and inspiring work environment.",
