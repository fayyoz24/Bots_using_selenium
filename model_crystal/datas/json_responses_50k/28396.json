Over the years, I have operated both in emerging and in established markets (Europe, Latam, USA and Middle East), and different enterprise environments (from corporates to rapidly growing FinTech Unicorns). \n\nI\u2019ve worked on different facets of payments \u201cproducts\" - starting as a developer, and moving to drive innovation, product roadmaps, commercial performance and strategic partnerships. Always, with extreme attention to details and execution excellence: Whether they are related to technical decisions, front-end experiences, compliance, or product marketing. \n\nI was previously responsible for a group of teams driving the performance of one of Klarna's leading direct-to-consumer products. And today I\u2019m responsible for Mollie\u2019s Financial Services domain. ",
