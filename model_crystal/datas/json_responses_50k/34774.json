    "summary": "A Computer Science graduate at University College Cork with an interest in software development. Enthusiastic and wanting to learn more. Successfully completed a year-long internship as a Software Developer at BCE and a four months long internship at SES Astra in the Learning and Development department. \n\nSpecialties:\nJava development (JSE, Spring, SWT, Maven, Tomcat, JUnit)\nXML\nDatabase design (SQL)\nEclipse/InteliJ\nLinux\n\nSpeaks good French, is greatly interested in dog training and spends her free time learning mobile photography, 3D printing and renewing old furniture.\n\nWhy computer science?\nI always liked being challenged, starting with learning math before being able to read to solving all sorts of puzzles. Always curious about how things work and why. \nGot my first computer at the age of 9 and a family friend taught me all about it, from hardware to software. \nWhile in primary school, I have heard some kids whisper that there is a girl in our school who is our age and knows how to create websites. Being competitive, I went home and self-taught myself HTML and CSS. \nWith time, my IT knowledge grew and soon I was the first point of contact for friends, family and neighbours for any computer-related issues. From that point on my career choice was obvious. \nI love how challenging this field is and how it always requires me to learn new things. ",

This project examines the current state of research of naming in the IoT and selects several candidate solutions for closer examination. Subsequently, this project proposes to combine several candidate solutions into one solution that works for any size of the network, comes with  utoconfiguration scheme and with URI-like names. The resulting solution allows users to easily identify the devices in the local network, and therefore, making remote controlling much easier with no user input.\nThis approach is closely linked to inter-device communication, where the current protocols are too heavy for the connected devices that have limited resources. A lightweight version would include sending unicast messages to authoritative device, and using Constrained Application Protocol to keep the message size to a minimum.\nFurthermore, this project proposes the use of \u201clocal clouds\u201d, a group of connected devices. These clouds can talk to each other, and search for new clouds and their resources using keywords that describe their capabilities.\n\nBlending all these approaches together creates a new environment that is lightweight and user friendly.",
