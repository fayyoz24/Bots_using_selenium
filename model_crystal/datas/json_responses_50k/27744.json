    "summary": "In my career, I have always enjoyed helping others and putting information across as clearly as possible. As a teacher, I wish to continue doing this. I do not only want to share my knowledge of the English language, but also help students to learn for themselves, within an encouraging and inspiring atmosphere. My analytical and creative skills enable me to plan lessons effectively and to devise varied tasks which are fun as well as useful. I enjoy working with people and have a genuine interest in others. I am friendly, able to clarify language well and always put a lot of effort into my work.\n\nI have recently obtained my CELTA qualification (grade A) and now work as a freelance teacher of General English to adults. I enjoy combining my teaching with helping international students for my work at Utrecht University.",
