My responsibilities consisted mainly of supporting our field engineers. I also gained experience in \u2018Old-School\u2019 survey techniques with magnetic and gyroscopic survey tools in Oman. In addition to these tasks, I became heavily involved in the development and introduction of the latest MWD technology. In collaboration with the technical staff we were responsible for taking the latest MWD system from the drawing board to the commercial stage. In this period I was sent to Houston to monitor pressure and flow loop testing and the general development of the tool.  During the advanced development phase I became liaison between our the R&D departments in Celle, Germany and Houston, Texas.",

On- shore I assisted the base manager and represented him in his absence. This meant gaining experience in both the operational as the administrative aspects of an internationally operating company.

On board I learned about operating the production installation on the FPSO and in addition the maritime aspects of running such an installation on a ship during all sorts of adverse conditions.
