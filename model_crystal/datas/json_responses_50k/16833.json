Visual communication has proven to be a powerful method that can obviate these challenges. Next to this it adds clarity, creativity and fun to the experience.\n\nI use Graphic Facilitation as a method through which I visualise complex processes graphically on the spot. I am present during a process and listen for the essence of what is taking place and being communicated. Which main ideas, challenges and concepts are emerging? What processes are taking place and how are the different elements, procedures or stakeholders linked? On a large sheet of paper, I translate this information into a simple visual language, using symbols, drawings, and words. \n\nGraphic facilitation can create important added value for your strategic processes, meetings, workshops, and conferences, as well as for the creation of specific communications such as agendas, mission statements, timelines and templates. I can create customised output for your specific event or communication tool.\n\nA video about graphic facilitation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2JuqfrsVhM",

On a voluntary basis I designed and executed a project in their community. The Sani had started an ecotourism project, which had caused a large increase in waste, and led to the pollution of their land and river. I made a project plan with alternative sustainable strategies for the activities that were taking place within the community and executed the first phases of the plan with the community. By means of schooling and group discussions I gained support for the plans to make the community and its tourism more sustainable. Side projects were composting, reducing the inflow of plastic, recycling, and the usage of organic detergents and soaps.",
