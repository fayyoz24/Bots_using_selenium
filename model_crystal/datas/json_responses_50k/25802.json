So when a bad spot has been detected, the balls can be released and the substances are dispersing from the balls in order to prevent algae bloom.

ON several locations in The Netherlands are now this type of tunnel constructed. In one tunnel we even used PCM plates to improve more comfort for the animals as a stimulus to use the tunnel to cross a road. We also did experiences with high reflective coatings inside a tunnel, to gain more light. In the future we have the ambition to construct a tunnel which even generates power!

At the same time there is a need for noise reducing screens, especially in urban area's. To lower cost and to get a more sustainable solution, we design and construct a noise reducing screen made of this waste. By using phytoremediation and a secret substance mixing into the sandy material between the stones, we have realized a cheap noise reducing screen. This saves a lot of cost.

This causes better migration zones for animals and habitats for insects. The wood can be harvest after 10-15 years, which can be used for heating up the agriculture farm or something else.

Special plants are selected in which the leaves can be used for softboard production and the rots can be used to extract flagrant oil for perfume industry. In the center a pump is installed for water aeration I combination with a UV-lamp for disinfection. After some projects, we calculated how large a floating wetland should be, to have any effect on the water quality. The secondary effects are that it is being used as a breading place for vulnerable water birds and the surface below the wetland is a good habitat for fish to breed. The method was developed in collaboration with MH Waterzaken and Eminent Products.",
