    "summary": "Sincere, detail-oriented, realistic, client-focused: these are a few words that describe some of my personal\ncharacteristics in a nutshell. Having built my legal knowledge and experience representing prominent foreign and multinational clients, contract law, concessions, regulatory and compliance issues, licensing procedures and procurement processing in, among other industries, energy, oil & gas, mining, infrastructure, and aviation are the most important keywords that describe what I have to offer. In many of the cases that I handled, I have worked together with Clifford Chance LLP, Allen & Overy, Eversheds Southerland and other internationally renowned law firms. I am interested in finding a position as legal counsel or contract lawyer within a multinational working environment that allows for further development in European and/or Dutch law. I have a valid visa/work permit and can work for any company in the Netherlands.",
