    "summary": "My journey in the creative world started studying art in Italy.\nThe roots of my style and visual language were formed at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna. \n\nThen I specialized in animation and motion graphics, hands on the projects I understood how to solve problems and attain desired results even with limited tools. \nWorking with different teams I learned how to translate ideas into creative products for the advertising world.\n\nI found an interesting creative community in Amsterdam, where I have been living since 2010. Here I learned a lot working with talented people and together we growth improving my skills in the art of animation in 2D and 3D. I have been working mostly in small studios for big clients connected through worldwide agencies.\n\nI'm constantly searching for creativity and new inspirations , both in the art world and in the creative industry, learning new tools to solve problems and looking for new ideas.\n\nI'm always happy to meet new people, so please drop me a line if you want to have a coffee!",

A company that introduced the first beverage filter web made from 100% renewable materials. Except for this achievement, the main idea for their introductory video is that it would visually express \u201cthe science behind tea.\u201d\nWe brought the animation to life with a set of stylish boards from illustrator Ingwie Boley and created an engaging animation.\nThroughout the video we used expressive layering and natural fluidity as with the liquids that are moving in the cups. Furthermore we tried to give the whole animation a paperfeel like texture and used scientific annotations to explain the story of Ahltea. Resulting in a continuously flowing story about tea in a fun and playful way.\n",

These elements represent to us one of our most southern provinces.\n\nWe were asked by film by the sea (fbts) to create an opening animation for their yearly film festival, which is held in vlissingen, zeeland. During this festival, film and literature are used as the central themes.\n\nInspired by the romantic sceneries of the province we wanted the animation to visualize this rustic, classic and elegant atmosphere combined with the cultural elements of the festival. We came up with the story how people are connected by the magic lantern and transcend the mystical feeling of the festival and its location.\nThe result is an opening animation that breathes a classic sentiment while extending an invitation to the 17th edition of film by the sea.\n\nWe are really enjoyed working on this animation and for such an iconic festival as film by the sea!\n\n",
