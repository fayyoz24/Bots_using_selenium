    "summary": "After having spent 6 months in Copenhagen, Denmark for a bachelor exchange it became clear to me that I enjoy taking on new challenges and opportunities to develop and get to know myself further. So when the opportunity arose I chose to sign up for the STAR Management Week committee to organise the biggest business and recruitment event of the Benelux. Organising this event together with 7 other ambitious students has taught me about team work, communication and personal skills and I found my place in a new working environment. I am excited to put these new learnings about myself to use during future opportunities. With much excitement, I am eager to start a new challenge in September 2023 by starting my Msc Business Information Management at the RSM, Erasmus University Rotterdam and further developing my interest in Information, data, and technology management.",
