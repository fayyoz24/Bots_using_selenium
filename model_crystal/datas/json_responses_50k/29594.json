    "summary": "I am a PhD candidate at Health@TPM project at TU Delft. My research focuses on trade-off between patient-centered and population-centered approaches in Healthcare Systems. I apply data-driven mathematical modelling to assess the effect of therapeutic and non-therapeutic interventions to benefit a single patient, group of patients or population in whole.\nI received a bachelor degree in Applied Math and Physics. After this I switched focus on biological and medical implementations and graduated from Systems Biology Master program at Maastricht University. In my master thesis I assessed the fit of the mathematical model of advanced cancer to in vitro and in vivo data, performed comparison with different models and evaluated biological interpretability of the model.",
