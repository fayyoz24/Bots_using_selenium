This included many new upcoming biotech companies that were breaking into new markets, compounds, and countries. I found and incorporated an entirely new pipeline of work, leading to more diverse compounds and markets feeding into our sales pipeline, which ultimately led to many more collaborations and partnerships mid-to long term. And subsequently to becoming key Account Manager for our biggest client.\n\nEarly experiences in my career, such as this role with ERT, were formative for me in building a dedicated global perspective for business success as well as endowing me with a deeper understanding of different cultures and people. Working with professionalism and integrity, I developed and strengthened business relationships central to our business development goals. This led me to becoming the top international BD person selling independently a territory of $19.5M, with jointly/globally a total of $46.5M.\n\nIn 2004, ERT was cited as 2nd and 3rd-fastest growing US small business. \n\n\u00bb Top Sales Performer, Global Accounts (2006)\n\u00bb Top Sales Achiever Commercial Global Accounts (2005) \n__________\n\nERT is a global data and technology company that minimizes uncertainty and risk in clinical trials so that our customers can move ahead with confidence.",
