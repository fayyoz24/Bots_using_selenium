Hospicio de San Jose is a religious welfare institution, acting as a nursery, orphanage, retirement home, and refuge for all who seek it. The playground was in pretty bad shape, and since it is one of the only playgrounds in the area, it is frequented by many kids. It was a major health hazard. I used my project to refurbish and restore 3 swing sets. The project involved the local community through a food for work program run by Hospicio, and itinvolved volunteers from the boy scouts. After work was complete, all extra material and funds were donated to Hospicio to further restore the rest of the playground. The project was to show leadership and organizational skills.",
