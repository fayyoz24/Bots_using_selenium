    "summary": "For 12+ years, I have empowered brands with creative yet logical ideas for beautiful, innovative, screen-independent software and hardware applications. I have an excellent eye for detail and a great sense of UX/UI and human-centered designs. \n\nI have had the opportunity to work with some of the world's biggest companies (such as HP, Yamaha, Cummins, Exxon Mobil, etc.) and some cool new-age startups for their product design and development needs. This experience has helped me grow professionally as well as on a personal level. I excel in user research, feature prioritization, product design, validation, and coordinating between stakeholders on the engineering and business side. \n\nI actively consult startups for idea validation, business development, product refinement, and design thinking. This includes defining the true MAP, finding the right development partner, budgeting, and cost control. If you have a startup idea but are unsure where to go next, let's connect and brainstorm together.",
