    "summary": "\u201cGreat vision without great people is irrelevant\u201d. In this I truly believe and it is one of the things that I have learned in my 5 years as strategic HR & HR Marketing consultant. Helping companies attract and find the best talent and being involved in organizational success in such a way, feeds my drive. I am a committed and very communicative individual who is obsessed with working at getting better at whatever it is that I am doing. Most importantly, I have a positive approach to everything that I am doing (except when I am hungry).\n\nI love making new professional acquaintances. If you are interested in grabbing a coffee and talk about Talent Acquisition, Employer Branding, Recruiting, HR  or job opportunities, feel feel to reach out to me.\n\nSpecialties: Talent Acquisition Strategy| Recruitment | Employer Branding| Project Management | Digital Advertising| (Team) Leadership| Team Work | Customer Relationship Management | Sales Management |Research",
