    "summary": "Author of \"The Architect of Love\" book. Buy it via Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.com . Giving you the tools to build your own dream home aka your perfect partner and relationship for life. Let's start you on your journey to happiness and great love communication today! \n\n*\nHaving been an expat since 1991 starting with living in China, I have moved around as an international student, a professional expat and as the trailing expat spouse. \n\nI've started a coaching/therapy business in every location I moved to. In all these 'madness' the theme of communication is always the same. It's about navigating through the different 'language' and thought process that every culture share. \n\nFrom China to the Netherlands to England, France to Switzerland and Malaysia, I have learnt so much that it is now time to share my knowledge. \n\nBeing raised as a 'Third Culture Kid' and being in an international mixed marriage for the past 19 years, there are many insights I have gained to help others be happy and successful global citizens.\n\nMy goal is to promote peace on Earth and helping people find solutions to to their problem. Success is doing something well with a smile.",
