            "description": "Aerodynamic devices are utilized in higher levels of motorsport such as Formula-1 to increase the traction of the tires by generating down force. This increase in traction increases the performance envelope of the race car since cornering can be performed at higher speeds without a loss of control. However, the aerodynamic device that provides the down force also increases drag. The additional drag is especially detrimental on straight sections of the track. As higher speeds are attained, the increased drag leads to a decrease in lap-times and the drive force required is increased. An ideal solution is a dynamically adjustable aerodynamic device which offers the ability to change the relative amount of down force and drag. Such devices have been used in many formaerodynamic device for an FSAE car. After completing extensive research on current car design without aerodynamic device, preliminary design concepts were formulated and full car solid model was designed on Solidworks software. These designs were then compared against each other based on the analysis performed on STAR CCM software on the basis of downforce and drag genrated. The software analysis was used to compare and conclude the final design from each iteration to get optimum aerodynamic package for Team\u2019s 2018 car .The product was manufactured using some advanced manufacturing techniques to save cost, time and to provide it for further development.",
