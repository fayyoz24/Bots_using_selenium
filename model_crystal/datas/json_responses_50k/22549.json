A study was ordered to research the effects of these changes and to draft an IT Roadmap, supporting the business processes of the new organization.\nFollowing the main steps of the SEMBA methodology, Gwendolyn started as a Project Management Officer, though quickly took on business analyst and modeling tasks. She performed an AS-IS analysis conducting seventeen interviews with the main process users. Based on the information gathered in these interviews, and in relation to the Retail Reference Model, she modeled the business processes. After a strategic exploration by the team, the TO BE of both the business processes as the IT landscape was drafted. Additionally, Gwendolyn modeled the TO BE processes of each transition phase. A project portfolio was composed and translated to a Transformation Map and Benefits Logic.\nThe IT  Roadmap was completed with recommendations  and presented to the management team of the client and the ICT department of its corporate organization. The Roadmap supported the migration to a new IT environment.",
