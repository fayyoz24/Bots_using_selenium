    "summary": "I'm presently working at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands as a postdoctoral researcher on microfluidics for more biologically-oriented systems and synthetic biology as well as liquid crystal-based platforms for biological sensing. Prior to this, as a Ph.D. student and postdoc at the University of Luxembourg, my work dealt with surfaces and interfaces of many flavors, ranging from liquid crystalline interfaces for biosensing to interfacial tension measurements using microfluidics techniques and to interfaces of liquid metals and polymer solutions for spinning them into fibers.\n\nI've had a significant amount of international experience, ranging from internships in Germany and South Korea to a semester of study in the UK, teaching English in France, and now working and teaching in Luxembourg. As a result, I'm also very interested in how students learn, in particular with respect to the teaching of foreign languages and sciences.\n\nOn the side, I work a bit with graphical design and with outreach projects for organizations and groups I'm affiliated with. I also enjoy travel and any opportunities to visit new places and experience new cultures.",
