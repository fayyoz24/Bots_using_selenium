The prize shall be $500 per author (up to a maximum of $1500 per award) and a certificate. Eligibility is based on a five-year window: for the 2011 Award, the paper must have appeared in one of the Society's Transactions between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010. Current members of the Signal Processing Society Awards Board are ineligible. Judging shall be on the bases of general quality, originality, subject matter, and timeliness. Up to six Best Paper Awards may be presented annually, either at the Society's Awards Ceremonies, normally held during ICASSP in the Spring or at ICIP in the Fall following selection of the winner(s).
