The training consists of three modules as part of phase 1. In the next modules participants will gain tools and practice with both qualitative as well as quantitative (forecasting and modelling) research data to write policy briefs (Phase 2). Finally participants will enhance their training competencies (ToT approaches).",

The rationale of the  Fair Treatment Approach, when applied by the  is that it improves the attitude of civil servants towards citizens from one of suspicion, into one of empathy and shared interest, while at the same time it enhances trust of citizens in the government. The experience of the National Ombudsman in the Netherlands has shown that the adoption of the Fair Treatment Approach asks for a profound cultural change throughout the organization, that needs attention and training over a longer period of time. This project aims to set up a road map for the successful introduction of the Fair Treatment Approach in, first of all, ORI offices in Indonesia, therewith taking into account regional differences. Since ORI has gender equality as one of its priorities, this approach will offer more insight in what is at stake for different groups within society, be it women, minorities or other disadvantaged groups.",
