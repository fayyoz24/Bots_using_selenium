    "summary": "I'm a developer always looking for challenges. I really like dealing with complex problems, understanding the domain and finding nice solutions for the issues. I'm committed to clean code what I see essential for building quality software.\n\nI like learning, discovering new areas and it seems I'm quite good in it. Furthermore I enjoy sharing my knowledge. It can be a personal discussion, a meeting with few people or a presentation for a class of students, I like all kind of teaching.\n\nI like working in an agile environment where I can effectively contribute to the success of the business. While I believe in well crafted solutions, I prefer to be pragmatic and spend my time on problems which really matter.\n\nI have working experience mainly with Java stack, RESTful services, AWS, automated deployment and testing.",

The applications were written in Java, using extreme programming techniques like TDD, pair programming. We had a continuous integration system in Jenkins and created an automated test framework for verification. During development I had to deal with effective memory handling, multithreading and graphs. I took part in architecture plannings and important design decisions. I worked closely together with our business experts and I was involved in their analyst work. Besides development I tried to guide programmers from the teams for high quality, clean code. I was the tutor of new colleagues and I introduced our products and new features to our stakeholders. I had to cooperate with other divisions in Ireland, Sweden and India as well.",

I was part of a scrum team and did acceptance test for user stories, regression and functional test for deliveries. Besides manual testing I wrote automated tests in Squish and scripts to automate repeating tasks. These few months of testing helped me later as a programmer to avoid code-only mindset and to keep focus on user values during software development.",
