    "summary": "Since my positions at the university and the embassy, I have been applying the extensive knowledge obtained across a broad range of academic disciplines in the working environment. In these activities, I have been responsible for the transcribing and interpreting of primary sources in order to assure their correct entry into the database as well as the writing and editing of texts with different purposes.\n\nDuring my time as a student I combined two academic disciplines in the form of a double bachelor \u2013 History and Italian \u2013 supported by many extracurricular courses from other disciplines, such as philosophy and history of art. During the almost two years that I resided in Italy for education and an internship, I have been able to deepen my knowledge of the culture and language of the peninsula. Nowadays, I aim to improve my vocabulary of the Italian language in less colloquial areas, such as academic and literary jargon.\n\nMy internship at the Royal Dutch Embassy in Rome took place at a very important moment, namely the state visit of the Royal Couple to Italy. Therefore, during my work there, this was one of my most important activities. Next to this, I also conducted a research during these six months, aiming to find simple means of measuring the effect of the embassy\u2019s cultural policy. Then, there were also a range of smaller activities I took care of, such as regularly updating the social media of the embassy as well as the publishing of newsletters.\n\nIn the three years that I worked as a student-assistant in a digitalization project, I was responsible for the entry of the documents in the database, from transcribing and correcting earlier transcriptions to the entry of the basic features and the writing of summaries.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy to read and collect literature, with special attention to the classics of (Italian) history. This includes both prose and verse, fiction such as novels, but also works on history and philosophy.",
