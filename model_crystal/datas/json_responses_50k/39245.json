    "summary": "With an academic background both as an architect engineer and building technologist, my research lies at the interface of structural design, architectural design and material engineering, with main focus on innovative, sensible and sustainable applications of cast glass in architecture. Examples include the use of waste glass as raw material for cast glass components (recycling), the use of cast glass in the restoration of historic monuments (applicability/material compatibility) and the use of topological optimization for massive cast glass components (reducing the mass). My educational and working background has offered me a critical aesthetic approach to my work and the ability to bridge the gap between architects and structural engineers.\nMy PhD, \u201cUnveiling the third dimension of glass. Solid cast glass components and assemblies for structural applications\u201d explored, through the design, development, prototyping and experimental validation of two distinct building systems, the use of solid, volumetric cast glass components for achieving 3-dimensional glass structures. My valuable contribution to this novel field of structural glass lies both in establishing design & engineering guidelines and in expanding the applicability of cast glass in architecture.\nI have been involved as one of the lead researchers in the research & development of the adhesively bonded  glass block system for the Crystal Houses facade in Amsterdam; for which our research group has received multiple awards, including the Innovation Award by the Society of Fa\u00e7ade Engineers (UK, 2016), the Glass Innovation Award (NL, 2017) and the personal Talent met Toekomst Bouwprijs (NL, 2017). \nThrough this project, I realized that although applications of glass in architecture are increasing, most designs lack provision for end-of-life reuse or recycling. In this direction, I have co-initiated \u201cRe3 Glass\u201d project which concerns a reversible system using recycled, interlocking cast glass components, achieving circularity at material and construction level. For its sustainable character, Re3 Glass has been a New Material Award (2018) and S+T+ARTS Prize (2020) nominee. \nAs a cast glass expert, I have been invited to give multiple lectures and cast glass workshops in international conferences and institutions, including workshops at SHoP Architects (USA), Design Lab Athens (Greece) and Challenging Glass 6 (The Netherlands), and lectures at Princeton University (USA), UPenn (USA), School of Applied Arts (Vienna), InGlass (Poland) and Challenging Glass 5 Conference (Belgium), among others.",
