    "summary": "The built environment is de decor of human life!\n\nWhile studying and working in multicultural and trans-disciplinary settings in the Netherlands, Greece, Nigeria and Thailand, I have noticed that Peace is a way of dealing with one another to understand the diversity of local-level expressions of global challenges. If we respect each other and make use of the learning potentials of mutual inspiration to govern transitions, then we operate with Peace.\n\nVia these experiences, I 1) became particularly interested in the relationship between the physical environment and human behaviour, and consequently how places function, I 2) advocate an established role for the built environment in achieving the UN SDGs, and I 3) emphasize the relevance and role of education in context, i.e. the interconnectedness between education, research and practise to enhance learning and societal impact.\n\nPeople I worked with describe me as a passionate, disciplined, spontaneous and well-mannered person who is open-minded and constantly eager to learn from others while being patient and understanding towards others to work to a better world.\n\nStefano Blezer",

More specifically, I worked on beating the traffic jam that Lagos is facing every day. The project consisted of six online webinars and a field visit of two weeks to the city itself in June 2019.\n\nMy team members and the project setting taught me a lot about specific social entrepreneurial skills necessary to start and find business solutions to overcome urban challenges. Moreover, the insights about the role of entrepreneurship, education, culture and politics within the ecosystem of a mega city in the 21th century that the project gave me are of immense value for my own career and understanding of city dynamics!",

I worked on beating the traffic jams in Lagos. The project consisted of six online webinars and two weeks to the city itself in June 2019.\n\nThe project taught me a lot about social entrepreneurial skills necessary to address urban challenges.
