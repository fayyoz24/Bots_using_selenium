    "summary": "I'm a passionate innovator. I love to gauge business potential in anything as such. After pursuing an MSc degree within energy optimization and sustainability, I gathered co-founders to start DC Hive. The idea came after a brief stint at 'The Green Village', working on Direct Current hardware systems. With DC Hive we aimed to fill the market gap of easy to use and install power distribution hardware that smartly connects PV generation, electric vehicles, LED lighting and electronic devices. After 4 months of hardcore market validation (through Yes!Delft Validation Lab and European Climate-KIC programme) we decided to take the bottom-up approach (pivot) of building user centric hardware that provides power charging, data as well as audio-visual capabilities. User experience and ease of use was given priority while designing our first product for the office environment. On our journey, we achieved many milestones and personally I learnt a whole lot about product development, B2B sales, importance of having the right team members, cash flow modeling and legal due diligence. Through some exciting projects, I also sharpened my data analysis skills. We also fulfilled grants and projects worth ~ 250k EUR. Due to some technical bottlenecks, I will be leaving my role within DC Hive to further my thirst of building genuine products/solutions.\n\nMoving ahead, I'm looking at interesting opportunities that lets me use my founder experience and help grow scale-ups/corporate innovations.",
