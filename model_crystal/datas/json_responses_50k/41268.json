PMA is divided into three sections, research, knowledge exchange and collaboration with Traditional Dance and Improvisation as a starting point, which ultimately lead to the creation of a the latest dance theatre production of Martinez&Verburg in collaboration with El Ballet Oficial de Bolivia: REALIDADES. In combination with other art forms such as music and poetry, the diverse backgrounds of the performers, (Contemporary Dance, Improvisation, Traditional Dance, Urban Dance and Physical Theatre) are integrated into the overall process . The PMA project started in 2013 in Bolivia with the support of the Dutch arts Funds NFPK. A collaborative project of 9 months. Bolivia is a country with an authentic culture that is constantly in motion, where tradition and innovation are inseparable . Through physical exchange, dialogue, discussions and open meetings, the collaboration between different disciplines and cultures were deepened in order to further methodological development of the work of Movementalist, with the vision to unite different worlds with each other.",
