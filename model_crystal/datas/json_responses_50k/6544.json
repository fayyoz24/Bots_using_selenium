Additionally, I also supervise Bachelor and Master students in writing their thesis. \n\nMy expertise is in marketing/business research, which is also reflected in the courses that I teach (research- and methodology courses). Within these courses we incorporate marketing by working on marketing related cases and other business related topics. In some of the courses my students perform actual research (academic or practical) on a marketing related topic. \n\nIn two consecutive academic years (2018-2019 & 2019-2020) I have been selected excellent teacher, based on student evaluations, for my course Business Research Techniques for Premaster. \n\nSince April 2018 I am a member of the Examination Board of TiSEM.",
