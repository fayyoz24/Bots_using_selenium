At the end of the course, the student must come up with an original theoretical physics problem and solve it. The problem I chose is a quantum random walk, which could produce different scaling compared to a classical random walk. The reason I chose this topic is due to some quantum algorithms could be modeled as a quantum walk on a graph. In my problem (pdf file), I showed analytically that an electron quantum walks with a Grover coin on a Creutz ladder (a well-known toy model of topological insulator) is localized in a region and can never escape to infinity. This is a sharp contrast to the diffusion process in which a particle always has some finite probability of escaping to infinity.",

In the Supply Chain Simulation, I investigate the capability of Chat-GPT in building supply chain models in AnyLogic. In the Quantum Algorithm team, I work on two tasks. \n1. I work on a generalization of Recursive-QAOA which can be applied to other QUBO problems (with a focus on the maximum independent set problem). I implemented different update rules and show that p=1 QAOA could perform on par with the classical greedy algorithm for the MIS problem. I also gather evidence to conjecture that RQAOA cannot outperform classical algorithms if we only second order moment and first-order moment  (covariance matrix and mean). \n2. I help another student with his master thesis on error mitigation. In explicit, we manage to relax the symmetric noise assumption in IBM's latest paper on noise cancellation. We also manage to prove a lower bound scaling  O(log2(N)) on the number of Pauli strings needed to learn the noise in a fully connected qubit topology. These results path way for error mitigation on trap-ions platform since it usually have highly connected topology.",

However, the superfluid weight is geometry-independent where as the quantum metric is not. In fact, the normal definition of the superfluid weight overestimates its real value. In this project, I derive an analytical expression for the correction term by taking into account the E&M vector potential properly. Together with my advisor, I have obtained a new expression for the superfluid weight which is geometry independent. The article is now on arXiv. This result is important to understand flat band superconductivity, which is a promising candidate for high T superconductivity. Below is the preprint of my project.",
