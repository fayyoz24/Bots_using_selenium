    "summary": "For the last 4 years I have been a PhD candidate in the department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Biophysics in the lab of Dr. Paul van Bergen en Henegouwen and in the department of NMR spectroscopy in the lab of Prof. Dr. Marc Baldus. I was in a unique position as I was shared PhD candidate between these two labs in a joined effort to establish novel research lines and answer crucial unanswered questions in cancer biology. I elucidated the structure-function relationship of growth factor receptor EGFR and Her2 by modulating the dynamics of the extracellular domain after binding of nanobodies or antibodies. In order to fully understand the complex structure-function relationship of these receptors, NMR data was supported by a variety of functional cell biology assays. Due to the diverse background required for my PhD, I obtained a broad knowledge in- and experimental expertise on atomic, molecular and cell biology. Overall, my PhD has allowed me to work in diverse molecular cancer biology topics and has given me the opportunity to become an independent researcher. Besides, it has also developed my critical thinking, multi-tasking, organisational and managing skills. Moreover, I supervised two Master\u2019s- and three Bachelor\u2019s students, while also being involved in educational courses, which further helped me to develop my teaching capabilities.",
