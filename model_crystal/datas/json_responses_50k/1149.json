    "summary": "When I first set foot into the 'real world' as an adult, my passion was music, so much so that I took the fastest route towards performing professionally, and joined the US Marines as a Bugler. After a tour abroad and a significant amount of cultural maturity through diverse experiences, I found a new passion in securing information and systems, meaning I really liked to break computers! \n\nIn 2011 I transitioned my focus a to a technical skillset focusing on my foundation in education and certification. Today I consistently build on that foundation with continued focus in education, certification, and professional growth. I spend a majority of my time providing structure to problem driven products, enabling repeatable processes, and providing value driven results.  One of my key goals is maintaining transparency in my work and fostering healthy relationships with my peers and stakeholders. \n\nA quick overview of my technical background will tell you I started with customer support, followed with various focuses on security domains, technology, and programs. Specifically, I have supported and led large scale security programs such as Vulnerability & Patch Management, Cyber Security Maturity, Threat Analysis, Threat Assessments, Risk Assessments, Risk Governance, and Security Testing for the United States Department of Defence and commercial sector. Ensuring value for my clients, peers, and stakeholders has driven me to seriously consider what threats and risks matter the most, and drive improvements in the people, processes, and technologies that best protected against them.",
