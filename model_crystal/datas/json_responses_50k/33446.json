It is based on the wisdom of the Andes - Peru and proposes a hollistic aproach to develop consciousness based in the person's own practice and experience. The physical level is taken care by understanding the relationship that we have with our body. The emotional level is thoroughly studied because it is the motor which shapes our world together with the mental level. But none of that makes sense if we do not integrate our spiritual level. This ancient wisdom source helps us to understand our human nature and our spiritual essence and be able to profit from it applying what we understand in our everyday life. It is an excellent alternative to orthodox therapy for anyone in need of healing or desire to grow as a person, because we become encharge of our own proces from the beginning. We are not a patient. We get our power back to be able to heal ourself and to become who we want to be. KawsayPacha creates a very powerful and save environment to facilitate the connection with each person allowing his/her growth process. Every person has a precious gift to discover in a life time and to offer it to the evolution of humanity. It is our birth right and responsibility.",
