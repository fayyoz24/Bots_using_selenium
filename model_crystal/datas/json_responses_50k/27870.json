    "summary": "I am an educator and science communicator with a background in research in Paleoclimate and Geo-ecosystems, Modern and past climate change.\n\nFor the past five years, I have worked as a science communicator, organizing and leading weekly events about topics such as astrophysics, planetary science, space travel and on another front climate science and sustainability, environmental policy that bring inspiration and passion for science to a diverse audience. As the main organizer of these events, I have developed strong leadership and communication skills, working collaboratively with a team of volunteers to create engaging and interactive experiences that make science come alive for audiences of all ages.\n\nWhile I have enjoyed my experiences in academia and research, I am now in the process of transitioning to a place where I can fully focus mainly on education. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my passion, skills, and experience to a more active teaching role.",
