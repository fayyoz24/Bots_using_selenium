Since all these publications were send at no charge on a try-out basis by scientific publishers throughout the world, these titles had to be returned within 3 months or otherwise Vermeulen got charged. I managed it all through developing a color coded system with index cards, and managed to save the bookstore a significant amount of money by returning the so-called 'dead stock' (books which were not selling within 3 months time). All this without a computer or database!",
