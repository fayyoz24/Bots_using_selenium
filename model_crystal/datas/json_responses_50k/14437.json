    "summary": "I am a penultimate year MSc Applied Earth Sciences (Petroleum Engineering track) student at\nDelft University of Technology (TU Delft). I have decided to connect my future career with Petroleum Engineering as I am certain I possess both right qualities and motivation to succeed in this area not only as a student at a top Dutch university but also as a future professional and scientist.\nMy goal is to obtain outstanding experience in Reservoir and Production Engineering sectors throughout my university and internature course.  I am passionate about data science and I strongly believe that data-driven future is not far away, therefore data science skills are essential for a successful engineering career. \nSeeking for work experience in the upstream sector to develop engineering and management skills and apply new ideas to real-life industry problems.\n",
