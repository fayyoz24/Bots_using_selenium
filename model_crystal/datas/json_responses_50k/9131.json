Wij zijn een jonge en innovatieve vereniging binnen de gevestigde orde, een vereniging met verstand van zaken van de Traditionele Chinese Geneeswijzen. Wij krijgen adviezen van professoren en wetenschappers van Chinese universiteiten. Ons hoofdbestuur houdt zich alleen bezig met beleid, terwijl een jong en enthousiast team van ondernemers zich bezighoudt met de werkzaamheden binnen de vereniging.\n\nDe resultaten zijn niet uitgebleven in deze korte periode. Wij kunnen met trots zeggen, dat wij in 5 jaar 40 verzekeringsmaatschappijen hebben geregistreerd die onze beroepsvereniging in hun polisvoorwaarden hebben opgenomen en zo de vergoeding van behandelingen mogelijk maken. wij zijn in het afgelopen jaar verdubbeld in ons leden aantal en dagelijks komen er nieuwe aanmeldingen binnen \n\nIn het afgelopen jaar hebben wij 2 contracten binnen weten te halen voor een samenwerking met de Chang Chun University of Chinese Medicine en de Zhejiang Chinese Medical University voor het volgen van de laatste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van de toepassing van deze geneeswijzen.\n\nIn november 2008 zijn wij officieel toegetreden tot The World Federation of Acupuncture Moxibustion Societies (WFAS), welke relaties onderhoudt met de World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn 2010 zijn wij toegetreden tot de Nederlandse normcomisie (tc249) om te komen tot een internationale ISO standaarden in de Chinese geneeswijzen. \n\nin 2010 zijn wij tiegetreden tot de Koepel SRBAG waardoor een verdere groei van de vereniging is gewaarborgd \n\nIn 2011 heeft de NBCG YI de 2e internationale vergadering van ISO TC249 in Den Haag mogeklijk mogelijk gemaakt.",
