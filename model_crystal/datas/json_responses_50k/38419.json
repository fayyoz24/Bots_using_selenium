Funded by the Childhood Development Initiative (CDI), the evaluation examines the data resulting from a health promoting intervention among children living in disadvantage in an urban setting in Ireland. \n\nAims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the social, emotional and behavioural difficulties of children growing up in urban disadvantage in Dublin, and compare the results to national, international and norm values.\n\nMethods: Data collected as part of Trinity College Dublin\u2019s impact evaluation of the Healthy Schools Programme were used in this study. Statistical analysis of the relationship the levels of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties and growing up in disadvantage was carried out using T tests. The results were compared with the Growing Up in Ireland study, the Millennium Cohort study and norm values. The original study and the study extension at year 4 received ethical approval from the Faculty of Health Sciences at Trinity College Dublin. \n\nResults: Significant differences between total difficulties were observed between data arising from the HSP SDQ parent report and each of GUI, MCS and the norm values. The null hypothesis was rejected. The differences in means in the child report were not statistically significant for any category other than peer relationship problems. Analysis was conducted within the parameter of the 95% confidence interval. \n\nConclusions: The data arising from the SDQ has shown an increase in difficulties for those living in disadvantage. The current study provides valuable information for future studies to explore the complex interactions between social demographic and difficulties during childhood.",

These included modification of the innate immune system by altered regulation of IgE-Synthesis, and changes in the adaptive immune system through a shift from Th2 proliferation to Treg proliferation, and inhibition of the facilitation of antigen presentation.",

I have held a committee position for the past 4 years, and have been involved in organising many events throughout that time. The most notable of which took place in February 2014 while I was Captain. \nI managed a committee of 10 students and together we undertook the organisation of the National Intervarsity Championships. It was held in 1 hotel over 2 days and 3 nights, using 100 horses (sourced by the club), with 250 competitors and 300 attendees. This event was one of the most challenging things I have ever done, and I am very proud to be able to put my name to it.\n\nIn total, the event involved a turnover of over \u20ac50,000. Through careful management the event ran at a small profit, allowing for the re-investment of capital and the purchase of new equipment for the club.",

Children who are vulnerable,  or have not been afforded the same opportunities as myself, my friends or my teammates. \n\nLast year, Barnardos worked to change the lives of 9,000 children who, without this guidance, would not have made it through school. Now they have the possibility of a college education and the opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their families. \n\nChildren with intellectual disabilities learn in the same way as those without; through play. For mothers and founders of Blossom, Auveen and Orla, this is at the centre of their organisation. To provide a fun, safe, stimulating environment much like you would find in any summer camp, or after school club around the country but tailored to the specific needs of the children attending. Allowing these children to fit, helps them to learn. \n"
