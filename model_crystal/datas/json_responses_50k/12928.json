Beside his research activities, he also attended statistical and methodological courses organized by the Postgraduate Epidemiology Programme of the EMGO-Institute, the Netherlands School of Primary Care Research, and the New England Epidemiology Institute in Boston, USA. Subsequently, he started working as a lecturer and senior researcher at the Department of Epidemiology and the Center of Evidence Based Physiotherapy at Maastricht University.
