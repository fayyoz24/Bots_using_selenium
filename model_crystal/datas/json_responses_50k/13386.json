    "summary": "In the context of work there are three things that give me net-positive energy.\n\u2601\ufe0f The first is to design and build cloud architectures that make a difference; in cost, performance, reliability, security or any other valuable business metric.\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb The second is to design and build software that can last; by using well-thought-out patterns and responsibilities, and by writing reusable and readable code.\n\ud83c\udfa4 The third is to share knowledge and insights on the first two topics; through public speaking, knowledge sharing sessions, blog writing, and training.\n\nAlthough the platforms and technologies change, these topics have been driving my career since my teenage years. Of course, \"cloud\" wasn't a thing back then, but back in the nineties I was climbing on the roof of my house to lay a 10BASE2 coax cable to create a network with my neighbors. A few years later I started programming in C, using the Borland IDE. And you could never get me to shut up about computers.\n\nI guess it was inevitable that I would be studying computer sciences. During my studies I made new friends and met likeminded people, two of which I started my first business with. Our company Coding Dutchmen was founded in 2009 and was acquired by The Others Online in 2014. I stayed there for another three years. In my time at Coding Dutchmen / The Others Online I got deeply involved in private hosting, virtual machines, scalability and redundancy, building a platform that could serve hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users across our sports and business apps.\n\nIn 2017 I joined Sentia, which was a fertilizing bed for my AWS knowledge. In 3.5 years I went from \"I know what an EC2 instance is\" to achieving every single AWS certification, including the Professional certs and tough nuts like Data Analytics Specialty, Machine Learning Specialty and Advanced Networking Specialty. At Sentia I also found my voice as a public speaker and blog writer, which in turn earned me the titles of APN Ambassador and AWS Community Builder.\n\nCurrently I'm using my experience to help Sentia's customers and internal teams improve their tech stack, optimize their use of AWS and grow their business. I'm balancing this with my role as lead engineer for the team that builds Sentia's internal AWS tooling. These products are built using AWS' serverless services, specifically AppSync, Lambda, EventBridge, StepFunctions and DynamoDB.

                    "description": "As Systems Architect, I've designed and built a hosting solution based on Juniper network appliances, Dell PowerEdge servers, HP StoreVirtual storage and VMware virtualisation. My most notable experiences are with VMware vSphere, VMware ESXi, Junos, Juniper SRX, Juniper EX, iSCSI and Veeam. I also single handedly created the physical environment, of which I've attached a picture.\n\nWithin our virtual environment we host about 200 virtual machines. 95% of these are running Ubuntu Linux. They include servers running NginX, Apache, MySQL, MySQL cluster, PHP-FPM, LVS, Postfix, OpenVPN, HAProxy, Git, Bind9, Subversion, Jenkins, Nagios and Python. All servers deployed in 2016 and later have full IPv6 support. I've designed, developed, deployed, monitored and maintained almost all of these servers. \n\nIn recent years we started using AWS as a secondary environment to our own. We host about ten servers in AWS, mostly for monitoring our primary sites. Because high availability and redundancy are important to us, I designed and deployed these servers with full failover capacity as well. Through this, I gained experience with Amazon's Availability Regions, VPCs, subnetting, virtual NICs, Elastic IPs and so on.\n\nNowadays, all our new servers are deployed using VMware templates and Ansible. This has simplified many operations, including the installation of default packages, network settings and users. \n\nLooking back to the past years as a systems architect, I think I've struck a good balance between flexibility, stability, costs, benefits, user requirements and security. We achieved a very high level of availability and performance. I have only been able to pull this off without a supporting team through good design, using modularity, layering and defensive design principles.",

We worked at this project for over 20 weeks. In the end we delivered a fully functional game in which two players could race each other in hovercrafts.\n\nWe also improved a lot of the existing hardware, for example by upgrading the computers, adding new audio hardware and adding professional cabling.",
