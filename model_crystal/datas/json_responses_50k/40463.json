Because what will be the impact on music if computers become better singers than Beyonc\u00e9, better performers than Prince, or better producers than Rick Rubin?\n\nIt is our goal to make sure that AI will always be an enrichment to human creative expression, instead of a threat. To reach this goal, we bring together multi-disciplinary project teams with musicians, scientists and designers to develop responsible AI-powered tools and artists.\n\nFind out more on www.thunderboomrecords.com",
