With over 7,500 members from 130 countries, ESCRS is a vital global platform and one of the largest professional societies in the field of ophthalmology.\n\nThrough the Digital Health Committee, I contribute to shaping and guiding the digital agenda with the aim to bring to the front compartment of the eye some of the digital advances that are already being made for the retina. The ESCRS have an active group of researchers, clinicians and surgeons, and there is a lot of positive enthusiasm for digital transformation in the Society.\n\nI'm a firm believer that the digitalization of healthcare will also bring about a net-positive impact on people and the planet. It delights me immensely to get to contribute towards these sustainable eHealth goals through this important digital focus at the ESCRS \u2013 especially where it concerns digital advances for the front compartment of the eye.",
