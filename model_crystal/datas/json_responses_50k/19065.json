    "summary": "I am a Computer Science Bachelor student that is looking for opportunities in working for a company that aims to combine the field of computer science with other fields of science. Currently I am in the fourth year of my bachelor, finished with all the mandatory courses in my curriculum. In the time I have now I hope to gain some work experience before I will go into masters next year september. In terms of working I consider myself a forward thinker that generally likes to think outside of the box. One aspect of the latter is that I often like to play devil\u2019s advocate to find out whether some concept is substantiated, which is also a role I prefer to perform in a company. I have a down to earth view of things and like to first think things through before going into action. My dream would be to contribute to the development of a piece of software that aims to unravel some of the remaining mysteries of nature.",

I came in contact with AEZEL through my father who contributes to the local history circle of his place of birth by writing articles regarding historical information of the habitation of the area. I programmed the web platform which enabled him to present this information in a straightforward and easy to comprehend fashion. By doing this voluntary work I hoped to further improve my understanding of websites and databases, as the mechanics behind this interested me. This has certainly contributed to my comprehension of the subject, as most aspects from the start-to-end development process of a website have passed by as I build the website single-handedly from the ground up. This extra knowledge has furthermore come in handy as some kind of head start for some of my courses. Important to mention is that since I was the only coder for AEZEL responsible for the whole website, I have also gained some experience in other fields surrounding the actual coding such as handling responsibilities and remarks and/or wishes of the website users. One of the most important forte I gained is to improve communication with less experienced clients.",
