    "summary": "I am a Software Engineer at EVBox, the leading provider of electric vehicle charging solutions, with over 4 years of experience in developing and maintaining backend applications, Rest APIs, and data analysis tools. I have a Master's Degree in Embedded Systems and ISTQB Foundation Certification, demonstrating my solid knowledge and skills in software engineering principles and practices.\n\nMy passion is to solve complex problems using Django, Python, data analysis, and data visualization techniques. I collaborate with developers and QA engineers to build hardware and backend APIs for EV chargers under test, and create dashboards to visualize and provide insights on test data. I have also gained experience in front-end technologies like Angular, and infrastructure technologies like AWS, CI, Docker, Linux, GitLab, and JavaScript. I enjoy learning new skills and technologies, and I'm always looking for opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of our software solutions.",

The controller board is equipped with PWM channels and customized inputs for motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. The closed loop PID control enables one to precisely trigger the actuators at specific intervals and achieve a smooth balance. This robot is a first step in building two wheeled transport vehicles through concepts such as gyro-stabilization, center of mass and sensor output filtering.",
