    "summary": "I am a Lead data scientist with several years of experience in data analysis, statistics, machine learning, software development, and leadership. I worked at CERN during my formative years. There, I obtained a PhD in Experimental Physics and four extra years of scientific research experience. During this time, I was part of one of the two experiments that were fundamental for the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics award.\n\nDifficult challenges motivate me, I use them to expand the limits of my knowledge. I like to approach problems from a global point of view, finding the best solutions after considering several possible options. I am a self-starter and an explorer. I like to take new ideas and identify their commercial or scientific potential. I am self-motivated and resilient, and I get a lot of my energy motivating people around me. \n\nI believe leadership is about setting the right standards and the right example. As part of a team, my main objective is that my contributions improve the team's status quo. I often take a supportive role, and I make sure I remove the problems my colleagues can face in order to set the team up for success. I help people with their own development aiming to get the best version of what they want to be. I believe that maximizing people\u2019s potential leads to the best possible results.",
