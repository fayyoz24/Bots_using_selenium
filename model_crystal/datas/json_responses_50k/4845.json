COMPLEX integrates the quasi-classic models of meso-scale processes with our best understanding of fine-grained space-time patterns and the system-flips that are likely to occur in the long interval between now and 2050. The sub-national region is the key point of entry for studying climate change and its cause-effect interrelations. It is small enough to be sensitive to local factors, large enough to interact with supra-national agencies and stable enough to be historically and culturally distinctive. In addition to undertaking case studies in Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain and Italy, we arel developing a suite of modelling tools and decision-support systems to inform national and supra-national policy and support communities across Europe working to make the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n \nWorkPackage 3: Realizing Climate-Policy Options\n \nThis Workpackage will explore acceptance, implementation and realization of climate mitigation (CM) policy options at the scale of the landscape from the perspective of those stakeholders who are most important for their successful implementation - key actors and communities, for example, and knowledge gatekeepers. To do this, we integrate non-mathematical modelling approaches developed for policy research with quantitative decision support tools. Green technologies, such as wind, solar, biofuel production and other forms of biomass use, together with energy efficiency measures such as innovative water treatment or better electricity demand management are needed to move towards a low carbon economy. Large scale implementation of these technologies affects land use dynamics in a complex, unpredictable way and may have unintended consequences (e.g. replacement of food crops for biofuel).",

The aim of the DROP project is to increase the resilience of NWE catchments to periods of drought.. DROP will develop a governance toolkit to be used by NWE regional water authorities and will test a few pilot measures on drought adaptation. The objectives of the project are 1) to promote the use of a European governance assessment toolkit to define regional drought adaptation; 2) to improve the effectiveness of drought adaptation measures for NWE areas, and 3) to enhance the preparedness of regional stakeholders in NWE in drought adaptation. To enhance the preparedness of NWE regions, the DROP project will work on improved measures and a better governance approach in defining drought adaptation.",
