The airport is operated by DHMI.\n\nThe Departure system consists of 10 check-in positions (5 for Domestics and 5 for International), two redundantly available in-line screening machines and two make-up carrousels. The Arrival system consists of three arrival carrousels (one for Domestic and two for International passengers) which are feeded by means of two continuous baggage elevators covering a height difference of more than 14 meters.\n\nThese elevators where also posing a technological challenge, which we successfully tackled during this project.",
