    "summary": "As a (technical) project manager, I like to understand the details of the product I'm responsible for, while at the same time monitoring the overall progress of the project (planning, scope, budget). This allows me to contribute to all activities during a software development project (except programming): from requirements analysis and design to test, deployment and maintenance. My experience has smart card technology as its common thread, and I have expertise in several applications of it in Transportation (Intelligent Transport Systems, Smart Ticketing) and Identity and Access Management. As a person, I am analytic, pragmatic, conscientious, reliable and hard-working. Last, but not least: I have a good sense of humor!\n",
