The research is OMAR is interesting because of its applications in organic light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells and field-effect transistors. I constructed an analytical bipolaron model, found analytical expressions for the current, the linewidth and magnitude of OMAR curves. Moreover, not only hopping in forward direction, but also in backward direction are included. The analytical bipolaron model can be compared with a Monte Carlo simulation and many similarities are found.",

These plasmas generate a mixture of highly reactive radicals and molecules, of which the most important one is the hydroxyl radical. \n\u2022\tIn order to determine the hydroxyl ground state density, laser induced fluorescence is used. I developed a model and a calibration, with the help of Rayleigh scattering for deducing the absolute hydroxyl density in the plasma. I proved the results to be consistent with those of absorption measurements. The advantage of using laser induced fluorescence compared to absorption is the ability to resolve the results in both space and time.",
