Relying on the credentials provided for the registration is not a fool proof way for detecting duplicate entries. World renowned UIDAI program and one of the largest biometrics based resident enrollment bases de-duplication of records using multi modal 1:N biometric matching \u2013 which involves image-to-image matching of 10 fingerprints, 2 Iris scans and face recognition algorithms. Every record is matched against an existing gallery of 700 million records (enrollment count by September 2014) with permissible error rate below 1%.\n\nI lead the solution team during the pre-sales solution and successfully implemented the PoC. The biometrics teams were based in Norway for Fingerprints, United states for Iris scans and German team for face recognition. The solution was intended to be deployed on 370 servers in production with 100% DR capacity. The challenge for the solution was to handle high volume of transactions \u2013 over 1.25 million per day at peak and work in multi-server environment which was achieved using the system. \n",

The current process for the measurement involves manual testing at regular intervals. However, tough and remote terrains combined with climate conditions makes the process unreliable and error prone. Errors or delay in action could result in damages to equipment, structure or damage to life and property downstream.\n\nSensor based systems deploy appropriate sensors which stream the data through appropriate connectivity to the control room in real time. This permits the system to generate different types of warnings in real time for officers and suggest necessary action. The system also aids in dissemination of information using public address system to population downstream.\n\nMy role of the system was solution designer migrating the solution from Japan and lead the pre-sales efforts for opportunities in US, Latin America and India. I was also responsible to integrate the solution with partner hardware interface for hydro sensors and consultation to the customer with hydro analysis of the river terrains in India.",
