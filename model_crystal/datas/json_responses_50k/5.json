My qualities lie in having strong analytical and communicative skills, being able to find opportunities and consensus where others only see differences, and being result-driven. I like using my knowledge and skills (connecting, networking, analyses, writing) for socially relevant causes, such as social wellbeing, financial stability and the environment. Variation and room to take initiative I find important. Moreover, I have experience in working in a fast-paced political sensitive context.",
