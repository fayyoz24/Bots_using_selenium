    "summary": "I am an experienced Process Engineering Professional with a demonstrated portfolio of working within the Global Diaspora of the Oil & Gas Industry,  Performance Chemicals, Paper/ Pulp and Research. I am widely regarded as highly skilled at Plant Technical Support , Process Optimization/ Modelling and Troubleshooting your Operating units as well as Process Design (FEED), Plant Commissioning,  and Process Safety.  Learned industry techniques/stds for fire/explosion risk assessments in the oil & gas sector across geographies and have established myself as a future multi-industry expert.\n\nMy knowledge on a wide range of technologies stems from the innate quality of curiosity that has thus far made for an exciting and often quirky engineering career.\n\nI  am a strong engineering professional who holds a Bachelor's Degree  in Chemical Engineering from University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. And, I am unabashedly proud of my heritage and humble beginnings. \n\nWith over 16 years of experience in the engineering and specialist chemical sector and refining in the fields of Plant Technical Support, Troubleshooting, Project management & execution, Process Hazard Analysis, Biochemical Engineering, including Research and Development in the Paper and Pulp Industry.. I realize the field of engineering is a passion I get to live everyday.  I am not done yet. \n\n*Currently employed as a consulting engineer in Front End Design and Process Safety within the Netherlands.  \n\nSpecial Value \u2013 I combine my  strong academic base with natural leadership, analytical and communication skills to help deliver better, quicker, cost effective solutions to business while ensuring the sustained performance of plant, processes and people with respect to safety. A bit of a mouthful. As a quick charismatic thinker, I am  unafraid of new challenges while  I draw energy from working with and developing people into assets to the business.  I am wholly committed to safety, and passionate about  engineering and people.\n\nMy journey has immensely benefited from the guidance of great technical and personal coaches and this has ignited a spark to coaching and mentoring the next generation of engineering leaders in the same way that my life has been the better for. \nMy zest for my profession is part Kaizen, and part stubbornness and a love of MacGyver. \n\nLet's start a dialogue and a revolution where y = mx + c and pi can be firm friends.  \n\nOne molecule at a time",
