    "summary": "Hi, I'm Emma! I was born in Romania and raised in Belgium and Portugal. I am a Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology student at Leiden University, a singer/songwriter, and a Kung Fu student at Fire Dragon Den Haag. As a singer/songwriter, I love engaging with others creatively. Two of my best aptitudes are communication and creative writing. As a Kung Fu student, I learned awareness, balance, consistency, and humility - 4 life skills that have strengthened my work ethic. \n\nPrior to starting university, I worked in a contemporary art gallery in Brussels where I was in charge of management: customer service, art installations, and event planning. I also volunteered as an assistant vocal coach and concert organizer at my high school where I learned leadership by motivating and listening to others. \n\nWhen my mind and body need a little break from discipline, you can find me freestyle dancing, food tasting & cooking, photographing, and playing with animals.",
