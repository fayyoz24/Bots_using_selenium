    "summary": "I am a researcher with 4+ years of experience working in a laboratory setting in multiple scientific disciplines. My primary areas of expertise are microbiology, data analysis (using MATLAB), and scientific writing. I currently provide proofreading, editing, and translation (Hebrew <-> English) services at an academic level for individuals and organizations.\n\nI am organized, thorough, dependable, and meticulous. I learn and adapt quickly to new situations, even under pressure or when unexpected complications arise. I am goal-oriented and have an eye for detail. I like to get invested in what I do, and I do everything with great passion and drive to succeed. Most of all, I strive to provide quality insights and results.\n\nDuring my B.Sc., I finalized and validated the development of a nanoencapsulation technique to protect insulin from the harsh conditions of the stomach during oral delivery to the gut. The project aimed to create a dry component that could be incorporated into baby formula. The results achieved in the limited time and scale of the project were auspicious.\n\nIn my M.Sc., I explored and analyzed the effects that environmental changes have on the growth and interaction of certain bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis) in the context of inflammatory skin disease (atopic dermatitis) to gain insights into the changes that could reverse or prevent exacerbation of the disease. I am currently writing a research article about my results.\n\nI am a team player and enjoy being part of a team; I find that a collaborative working environment often yields synergistic benefits that improve the quality and productivity of one\u2019s output.",

Among other things, I edited scientific reports for startup businesses, scientific publications for research institutions, and theses and research proposals for M.Sc. students and Ph.D. candidates.\n\nThanks to my diverse academic path, I have ample experience working on scientific projects, which helps me get into clients' minds and express their intentions in the best way possible. I am good at building solid scientific arguments that follow logical reasoning while using clear and concise language to convey ideas clearly. I am also good at quickly finding high-quality scientific resources to support my arguments. Furthermore, I am good at identifying potential issues in documents as I review them and am capable of raising questions that could come up during peer review of the article. In other words, I can detect potential pitfalls and help improve documents before they are released or submitted for publication.",

Livney\u2019s Lab of Biopolymers for Food and Health at the faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering. While I was performing a research project as part of a voluntary curriculum requirement, Prof. Livney offered me a temporary position as a research scientist to perform R&D for industrial applications, which I gladly accepted.\n\nThe position entailed incorporating knowledge I had gained in my main research project and translating it into the required application. Specifically, I had to plan and test the incorporation of a treated food preservative into a food product. The goal was to nano-encapsulate the food preservative to reduce its quantity in the final product without reducing the product's shelf life. I mainly developed the platforms and protocols necessary for production, but the process's initial results were promising.\n\nThe position required me to learn and utilize new scientific methods and learn to operate a pilot plant. Additionally, it involved designing experimental procedures (developing and testing new protocols and SOPs), conducting scientific experiments, and writing detailed scientific reports.",
