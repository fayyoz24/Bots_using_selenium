Our pipeline used CellProfiler and Analyst to identify objects in the images and make measurements, and train a classifier model to classify the objects into healthy or fused chromosomes.\n\nOur pipeline successfully identified healthy chromosomes with high accuracy, saving researchers time and increasing accuracy. However, fused chromosomes proved to be more challenging to classify accurately.\n\nThis project contributes to the ongoing research at the NKI on non-homologous end-joining and double-strand breaks in the DNA damage response. Resources used in this project include CellProfiler and Analyst, which are software for automated biological image analysis.",

Designed the architecture to allow input from different sources and to generate output to different output modes.\n\nExtracted data from the Windows Ink API and utilized it to produce feedback in real-time by generating sound and varying its pitch. Also utilized this data to generate statistics and create meaningful graphs to inform about handwriting performance.",
