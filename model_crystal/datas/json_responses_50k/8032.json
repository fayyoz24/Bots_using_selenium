    "summary": "I am very passionate about people, and seeing them reach their full potential. Through years of volunteer work focused on individual  development I have realized that seeing others flourish is both energizing and motivating for me! \n\nI believe in the power of community and team work, that is why I always say \u201cwe are better and stronger together.\u201d I believe everyone has something significant to contribute to the world all it takes is perseverance and someone to believe in them. That is why over the years doing volunteer work with youth and young adults in Brazil, Australia and The Netherlands I have witnessed first hand people pursuing and discovering new passions, stepping out of their comfort zones, and dreaming bigger than they ever thought they could! Witnessing the growth of an individual is a big part of my personal mission and I count it as a privilege to have been able to do that voluntarily and as a staff member at hillsong church in The Netherlands and Sydney! \n\nI am also very passionate  about creativity and the arts! Communication is an art form that I pursue because  I believe the key to good harmony and a good team spirit is good communication. I am also a lover of music, I have had the privilege to study singing during my time in Sydney Australia and today I pursue my hobby by  volunteering with music. \n\nI am looking forward to what the next chapter in life will bring, but I am confident that the best is yet to come!
