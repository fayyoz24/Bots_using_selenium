    "summary": "Hi there, thanks for checking out my page!\n\nI'm a software engineer with a lot of experience in webdevelopment. This includes building simple webpages with Wordpress to great Magento 2 applications with more than 30.000 users.\n\nMy personal interests lie beyond webdevelopement, they broaden my understanding of several languages and frameworks. Such as low level programming simple embedded systems for real life solutions.\n\nI enjoy creating efficient and useful tools for all kinds of applications. In addition, I love to be included in the process of designing and thinking about the architecture. \nTherefore I believe my strengths lie in understanding the requirements for an application and translating these into comprehensive tools.",

This includes setting up the projectmanagement, designing and building the software and designing and implementing of the hardware.\n\nSome of the challenges of the project were the requirement that the robot project would continue for future project groups which meant that everything should build with continuity and modularity in mind. \nAnother difficult aspect was that the robot should resemble BB-8 from the Star Wars universe and that it eventually should run autonomous.",

I worked on this assignment together with two Chinese students and one other Dutch student.\n\nMy main responsibility was to act as a bridge for the communications between the product owner and the team. Further activities included things such as; setting up the development environment, setting up projectmanagement (SCRUM), researching preferred methods, tools and programming language and developing the collaborative risk management system.\n\nOther than the main assignment, I have joined in on multiple cultural exchanges and festivities during my time in China.",
