For a detailed list of courses see the Courses and Certificates section.\nFurthermore, I have studied a lot of online resources like machinelearningmastery.com, Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai), TensorFlow tutorials etc.\n\u2022 Participated in Kaggle competitions for image classification and semantic segmentation that required deep learning and transfer learning techniques\n    Competitions:\n    - Kaggle: UltraMNIST Classification Challenge is about classifying digits in very large-scale images. CNN neural networks were used as an attempt to classify the digits. \n    - Kaggle: HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body is a challenge to help scientists understand the human body at a molecular level. SOTA techniques of semantic segmentation (i.e. U-Nets, Vision Transformers etc.) had to be used in order to achieve high predictive accuracy (https://github.com/theros88/HuBMAP-kaggle). \n\u2022 Built and trained various experimental Machine & Deep Learning models for self-education. An example is a pet\u2019s breed image classifier which shows the complete ML life-cycle from model training to WebApp implementation, containerization and finally deployment to Azure Web Apps (https://github.com/theros88/pet-classifier).\n\u2022 Studied research papers mainly regarding Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Language Modeling, Transformers, Machine Neural Translation, Conditional Computing and Scaling\n\nFrameworks and tools: Python 3.x, fastai, PyTorch, OpenMMLab, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, NumPy, SymPy, Pillow, CUDA, Azure, Docker, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, git, GitHub, Spyder, Sublime Text, LaTeX\nPlatform: Ubuntu Linux 20.04",
