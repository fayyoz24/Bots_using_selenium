    "summary": "I am driven by good vibes. You know the feeling you get from what\u2019s right and what\u2019s beautiful. Call it chemistry, capitation or click. Good vibes tell me what to do. Which ideas to follow, which ideals to strive for. And good vibes tell me what\u2019s great about you. \n\nWith my passion to contribute to better world, I started BRANDOUTLOUD. A creative agency working for brands with a purpose, be it a social venture, conscious corporate or ambitious non-profit. We want brands to look good, sound good and feel good too. With your drive as starting point, we visualise to persuade. Through logos, photography, websites, videos or visual storytelling. In the best way.\n\nHere I combine my academic background with a creative mind, an eye for visuals and a nose for good stories. Add to this, a wealth of expertise having worked in the commercial, educational and health sector in The Netherlands, scientific research in the UK and development sector throughout Africa, Latin-America, Asia and the Pacific. \n\nI am always playful and never without a smile on my face. But dead serious about those good vibes. \nSo let\u2019s share some! Feel free to connect with me or get in touch at judith@brandoutloud.org\n\nMy specialties? Strategy, branding, communications, storytelling, content creation, production, management, global development and much more. :)",
