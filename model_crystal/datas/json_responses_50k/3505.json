    "summary": "It's my strong belief that in a more and more \"projectized\" work environment, cooperation, interdependence and creativity are the pillars on which to build any success, along with humility and the will to understand before to be understood.\nFurthermore, new values have started to have more importance in multinational companies than ever in the past. Same challenges like the environmental one, same knowledge of what means to be part of a bigger community of different people in a \"smaller\" world thanks to technology: these aspects lead to a common base of values trough which we all recognize ourselves, values that can transcend local cultures and beliefs.\nManage changes have become one of the most fundamental assets in any companies for any individual and a continuous development is a key factor nowadays more than in the past. However, there is something that does not change over the time because people are always the real value-added in any organization.\n\nMY SKILLS AND COMPETENCES\n\n-Project management and Finance\n-Change Management and Communication\n-Leading work teams\n-Stakeholders management\n-ERPs implementation\n-Finance process re-engineering\n-Negotiation\n-Knowledge management\n-Trainer\n\n-Diploma and certificates: MBA, CIMA GBS, People Coaching, Change management, SAP ERP e CRM practice, Prince 2 PM approach, LEAN and SIX SIGMA methodologies, CAPM, Agile methodology\n\n-ERPs: SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics Navision, AS400\n\n-Transitions: Europe, Middle East, Caribbean, Africa\n\n-Languages: Italian, English, French, Arabic\n\n-Awards:\nBASE project - Role model 2019\nBASE project - Extra mile delivery 2019\nHeineken SSC - Act as an entrepreneur 2019\nIvory Coast transition - Best trainer 2019\nAppreciation from Head of EMEIA Finance Services - certificate 2016\nCoordination company News letter - Recognition 2015\nLean Idea competition - Winner 2014",
