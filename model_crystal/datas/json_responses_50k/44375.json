For further information on his activities and roles, please see below: \n\n\u2022\tKieran's initial work for Seatech Energy required him to stay in Cape Town, South Africa for 8 months in 2017. Here he was involved in learning and researching the operational procedures for an anaerobic digester. This was an amazing learning experience allowing him to gain a good understanding in the development and installation of this technology in addition to expanding his bio-chemical knowledge of the procedures and parameters that allow certain feedstocks to be converted into Bio-Gas.\n \n\u2022\tAnother project for Seatech Energy allowed him to develop his design and CAD skills through a project engineer role, involving the design and installation of floating platforms for seaweed cultivation in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In addition to the engineering side of the project he was able to work very closely with the project manager and further develop his skills in this area.  \n\n\u2022\tIn addition to the Seatech Energy Projects, Kieran was also involved in designing PCB casing for another company within the group (InCharge). \n\n\u2022\tHis work also lead him to being included in the early stages of a new product for the Oil and Gas Sector of the company (Inrada Oil and Gas) which involved  electrically powered actuators on a fail safe valve.",
