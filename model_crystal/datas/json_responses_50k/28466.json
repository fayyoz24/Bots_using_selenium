    "summary": "My career in IT began in 1996 when I was selected to be a public ambassador for the Enoch Pratt Free Library's \"Whole New World\" program, an initiative to train children on accessing information through the internet. I presented at the American Library Association's 1997 spring and midwinter conferences and was known as the \"Cyberkid\" by the Baltimore Sun. Also, in 1997, I presented a speech at the National Geographic Center, in my hometown of Washington, D.C., about the power of the \"information superhighway.\"\n \n Remember when we used to call it that?\n\nVice President Al Gore proceeded me after I addressed the audience and announced the federal government's \"E-Rate\" program, which provided 2.25 billion dollars to assist schools and libraries in obtaining affordable telecommunications and Internet access. Since then, I have made a commitment to stay up to date with current trends in IT and using my applicable skills for business, creativity and serving my community.",
