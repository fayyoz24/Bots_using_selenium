These are some of the fundamental questions that are explored by the Creative Machines Lab led by Ph.D. Hod Lipson.  The team consists of of ambitious researchers from various disciplines of engineering, such as computer science, physics, math and biology. Seeking biological concepts of engineering and new engineering insights into biology, biology is one of the main inspirations for the lab.\n\nMaster thesis: 'Designing the foodprinter of 2020'.\nSupervised by Ph.D Hod Lipson, this project focussed on developing a new type of kitchen appliance for the year 2020. \n\nIn this project I have accomplished the following: \n\n- Conceptual design covering four levels: product, brand, digital, business innovation\n- Research (expert interviews, company visits, literature)\n- Integrated design (use of air pressure, infra-red heating element, scara-arm pick and place)\n- 1:1 Physical prototype, semi-functioning including scara-arm (product)\n- Concept design for retail system (business innovation)\n- Packaging design and interface (brand)\n- Interface design (digital)\n- Video explaining the concept (brand)\n- Workshops: arranged and led three workshops together with the International Culinary Center (ICC)\n- Workshop project generated media attention (Wallstreet Journal coverage, digital trends, the smithsonian, 60 000 + views Youtube)",
