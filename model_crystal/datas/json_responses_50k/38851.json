            "description": "This book investigates the interrelations between knowledge and entrepreneurship, and their consequences with regard to economic performance. Both knowledge and entrepreneurship are recognized as new twin driving forces for economic growth. Recent\nstudies suggest that neither knowledge nor entrepreneurship alone is sufficient to drive\ngrowth. Investing in new knowledge is only a necessary condition; new knowledge needs\nto be exploited and put into commercial use such that it can lead to higher levels of\ncompetitiveness and economic growth. Entrepreneurship is acknowledged to play an\nimportant role in this process. It is thus essential for economists and policy-makers to understand how knowledge and entrepreneurship relate to each other and why they lead to economic growth. The five empirical chapters included in this book provide new insights into aforementioned issues on the firm- and country-level. Chapter 2 is based on a country-level\nanalysis and identifies the moderating role of entrepreneurship in turning knowledge into\ninnovation, which may ultimately lead to economic growth. Chapters 3 through 5, taking a\nfirm-level perspective, investigate how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\nmanage their knowledge assets (including organization knowledge and human resources)\nto stimulate innovation performance. Chapter 6 pays special attention to the determinants\nof SME growth. The findings of the chapters indicate that entrepreneurship catalyzes the\ntransformation of new knowledge into innovation on the one hand; on the other hand,\nknowledge plays a significant role in stimulating innovation performance and SME growth.",
