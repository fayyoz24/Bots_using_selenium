Currently I am looking for a new job that enables me to apply my talents for a challenging and worthy cause, whether that may be within or outside academia. My main interest are cultural history, art, literature, Scandinavia, but also pressing political issues such as the debates on national identity, the EU and climate change. ",

            "description": "In the European nation-building process, the shifting demarcations and power relations between the states of Northern Europe, and the emergence of a separate ethnolinguistic self-awareneness among Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic groups, has been well studied. The resulting model risks being both finalistic (in that it highlights those processes which were eventually consolidated in state-formation) and competitive-secessionist (in that it highlights processes where ethnic groups opt out of existing states).\n\nA proper intellectual-historical and comparative-macroregional approach should also take intoaccount those processes which, without achieving political consolidation, played a more transnationalrole in cultural mobilization by propounding alternative cultural identities across existing state structures. Besides a widespread Romantic interest in a putative Nordic sea empire involving the shores of North America, the most salient phenomenon is that of Scandinavism. While Scandinavism has been well studied, particularly as a failed political ideal, the current PhD-project aims to thematize Scandinavism as a primarily cultural movement, which, notwithstanding its failure as a political mobilizer, strengthened and extended national consciousness-raising in the various Nordic nationalities by stressing common ethnolinguistic, mythological and historical roots. This cultural vision is to be traced in the \u2018Long 19th Century\u2019 specifically in its cultural presence (as critical discourse and literary activism) and in its interactions and overlaps with the various nationally-specific manifestations of cultural nationalism, following the model of the \u2018cultivation of culture\u2019 developed by the Study Platform on Interlocking Nationalism.\n\nThe project is supervised by prof. dr. Joep Leerssen, prof. dr. Henk van der Liet, dr. Suze van der Poll and dr. Kim Simonsen.",

                    "description": "Scandinavism: Overlapping and Competing Identities in the Nordic World\n\nIn historiography, Scandinavism has usually been portrayed as a political ideology that failed to realize its ideal of a unified Scandinavian state, consisting of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. My research aims to extend this general perception of Nordic pan-nationalism by analyzing it as a primarily cultural movement, for Scandinavism, and its significance for the specific national identities that developed over the course of the nineteenth century, can only be properly understood if one takes its cultural aspects into account. The analysis takes its starting point in the discursive instrumentalisation of Old Norse and medieval mythology and literature. This rich literary heritage was both a source of solidarity between the three 'brother nations' as a probable cause for conflict and competition. As such, Scandinavism strengthened a sense of a shared culture and linguistic and historical roots at the same time as it undermined these sentiments of togetherness. It is the main aim of my research to survey and analyze this interaction between Scandinavism and the various nationally-specific manifestations of cultural nationalism in the 'Long Nineteenth Century' (1789-1914).",
