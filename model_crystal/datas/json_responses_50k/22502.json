    "summary": "I am a deeply curious person highly motivated to use research and collaborative processes to deliver better programs and design solutions to the complex problems of today. Trained as an anthropologist (PhD), I approach problems in a holistic yet practical way with an attention to changing demands of their contexts. My first experiences in project management were with individual and collaborative research projects, which helped me cultivate skills that I have applied more broadly today: engaging with stakeholders to identify and understand their problems, designing and conducting research, synthesizing findings, communicating them to different audiences, and translating them into project plans and new solutions. What drives me is an intense curiosity about people's worlds and the \"backstage\" of different processes as well as a desire to make meaningful contributions to their lives. \n\nA holistic, deeply analytical, and practical approach to understanding social issues have long been at the core of my personal philosophy and training. I love initiating collaborations where everyone gets to bring their strengths and creativity. Working with different target groups, from refugees, older adults, or academics, I seek to cultivate a good rapport and to stay open to new ways of thinking about their problems. Most importantly, I seek to find ways to bring empathy and understanding into the work that I do.\n\nSkills:\n\nProject Management: I have experience securing funding for and leading large European-funded programs (Horizon Europe, Erasmus+) within and across countries. I am skilled in process planning; overseeing day-to-day operations; training and mentoring staff; overseeing data collection, translation, and analysis; collaborating with large teams; and presenting results to stakeholders.\n\nQualitative Research: I have conducted hundreds of semi-structured and structured interviews and focus groups for individual and collaborative research projects, many in sensitive and challenging contexts (Flint water crisis; Chad-Cameroon borderlands). \n\nTraining and mentorship: I have trained students to use qualitative research methods, including interviewing, ethnographic methods, and analysis. I have taught interdisciplinary courses at the university level and mentored undergraduate and graduate students.",
