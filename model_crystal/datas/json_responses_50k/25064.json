    "summary": "Passionate and result driven communication professional with over 12 years of experience in PR, Marketing Events and Tourism. After studying tourism management, I worked in the travel industry for several years where I gained extensive in-depth knowledge of all elements related to PR and Marketing,  Destination and Event management and the implementation of successful trade, sales & marketing strategies. \n\nI travelled all over the world for a wellness tour operator to source and market spas and cure resorts and did flash sales for an international tour operator for four- and five-star hotels and package holidays where I was specialised in long-haul sales. \n\nAfter that I started to work for an international PR & Marketing agency where I did projects and full representation for clients such as the European Commission, Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority, Singapore Tourism Board, Croatian National Tourist Board, Estonian Tourist Board and many more. My speciality is developing creative campaigns to increase brand visibility and awareness in the Benelux market with the main objective of boosting sales.",
