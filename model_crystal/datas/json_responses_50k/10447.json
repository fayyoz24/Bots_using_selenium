This is program which makes it possible to run multibody simulations. In this case I had to make a model of the concept car and run simulations with the model. With such a simulation all the forces in each individual part of the front- and rearsuspension can be measured.",

My task was therefore to calculate the chain forces which secures the truck on the trailer. Loose components are also transported over the road, for these components I calculated the best way to secure the load to the trailer. For every truck and component I wrote a manual for the truck drivers for how to secure the load.",

Our contractors education mission was to build the school itself, IT education had decided to deliver all the equipment in order to educate the children over there about IT etc. \n\nWe, as the automotive mechanic department, had the idea to search for sponsors who were willing to sponsor goods, vehicles and/or money.\nIn the end we had 4 vans (3x VW LT and 1x VW Transporter) and 1 jeep. the LT vans were supposed to be converted into school buses so we added windows in the back and made some benches for the children to sit on. The VW transporter was for another charity institution and the jeep was for a woman who was driving to all the local schools to give sexual education.\n\nWhen all the preparations were done in the Netherlands we took off for our journey with 17 people and 5 vehicles of two weeks through the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal and finally The Gambia. At the end we delivered the vehicles and heading back to the Netherlands by plane\n"
