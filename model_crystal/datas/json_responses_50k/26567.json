I was doing physics and math with sparkling eyes, and society promised me a bright future. \n\nBut the light of this spark is no match for a star \u2014 and my starlight is my passion for creating. Every time I discover an amazing new world in a game \u2014 HoMM, WoW, Witcher, Destiny, Ori, and many others  \u2014 I feel like I want to make as many awesome games as possible. That is my dream.\n\nOne day I wondered: \u201cWhy do I do my favorite activity after everyday work when I can do it all the time?\u201d Since then I\u2019ve been in the gaming industry for over 5 years I have discovered the following about myself.\n\nMy scientific background and hobbies allow me to combine complex activities:\n- Math and art  \u2014 I can create advanced monetization and game balance models as well as drive my creative ideas to delivery\n- Narrative and game design  \u2014 I can develop innovative features and memorable narrative content\n- Old and new game design schools  \u2014 I can work with different types of target audience.\n\nI educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person:\n- I am constantly learning because I never settle\n- I stay calm when faced with adversity\n- I focus heavily on results but also enjoy the process.\n\nPeople love working with me because:\n- I am patient, polite, and considerate with solid teamwork skills\n- I am generous when it comes to sharing experiences\n- I enjoy learning as well as teaching and mentoring.\n\nI am great at social connections, teamwork, and strategy-making. In my opinion, it\u2019s essential because great achievements are made in close-knit teams. I am happy to share my knowledge and become a part of a new team. Feel free to contact me.",
