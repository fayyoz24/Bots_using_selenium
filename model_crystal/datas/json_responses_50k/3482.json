As Team Lead I was helping the teams in working with other teams to achieve the goals and mission of the Jumbo organization. \nNext to that I focused on Portfolio Management to prepare our quarterly goals, Agile coaching and my HR responsibility for the people in my teams. Because of the transition of Jumbo towards more internal knowledge I also had the responsibility to hire new colleagues. All activities have of course been in close collaboration with other Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Team Leads and other teams.",
