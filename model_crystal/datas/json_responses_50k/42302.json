    "summary": "An essential aspect of making the sustainable transition of food system smooth is to involve the consumers and have them enjoy the process. For this reason, I'm excited about improving the sensory experience of sustainable foods in a data-driven way. I would be thrilled if one day, someone would unwind themselves before or after a long day work by having a delightful bite of green foods that I contribute to.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m looking for a job in sensory and consumer science field to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge of data science, behavioral science and food technology.",
