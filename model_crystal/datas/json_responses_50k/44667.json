Human Trafficking & Child Labor were the topics of choice, and were added as a layer on top of the regular gameplay for the mod design.The goal of the mod is to provide an open ended gameplay in which we explore and demonstrate the positive and negative impact based on the player's decisions. Additionally, a social design concept was proposed with the means of intertwining the social world of co-creation and video games, and to explain how it all connects back to the real-world through a Map Generation Web Service that allow both players and non-players to be able to generate meaningful content.",

            "description": "Difficulty learning math is a common and known problem among children throughout the ages. The way of teaching and learning math has remained relatively the same in education. However, with the rise of portable devices; tablets and smart-phones, and motion-sensing controller such as the Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo WiiMote and the Playstation Move, people have shown huge interested and motivation to develop new and interactive methods for teaching. Being inspired by this trend, we created an interactive, gesture-controlled arithmetic math game, Xdigit, using the Kinect to enhance and support math learning experiences for children. Xdigit is a challenging, fun and interactive space themed math Kinect-game, where the player has the objective to combine numbers through arithmetic operations to match the target number before the timer runs out. The game comes in various levels of difficulties to provide challenges and interesting mathematical opportunities by increasing the arithmetic complexity.\n\nXdigit won 3rd Place at the Student Game Competition, Fun and Games 2012 Conference in Toulouse, France and was showcased at the 1st Games For Change Conference in Melbourne, Australia",

Simulations utilizing EEG headsets, head-mounted displays, real-time video processing, and more will allow guests to gain first-hand experience of the mental and physical challenges of using implants and to learn more about both the current and future technologies involved.  This union of medical science with media technology will hopefully educate and inspire the researchers as well as policy-makers of this generation and beyond.",
