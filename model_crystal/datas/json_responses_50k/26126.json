The use of remote sensing techniques has become increasingly popular during the past three decades since these remote techniques are non-intrusive, easily, and safely deployed. \n\nDuring this research I successfully deployed a 3D laser scanning technique to acquire wave characteristics for studying the inner-surf and swash hydrodynamics. I was able to perform the measurements during a one-week fieldwork trip to the Sand Engine, together with nine other students. \n\nThe developed software (in MATLAB), used to transform and analyze the data, can be found over here: https://github.com/CTaaban/Lagun-EX.git",

Ph. van Vledder I performed a research study to get more insight into the physics of wave transmission over submerged dams.

The wave transmission in the empirical relationship is simplified since the dam is represented as an infinitely thin line (\u2018Line-model\u2019), whereas the spatial characteristics of the dam are taken into account in the 1D Grid-model. \n\nDuring this study, I was able to implement my newly acquired software design knowledge. Software has been developed to automate the process of initiating the vast amount of simulation runs and to invoke and analyze the data. \n\nThe SWAN model and developed software (Matlab) can be accessed over here: https://github.com/CTaaban/BEP.

Using a biogeomorphic model (Delft3D-FM), an interesting result has been found showing that seagrass meadows and coral reefs form a synergy, in which the stabilization of sediments provided by the individual ecosystems is facilitated, reinforced, and complemented by the proximate presence of the other ecosystem.\n\nPerformed an extensive sensitivity analyses to find bugs in proprietary software; detected and\nresolved software technical errors in close collaboration with the Delft3D-FM development\nteam, results incorporated to improve the recent version of Delft3D-FM.",
