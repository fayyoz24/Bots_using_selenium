    "summary": "Never a dull moment in this crazy freelance life. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\nI'm proudly entering into my tenth year of collaboration with TNO. As always, they challenge me with unimaginable innovations and technological advancements that boggle the mind and beg for clear, compelling copy.\n\nSo grateful for long-standing, loyal clients like NN Group and Schiphol, who regularly call on my help for everything from intranet articles to press releases to newsletters to campaigns and more.\n\nSome amazing agencies make me feel like I have colleagues, which is the best feeling in the world for a ZZP'er. I'm looking at you, Studio Oostrum, Tekstwerf and Proof. And I absolutely can't forget The Oval Office. We work with some of the big boys like Google and Randstad, and ensure we have a blast while we do it. \n\nIt was my sincere honor to help Gea Sijpkes bring her vision of Humanising Care to the Humanitas Deventer workbook. Ever heard of a nursing home where residents play beer pong and chase each other through the halls, screaming with laughter? It happens at Humanitas Deventer. I saw it with my own eyes. And I got to write all about it.\n\nFrom creating web copy for Incentro to supporting marketing efforts at funda and the brand-new company Biller, my client list is a Who\u2019s Who of some of the best and brightest brands in the Netherlands. And it\u2019s the reason I go to work with a smile on my face every single day.",
