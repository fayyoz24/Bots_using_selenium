    "summary": "Ever since I was a young girl I was always busy with my mom\u2019s wardrobe and her beauty case. More than once I came down the stairs in her wedding dress with red lipstick all over my face (and dress). That moment my mom already knew that my future would be in fashion and cosmetics.\n\nAfter my study Fashion Management I did courses in Online Marketing to step into the digital world. After this I started my own business in social media, I advised small retailers how to behave on social media. Because I wanted to learn more from the best I started working for fashion brands and a webshop. I like being in contact with customers, retailers, suppliers and most of all: colleagues. After working for Gaastra, McGregor and Miinto I switched to cosmetics and started for MOOI Parfumerie. I followed my passion for beauty and marketing. Here I focus on what I like to do, thinking of and implementing new strategies and campaigns which make us stand out from others. Doing this in a great team, in an ambitious organisation and in beauty is what makes me happy!\n\nKey words: \u2605 Fashion and luxury goods \u2605 Cosmetics and perfumery \u2605 Marketing strategy and consulting \u2605 Social media and webshop \u2605 Creative and social \u2605 Key Account Management \u2605 Wholesale and retail",

At Miinto it was my responsibility to manage the relationships with over 200 boutiques and brands. In this role I analyzed results and trained and motivated boutique owners to work on their activities on Miinto and together we set up online sales strategies. The improvement of B2B and CRM processes and boutique engagement was also part of my role. The execution of all B2B communication, mailings, (marketing) campaigns and events were my responsibility.
