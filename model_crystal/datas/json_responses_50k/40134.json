    "summary": "Johanneke Procee graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven\u2019s design department Man and Living. In 2011 Johanneke started working as a freelance designer from Tel Aviv, Israel, where she also completed a ceramics course at the Benyamini School of Ceramic Art. Upon returning to the Netherlands, Johanneke worked as an in-house product designer at fashion brand Oilily for several years before working independently as a multifaceted creative. Her product design background has strongly influenced her approach to design as she seeks to balance form, material and tactility. Conceptual and intuitive, her minimalistic style champions attention to detail and a strong aesthetic. Over the years, her work has shifted in focus from product and interior design to more graphic work, visual design, styling and photography. Johanneke is an all-round creative who enjoys working on conceptual projects as well as practical, commercial designs.",

This groundbreaking new vision of children\u2019s wear resulted in a spectacular and vibrant style nobody had ever seen before. The success of the children\u2019s wear collection sparked the launch of Oilily's first women\u2019s wear collection in 1986. Since then, Oilily has been a hallmark of creativity in the wardrobe of both women and children.",
