    "summary": "I bring my aggregated experience to the table in every role I play. My career has evolved alongside the telco, media, and technology sectors. A persistent interest in learning and being open to new challenges has led to a variety of roles and opportunities that have allowed me to work internationally while expanding my capabilities.\n\nWherever I've worked and in whatever capacity, I continue to enhance my ability to influence and lead others. I take a collaborative approach to any project, trying to understand what motivates others while building alignment toward my own goals. I've always had an interest in how taking a wider view can reveal pragmatic solutions. My leadership style reflects a cooperative approach balanced with a tenacity that sometimes surprises others.\n\nMy goal is to be involved in companies and projects that require change. Change is exciting but it can also be hard. I want to engage with people who, like me, can figure out how to make things happen and get the job done.\n",
