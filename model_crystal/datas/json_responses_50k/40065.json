    "summary": "\u2726 WHO AM I? \nI began as a legal professional, took a slight detour from the legal lane to work in hospitality, non-profit, and now as Relation Manager at the Hotel Management School in Maastricht. It is no accident that I've always worked in intercultural environments. It\u2019s central to who I am and what I\u2019m best at: connecting, inspiring trust, and helping others. \n\n\u2726 WHAT RECOMMENDS ME? \n-My excellent people skills. I have experience in working with people from a range of industries: legal, hospitality, non-profit and education. I worked directly with clients in a consultancy law firm, I served customers while working in a 5* hotel and I contributed to the work of an international women\u2019s rights NGO. \n\n-My resourcefulness and self-discipline. I worked from home for a year and a half. This meant two things: 1. I quickly developed my problem-solving skills and my ability to deliver results with minimal directions. 2. I learned to effectively communicate the results of my work clearly and comprehensively. \n\n-My intercultural competency. Yes, I have a certificate, but if that doesn\u2019t convince you, I was also a Master Coach at the end of my studies for 20 international newcomers, each with a different cultural background and tens of 'why's and 'where's. \n\n-My \u2018language set\u2019. I speak four languages fluently (Romanian, English, Spanish, French) and I understand Italian and Dutch.   \n\n-My adaptability and fast-learning capacity. I have lived and worked in three different countries (the Netherlands, the US, Romania) and I gave up my comfort zone back home in exchange for cultural diversity, challenging professional opportunities and internationally-oriented environments. Diversity does not discourage me - I thrive in it.\n\n\u2726 GET IN TOUCH\n\u2709 delia.grigoras@zuyd.nl",
