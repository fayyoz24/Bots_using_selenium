            "description": "In this paper, we are focusing our analysis in the Sabre Insurance Group PLC and its exposure to climate change risks. Climate change  exposure poses a higher risk of  insured assets being damaged  from extreme natural phenomena which  affects the amount of compensation an insurance company will have to pay out. Sabre Insurance Group has entered the investigation process in order to quantify the impact of the phenomenon on its activities, which is expected to be completed in the coming years. It is essential to address these issues  both for the company  and their clients in ensuring progress towards sustainable development. In particular, the company acknowledges that the risks associated with climate change can have a significant impact on its clients (Sabre Insurance Group plc Annual report, 2019). The natural hazards due to climate change are classified into two categories: acute hazards, and chronic hazards. Acute natural hazards are related mainly with catastrophic events such as floods, fires, and heat waves. In other words, are events that we can see their impact in the environment immediately after they occur. Chronic natural hazards are associated with long-term climate change, such as the rising of the sea levels. In addition an increase in the frequency, severity or even the duration of severe weather events such as storms, droughts and floods is considered  chronic natural hazards. This report focuses qualitatively on the risks associated with flooding, windstorms, hailstorms and ice storms. The quantitative portion involves calculations of Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall using both historical simulation and a Weight Scheme Approach, and a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation.",

We also examine the existence of the presidential cycle theory effect and the impact of capital controls. To measure these effects, we use a simple linear regression model, including an interaction term using 371 monthly observations. We find that when a left-wing party is in office, the stock market returns are lower than those of the right-wing party. Moreover, we find evidence supporting the existence of the presidential cycle theory effect when a left-wing party is in office. There is no evidence supporting that the existence of capital controls decrease the stock market returns in Greece.\n",

The research in this paper focuses on observing the monthly averaged price histories of indices for Canada, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. This 20-year observation window begins in January 1999 and ends in December 2018 and generates 240 observations per country.\nThe methodological approach in this paper replies to the model of Bouman and Jacobsen (2002), explaining the stock market return rt (dependent variable) of a period by a seasonal binary dummy variable St (independent variable) with the coefficient 1. The results after plugging the data into the robust regression model were statistically significant on a 10%-level for 5 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan). This is compatible with the results from Bouman and Jacobsen ( 2002).",
