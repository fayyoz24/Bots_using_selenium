He improved his communication style as well learned to recognize different communication styles of other team members. Tim can handle ups and downs in a project well, has learned to be self-directed in a new field of expertise and gained experience with technical management.\n\nIn short, the fact that Tim has successfully combined the two-year program at the Honors Academy with his regular bachelor program at the Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, shows that he is an excellent and motivated student. I am delighted to recommend Tim for your program.\"",

This was done by writing code in C++ that worked together with the libaries offered by Barrett. The result was a well working and stable robot where the user can interact by holding the endpoint of the robot. The user then feels either a repulsive or an attractive field, which offer opportunities for rehabilitation purposes.",
