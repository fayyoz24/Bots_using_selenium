    "summary": "I am a Masters student of Strategic Management at Erasmus University Rotterdam. Areas of my career interest include economy and management, with a particular interest in strategy.\n\nAs the 21st century is constantly bringing up new challenges, it has become apparent to me, that finding the way of constant growth is the key to success. In my current professional and personal development I\u00a0try to rely on my two strongest skills: deep understanding of maths and analytics as well as perceiving people\u2019s needs. This holistic approach enables me to make use of both soft and hard skills every day. Despite my young age, I have already gained my first professional experience. Moreover, I have chosen to study abroad as I know my future goals clearly.\n\nIn following years I would like to focus on gaining new skills, personal development and getting to know the world and people. I am aware of the necessity of understanding yourself and setting clearly defined goals.\n\nI am open to participation in meetings and conferences related to my business interests as well as engaging myself into various projects.",
