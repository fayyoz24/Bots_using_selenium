    "summary": "When it comes to design and efficiency, I appreciate every little detail about a beautifully crafted system.\n\nMy day starts with a freshly ground cup of coffee and a to-do list that is focused on helping other entrepreneurs scale their businesses by enhancing their digital presence and streamlining their sales & marketing efforts. \n\nAs a hobby at school, I have been helping other teenagers interested in the digital world to build their websites or blogs and increase their authority through design. Later on, my marketing passion has been sparked by some of the novels of Frederic Beigbeder*.\n\nI always knew that I will become an entrepreneur no matter how much time and effort it would cost me. That's why I graduated from the most entrepreneurial university in the Netherlands - the University of Twente.\n\nNow, I am the creative director of an innovative digital marketing agency - Wizflows - which creates marketing systems that skyrocket your business. \n\nThat may sound a bit boring and corporate... so let me give you a real-life example. Last year, I created a flow that tripled my income in just one month.\n\nSounds like magic, right? That's why now I want to help other entrepreneurs with my team to increase their revenue and release them from performing boring repetitive tasks such as follow-ups and lead generation.\n\nIf you want to gain more time and freedom from your business, I would love to give you some free tips or pointers on how you could increase your revenue without spending endless hours on bringing new customers or following up with your lost leads.\n\nSend me a message, or check out my website.\n\n>> www.wizflows.com\n\n* Was 9.99, Now 6.99 is a great novel that even after 20 years, is still valid - highly recommend.",
