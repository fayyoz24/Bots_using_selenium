    "summary": "All-round urbanist with a diverse range of expertise in teaching, researching and practising in the fields of architecture and urban planning. I view city-making through a holistic lens in order to make sense of how morphological, sensorial and technological forces shape socio-spatial conditions over time. \n\nBoth my practice and academic projects explore new frameworks for grasping how people, spaces, affects, networks, and machines are entangled together to co-produce the marvellous tapestry of local and planetary urban patterns. Contemplating these interdependent nexuses, I search for instances and interval spaces that galvanize the HOPE for more just, livable and happy futures for cities. What sets my creative engines on fire is being part of projects that cultivate these bright futures through concrete experiments with the present possibilities...\n\nCurrently, my curiosity is geared towards exploring the diverse urban cultures that manifest in everyday life in both the physical and virtual public space. The continuous flow between habitual and novel spatio-temporal patterns in such hybrid spaces makes them exciting laboratories for experimenting with the self-organizing faces of cities:\n- Why understanding the rhythms of urban self-organization matters to city-makers? \n- Which public spaces foster healthy social relations between people, now and in the future? \n- Which socio-spatial conditions enable people to carve out creative and productive forms of collective action? \n- How can virtual spaces enhance the quality of life and social welfare in physical spaces?\n- How to equip progressive city-makers with tools, theories and methods in order to recognize, create and nurture spaces that hold such potentials?\n\nMy aspiration for the next career adventure is to engage in projects uncovering new synergies between public spaces, public pedagogy and media studies.\n\nDo you have any suggestion, advice, or related aspiration? \n\nIf YES, then please get in touch - maybe we are meant to co-create something amazing...",
