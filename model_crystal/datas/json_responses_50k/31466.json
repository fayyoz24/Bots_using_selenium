    "summary": "Global marketing leader with 15 years experience both client & agency side in best-in-class sports, broadcast and creative businesses. I am currently VP of Global Partnerships at Race Service, where I lead the agency's relationships with global clients outside of the US.\n\nPrior to Race Service, I led Brand Marketing initiatives at Formula 1 for 3 years, overseeing a significant period of growth and transformation for the sport under Liberty Media, after 3 years overseeing ITV Sport's marketing output, culminating in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I honed my skills as an Account Manager in advertising agencies and spent 6 years working at some of London's finest agencies: BBH and Wieden+Kennedy, where I led client relationships with global brands including Nike, Google and Diageo. Those experiences; combined with a unique international background that has seen me live, study & work outside of my native France since 2005, in cities ranging from Barcelona, Geneva, London and now Amsterdam; provide me with a unique outlook on global brand building & creative strategy.",

To do so, I partnered with film director Klaus Thymann and agency Melhor Communica\u00e7ao to create a 3 mins film documentary, a new website for the NGO, and a poster campaign across Recife, all in just a month time in Brazil.\n\nFundraising was an essential part of the project and so I created City of Good (www.cityofgood.me), a platform that saw some of our industry's best talents offering their time, talents and passions in some thrilling lotteries. Wine tasting with John Hegarty, mentorship from Nigel Bogle or copywriting lessons from David Kolbusz were some of them. I also curated thanks to friends and clients some great prizes to auction, including a Usain Bolt signed jersey, a sailing trip to Croatia and a JW Director's Blend bottle. All in all, the platform helped me raise \u00a312,000 for the project which is the biggest fundraising ever done to date on T.I.E.\n\nLast but not least, I also organised a joint BBH & WK fundraising T.I.E. party in Shoreditch which sold 220 tickets and featured a live showcase from Danish artist M\u00d8 (at the time when she was up and coming, well before hitting a BILLION plays on Spotify with Major Lazer...) to thank people for their support and raise more money and awareness to the project.",
