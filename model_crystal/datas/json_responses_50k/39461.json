    "summary": "     In The Lord of the Rings, the wizard Gandalf writes, in a letter to the young hobbit, Frodo Baggins: All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. This advice holds true in education perhaps more than in some professions. Contrary to the belief of those who do not understand the profession, teachers are both born and made. The best teachers are naturals who then invest in learning pedagogy, and who, through this process, become innovative synthesists. The great teacher is someone who naturally loves his or her fellow human beings. When I was finishing my bachelor I already knew that I was too much into the craft of teaching. I knew that I liked helping children develop their knowledge so that they can go on in life and be responsible and productive members of society. I knew that I wanted to contribute to the society and be close to the youngest generation, which  represents the future and the direction that society will take.  Entering a classroom and watching the smiley faces of my students makes me feel complete. The last 10 years my passion is to help students to cope with their difficulties, build their self esteem and most important to enjoy the learning procedure. During my third master I realized that also research plays an important role in education.As a student, teacher, or administrator, consider how many times you have heard, \u201cevidence-based practice\u201d or \u201caccording to the research. It seems that every new idea in education is research-based. In an increasingly data-driven society, it is vital that educators know how to locate, find, and interpret research on their own. I feel lucky that my educational background combines theory and research. Reach out if you want to talk about children, teaching methods, innovation and research in education.",
