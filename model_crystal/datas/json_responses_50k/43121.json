Not more. Therefore we keep things simple, clear, and straight forward. Speed and stability have therefore highest priority.\n- Fostering trust: We don't want our merchant's customers to feel insecure and abort a transaction. Therefore, we aim to provide full transparency of what is going on as well as provide all the information that they need in case they need to make a decision or take action.\n- Payments for everybody: Accessibility and inclusive design play for us an important role we strive to enable our merchants to accept payments from all their customers from young to old, in any physical and mental state, of any ethnicity or background.\n\nThis effort was executed in parallel with other projects leveraging development work that had to be done anyways as well as a few directed efforts. Next to optimizing the UI for a good performance and experience we also increased the scalability of the UI and our solution with future expansion in mind.\n\nMy role was to drive the effort for the UI optimization in close alignment with our Product team, applying our UX patterns and design language consistently throughout our transaction flows as well as managing the UI implementation and release process.\n\nThis will be a continuous effort for our In-Person Payments tribe for the life-time of this platform.",

The UI includes all transaction related but also operational flows and functionalities.\n\nI was responsible for setting up the Design system and designing a majority of the different screens and flows for each UI variant. Furthermore, I actively advocated for and helped to improve the UI development, QA and release process.\n\nTeam: Collaboration with frontend and C developers\n\nResult: 7+ models successful released. Currently +100k devices deployed in more than 40 countries and counting\u2026\n\nExpansion, optimization, improvements and maintenance are an ongoing shared effort.",
