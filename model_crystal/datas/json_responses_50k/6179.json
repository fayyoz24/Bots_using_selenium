The skills I developed were teaching and organisation as I ran a coding club in conjunction with my computing teacher aimed at introducing younger students to programming in Python and using a Raspberry Pi. In a group of five people we undertook our expedition in the Lake District investigating litter along popular walking routes. After the expedition we presented our findings to our assessor and other Explorer Scouts.",

As part of the environmental requirement I worked as part of a team to produce a raft for terns at a local nature reserve and I implemented a recycling program on a summer camp. I completed the values section by researching my family history at the point of World War One and then visited the battlefields in Flanders. ",
