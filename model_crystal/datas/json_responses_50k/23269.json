    "summary": "Sukanya has University Masters degree in Microbiology & Microbial technology. She is an experienced researcher and has worked as PhD Research Fellow in the area of Microbiology and enzyme technology for a period of 3 years. The role was responsible for Isolation and characterization of microbes in specific hypersaline environment. Purification, characterization and extraction of biotechnologically important enzymes were also part of the research. During this period she was part of several inter disciplinary collaborative research work which has been published in six International journals. Sukanya also worked as a trainee in a cancer biology project for a short term where she gained experience in mammalian cell culture and FACS. She also served as a trainee in a pharmaceutical company for a short period during her University study where she learnt the various upstream and downstream processes and the use of chromatography, microbial culture techniques to quality control the products. \nCurrently she aims to be a part of result oriented research project team which will provide her a greater platform and exposure to explore, contribute and demonstrate her knowledge in Microbiological and Cell biological domain.
