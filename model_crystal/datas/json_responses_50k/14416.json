    "summary": "I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU Delft. I am also the co-director of the Centre for Urban Science (CUSP), a member of the Delta Urbanism Interdisciplinary Research Program, and a member of the Climate Action Program at TU Delft.\n\nI do what I like most: I collaborate with people across disciplines and sectors to build a fair and sustainable world. To address the challenges we face today, I am betting on unconventional and diverse collaborations. Why? Because \"leaving no one behind\" requires a systemic understanding of how complex systems are connected: housing, energy, food, waste, transportation, water. When it comes to climate change (justice!), understanding the whole system becomes an even greater challenge. I believe that diversity and transdisciplinary collaboration are key to tackling this challenge.\n\nThe research topics I am interested in include urban inequalities & spatial justice, climate change adaptation & urban resilience, energy transition, housing & building renovation, public participation & citizen empowerment, and related planning and policy implications. I look at these questions from a socio-spatial intersectional perspective, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods.",

Citizen Voice is a digital survey tool based on geographical information systems (GIS). The focus of Citizen Voice is on digital participatory mapping, enabling the collection of spatial data directly from citizens. An important aspect of the development of Citizen Tool is a user-friendly interface with focus on data visualisation. This characteristic is key for an effective communication with decision makers as well as communities, creating opportunities for dialogue, joint analysis, debate, and deliberative process.",

Examples of such products are already on the market, but the ambition to customise the manufacture for the specific dimensions in the construction industry is new and caters to the growing market for renovation and reducing the energy consumption of homes and buildings in answer to public policy.\nThe project will be led by Solliance, the public-private cooperation between companies and knowledge institutes focused on the development of thin film solar cells. Other centres involved are the Netherlands SEAC, the independent centre for the application of solar-energy systems and the Flemish EnergyVille, the energy centre for sustainable energy and intelligent energy systems. Within the consortium TNO acts as project coordinator; other participating research entities include ECN, imec, Holst Centre, ForschungsZentrum J\u00fclich, the universities of Eindhoven, Hasselt and Leuven, and ZUYD.",
