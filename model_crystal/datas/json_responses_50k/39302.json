This was one of the leading Physiotherapy practices in Amsterdam at that time and they worked with professional top sportsmen as well on national- as international level. Charles travelled with Richard all over Europe to help individual sportsmen and Professional Football Organizations with their requests on physical level. In a few years they had a very large international network. From 1988 Charles was responsible for education and quality, inside the Richard Smith group. After 8 years of collaboration with Richard Smith, Charles left in 1992 the company to start a new company named \"J&C SportsRehab\".",

Our idea at that time was: the better the Basic Athletic Capacity of the individual player is, the better the Recovering Capacity is and the sooner the injured player can return in the field. So besides the Football (soccer) Skills we worked on the Athletic Skills. \nIn 1987 Sven Goran Erikson went to AS FIORENTINA, Charles could go with him but decided to come back to Holland to improve his skills on Sports Management Level.",
