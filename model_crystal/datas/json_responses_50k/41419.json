    "summary": "I am a farming systems expert, focusing on sustainability management in smallholder farming systems, with over six years experience in East Africa and currently based in Kampala, Uganda. I am an analytical thinker with special interest on how smallholder farmers can be supported in sustainably intensifying their farming system and obtaining a decent income. I have detailed experience in sustainability and indicator assessments such as living income benchmarking and environmental indicator assessments in smallholder farming systems. I also have extensive experience in setting up co-learning programs with farmers and developing (agronomic) advise to farmers, using our scientific knowledge and understanding.",

These methodologies are used by our country teams to collect data for reporting to customers and to better target new projects for improving the sustainability of our supply chains.\n\nMoreover, I am supporting project design and implementation of projects that aim to improve smallholder farmers' income and sustainability performance of our supply chains. These projects focus on taking away current bottlenecks for farmers to for instance increase their coffee yields and/or quality, and ultimately, improve farmer income.",

The aim of the approach was to facilitate sustainable intensification and thereby to increase crop yields and household income of smallholder farmers. During the five seasons of the programme most households became maize self-sufficient as yields doubled or tripled. Provision of input vouchers each season allowed farmers to invest in technology such as seeds, fertilizer and other inputs. Yet due to small farm sizes most households were not able to earn a \u2018living income\u2019 despite the large increases in yields. Co-learning proved key to facilitate the complex changes in the cropping system that are required for sustainable intensification, such as the incorporation of legumes. Building on the finding that farm size limited farmer income, we developed a novel benchmark of the \u2018viable farm size\u2019: the cultivated area required to attain a living income from arable farming. With current yields, farm sizes would have to be 1.3-4.5 times larger to attain a living income. By contrast, most households could attain a living income with their current farm size if they could increase their crop yields. This thesis underscored the need for large changes within and outside the farming sector to sustainably increase yields and farmer incomes, while ensuring no one is left behind.",

Based on a rapid farm characterization survey (125 households), a farm typology of in total five farm types (four in each location) was constructed. For each farm type four households were randomly selected (32 in total) for a detailed farm characterization (socio-economic information, measured field sizes and yields). Opportunities and constrains for climbing bean cultivation were explored for the different farm types. The main findings were that climbing bean cultivation and yields did only partly differ for different farm types. Poor soil fertility and pests(rats) were the main cause for poor yields in the south-western highlands. Intercropping climbing bean in coffee-banana systems and a lack of knowledge on climbing bean cultivation resulted in low yields in the eastern highlands. Currently this knowledge is used to develop and target options for improved climbing bean cultivation in both areas within the N2Africa project.",
