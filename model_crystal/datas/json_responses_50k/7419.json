    "summary": "Hello!\n\nMy name is Shawn! I am an American who has been living here in the Netherlands for 13 years now. I have experience working in various fields, many of which I believe share transferable skills that would be perfect for the position I am applying for. I believe these experiences have taught me invaluable lessons about professionalism, communicating and working well with others in a team environment, and giving me the perspective to apply those experiences to whatever new position I might find myself in.\n\nFor the past number of years, I have been working on my own as a freelance director, editor, and videographer, along with my father\u2019s beverage company. My father decided to retire at the beginning of the year, and while I have enjoyed the freedom and creativity working for myself as a content creator, I am in need of a change. Thanks to Covid-19 throwing a large wrench into the business of music and live entertainment, I have found the need for a career with more stability. I have a 13-year-old son, along with a fianc\u00e9e. The volatility of being freelance in a post-Covid world, along with the safety net of working with my father being removed, I need work that I can depend on. I am confident with my experience in both life and work I can be a strong asset to any team that I join.\n\nI like to think am a very hard worker who always gives maximum effort. Being an editor requires you to be exceptionally organized, have the ability use different complicated technical programs to be creative, and use communication skills to interface with colleagues and clients. Even when working alone video and content creation remains a very collaborative effort.  I take pride in those skills and my ability to problem solve and adapt to any situation put in front of me. I get along very well with other people, and always try to have a smile and enjoy my work. When spending so much of your life with clients and colleagues I think it is especially important to be friendly, kind, and respectful.\n\nI am extremely proficient with many computer programs and systems. I am a very quick learner, particularly with technology, and haven\u2019t found a computer program I can\u2019t master. I can work with everything from simple word processing programs to more complex video editing or music recording software, as well as things such as customer service solutions and inventory management. If there is a program for it, I either know how to use it or will master it in short manner.\n\nThank you for reading!",
