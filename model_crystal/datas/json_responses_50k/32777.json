    "summary": "Hello! \nI am an Industrial Design Engineer, Researcher, Design and Innovation Strategist, and an Architect. I recently graduated from TU Delft  (Delft University of Technology, Europe), by working on a collaborative graduation thesis project between Stanford University School of Mechanical Engineering (San Francisco, USA) and TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. Through my M.S. thesis titled \u2018Talking with your car\u2019: A Design Exploration of Human-Centered Conversational AI in Autonomous Vehicles, I specialized in Design Innovation Strategy, Generative AI (Conversational AI),  Autonomous Vehicles, and User Experience / User Interface design research. \n\nIn my recent work experiences, I have applied my skills and knowledge to various domains and sectors, such as automotive, robotics, aviation, social enterprise, and architecture. I have worked on professional technology design research projects for Mercedes-Benz and Boeing, contributed to the innovation strategy for the Royal Schiphol Group, and supported the operations management department of AeroDelft (a student-led dream team initiative to build the world's first liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft). I am passionate about finding innovative solutions for complex and meaningful challenges, and I value collaboration, learning, and impact. I believe that I can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, and help create positive change in the world. \n\nFeel free to get in touch to discuss interesting projects or for a chat over coffee.",

We interviewed eminent people representing these organizations and recorded as well as transcribed their interviews which served as data for further analysis.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\nWe began analyzing the data by selecting important quotes first and then deriving core concepts from it. Once we had the core concepts, we categorized them into themes.\n\nTHEME CLUSTERING\nWe clustered our themes in 4 quadrants of Desirability, Feasibility, Viability and Responsibility after debating within the team. This helped us understand the data better and informed our understanding on the way ahead.\n\nDEVELOPING STRATEGY STATEMENT\nBased on themes derived and clustered, we decided to develop a strategy statement to guide us through the next phase.\n\nREORIENTATION\nOnce we had an advisory discussion with the entire innovation hub, we re-oriented ourselves to follow a new approach to project. Rather than suggesting the modalities to choose in the future, we focused our process on developing a set of criteria that could be used to choose modalities developed in the future.\n\nFORMULATION OF CRITERIA\nWe started to formulate a set of criteria based on data analyzed. The set of criteria was categorized into Desirability, Feasibility, Viability and Responsibility to be more effective in decision making.\n\nTESTING AND FINALISATION\nAfter testing the criteria by applying to real cases, we determined the best way to deliver the criteria set is through an excel sheet. We developed a scoring system wherein modalities could be scored and weighed against each other.",

We developed a solution with multiple drones to detect hazardous leaks in urban regions that could assess the degree of destruction caused and send the data back to the central command. The central command can then choose to take suitable action based on the data received from the drone system. This project was a step towards developing intelligent autonomous systems that could aid relevant authorities during crisis situations in inaccessible locations.",
