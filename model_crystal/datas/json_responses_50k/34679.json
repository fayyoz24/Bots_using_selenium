The public space is enhanced by a dynamic shaded canopy covering organised spaces beneath. There is a curved wall that defines the northern spine of the new fish market, which is constructed of rammed earth, a structure, which is both sustainable and reminiscant of traditional venacular architecture familiar to the local community. \n\nIza has joined the project at executive design stage and she was involved in structural calculations (steel structures) and preparing executive documentation. She coped with ARSA\u2019s limitations related to using custom steel sections of compound columns.\n",
