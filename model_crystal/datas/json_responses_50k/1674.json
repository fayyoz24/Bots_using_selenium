    "summary": "Maastricht University, in collaboration with its partners: Antwerp University, Defence for Children, Jagiellonian University, Macerata University, PLOT Limburg and Warwick University is currently carrying out a two year research project \u2018Protecting young suspects in interrogations\u2019, which aims to contribute to this harmonisation. \n\nThe goal of the project is to gain insight into existing legal procedural safeguards and practice, ultimately identifying best practices. The project team strives to draft proposals for EU wide mimimum rules and safeguards \u2013 providing effective protection for young suspects during interrogation. It is hoped that the outcome of the project will ultimately influence (European) policy-makers and custodial workforces. \n\nThe research will be carried out in five European countries \u2013 Belgium, England and Wales, Italy, Poland and The Netherlands \u2013 and consists of three phases: \n\n1. A six-month legal comparative study into supranational safguards, national legal provisions per targeted country and transversal analysis \u2013 resulting in publication 1.\n2. A one-year emprirical study, consisting of observations of (video)taped interrogations of juveniles and focus group interviews \u2013 resulting in transversal analysis of good practices;\n3 A six-month merging of legal and empirical results, establishing minimum rules recommendations and proposal for best practices \u2013 resulting in publication 2. \n\nThe project will finally be closed of by organising a master class and conference.",
