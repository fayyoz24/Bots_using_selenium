To mitigate this global challenge, there is an urgent need for solutions that lower CO2 emissions and protect natural resources. A solution lies in circular economy and circular design to solving some of these challenges, particularly in the paint industry.\n\nThe overall goal of this project was to obtain knowledge on circular economy and circular design and apply this to discover and explore circular solutions within the paint manufacturer PPG. To this end, the following problem statement was developed and applied throughout the project:\n\"How can we support PPG in extending their producer responsibility and assist DIY customers in reducing their paint waste?\"\nIn response to the problem statement, the project developed the solution \u201dNo paint wasted\u201d. The solution aims at the top of the circular waste hierarchy, reducing the environmental impact from unused paint currently ending up in storage, incineration or in polluting water. The solution consists of three components which aids do-it-yourself paint customers.\n\nThe three components consists of: a planning app that provides accurate guidance; unit sizes that change product offerings to support the purchase of correct amounts; a cleaning kit to support correct cleaning practices with equipment and enable recycling of paint packaging. The combined solution, results in a reduction of paint waste.\n\nThe outcome of this project has provided PPG with inspiration to reconsider their current linear business model and see the potential in business opportunities that decouple value creation from resource consumption.",

Changing your car to a more sustainable model usually involves a big investment, while changing your food habits does not. Main barriers are lack of knowledge, lack of inspiration and the assumption that eating climate friendly is too expensive and time consuming.\n\nPlan2Plate is an app solution that combines inspirational sustainable meals with low CO2 footprint with a simple and flexible planning system to decrease shopping time and frequency. Plan2Plate tracks the progress of the user and calculates the CO2 footprint of the planned meals. Additionally, it provides tips and guides on how to make sustainable food choices. The users can create meal plans from the recipe library or upload their own favourite recipes to be assessed and included in their meal plan. Either way, Plan2Plates helps users plan their sustainable food choices one plate at a time.\n",

In addition to this we have created a specification of user need, though interviews with various relevant actors within the network of packaging in Denmark. Through a creative problem solving process, we have walked through many ideas and come up with a final concept through function evaluation and prototyping sessions with users.    \n\nUsing the product will have follow positive environmental effect: \n- The longer a packaging is reused the less impact the plastic has on the environment because the production effects are distributed over longer time. \n- Food waste will be lowered. \n- External plastic components will not be necessary. \nThe exact reduced environmental effect will be presented in the pitch. \n\nWe can conclude that by prolonging packaging and it\u2019s contents lifespan the environmental impacts are reduced.",
