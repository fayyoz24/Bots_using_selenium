Conventional flood risk models are built for data rich environments, while the largest increase in floods is expected in data scarce environments in Africa and Asia. How can we close this gap?\n\nThis master thesis started with the hypothesis that data scarce regions are not so scarce. Remote sensing data has been collected for the past 40 years and is often publicly available. The outcome of this study is a inundation extent model based on optical and passive microwave remote sensing imagery that can analyse the magnitude of an inundation and estimate and map the inundation extent on a daily basis. \n\nThe inundation extent model has been applied in a delta study in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 Delta, Benin and has been presented as an oral presentation at the EGU General Assembly in 2019.

In this study I presented a framework for sustainable development of ports in transition and I applied it to the re-development of bay of Havana in Cuba. \nThe conference paper was accepted for the International Conference of Sustainable Infrastructure 2017, New York.",
