    "summary": "In 2013 I finished my master Human Geography at the University of Amsterdam, my master thesis was about coherence between environment and development in the shipping industry in Europe (Grade: 7.5 out of 10). For almost a year I was working at Expedia, where I worked as a Direct Debit Coordinator and Credit Controller. In December 2014 I started working at the Gemeente Utrecht. For a year I followed the Young Professional program at the Healthcare department and now I am working as advisor on health and environment in spatial planning (Adviseur Gezonde Leefomgeving) being part of the team \u2018Co-creatie en Wijken\u2019. Our team primarily works to protect and promote health in public space. With the aim to build an environment that people experience as pleasant, invites to healthy behavior and minimizes pressure on health. We do this by bringing advices focused on health in spatial plans and projects. We also work with colleagues in the spatial domain, other governmental agencies and (national) (knowledge) institutions, to learn more and promote Healthy Urban Living.",
