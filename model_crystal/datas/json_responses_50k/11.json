Despite the availability of effective treatments, the number of patients receiving treatment is limited. \n\nInternet based therapies seem to be promising, viable and feasible approaches to treating common mental disorders. Extensive research established the clinical and cost-effectiveness of eMental health from patient, clinical, technological and societal point of view and continues to strengthen the proof even more.\n\nHowever, these evidence-based interventions often do not enter routine mental healthcare. To contribute to lowering the burden depression places on people and society, high quality insight in the Implementation processes and the factors that hamper or facilitate implementation and up scaling of evidence-base eMental health interventions in routine practice is needed.\n\nI aim to contribute to this by evaluating the up scaling and implementation of computerised Cognitive Beviour Therapy and Videoconferencing in routine practice throughout Europe.",

Tailored implementation can effectively and efficiently change practices. Tailoring is a systematic process that includes identifying the factors hindering and facilitating implementation, design implementation interventions appropriate to those determinants, and the actual application of those interventions. ImpleMentAll will develop and test tailored implementation strategies for Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) in 9 countries including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Kosovo, Albania, and Australia. The project is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program and the Australian Government. It has a budget of 6 million Euro, started in January 2017 and runs for 4 years.\n \nThe tailored implementation strategies and the study design will be based on the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), novel implementation measurement instruments (NoMAD), and on an established eHealth Technology Assessment methodology (MAST). Following a clustered stepped-wedge RCT design, the tailored implementation strategies will be introduced in the participating organisations at randomly chosen moments. By measuring uptake and level of normalisation of iCBT before and after the introduction over a period of 24 months, the effectiveness of tailored implementation strategies can be compared to implementation-as-usual.\n \nThe tailored implementation strategies of ImpleMentAll will enable data-driven evaluation of eHealth implementation projects in terms key performance indicators for process, effectiveness, and efficiency outcomes. Its methods, materials, and strategies will provide concrete guidance on how to tune implementation interventions to local determinants of practice within and across a variety of healthcare systems.",
