I also have an MA in Agrarian and Environmental Studies from ISS, and a BA in International Development Studies from York University in Canada. My research work has focused on social movements; politics around food production and climate change (particularly in relation to fisheries); land grabbing; agricultural investment; young farmers\u2019 access to land; and the bioeconomy. I am currently a Programme Associate at the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF), working with small-scale fishers\u2019 organizations in international processes.",
