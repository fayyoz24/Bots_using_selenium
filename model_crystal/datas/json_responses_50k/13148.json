At the same time the data on the customer Storage  and Backup infrastructure had to be moved to Atos SOD and CBS services. \nAlso the move of 4 environments that were considered to be extremely business critical was managed by me.\n\nIn order to be successful in this migration I created a Milestone Planning, described the Present Mode of Operations and Future Mode of Operations, both technical and procedural. With the PMO and FMO at hand the GAP analysis was written and from that the Run Books for the migration. \nBecause of the thorough preparation, the execution of the migration went very smooth.",
