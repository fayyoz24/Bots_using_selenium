Besides closing material  loops for circularity, this also touches upon dialogue support through innovative ways of process management to develop true innovation ecosystems. Finally, only future-proof results can only be realized when the perspectives of the different stakeholders are bridged. Realizing a sustainability transition in the built environment is also an issue of social-organisational innovation.",

A crucial step to strengthen future retrofit policies in China and the Netherlands is to focus on how retrofit interventions are socially \u2018made available\u2019 to householders through co-design and trust-building. The empirical findings from Amsterdam, Beijing and Mianyang show that the relevance of householders is exemplified by their role in suggestions on preliminary plans during the retrofit design, their quality control during the retrofit construction phase and pro-active education during the retrofit operation.\n\nFor this project I have interviewed more than 300 householders, builders, installers, housing association professionals and government officials. I have researched 10 retrofit projects in both Amsterdam and Beijing. Additionally, I have 4 retrofit trajectories researched in Mianyang (South-West China).\n\nWant to read this dissertation? https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/583301",
