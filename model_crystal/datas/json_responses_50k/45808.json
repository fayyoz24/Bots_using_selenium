    "summary": "Enthusiastic for new challenges, I am currently working towards designing optical phased array(OPA) for automotive cars. With a strong technical background in Electro-Optics and Photonic Integrated Circuits actively looking for full-time or Part-time job Opportunities in the integrated photonics field.\nI am a graduate student at the Technical University of Eindhoven in the department of Electrical Engineering specializing in Photonics. My graduate thesis focuses on the dense integration of InP-based grating antenna array. I received prestigious Erasmus Mundus scholarship from EACEA and by 2022 I would receive my dual master\u2019s degree. \n\nAfter my undergraduate program, I worked in academia for 2.5 years and also worked as a scientific officer for 2 years in \u201cBangladesh Atomic Energy Commission\u201d. Excellent interpersonal and communication skills acquired through professional and extracurricular activities.",
