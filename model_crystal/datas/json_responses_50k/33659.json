The year plans gave direction to where, how often, to who and how, to activate Jupiler and to build up the brand.\n\u2022 Out of the Annual plans I developed with or without agencies all specific activations, both online (Facebook / Website etc.) and offline (in the football stadiums, pop stages etc.).\n\u2022 I presented the activations to our partners and was point of contact for partners.\n\u2022 I organized the activations from A to Z, often in cooperation with an intern.\n\u2022 I evaluated the action, both internally and externally, and enhanced it for the future.\n\u2022 External I was the first contact for all activations on the above platforms. Internally, I was the contact for all activations. I went down with sales agreements between (potential) partners and internally I advised about what agreements schould be made \u200b\u200bfrom activation perspective towards relationships.\n\u2022 I managed the non-financial part of the contract, and took care that we fulfilled our duties and make maximum use of our rights.\n\u2022 I was responsible for the budget and was in charge of one trainee.\n\u2022 I was always looking for new activation opportunities, including outside the platforms.\n\u2022 I thought also about expanding the platforms through attracting new partners.",
