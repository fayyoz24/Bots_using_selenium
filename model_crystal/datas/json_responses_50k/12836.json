This is the proposal that earned a group of leading Dutch microbiologists a Gravitation grant (Zwaartekrachtsubsidie) from the Ministry of Education, Culture & Science. Prof. Mike Jetten from Radboud University Nijmegen and fellow-scientists from TU Delft, Wageningen University and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) will use the funding to set up SIAM, an institute to identify new anaerobic-living micro-organisms with characteristics that will benefit the environment and health. Gravitation grants are intended to provide excellent Dutch scientific fields with the funding they need to carry out top level research.\n\nThe microbiologists in the SIAM (Soehngen Institute for Anaerobic Microbiology) consortium are tackling one of the greatest challenges facing our society: creating a sustainable economy based on biomass. Microbes that survive without oxygen will play an important role, whether they live alone or in complex microbiological communities. They have many important functions, such as producing biogas, for example, turning organic waste into degradable bioplastics or improving health by optimising the microflora in the gut. Micro-organisms can also be used to trap or even neutralise greenhouse gases. SIAM will search for as yet unidentified anaerobic microbes, while also focusing on training a new generation of microbiologists.",
