    "summary": "Specialties: Interdisciplinary research, FAIR data principles, e-Science, rare diseases, molecular cell biology,  Linked Data and ontologies (knowledge representation), computational research workflows\n\nMy research focus is on making state-of-the-art computer science applicable to enhance biomedical research, particularly for rare human diseases and using computational knowledge discovery and linked data techniques. My main research interest is currently in enhancing translational research, originally starting from an interest in the role of chromatin structures in the cell, but now covering how knowledge representation (machine actionable data) can be used to advance translational research, particularly in the domain of rare diseases. \n\nAfter including computer science in my MSc in molecular biology, I have worked as a multidisciplinary researcher in research groups in life science and computer science. Now, as group leader of the Biosemantics research group, founded by prof. Dr. Barend Mons, LUMC (initiator of the FAIR principles), I lead the research, development and application of knowledge discovery methods for research on rare and genetic diseases. As one of its co-founders, an important aspect of my research is the implementation of FAIR data principles (data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for humans and computers) to create a powerful substrate and infrastructure for world-wide knowledge discovery across distributed heterogeneous data resources. This is of particular relevance for rare diseases. Therefore I co-lead the rare disease community of the European life science data infrastructure ELIXIR and the 'FAIR at source' work package in the European Joint Programme Rare Diseases. I coordinate the 'Rare Diseases GO FAIR implementation network' and the Dutch 'Personal Genetic Locker' project, and am involved in European Reference Networks for rare diseases. I am also involved in the national Health Research Infrastructure and the LUMC Data Competence Centre to help establish the LUMC as a FAIR principles compliant institute.",

With this work we contribute to the CHDI Genetic Modifier group, and the Rare Disease Connect project (http://www.rd-connect.eu).
