Some of these milestones, for example, are: individually conducting interviews with stakeholders and individually creating a responsive lo-fi. Visualizing your concept through a moodboard will be a team efforts and during the production of the site via html&css you can combine your strengths, just make sure everyone has at least one page they have coded.
