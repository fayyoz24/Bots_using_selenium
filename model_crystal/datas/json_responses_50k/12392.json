We love living in Amsterdam, enjoying the chaos and energy of an international city. Nevertheless we also love to have our space, tranquility and be outdoors. Two years ago we decided to investigate if we could combine both worlds, resulting in Casa Joya Nerja. It took us 6 months of renovations to create the most authentic personal holiday home possible. In our opinion it has everything you need for an ultimate feeling of space and tranquillity, but at the same time being close to the vibrant city of Nerja and having tons of outdoor activities around the corner.\n\nDREAM BIG\nWe strive to inspire others to also dream big and let intuitivity guide you sometimes. We want to share our experience and thus share our personal holiday home with you. With our passion and attention to detail, the property will transform from a holiday house into your holiday home during your stay. With a little help and tips from us, we believe you will change from being a visitor to feeling like a local.\n\nA HIDDEN GEM\nCasa Joya Nerja is located in a quiet area, yet at walking distance from bars and restaurants. It is close to the mountains, yet at walking distance to the beach. We think it is the perfect combination to have your holiday, whatever your needs are. In the future we would love to create more Casa Joya\u2019s so we can offer different kinds of experiences!",
