The goals evolve over time. A few years ago there was an emphasis on improving relationships and opportunities in Hong Kong and we are now looking for more affordable opportunities across Asia. We were successful and a number of our students attending HK universities rose from 8% to 24%.  In recent years, we were engaged in diversification of opportunities across the world for our applied learning pathway students.  The impact of this is evident with more and more BTEC students attending colleges outside the UK.  We are currently improving recognition of ESF in North American Universities systematically. ",
