    "summary": "Master student electrical engineering with a focus on Terahertz sensing. Good fundamentals in the rigorous math and physics of the electromagnetics in the sub-mm Wave/Terahertz region. I designed and optimized a superconducting filterbank for astronomy applications, covering a bandwidth of 200-400 GHz. Through the THz sensing group at TU Delft I have been exposed to state-of-the-art antenna systems used in telecommunications, sensing, and space applications.\n\nI have a strong sense of teamwork, an inherent feeling of project ownership, and, a \u2019can-do\u2019 attitude through my experience as a Student Council Member. I can easily adapt to multicultural work environments due to my international work experience.",
