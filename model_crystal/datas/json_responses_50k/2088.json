    "summary": "\"The greatest wealth is health\" - Virgilius. As an international development and global health professional, I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to make a positive impact on the well-being of individuals and communities worldwide. With a strong academic foundation and extensive experience in business development and consulting within the health sector, I bring a unique skill set to drive transformative change.\n\nI hold an MBA in International Health Management from Switzerland, a Masters in Social and Cultural Sciences from the Netherlands, and a Bachelor's degree in Communication Science, also from the Netherlands. These qualifications have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between health, culture, and communication.\n\nWith over 15 years of experience in both profit and not-for-profit sectors, I have acquired valuable insights into the intricacies of health-related initiatives. Having lived in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and worked in various other developing countries, I have been exposed to diverse cultures from an early age, fostering my adaptability and cross-cultural competency.\n\nMy specialties lie in negotiating investments and securing funding to strengthen health systems, combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, optimize supply chain management, and improve water and sanitation sectors. I have a proven track record in establishing successful public-private partnerships that drive sustainable healthcare solutions.\n\nMy passion lies in promoting health equity and addressing the underlying causes of health disparities. By integrating my expertise in business development, consulting, and global health, I strive to create innovative solutions that enhance access to quality healthcare for all.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can collaborate to create lasting impact in international development and global health. Together, we can strengthen health systems, drive impactful change, and contribute to a healthier and more equitable world. Let's make health the true wealth for all!",
