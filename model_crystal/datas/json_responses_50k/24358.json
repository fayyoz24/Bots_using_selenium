Not only have I been running my own businesses for many years, I\u2019ve also worked in advertising agencies and high-volume retail in major cities around the world. I can be independent, but I also know how to work with coworkers and customers to achieve goals and objectives. I\u2019ve acquired a wealth of knowledge and interpersonal skills through these jobs, and from continuously improving myself through education. Being exceptionally organized and detail-oriented is something that comes naturally to me, and making my clients extremely happy with their experience is one goal I\u2019ve always been able to achieve.",

I am also a FAA Part 107 certified drone pilot specializing in commercial and residential real estate, hospitality business & tourism, roof and solar inspections, promotional photo and video for your business, insurance inspection and documentation, construction and architecture, and events and drone portraits.\n\nBio:\nDuring his 38 years of life, Dave has already traveled to 35 countries and 35 states. While studying at Michigan State University and Miami Ad School, he was lucky enough to live in Miami Beach, Budapest, Dubai, Hong Kong, and finally landed in New York City where he lived for five years. Dave grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, but he lived in Eastern Market and then Rivertown near downtown Detroit for 7 years.  \n\nNothing makes Dave happier than experiencing other cultures, taking photographs, and meeting new and fascinating people. His most recent obsession is flying his professional-grade drone. One of his favorite experiences ever was traveling by himself in a stick shift rental car across the country of Jordan for five days, and spending a night with a Bedouin family sleeping on the desert floor under the moon and stars.",
