    "summary": "Exercising passionate enthusiasm in all areas of life, my favourite projects bring together a mixture of serious subjects and playfulness to mobilize knowledge. This means implementing collaborative research and learning through a merging of critical discussion and imagination to engage a wide range of communities. Though my curiosity and interests are broad, my best work combines creativity, top-notch organization, and clear communication to inspire productive change.\n\nDuring my doctorial research I developed a theory called Intimate Pedagogy. Caring deeply about how we create knowledge together and how we can use collaborative learning strategies to promote social and environmental change, I looked at how to employ intimacy and vulnerability as transformative pedagogical tools. \n\nI have worked in the field of education in various capacities for over 20 years. Holding administrative, research and teaching positions at learning institutions and art organizations has allowed me to maintain a commitment to ethically informed, diverse learning and research methods that extend beyond academia.\n\nResearch areas: critical pedagogy, gender and race studies, theories of the erotic, Caribbean and Black feminisms, queer theory, eco-feminism, decolonial art practices, visual methods, research as creation\n\nOther life pleasures include: swimming, delicious food, coffee, sci-fi, plants and (probably unsurprisingly) cats. \n\nIf you are interested in collaborating, please get in touch!",
