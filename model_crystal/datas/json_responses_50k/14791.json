    "summary": "I am an experienced People Coach and trainer. I  have taken up different roles, in business and IT and I believe, to make the right choice, we need to consider all challenges and opportunities. Only in collaborating with minority and majority votes will we find an excellent solution together. \n\nOf the 15+ years that I have spent in IT  I have focused on training, coaching people and facilitating conversations. The most valuable lessons I learned was by teaching others. And I have invested a lot of my time in communication skills like NonViolent Communication, Radical Candor, Deep Democracy and team leadership skills.\n\nYou should contact me if you're looking to continuously  contribute, nurture and develop the talents of  your people, and if you are open minded to experiment and use various styles of coaching. I promise to bring passion, dedication to results AND skills to help you from desire -> to plan -> and executing towards your goals. Does that sound like fun? Feel free to get in touch. \n",
