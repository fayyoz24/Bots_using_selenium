    "summary": "I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft, and am part of the TU Delft Circular Built Environment Hub. My research uses spatial statistical methods to analyze location data of materials and waste in order to generate insights for circular regional development. My goal is to add a spatial perspective to the fields of circular cities and urban metabolism. I'm currently engaged with research projects related to the Circular Economy in the EU, including the EU H2020 funded project Pop-Machina.",
