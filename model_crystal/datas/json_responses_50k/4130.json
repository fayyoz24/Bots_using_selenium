    "summary": "I am an open-minded and passionate individual. I am very experienced in, and attuned to, the world of fashion. I was previously based in Milan, Italy for 5 and a half years, where I acquired in-depth knowledge of the Italian fashion industry and its place in the global market. I gained this understanding through the roles of Trend Specialist and, previously, Assistant Buyer within the Buying department of Rinascente (a group of 9 department stores with its main luxury flagships in Milan, Florence and Rome). Whilst there, I learnt to speak Italian fluently and conduct business in both Italian and English. Eventually, I decided I wanted new experiences aside from working in the world of corporate retail.\n\nLiving in Amsterdam since the beginning of 2020, I have been working in an Italian Wine Bar situated in the Jordaan. During this time, and over the pandemic, I had the chance to nurture my passion for environmentalism and sustainability. I also had the opportunity to put it into practice in the independent restaurant where I worked. Through considerable research, I have re-assessed my aspirations, and now I am determined to make a difference in the fashion industry for a brighter, sustainable future.",

It involved the forecasting, management and tracking of merchandise from the suppliers to the shop floor. Though I became familiar with hundreds of shoe brands, I focused on major players such as Casadei, Balenciaga and Marni as well as niche brands like Marskinryyppy, Rejina Pyo and Giannico, whose presence was less assured. I regularly accompanied the Buying Manager on showroom visits and aided in the selection and merchandising of product for the various stores.\nDuring my time in this role, overall luxury shoe sales rose significantly. I also trained and managed buying interns with a view to the future development of the department.\n\nUntil September 2016 I was attached to the team for Jewellery, Watches and Women\u2019s Shoes, I gained great insight into how these buying areas are managed. I also learnt how to gather and analyse the data required for forecasting buying needs. This also extended to the department store Illum, Copenhagen during the initial takeover and renovation by Central Retail Corporation (holding group of Rinascente).",
