    "summary": "\"It's not about the future of work, it's about the future of living.\"\n\nAs a small-town teenage girl, I always had the dream to work online while traveling the world. But I had no clue how to get started.\n\nUpon graduation (cum laude & with honors) I started a travel blog with my - identical - twin sister to figure out how to make this location-independent lifestyle work.\n\nHowever, we had no idea what we were doing and didn't make a single cent. \n\nSerendipitously, I received a message on LinkedIn\u2122 for a job opportunity at one of the world's most popular tech companies. \n\nThis is how I landed my \"dream job\" at the LinkedIn\u2122 EMEA HQ in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nIt was a red-carpet deal with world-class perks and benefits incl. free food, a gym, a rooftop barista bar, in-office massages, a meditation room & more.\n\nBut, after a while, the office walls started to come down on me and these shiny perks and benefits didn't seem as interesting as they used to be...\n\nBack in 2018, I decided to quit my comfortable, 9-to-5 office job to \"explore the world of remote work\" without a solid plan. I haven't set foot inside an office ever since.\n\nIn the past 5 years:\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd I\u2019ve helped clients worldwide to build an irresistible personal brand and stand out from the crowd.\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd I\u2019ve built and grown the world's #1 remote work community with 100,000+ members (and counting!).\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd I\u2019ve been invited as an international keynote speaker at award-winning events on the future of work.\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd I\u2019ve been named one of 10 global thought leaders in the US LinkedIn\u2122 Top Voices 2022: Remote Work.\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd I\u2019ve been featured in top international media incl. Thrive Global, Remote Influencer Report, AD & more.\n\nAnd, most importantly, while enjoying the freedom and flexibility of the remote work lifestyle that allows me to plan my work schedule around my ideal life, not the other way around.\n\nDo you want to explore a collaboration?
