            "description": "In the 28 years of my career I have built up experience in various roles in the execution of complex design and development projects. As a junior straight from university I applied my knowledge as mechanical engineer in the strength analyses of solar arrays for satellites for 9 years. I learned to apply my technical skills in an industrial environment. \nThen my focus switched to the process-side of the engineering activities: during my 6 years on the Joint Strike Fighter program I got the opportunity to go into depth of processes as Systems Engineering, Requirements Management and Configuration Management which are essential to manage high-tech development programs. In this period I was seconded to the JSF Systems Engineering and Integration Team of Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas.\nThen I moved from Texas to Bucharest, where I got the opportunity to sharpen my managerial skills: I was tasked with the initial set up and general management of a low cost engineering facility: Fokker Engineering Romania. Within a year the office was fully operational with 8 employees, interconnected with the home-office in The Netherlands.\nAll this experience (in-depth technical knowledge, process orientation and managerial skills) was essential for being eligible and successful in my role as Chief Engineer of the NH90 helicopter development program over the past 9,5 years. Due to its complexity in many ways (both technical and organizational and political) it brought me the ultimate challenge to achieve results in this environment: certifying the designs of our components, ensuring safety and airworthiness of the flying fleet of NH90\u2019s worldwide (> 300 aircraft), bringing improvements to the machine by listening carefully to the needs of the military operator\u2019s. Seeing this aircraft fly and meeting its requirements makes me proud.\nSo in short, this is who I am: an allround experienced engineer who thrives in complex technical development programs where I can play a decisive role.\n",
