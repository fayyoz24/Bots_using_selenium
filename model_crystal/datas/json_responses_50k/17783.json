    "summary": "My passion has always been understanding the stories that drive us. I've spent years studying how people engage with cultural icons and am now looking to expand my skillset with new professional challenges. My background in sociology demonstrates that I'm naturally curious and a critical thinker with strong research and story-telling abilities. \nI'm as comfortable collecting and analyzing data as with presenting results to a room full of people. As a team player, I know what it takes to be an effective cross-cultural communicator and have a deep appreciation for the perspectives that come with diverse environments.\n\nI'm a German native speaker with an American accent from watching \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" as a teenager. I stay sharp by debating U.S. politics with my powerlifting coach and listening to German feuilleton podcasts.",
