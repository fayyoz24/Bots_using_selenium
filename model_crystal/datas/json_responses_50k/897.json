    "summary": "Interesting initiatives to broaden your mind:\n\npostgrowth.org | offersandneeds.com | follow-this.org | simpol.org | gabv.org | energyandourfuture.org | consilienceproject.org\n\nAlex is an adventurous and creative person with a wide area of interests. Important values to him are equity, autonomy and harmony. As an adventurer Alex likes to fully understand issues or challenges. He will often ask the why-question and dares to think and act differently. Colleagues and friends appreciate his ability to connect with others, including people with diverse cultural backgrounds, that he applies in engaging stakeholders. His creative side expresses itself through visualisations, branding, facilitating workshops and his humour. Alex is passionate about economic system change and is already contributing to this as a conscious consumer and green investor (Triodos Bank, Broccoli.eu, follow-this.org). We need to move from EconoME to valYOU.\n\nAlex would like to contribute to societal, scientific, environmental or cultural goals in which profit is viewed as a means and not a goal. Interesting areas are social entrepreneurship, social design and (radical) circular economy. He has experience as researcher, analyst, workshop creator and facilitator, knowledge manager, onboarding manager, learning and development officer and since he\u2019s a quick learner do not hesitate to reach out with other positions. He's located in The Netherlands for the moment but open to discuss relocations (preferably places where English is spoken sufficiently).\n\nReach out in case you have an opportunity to discuss or if you just wish to connect and have a coffee.\n\nSources of inspiration include minimalism, hitchhiking and volunteering experiences, Commons (Ostrom, Bollier, Monbiot), De Correspondent (Research Journalism), Doughnut Economics, Economy Transformers (economytransformers.nl), Wellbeing Economics (WEAll.org), Degrowth, Indigenous wisdom (Krznaric/Yunkaporta), Post Growth (Institute), Post Growth Entrepreneurship, Permaculture, Purpose Economics (Kees Klomp), Regenerative Economics (Capital Institute), Regenesis (Daniel Christian Wahl), Rudolf Steiner (Social Triad), Sacred Economics, Systems Thinking (Meadows), The Great Simplification (energyandourfuture.org), The Web of Meaning (Jeremy Lent), Triodos Bank etc.",
