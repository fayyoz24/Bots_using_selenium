    "summary": "Hola!\n\nMy name is Jeimmy, and I come from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and I have lived in the Netherlands for seven years (Tuurlijk spreek ik een beetje Nederlands). I recently finished my Master's in Media, Culture and Society at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am an ambitious professional with diverse skills gained due to my thirst for knowledge and inner curiosity. I have been drawn to media since my earliest years and possess an inner passion for journalism and storytelling. My journey began with studying social communication and journalism back home. My career reveals that I am a multifaceted and creative communicator. I have been involved in roles in diverse media forms such as radio, newspapers, and digital media. I have over 3 years of experience in media-related roles, including journalism, photography, video edition, content creation for digital platforms, social media management, PR and journalism. I am confident that my versatility and skills can greatly benefit your company.\nInterested in my work? Take a look at my portfolio.\n\nWould you like to chat? I would love to connect, too!\n\nDisclaimer: I have a valid work permit in the Netherlands, thus I do not need sponsorships for my Visa. \n\n#OpenToWork #contentwriting #communications #traineeship #journalism #Spanishnativespeaker",

Check \u2705 \nNo childcare and studying Online? Check \u2705 \n\nWhen I became a MOM in January 2020, I was not only in charge of nurturing and caring for my little boy's physical, emotional and developmental needs, but I also became the queen of multitasking. In my role as MOM, I keep track of schedules, appointments, budgets and household tasks. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, while social media buzzed with banana bread baking, I navigated some of the most pivotal years of my personal and professional journey. \n\nDuring these years, I had to adapt and solve problems such as lack of social support and child care. Adapting to the changing circumstances and crisis management during this period of time has been vital to sustain the company's growth. My strategic time management and thoughtful planning were wonderful tools in harmonizing my career aspirations with the demands of family life and the pursuit of my master's studies. \n\nBeing a MOM is one of the most significant roles I have embraced and I take great pride in being part of this journey we call motherhood. \n\nSkills:\n\ud83d\udd39Organization\n\ud83d\udd39Time Management\n\ud83d\udd39Multitasking\n\ud83d\udd39Crisis Management\n\ud83d\udd39Conflict Resolution\n\ud83d\udd39Work Under Stressful Situations\n\ud83d\udd39Adaptability\n\ud83d\udd39Communication Skills\n\ud83d\udd39Emotional Intelligence\n\ud83d\udd39Mentorship and Guidance \n\ud83d\udd39Creativity \n\ud83d\udd39Patience",
