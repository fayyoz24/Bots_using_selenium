    "summary": "I am a proactive financial/operational management professional with an operational focus supporting the improvement of the connection between business and finance. I have more than 35 years of working experience in international and national operating companies active in various branches and legal set-ups (limited liability, institutional participations and family owned), mainly, for more than 20 years, in several sectors of the international real estate business, development/ finance and participations/ property management, as well as financial as country/project responsible.\nMy educational background is in accounting/finance and I further developed to management / board level in the financial/operational, but later on also in more general/commercial roles. In those roles  Financial departments and services as ICT, Legal, Facilities, Personnel Administration and Purchasing/Contract Management were managed, but also Country organizations and portfolios. This all convinced me even more that good financial reporting can only be made if the business is understood. Improving that understanding will make kpi's and numbers added value for performance of a company.\nDuring all the years in international business a good understanding of cultural differences was gained. Being empathetic and easily switching between strategic, tactical and operational levels, with a constant focus on helping the business forward and achieving goals, I am sure that improvements can be made in either of my three focus points mentioned hereafter.\n\nAmbition/focus:\n- (Interim)(Part-time) Financial Director, Financial Manager or Senior (Business) Controller.\n- Bring solutions on the intersection of Finance and Real Estate. With the knowledge in the areas of\n   commercial and residential real estate, invent, work and develop solutions in the current market.\n- \u2018Troubleshooting\u2019, solving the puzzle, from a clear analyses to a solution proposal and thereafter \n   energetically ahead to reach the goals.",

                    "description": "Advising two teams on development schemes in Denmark and Germany. Both projects were under construction and finalizing the projects within the proposed timeframe had priority. Construction of the German project is almost completed. One small part is currently fitted out by the tenant under control of the developer. \n\nResults: Based on the strategy outline of SNSPF, I managed to have the Danish loan repaid in due time, helping the developer in selling the property. The German project is to be delivered and selling negotiations are taking place at good price indications.",
