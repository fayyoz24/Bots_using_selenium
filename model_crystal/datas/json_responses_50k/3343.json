We all make assumptions on how should lessons be carried out, how mobile phones should be switched off or how learning happens only in classrooms. Fundamentally, every student comes to a school or university to learn, and teachers come to teach. Ordinarily, these assumptions match the way most of us were educated. However, these principles were created and managed by traditionalists, which is a no match to the learners of today. In fact, despite the hard work these conventional institutions are struggling to engage the young people. Its high time that we introduce something real and engaging into our system of education before it completely restricts our social mobility. Having said that, Innovation can only work if we have the willingness to experiment and accept change. In this report we present our findings of the growing global movement towards achieving the vision of an engaging 21st century education for S P Jain School of global management through Gamification.",

The USLS, organised by Humanitarian Affairs UK and the UNDP, was a week-long Leadership Conference in Social Development for young leaders from all over the world. The theme of the Symposium was \u201cBuilding LIFE, Giving HOPE\u201d, and about 907 emerging world leaders in 70+ United Nations Member States attended this Youth Leadership Symposium at the UN in August 2017. Focusing on developing young leaders to bring social change, the delegates got a chance to engage with the world\u2019s largest humanitarian agency, the United Nations, through exposure to 12 UN agencies, who showcased their works and lead workshop discussions themed based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The purpose of the USLS is to instil a sense of social responsibility as well as to cultivate the attributes of selfless giving among our emerging world leaders. The young participants learnt what it means to give back to the community and be challenged to respond to the needs of the marginalized with works of kindness and unconditional service. Delegates also had the opportunity to expand their professional network and get a better understanding of world affairs."
