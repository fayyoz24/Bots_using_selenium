We lived in Norway for 4,5 years because my husband had a temporary assignment in Norway. His assignment finished this summer, which was the reason for our move back to the Netherlands. I quit my job in June, took care of the children and prepared our move. Once we arrived in the Hague, I supported the kids in settling at child care and school and took an active role as a parent in the school. During this time I also focused on earning points for my Project Management Professional certification, by following webinars and going to meetings of the Netherlands Chapter of the Project Management Institute (PMI).",
