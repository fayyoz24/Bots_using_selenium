Strenge maatregelen in combinatie met verschillende innovatieve oplossingen zijn nodig. Zowel technologische als sociale innovatie, veelal ge\u00efntegreerd, dragen bij aan noodzakelijke en gewenst oplossingen. Zo wordt hard gewerkt aan vaccins, waarvan de eerste wellicht begin volgend jaar te verwachten zijn. Hoe krijgen we vaccins snel, zorgvuldig en verantwoord van \u201clab to life\u201d?\"",

In order to investigate the usefulness of adopting an online stock allocation strategy, I performed multiple simulations. For these simulations I measured improvements in the order sourcing process, in terms of order sourcing costs.  For my simulation I have mainly used Python and CBC-solver. Moreover, in order to construct the simulations, extensive data analysis had to be performed.\n\nI enjoyed working independently on the project, updating relevant stakeholders and sharing insights in a (non)-mathematical way!\n\nTitle thesis: Online Stock Allocation Strategies, an explorative study of the alternating shipment landscape.",
