    "summary": "A self-driven business enthusiast with a strong interest in technology and a background in smart home on both hardware and software development. As one of the main driving forces behind building up a new business unit at IKEA, I played a pivotal role in its rapid growth through close collaboration with the management team. I also collaborated with industry giants Apple, Google, Amazon, and Sonos to develop IKEA's successful line of smart speakers and new smart home ecosystem. With extensive experience in leading and motivating teams and the surrounding organization, including internal and external communication, I have developed strong interpersonal skills that enable me to build trustful relationships and manage stakeholders effectively. Working internationally in The Netherlands, Sweden, Taiwan, and Mexico has equipped me with language skills and a diverse network, making me an asset to any team. My drive to succeed and willingness to take calculated risks position me ready to take on new challenges and drive business growth.",
