    "summary": "The last years I have been working on a large expansion project. One of 4 expansion projects I have worked on. I was Project Engineer for the disciplines Mechanical, HVAC and partly Piping (not in execution phase) from the study phase, FEED and execution phase of the project. I have been the lead of the team preparing the purchase of 60 requisitions of machines and equipment, engineering the HVAC systems and piping systems. Responsible for the requisitions/specifications, selecting vendors, technical evaluation of the bids, providing technical support for the vendors (e.g. in case of deviations/problems) and ensuring overall quality control. I am used to work with together with big engineering companies like Worley/Fluor and manufactures all over Europe.\n\nI need complex technical challenges and problems for my satisfaction. New technologies and new knowledge areas I find very attractive. Finding a solution beyond the obvious. Within Teijin Aramid I have had many projects that meet this and that I enjoy.\n\nWorking with people and achieve the best possible added value to the company and the people is what satisfies me also. For me working together with people means: accepting them as they are and challenge them to perform at their maximum to reach the goals of the project. The differences between people are needed to challenge all members in the project team. I see it as my responsibility to challenge every team member and make the whole team perform at its best and deliver the best possible result for the company.\n\nKey words (random order):\nPeople\nProject Management\nMechanical engineering\nMachinery, CE\nManufactoring\nMechanical static equipment\nRotating equipment\nPiping\nHVAC systems",

In short: I act as a controlling gateway between Teijin Aramid and the lead engineers of the engineering contractor(s) to make sure that all necessary internal knowledge is also available for and applied by the EC project team.\nAs an mechanical Project Engineer I have to work very close with all disciplines in order to achieve the highest level of quality of the project result. This begins with contribution to (3D) plant layout reviews, HAZOP, SIL and RI&E sessions. Generating the Technical Requisitions for the various equipment and facilities, vendor selections, bid evaluations, inspection, acceptance tests at factory or at site also require a lot of cooperation with all disciplines. Finally the project ends with support for the commissioning and startup team and handling of spare parts, operating and maintenance instructions.\n",

Together with lead engineers of the client I made several production tools for the series production of ASML machines. As senior design engineer it was my responsibility to make the tooling which met the specifications. This was done under my lead by a team of design engineers from Almelo and Amsterdam office. Also the fabrication of the tooling was organised by me. Fabrication of the tools ment:  preparing offers for the required tooling, specify, validate and approve of designconcept, making CE declaration of conformity and documentation, prepare specs for bidding, selection of winning bid, making detail production drawings and supervise production and implementation of the tooling. Multi disciplinary project based. These projects provided work for several CAD engineers in both Almelo and Amsterdam which I coordinated.",
