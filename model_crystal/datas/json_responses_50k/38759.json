    "summary": "I was born in New Haven, Connecticut, United States and after spending the first 3 years of my life in Connecticut moved to Athens. This is where I grew up until the age of 15, even though I did spend a year in North Carolina in 2010. In 2016, at the age of 15, I moved to Lausanne, Switzerland until I finished high school and moved to Amsterdam. Due to its rational and logic-based nature, I have been interested in economics from a young age. I am a very practical person and I find Economics and specifically finance a tremendously useful tool in life, as it helps in better understanding people in society and can be applied to many other subjects. Having lived in Greece, the US, the Netherlands, and Switzerland has deepened this interest, as I have observed the effects of the economy on the standards of living and human behavior in general. Moving to Lausanne from Athens in 2016, when I was 15 made a particular mark, due to the Greek economic crisis.",
