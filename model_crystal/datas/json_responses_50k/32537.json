    "summary": "Interdisciplinary professional with a background in urban planning and mechanical engineering - topical areas include Climate Resilience and the Energy Transition. Lived, studied, and worked in the US, Singapore, and India and currently pursuing my joint MS degree from TU Delft and Wageningen University in Amsterdam, Netherlands. \n\nThe degree focuses on Sustainable Urban Development through the lens of technology, data, and policy solutions with Amsterdam as our test bed. It emphasizes metropolitan solutions in the areas of urban energy, mobility, water and waste management, and food security. \n\nI am passionate about addressing socioeconomic equity through critical resource & and infrastructure management (water & and energy) using my background in urban planning and engineering. In my projects, I strive to develop multi-stakeholder solutions that bridge the community, private, and public sectors. My skill set includes public-interest planning methods like stakeholder engagement and co-creation, and technical skills like data analysis, geospatial studies (GIS), and engineering modeling. I work in the context of Western cities currently and have begun taking up projects in the Indian context with my current Master's thesis. I have a keen interest in working with other Global South regions as my career develops and contributing to the topics of livable cities and planning for urbanization.",

            "description": "This 4 month consultancy project was part of the MSc. MADE Living Lab course and our team of 5 directly worked with the Bajeskwartier consortium in Amsterdam to develop a drought resiliency plan for their mixed-used neighborhood looking forward into 2085. Bajeskwartier is a rejuvenation project in South-East Amsterdam, where an old prison complex is being converted into a mixed-use neighborhood with residential, commercial and educational buildings. The project area spans 8 hectares and current design plans propose around 70 gardens to keep the neighborhood green. The development has already been designed and construction has begun, with the project consortium recently identifying drought as a scope. As students at the AMS Institute, this is where we contributed by 1. identifying drought risk for greenery on site from now to 2085, and 2. proposing engineering and nature-based interventions through stakeholder discussions and technical modeling. My role within the project entailed developing the cohesive design approach (synthesizing and selecting appropriate interventions.) I focused on concepts like a decentralized water grid (combining rainwater collection and storage), contributed towards a water-shortage python model, and structured co-design sessions with project stakeholders along with other team members. My personal project learnings were technical modeling (schematic water grid design, python models for droughts) and integrated process design for urban planning projects.",

The challenge was to address the food desert condition experienced in Washington DC, Ward 7, by designing a local farm that increases fresh-food access and doubles as a space for community interaction and education. \n\nI was part of team AMS Caterpillars and served as the Technical Design Leader, coordinating the engineering, architectural and agricultural concepts. AMS Caterpillars finished the challenge strong, winning the resident choice award from resident's of Ward 7, and finishing 3rd place as judged by the WUR UGC panel of experts. \n\nOur vision statement: Fostering community spirit through an adaptive, self-sustaining urban farm that ensures local food security and economic viability, infrastructure longevity and meaningful public space. Guided by this, we proposed a farm masterplan that included: a central community center (the Butterfly Building), a robust outdoor growing landscaping plan, and indoor growing with a greenhouse. the concept farm sported 25 crops. \n\nAs a team based in Amsterdam and the AMS Institute, we linked dutch concepts like developing the farm into an Urban Living Lab which allows for community input and ownership. And being international, interdisciplinary members we tackled everything from architectural building design, HVAC systems for greenhouses, and a detailed agricultural study of crop cycles and symbiotic crop selection. The social context was the backdrop for all design decisions, with our social and economic teams conducting detailed studies of local context. We ensured a design for residents of ward 7 that not only increases their access to healthy vegetables, but also helps bolster their socioeconomic prospects.",

This project aims to test different, environmentally friendly, antifouling methods and quantify the relationship between turbine efficiency and biofouling in small-scale hydro turbines. \n\nTesting Methodology: The project included testing various nontoxic anti-fouling methods and submerging them in the Mystic River for 45 days to observe growth, along with the construction of a data acquisition system and testing rig to measure the efficiency of these turbines. \n\nCollaborators and Special Thanks to:\nDr. Jacqueline Ashmore & Boston University\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Energy\nDr. Somnath Basu\nRuss Cone & Still Water Design, Inc.\nProfessor James Bird & Mark Menesses\nProfessor Greg Blonder\nProfessor Frank Di Bella\nProfessor Enrique Gutierrez-Wing\nProfessor William Hauser\nProfessor Anna Thornton\nJoe Estano & the EPIC Staff\nPettit Paint\nBlue Water Marine\nRainGuard Water Sealers\n",
