IOVA pursues to receive market authorization for an orphan disease named Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) that is characterized by life threatening attacks of microvascular thrombosis. However, MICROLYSE has the capacity to target all forms of microvascular thrombosis and could also be applied in early-stage macrovascular thrombosis as seen in heart attacks and stroke. In vivo validation in TTP in mice is expected early 2020. Additionally, IOVA is actively exploring the applicability of MICROLYSE in acute ischemic stroke.\n\nAt IOVA, we are determined to change the future of microvascular thrombosis.",
