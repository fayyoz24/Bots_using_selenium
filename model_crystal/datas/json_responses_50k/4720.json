    "summary": "Generalist | Essentialist | Lifelong Learner\n\nI am passionate about development, both personally and professionally, of myself and the people and processes around me. I am curious about almost everything and tend to find connections and links between abstract concepts that others do not see.\n\nManaging a department in a relatively small company allowed me to build my experience in buying, selling, leading teams, sales and marketing, logistics, and customer service.\n\nI have almost a decade of formal experience in training and development in myriad of themes and ages. As a trained teacher and professional trainer, I can use my exceptional communication and interpersonal skills to share my broad experience and knowledge with others, allowing me to become even more of a leader and manage effectively in various roles and environments.\n\nBalancing work and my personal life, I am an enthusiastic player of board games and card games. I find this to be a fantastic way to develop my interactions with friends and family whilst being challenged to test and improve different strategic approaches to different circumstances and goals within the games.\n\nAdditionally, I am an avid reader. I am currently most interested in personal development books and mystery/crime solving novels.",
