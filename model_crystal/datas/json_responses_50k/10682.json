    "summary": "I am a product designer who has always had a people-first mindset. My greatest inspiration stems from my love of travel and the different people I have met along the way, and I aspire to create innovative solutions that positively impact their lives and wellbeing. Through my background in product design, mechanical engineering, and the service sector, I have become a true generalist with a versatile skill set that I can apply across the entire design process \u2014 from in-depth researching and concepting, to prototyping, building, and managing both team and personal projects.\n\nMy multicultural background and diverse work experience helps me connect with others and cultivate inclusion both through my work and personal life. I aspire to be the bridge between people, design, and engineering and am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and design human-centered projects.",

Through the integration of smart chromogenic materials, the Beetle becomes a supportive atmosphere that encourages child creativity while protecting them from external environmental conditions such as rain or UV rays. The cover is designed so that when it comes into contact with rain, heat from the child's hand, sun, or darkness, it will change colors promoting creativity and exploration, motor development, and visual and cognitive stimulation.  This cover provides the child with space where they can safely experience their world in a new and colorful way.\n\nThis project was sponsored by Bugaboo, with the desire to design a product that helps the child develop into a positive and confident person in a complex world.",
