    "summary": "What I really want in my life is to understand, which has led to the discovery of a simple new metaphysical principle, on which I have built A New Generation of Philosophical-Scientific Framework. Within the framework, I wrote six big book manuscripts in Chinese: \u300a\u65b0\u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u548c\u65b0\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3001\u65b0\u9053\u5fb7\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u300bNew Principles of Metaphysics and Ontology, Ethics, and the Application of New Ontology in Physics, Cosmology, Biology, and Anthropology, \u300a\u5b87\u5b99\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5b58\u5728? \u300bWhy Does the Universe and We Exist? \u300a\u65b0\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u5b83\u5728\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u300bNew Epistemology and Its Applications in Philosophy, Aesthetics, Psychology, Neuroscience, and Anthropology, \u300a\u65b0\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b66\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4eca\u5929\u3001\u660e\u5929\u300bNew Theory of the State and the World Today and Tomorrow, \u300a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6587\u660e\u53f2\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u53f2\u300bThe History of Human Civilization and Chinese Cultural, \u300a\u4eba\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5b83\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u300bThe Three Key Traits of Human Beings and Their Geometric Models. You can find some highlights in my video clips https://youtu.be/ZsJXHgUL03I.\n\nThe world is simple and interconnected. It is a wonderful forest and music. However, the existing philosophical and scientific theories are fragmented, isolated, and complicated, dividing the world as trees and notes in the Plato cave, one sees no trees and hears no music, causing huge confusion. The simplicity and interconnections in philosophical and scientific theories are restored in my six big manuscripts. I see the forest and hear the music of the world. I am finalizing my last two manuscripts.\n\nI have studied and worked for 10 years in particle physics, both in theory, and in experiments, and witnessed the golden time for the standard model, worked and talked with some great physicists. But, I left the lovely physics community to get freedom and time to think. I had some wonderful experiences in industry and society.  I am doing my research lonely, but follow the major news of society and sciences, especially experimental results closely.  I make occasionally comments, not as my opinion or belief, but based on the conclusions of my research. \n\nI know that the world will see me as a crazy idiot since I am constantly confronted and taken out of my comfort zone in my research of last years by the conclusions that I deduced from my single super-simple metaphysical principle. Fortunately, there exists so much experimental data and human experiences, which support the conclusions and make me comfortable again.  I am happy that I am out of the Plato cave so that can see trees, and listen to music in the sun shining. What else a free human being could expect? \n\nHopefully, the world will get out of the Plato cave in the future.",
