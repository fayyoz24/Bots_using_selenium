    "summary": "My career in education started in the childhood bedroom of my small Polish apartment when I excitedly subjected my two younger brothers to hours and hours of English language lessons.\n\nSince then, I have enjoyed many positions in education: teaching ESL to high school and adult learners, a stint in corporate training & development in Warsaw, and teaching college writing & literature in Europe and in the U.S. until I transitioned to educational development in higher education, first at the CTLs in the U.S. and now in the Netherlands.\n\nAs an educational developer, for nearly nine years I have been helping higher education institutions function effectively as teaching and learning communities. I have done that by: \n\ud83d\udd39designing and facilitating pedagogy training programs--such as learning communities, communities of practice, course design institutes, and fellowships--for early-, mid-, and late-career faculty; \n\ud83d\udd39advising academic experts on educational innovation, active learning, learning design, assessment, and classroom community building, among other topics;\n\ud83d\udd39mentoring graduate students for careers in higher education;\n\ud83d\udd39translating learning science into practical resources and applied learning-centered classroom interventions;\n\ud83d\udd39supporting integration of learning technologies.\n\nCurrently, as an education coach at the Eindhoven University of Technology, my job is to support the university's education innovation strategy by helping teachers develop skills in formative assessment, assessment as learning, and Challenge-Based Learning.\n\n\ud83c\udf37 \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94: Love of learning \ud83d\udd39 Sustainability \ud83d\udd39 Kindness \ud83d\udd39 Inclusion \ud83d\udd39 Authenticity \ud83d\udd39 Practicing \u201cwhat if\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf33 \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc94: Intellection \ud83d\udd39 Strategic \ud83d\udd39 Deliberative \ud83d\udd39 Input \ud83d\udd39 Learner",
