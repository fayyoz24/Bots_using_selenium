The project reaches out interdisciplinarily into the fields of geology, geography, glaciology, meteorology and political ecology. At the same time, it explicitly situates itself in the transdisciplinary by establishing the connection between scientific and practical knowledge, as well as building the bridge to the arts, in particular to participatory theater work with the local population. The project addresses planetary issues, but is equally locally anchored in the alpine cantons of Glarus, Graub\u00fcnden and Uri.\n\nIn contrast to the 19th century, alpine ice and snow are no longer perceived as something threatening in the age of climate change, but rather as something threatened, with the increasingly rapid melting of the glaciers as a symptomatic expression. This project understands this radical upheaval as a crossing of tipping points, which are traced culturally and historically on the concrete example of the Morteratsch glacier and the T\u00f6di area. This tracing is carried out 1. in cultural and literary studies by researching and analyzing glacier descriptions between 1800 and the present. On the basis of the archivally prepared material, 2. the participatory theater work addresses questions about a new consciousness of loss in the Anthropocene in view of the radical change of the alpine habitat. The resulting artistic forms of expression are in turn incorporated into the cultural studies analysis, which is published as a whole in book form.",

                    "description": "From the Threatening to the Threatened: Tipping Points of Alpine Ice and Snow at the Morteratsch Glacier and in the T\u00f6di Area (Switzerland)\n\nThis transdisciplinary project combines archive research with participatory theater work. It is institutionally supported by the Urner Institut Kulturen der Alpen in collaboration with the Institut f\u00fcr Kulturforschung Graub\u00fcnden, the Junges Theater Graub\u00fcnden and the Kulturgesellschaft Glarus.\n\nIn the course of the heat year 2022, the alpine glacier extinction has definitely moved into the center of public interest. This raises the acute question of what these rapid changes mean for the future of the Alps as a habitat and how their inhabitants deal with them. In this context, this research and theater project addresses the question of how the inevitable transformation of the Swiss Alpine landscape can be understood and mentally processed in times of drastic climate change. This project is locally anchored in the mountain cantons of Glarus, Graub\u00fcnden and Uri, but it also addresses planetary issues.\n\nIn contrast to the 19th century, alpine ice and snow are no longer perceived as something threatening in the age of climate change, but rather as something threatened, with the increasingly rapid melting of the glaciers as a symptomatic expression. This project understands this radical upheaval as a crossing of tipping points, which are traced culturally and historically on the concrete example of the Morteratsch glacier and the T\u00f6di area. This tracing is carried out 1. in cultural and literary studies by researching and analyzing glacier descriptions between 1800 and the present. On the basis of the archivally prepared material, 2. the participatory theater work addresses questions about a new consciousness of loss in the Anthropocene in view of the radical change of the alpine habitat. The resulting artistic forms of expression are in turn incorporated into the cultural studies analysis, which is published as a whole in book form.",
