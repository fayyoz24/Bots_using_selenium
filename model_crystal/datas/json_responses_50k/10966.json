Both FPU and test unit will be described in VHDL with FPGA implementation and optimization in mind. The project will be a success when all calculations applied by the project principal are returned by the FPU with the right answers. (These calculations will not be given before the end of the project.)\n\nMy approach was to start with a brainstorm session resulting in an own well defined project description. After that too get a fully defined FPGA functionality I start making ASM diagrams of both the FPU and the test unit together with my team. Brainstorm sessions where held when new barriers where found and possible corner cases are documented. When the ASM diagrams where ready we held a review with the project principal. After getting the go I was responsible for the VHDL of the test unit design. I used the already made ASM diagrams for the VHDL description. After completing the VHDL description, it was time to hook the test unit to the FPU and start testing corner cases. Everything was good documented and I made a presentation about our work flow, learning points and the proof the FPU was working based on our corner cases and results from the test unit.\n\nAfter the project, the FPU was tested with the calculations applied by the project principal. It succeeded the test which resulting in a successful project. I learned during this project it is very important to first fully define the FPGA program with a good project description and ASM diagrams before equally building it in VHDL ",

About two years ago a new system is introduced. The Tecnai Osiris. My task was to make the Tecnai Osiris customer ready and troubleshoot problems when needed.\n\nBeginning 2012 a new product was introduced by FEI. The Titan G2 ETEM. This \u201cenvironmental TEM\u201d is capable to have normal environment inside high vacuum. This is a very complex machine. Short after the introduction I was moved from the Tecnai Osiris to the Titan G2 ETEM. My task was to make the Titan G2 ETEM customer ready and troubleshoot problems when needed.\n\nDisciplines I worked on:\n* High Vacuum (till 3e-8 mBar)\n* High Voltage system (till 300KV)\n* Mechanical and electrical Sensitive environment\n\nThe results where many improvements to the system. The Titan G2 ETEM passed the beta gate. Also I learn a lot about what is happening on the factory floor, and where a product designer of the future should be aware of.",
