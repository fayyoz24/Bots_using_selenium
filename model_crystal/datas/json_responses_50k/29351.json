Local events in the university have included stargazing and planet-watching using a telescope and binoculars. An online chat group has also been set-up to continue discussions related to astronomy and the sciences. \n\nThe club gave a chance to students from other departments such as arts and humanities to step into the world of astronomy through an interactive experience.",

These included, but were not limited to, finding distances to star clusters, verifying HR diagram plots and verifying certain mathematical equations. \n\nThe internship allowed for me to experience, on the surface, what pursuing research in astrophysics may be like. It also provided me with knowledge that I could relate with the courses that I had taken or will take during my time as a physics undergraduate student.",
