Successful poster submissions are declared winners and exhibited at the GDC. \n\nMy analysis looks at Portal 2 from the perspective of medium-specific storytelling methods and how it creates a multi-layered narrative that draws from the classical monomyth and Greek tragedies. It is this strong intertwining of story with gameplay and the medium-specific delivery methods through which the story is told that creates a narrative best told through a video game.",

As one of the major performance teams for the game, we were responsible for the majority of multi-player cinematics, mission briefings, and mission cutscenes. As a team, we deliver an unprecedented amount of cinematics for the game as well as establishing a method for creating such cinematics for a live service game.\n\nI work closely with the performance director and team producers to help manage internal work, embedded team schedule/needs, and technical needs on owned features. Additionally, as an product and feature owner, I work with my counterparts at partner studios as a resource by providing feature mentorship, documentation, and content creation guidance.
