The project proved to be a success with the models showing that high rates of faulting stopped knickpoint propagation and thus protected the upper catches from erosion. This has significant implications for the Himalayas where large strike slip faults such as the Karakoram are now believed to play an important role in stopping incision into the Tibetan plateau. The results of the project are still in the process of being published.",
