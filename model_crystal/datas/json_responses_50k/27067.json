NISI enables industry participants to co-create globally competitive products and services using a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) platform. PLM streamlines the flow of multi-disciplinary information about products, services and related processes throughout a complete lifecycle, to ensure that the right information is available in the right context and at the right time.",

As part of the Architecture & Integration team, Jonnro is responsible for the constant evolution of this new business architecture, managing 1000+ process interface points, standardising terms and abbreviations and consolidating architecture objects across all engineering processes.\r\n\r\nThe second of the two business process views, showing how work flows through the department, is primarily Jonnro\u2019s responsibility. This model is a key project deliverable and a valuable communication and integration tool. This principle of two views of processes has subsequently been adopted by other divisions in Eskom and Jonnro was awarded with the Engineering departmental award for Innovation for this initiative.\r\n\r\nPersonal characteristics this experience revealed: The power of displaying the same information in different ways to suit the perspective of the audience.",
