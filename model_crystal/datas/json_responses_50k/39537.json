I am interested in various types of cults, especially Exu and Pomba Gira, and I hope to contribute to a visual and written ethnography of the entities, their relationship to humans or non-humans and the ways that they relate to the local identity of Rio.",

A major part of the research focuses on the \u201crepresentations of diversity\u201d and how these imaginaries affect or legitimize neonazism and the emergence of the far right. Furthermore in order to examine the consequences of super diversity the research draws a detailed ethnography of the reception of the far right in the city of\nAthens by examining the encounters between \u2018locals\u2019 and \u2018immigrants\u2019 in a number of inter- group contacts and social relationships in key public spaces. How is the social life of immigrants affected by active members of far right networks or other ultra nationalists? How do these networks organize pogroms or other racist attacks? How is the social geography/ public space of Athens affected? What strategies and tactics do people use in these encounters?",

Photographic images have been incorporated and often associated with \u201ctradition\u201d, \u201cauthenticity\u201d, ritual practices and local identity. A way of approaching this traditionalization of photography is the biography of the self-taught island photographer Giannis Vernardis who kept the only photography shop on the island of Skyros for over thirty years. The story of the photographer\u2019s life and his widely circulating photographs are vehicles of varying notions of tradition and modernity that are of central importance in contemporary ethnography and anthropology.",

I looked at how cultural practices accommodated Scotch in the everyday life of laborers, shepherds and young professionals in island and urban Greece and how Scotch became a materialization of modernity and masculine styles.  My PhD research has been published by Berghahn under the title: Greek whisky: The localization of a global commodity (Oxford & New York).",
