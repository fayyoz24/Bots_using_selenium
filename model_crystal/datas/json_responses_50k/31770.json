A game that transforms tensions in communities into opportunities for positive transformation. It brings together the community mobilization power of the Oasis Game and the systemic work and depth of Process work. We have developed and applied the game in 2016 and it has spread across Europe fastly. \n\nGo Deep is a game that is played by any group that is interested in the future of a community. It is a like a journey, where groups of people travel through the cards along imaginary metro lines to deepen their leadership and facilitation skills and create actions and community transformations for everyone\n\n\u2022 Brings awareness about the diversity inside the participant and in the community, welcoming different ways to meet all the different parts inside the person and others\n\u2022 Leads to new ways of thinking, doing, behaving, expressing feelings and offers new patterns of relationship.\n\u2022 Raises awareness of what is needed to transform individuals, groups and communities and how to help that to happen and sustain the change.\n\u2022 Bring fresh ways to work with deep community issues through the game.\n\u2022 Supports the community to enjoy and promote its own growth and empowerment, \n\u2022 Promote the agency and independence of the individuals and community to achieve their own needs through healthy relationships.",
