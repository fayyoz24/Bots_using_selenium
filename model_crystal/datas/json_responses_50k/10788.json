    "summary": "My name is Dave Trienekens, 49 years, father of two wonderful boys in the age of 8 and 12 years.\n\nI see myself as being precise, pragmatic, open, inventive, loyal, responsible, dedicated, constructive, entrepreneurial, out of the box thinking, humorous, pleasant, self improving, social, flexible and a motivator. I am eager to learn, interested in new technology, like to do research, stimulate 'out of the box' thinking and like teamwork.\n\nFor an overview of the skills that I have acquired during my career please have a look at the 'Experience' section.\n\nMy personal interest and objective:\n--------------------------------------------------\nI am interested in the 'Internet of Things' developments. I think it is far from just a hype. Just try to imagine what it would mean when the behavior of a device can be changed, controlled, measured or influenced by any other device surrounding it, in a controlled way. Large networks of devices which are \u2018talking\u2019 to each other. Networks that configure themselves automatically, like mesh networks. The possibilities will be endless in the (near) future. But it also will have security risks. So it requires views from different perspectives. \n\nI think within the next 10 - 15 years there will be a major change in the way we use devices or how devices will serve us. Everywhere. And I think it is exciting. I would like to be at the front-end of technological development, protocols and standards related to intelligent networks like mesh networking and Zigbee in special interest. Application areas like Home Automation, Building Automation, Healthcare and Smart Energy that use wireless technology and IoT will show tremendous growth. It would be great to work on new revolutionary ideas that are actually translated into new products and applications which are directly used by the end customer and affect people's lives, really change something and make a difference.",

This new software driver not only support the new sensor hardware but is also prepared for future developments to run on multiple boards for even more parallel processing power. Interfaces and interaction with other software layers was also heavily redesigned. The complete multidisciplinary project was a collaboration between ASML in the Netherlands and ASML Wilton in the United States. The project required extensive integration of hardware and software and a strong collaboration between different teams in The Netherlands and the United States.

The motion control of the manipulator is based on the \u2018arti\ufb01cial potential \ufb01eld concept\u2019. This technique creates an attractive arti\ufb01cial potential \ufb01eld at the goal position and repulsive arti\ufb01cial potential \ufb01elds at obstacles. The negative gradients of these \ufb01elds are arti\ufb01cial forces which operate on the manipulator and result in torques at the joints. This motion control includes direct kinematics, shortest distance calculations between links and obstacles, force calculations, geometrical force distribution and calculation of the torques",

With the help of a specially developed CD-phantom and an observer, a Contrast-Detail curve can be obtained, which is a measure for the image quality. A CD-curve expresses the threshold detection level of contrast as a function of detail size. Thus far CD-curves were obtained with the help of human observers. The assignment was to \ufb01nd out how the computer would perform as an observer by using image processing techniques. It turned out the computer generated much better CD-curves then the human observer.",
