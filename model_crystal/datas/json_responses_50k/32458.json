            "description": "What a brilliant guest lecture we had yesterday at AMSIB by Mario Brazzoli, IHRM at ING Nederland in Amsterdam as he addressed our first year bachelor\u2019s students from the International Business Program. Mario talked about the importance of taking culture into consideration while doing business. He deftly weaved cross-cultural theories with his practical experiences and examples from living and working in/ with different countries.\n\nHe mentioned five important pointers about culture:\n1.      Culture happens whether you plan it or not. It therefore is important to also consider culture while working on business strategy. A common mistake we tend to make is to assume that \u201cit is the same (experience/ reaction/behaviour) everywhere\u201d\n2.      Culture is learned: to understand culture, understand what the group has in common.\n3.      Culture is shifted and not created: learn what is inside the culture that is positive to reinforce\n4.      Understand others from their context- have the sensitivity to understand how others come from other contexts.\n5.      Lack of awareness excludes people- Be open minded to see things from different perspectives. Have empathy when you interact with others and don\u2019t judge them for how they behave, respond etc. Eg: Even the word \u201cJunior\u201d can mean different things to different people- as a title, seniority etc.\n\nMy key takeaway from the lecture was to be open-minded, respectful and empathetic to those from other cultures!\n\nPersonally, I believe humility and a willingness to admit mistakes/ to learn from them as well as respectfully keeping communication channels open are vital to have a successful cross-cultural understanding/ relationship."
