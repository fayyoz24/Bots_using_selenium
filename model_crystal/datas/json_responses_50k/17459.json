    "summary": "Business-technology specialist experienced in organizing and leading teams to design, build, and deliver high-value sales and marketing solutions. My experience spans three years with The Heineken Company in Europe and Africa. Through various roles, my core responsibility was to bridge the gap between developers and the sales/marketing teams. My deep knowledge of both the business and technical perspectives allowed teams to work together more quickly and efficiently, and ultimately enabled us to deploy higher-quality solutions to our customers. Specific project details can be found in the Experience section of this LinkedIn page. \n\nIn late 2021, after over seven years abroad, I decided it was time to move back to the U.S. I left my job at Heineken, and moved home to pursue my own business venture: real estate investment. Currently, I own and operate a small portfolio of rental properties in Pennsylvania and New York. \n\nPersonally, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, spending time with friends and family, and the outdoors. I love to ski, both on snow and water, as well as ice skate (I'm a big hockey fan). I also enjoy reading, exercising, and other activities that contribute to health and growth! \n\nA few fun facts about me: 1) I've lived on four continents. 2) I played ice hockey for 14 years before moving to Brazil (no ice there!). 3) I once caught a piranha with a bamboo fishing pole (and survived). \n\nWant to know more? Let's have a virtual coffee! I look forward to connecting.",

In this role, I was the technology expert and partner to my colleagues in Marketing with a specific focus on global Smart Creative solutions. \n\nWhat is Smart Creative? Simply put, it's data-driven marketing. Instead of showing the same advertisement (i.e. the creative piece) to everyone worldwide, we used data to make it \"smart\". This way, we could target creative ads to consumers based on their interests. For example, if you were a soccer fan, we would show you a World Cup-themed creative. Likewise, if the data showed you prefer seltzer over beer, then we would push a seltzer creative instead.   \n\nMy role focused specifically on the ongoing (re)design, testing, implementation, and management of Heineken's global Digital Asset Management (DAM) system, and its place in the wider Heineken architecture. It involved close work with my colleagues in Marketing to understand and document their requirements for the DAM, and then work with our external development partners to build and deploy the solution.\n\nCore activities:\n- Launched a complete redesign of the DAM to over 80 countries\n- Enhanced DAM capability with on-demand video editing\n- Orchestrated complex discussions between over 60 stakeholders, both internally and externally\n- Managed external vendors and developers based in Europe and Asia\n- Executed user testing and feedback for DAM and other Martech systems\n- Budget reporting for DAM\n- Maintained a constant customer feedback-and-response loop to troubleshoot issues\n- Built a playbook of global Martech solutions currently available\n- Managed Heineken's global digital experience platforms (interim)",

In this role, I managed a large project focused on Omni-Channel Enablement (OCE). The objective was to use data to increase revenue by targeting sales rep activities in the field. \n\nTo accomplish this, we brought together dozens of independent data sources, combined them with new data we were receiving from previously dark markets, and centralized it all in a single location. From there, we were able to analyze the sales data from POS devices nationwide in real-time, and send sales reps targeted sales activities. This way, reps could focus their limited time on the customers and outlets that required the most attention, and reduce time waste. The outcome was a significantly more efficient and impactful sales force, higher sales volume, and increased revenue for the company.\n\nCore activities: \n- Connected 12+ fragmented data sources to a single source of truth\n- Worked in the field to document user design feedback and improve POS devices\n- Updated new POS systems to fix data quality issues\n- Built a tool to automate customized sales activities for reps",

Shadow I.T. refers to the use of I.T. devices, software, and services outside the ownership or control of the I.T. department. It presents a serious security risk to companies large and small, especially as businesses continue to grow more reliant on technology to operate, and data-privacy concerns continue to expand. \n\nWe solved this with a two-prong approach. First, we implemented online safeguards to detect and block shadow I.T. attempts, and redirect employees to either select a pre-approved tool to fit their needs or to a quick security risk assessment to get their tool approved for use. Second, we raised awareness of shadow I.T. and information security best practices in general. This way, employees could be more security-aware in their daily activities.\n\nCore activities:\n- Investigated to discover how much and how bad the problem was\n- Convinced senior management it was worth investing the time and resources to fix \n- Implemented tool for automated risk assessments of new business tools\n- Centralized a database of approved alternatives to suggest when shadow I.T. was detected\n- Documented requirements and developed an RFP for a new global security awareness campaign",

This included speaking with students formally and informally, collecting feedback, and in general making sure things ran smoothly. This also included anticipating potential issues/questions and finding an immediate solution. If students had an issue with an exam, I would be responsible for gathering feedback and working with the professor to resolve the situation.",

Through this organization, students connected with other social actors, entrepreneurs, and like-minded people, and worked together to develop various projects to benefit the community. \n\nI was responsible for overseeing global operations of the organization, as well as local chapters domestically and abroad. I provided leadership and guidance to fellow board members, advised individual departments on their strategy and direction, and managed relations with external stakeholders.
