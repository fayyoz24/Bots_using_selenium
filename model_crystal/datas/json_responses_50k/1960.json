A smart web of sensors, actuators, cameras, robots, drones and other connected devices allows for an unprecedented level of control and automated decision-making. The project Internet of Food & Farm 2020 (IoF2020) explores the potential of IoT-technologies for the European food and farming industry.\n\nThe goal is ambitious: to make precision farming a reality and to take a vital step towards a more sustainable food value chain. With the help of IoT technologies higher yields and better quality produce are within reach. Pesticide and fertilizer use will drop and overall efficiency is optimized. IoT technologies also enable better traceability of food, leading to increased food safety. \n\nIoF2020 is part of Horizon 2020 Industrial Leadership and supported by the European Commission with a budget of EUR 30 million. The aim of IoF2020 is to build a lasting innovation ecosystem that fosters the uptake of IoT technologies. For this purpose key stakeholders along the food value chain are involved in IoF2020 together with technology service providers, software companies and academic research institutions.\n\nNineteen use-cases organised around five sectors (arable, dairy, fruits, meat and vegetables) develop, test and demonstrate IoT technologies in an operational farm environment all over Europe.

            "description": "Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS)\nTruly complex, designed systems, known as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), are emerging that integrate physical, software, and network aspects. To date, no unifying theory nor systematic design methods, techniques and tools exist for such systems. Individual (mechanical, electrical, network or software) engineering disciplines only offer partial solutions.\n\nMulti-paradigm Modelling (MPM) proposes to model every part and aspect of a system explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s). Modelling languages\u2019 engineering, including model transformation, and the study of their semantics, are used to realize MPM. MPM is seen as an effective answer to the challenges of designing CPS.\n\nWe aim to promote the sharing of foundations, techniques, and tools and to provide educational resources, to both academia and industry. This will be achieved by bringing together and disseminating knowledge and experiments on CPS problems and MPM solutions.\n\n(Descriptions are provided by the Actions directly via e-COST.)",

These included the Television Related Architecture Design for Reliability (Trader project), which was primarily coordinated by the Embedded Systems Institute and Philips and involved supervising two PhD students. Additionally, I was involved in an Aspect-Oriented Software Architecture Design project, which was funded by the Jacquard program of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and involved supervising one PhD student. Finally, I participated in the European Network of Excellence on Aspect-Oriented Software Development project, where I supervised one postdoc.\n\nIn addition to my academic activities, I have also carried out consultancy and education activities for the industry, where I have been able to apply my expertise and contribute to the development of practical solutions to real-world challenges.",

In particular, I introduced and taught several courses, including Software Architecture Design (2), Aspect-Oriented Software Development, and Object-Oriented Programming. Through these courses, I aimed to provide students with a solid foundation in software engineering principles, and to inspire them to explore new and innovative approaches to software development.\n\nIn addition to teaching, I also organized several workshops that were well-received by the academic community. I am particularly proud of the Aspect-Oriented Software Development workshop, which was the first of its kind in Turkey and attracted a significant amount of interest from students and industry professionals alike. I also organized the Impact of Process on Software Quality workshop, which aimed to explore the role of software engineering processes in ensuring the quality of software development projects.\n\nIn addition to my teaching and workshop activities, I also supervised several BSc and MSc students, providing guidance and mentorship as they pursued their academic and professional goals. I also reviewed many software engineering projects for the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcBITAK), where I was able to contribute my expertise and help evaluate the quality and impact of various software development projects.",

Through my research, I sought to develop innovative approaches to this complex challenge, leveraging cutting-edge techniques and methodologies to achieve meaningful results.\n\nIn particular, I applied fuzzy engineering techniques to cope with inconsistencies, developing an approach that has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and effectiveness of software engineering processes. I was able to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of experiments and case studies, which resulted in a number of important publications that have been widely cited in the field.\n\nOne of the key applications of this approach was in the scoping of knowledge sources in domain analysis. By leveraging fuzzy engineering techniques to manage inconsistencies and improve the reliability of our knowledge sources, we were able to achieve significant improvements in the accuracy and effectiveness of our analyses.

Over the course of four years, I had the privilege of regularly meeting with researchers and engineers at Siemens-Nixdorf, collaborating with them to develop innovative solutions to complex software engineering challenges.\n\nDuring this time, I explored a wide range of topics, including software engineering, problem solving, software architecture design methods, quality modeling in software design, and design space modeling. My research resulted in the Synthesis-Based Software Architecture Design Method, which we applied to design an adaptable transaction system architecture for the car dealer management system of Siemens-Nixdorf. This approach was highly effective, and resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness of the software engineering process.\n\nImportantly, my PhD thesis also pioneered the use of the term \"domain-driven design\", which has since become a widely recognized and influential concept in the field of software engineering. This term refers to an approach that prioritizes the needs and requirements of specific domains when designing software architectures, resulting in more effective, targeted, and sustainable solutions.",
