                    "description": "CGI Space: Veilige, betrouwbare en innovatieve oplossingen in de ruimtevaart\n\nSoftwaresystemen voor de ruimtevaart hebben ons al veel belangrijke toepassingen gebracht: exploratie van het heelal, aardobservatie, ondersteuning bij rampenbestrijding en betere navigatie. Met de groei van het aantal satellietapplicaties neemt ook hun betekenis toe. Ruimtevaartorganisaties zoeken continu naar mogelijkheden om hun investeringen meer ten dienste te laten komen van de samenleving. Ondertussen moeten ze zich echter ook wapenen tegen de diverse dreigingen waaraan satellietsystemen en \u2013informatie steeds meer blootgesteld worden.\n\nCGI heeft meer dan 36 jaar ervaring in het leveren van complexe, missiekritische systemen voor de ruimtevaart. Wij worden erkend als thought leader in de ontwikkeling en beveiliging van ruimtevaartapplicaties en werken nauw samen met diverse civiele ruimtevaartorganisaties, waaronder de European Space Agency (ESA). Daarnaast spelen we in Europa een leidende rol als het gaat om het grondsegment van militaire satellietcommunicatie.\n\nVanuit Nederland zijn we betrokken bij het Galileo-project, het Europese programma voor satellietnavigatie. In dit project zijn we verantwoordelijk voor het ontwerp en de ontwikkeling van beveiligingssystemen en het end-to-end testen. Verder werken we voortdurend aan nieuwe diensten op het gebied van aardobservatie en satellietnavigatie. Met onze experts dragen we zo bij aan het vergroten van de praktische toepasbaarheid van ruimtevaartapplicaties.",
