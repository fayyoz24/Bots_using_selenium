This project was initiatied by the National Health Research and Development Fund (ZonMw) in The Netherlands and is a consortium of Erasmus University Rotterdam, Leiden University, Verwey-Jonker Institute and Hosman Prevention Innovation Consultancy.   The reasearch aim of this consortium was to evaluate the empirical knowledge about evidence-based preventive parenting interventions and their core working ingredients.  Within this project I run together with the Jonker Verwey Institute the study on the core elements, factors, and processes  that drive the public and  social impact of these preventive interventions. This was motivated by the finding that such eviden-based preventive interventions have low reach and impact on targeted populations of parents, families and children.  \nThis research efforts resulted in a new and comprehensive IM-PACT model and IM-PACT Management model  providing a theoretical and strategic map to municipalities, local organizations and citizen groups to work collaboratively at improving and maximizing the common public and social impact of local  youth policies, programmes and interventions.\n\nAttached you find our presentation on the IM-PACT model offered during the international online conference of ZonMw titled  Building on Effectiveness Research: Results and Lessons Learned from Research into Core Elements of Youth Interventions, 26 November 2020.",

This also includes consultancy to neighborhood-based projects such as 'Promising neighborhoods' , innovative poverty projects (e.g. House of the Future linked to energiy transition) and Voorgoed Agency Rotterdam (social impact investment).\n\nCollaboratively with city policymakers, we have developed am integrative multilevel model of evidence-based factors of health, mental health and social development in children, adolescents and young adults.  Currently, we are expanding this model to a life span model covering all age groups from - 9 months, birth to elderly.  Related to this model we are building a database of empirical knowledge on the causal influence and long term effects of the incuded factors, based on information from international meta-analyses, review studies and large scale polpulation studies.\n\nNext, in collaboration  with dr. Harrie Jonkman (Verwey-Jonker institute) we developed the IM-PACT Model and  IM-PACT Management model to support municipalities, local organizations, professionals and citizen groups in maximizing the impact of their public health and social efforts to improve the health and developments of citizens. Based on multidisciplinary studies and our own long term participating observations we have integrated in this model a wide range of factors, processes and components influencing  the public and social impact of available evidence-based interventions. Linking these interventions or their working elements with bottom-up initiatives is supported.   (Hosman & Jonkman 2020, werken aan publieke en maatschappelijke impact.

The Global Project is focused among others on understanding the impact of economic recessions and poverty on mental health and its implications for public mental health and social policies. As prevention experts I adviced the Project Committee on options for mitigating the impact of economic recessions ans poverty on mental health using evidence-based prevention strategies and interventions and knowledge from prevention science. This has been summarized in my keynote presentation at the Global Conference on Socioenonomic Crisis and Mental Health, 24-25 of November 2016 in Lisbon (see attached PowerPoint presentation)",
