Many of these were dedicated to important members of ruling families, made for prominent politicians, or read by the ruling classes. Many poems, plays, spectacle, paintings, buildings and public spaces that were experienced as sublime have clear connections with political issues, in particular with the legitimacy of new rulers or regimes, the murder of politicians, or even regicide.\nSeventeenth-century Paris saw an hitherto unprecedented series of vast public buildings and interventions in the urban fabric, from the Place des Victoires and the Place Vend\u00f4me to the Invalides. Such cases of royal patronage caused responses in sublime terms; in fact the King himself, Louis XIV, allowed himself to be represented in architecture and spectacle as the ineffable embodiment of the sublime. The Amsterdam Town Hall is a well-documented, though hardly studied case of the role of the sublime in a public attempt to found and legitimize public authority. Throughout the 17th century the murder of political leaders, in particular the lynching of the De Witt brothers, was the subject of plays much inspired by a Senecan sublime that caused intense debate about the event, and the plays\u2019 artistic value or persuasive effect.",
