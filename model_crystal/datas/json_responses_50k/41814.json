    "summary": "I'm Saltanat (Salt to my friends), a Kyrgyz nomad living in Amsterdam for the past five years. I work as a producer in the advertising and film industries. Most recently as a marketing trailer producer with Netflix at their European HQ.\n\nIn previous years I've been lucky enough to work with some of the leading VFX, digital, and production agencies in the city. It's during this time that I picked up a passion for producing creative content of all shapes and sizes. I've had a great time, and managed to build a strong network of Europe's finest creatives; including motion designers, 3D/2D artists, editors, and brand producers.\n\nDrop me a line, I'm always up for new and challenging gigs within the world of brand, advertising, and film.",
