    "summary": "25 years of experience with programme and change management and management of multidisciplinary and international teams at head office level (with member and board dynamics) and at field office level in Africa. I add most value in mid-size organizations going through a phase of transformation, recognizing that result orientation and human development should go hand in hand. \n\nIn addition, I am analytical; paying attention to detail, without losing the big picture. Challenges make me tick; I do not give up easily, switch quickly between different levels and angles and work in a structured manner. If necessary, I will mention the elephant in the room, while being diplomatic.\n\nPeople describe me as open and communicative, inspiring, humorous, driven and decisive, creating a positive team spirit, realizing great results. \n\nStrong values, an open culture and an inspiring mission are effective means in business, which make me go the extra mile. I strongly feel all people in this world deserve a fair chance to develop themselves in life.",

With their mobility impacting their ability to access health services, North Star thought: if they can\u2019t get to healthcare, then healthcare needs to get to them.\n\nOver the past 15 years, North Star has grown from a small group of people with a good idea, to a mid-sized dynamic organisation which has set up 91 clinics in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. North Star works with more than 70 public and private partners. Built on a foundation of four core values; People Matter, Integrity, Quality and Entrepreneurial Spirit, the organisation has regional offices in Nairobi, Kenya and Durban, South Africa, while the Head Office operates from the Netherlands.  \n\nNorth Star\u2019s innovative model of care is proven, and it works, with the organisation standing on the edge of its next phase of development.",
