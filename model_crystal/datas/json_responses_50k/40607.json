    "summary": "Thanks to my many trips abroad and my studies at ESSCA in the English-speaking world, I am fluent in English and have a good knowledge of Spanish. My mother tongue is French.\n\nI have had two professional experiences in the restaurant industry. They have given me organisation, regularity and efficiency. One in Annecy at \"Le petit paradis\" and the other in Lyon at \"La maison restaurant\".\n\nI did an internship in the real estate and finance sector at \"ginkgo\". This internship was beneficial and revealing for me because I was able to confirm my interest in these two sectors. During my internship, I did market research and financial analysis. I also went to Marseille with the company's team to visit a future construction site for a large real estate project.\n\nFor my second internship, I had the chance to do it in Latin America. Within the ECOM group, I was in charge of analysing projects related to sustainable development and customer relations. With my internship supervisor, responsible for sustainable development, I was able to visit suppliers and farmers and learn on the field (cocoa, coffee fields). Improving my Spanish, my knowledge of the cocoa and coffee supply chain, finding sustainable solutions and analysing the results obtained were the aspects that most nourished my experience.",
