    "summary": "I am a recent graduate of Erasmus University Rotterdam's Master's degree program in Cultural Economics and Entrepreneurship, and I am currently searching for a new opportunity and challenge. I am fascinated by the areas including intellectual properties, Non-Fungible Tokens, licensing, and branding for both research and market practices. I love to see and participate in how art and culture are brought to people's lives through the market.\n\nBefore my master's degree, I experienced the licensing business as a brand manager in South Korea. By managing and supporting the foreign and local brands, I familiarized myself with the intellectual property business, the market structure, and the different colors and strengths between brands. However, I still had a thirst for the bigger picture of the scene and the economic principles behind it - which led me to further exploration on Cultural Economics.\n\nIf you want to talk to me, don't hesitate to send me a message. Looking forward to connecting with you!",
