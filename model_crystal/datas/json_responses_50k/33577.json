    "summary": "- OPEN FOR WORK IN HARDERWIJK FROM APRIL \u2010\n\nI am a driven teacher who is motivated by the sense of being meaningful. Diverse teaching skills have been developed through seven internships, working as a tutor and years of teaching in regular primary school, montessori school and special education. \n\nI teach with joy, understanding and a bit of humor. Learning should be fun! Each day offers new insights. \n\nMy kids, in my class, learn to think about what they want and why they want something. They will think about how they can apply what they have learned, because learning should be meaningful & useful.  \n\nThey will be motivated to have a voice, stand up for themselves, and explore their ways and trying things out.\nI always look for the positive things in my kids and motivate them to believe in themselves, be confident. They are allowed to make mistakes, fall, learn from it, maybe say sorry, stand up, and try again. Trial and error works for me. \n\nPractice makes perfect, right? \nEven though perfect doesn't exist for me, but you know what I mean. \n\nOf course the kids also need to learn how to listen, follow instructions; in life you don't always get it your way.\nI think being flexibel and thinking positively in solutions helps you get through uncomfortable situations, more easily and with less frustrations. \n\nMy kids learn how to work hard and play in teams, while they also learn how to be independent and take initiative; help isn't always around and life can be tough. Yes, already teaching them to make their own choices, and take control of their own life at young age. \n\nI rather see myself as an inspiring coach, who provides information and tactics, so my childre  can take in what they need, they use what they want, and have their own learning journey. They are responsible for their own growth and they can always ask me everything. \n\n'Succes is a journey, not a destination.'\n\nI love to believe that I can make a small difference for young learners in their journey of becoming autonomous, educated, confident, responsible, (self-)loving human beings, day by day - together with the school, the caretakers and the community. \n\nThe children are our future.\nEvery bit helps.",

We planned to travel around the world simply with our backpacks and would settle down at some place if our hearts belonged there, maybe to work, maybe to help, maybe both. We started in south Vietnam and traveled to the north by motorbike. We take the time to explore the nature and culture. The world has become our home. We adapt to, and respect places, and people we visit. We are grateful to have these opportunities and try to live conscious: minimal waste, less plastic & reuse plastic, eat vegetarian, no waisting food, no overeating and recycling. We love to hike in the jungles and climbed great caving systems. We also visited my mom and my 98 year old grandmother in Vietnam and helped out several weeks. This was confronting, but also beautiful. Glad we could help and bring laughter. After Vietnam we took a surfing course in Lombok. I overcame my fear for water. You just don't give up! Never. After Lombok, we continued our travelings around Malaysia by motorbike. Getting around by motorbike gives us opportunities and local insights. Malaysia is beautiful for its divers culture. There are still many authentic places untouched by tourism. The hikes in the jungles and mountains of Malaysia are astonishing and we started collecting garbage on our way down. Something we would like to give back to mother nature (or not). We've seen more wild animals than other places we've been before. We are excited to explore more beauties of Malaysia, but now is just not the time: A COVID0-19 pandemic has arise. It hurts, people. Please stay safe everyone.",

After the summer I got my own combination class of 6th, 7th and 8th graders. It was an adventure, a challenge, and an eye-opener. This experience included a new way of teaching, tracking and coaching young learners. Innovative! Increasing pupils' intrinsik motivation, confident, own responsibility, and care for each other and environment, is my personal touch. It was an incredible worthy year. I learned a lot.",
