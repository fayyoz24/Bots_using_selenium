For instance, how does a teacher cope with the stress associated with a high workload? Will he give some high achieving children substantial attention, while disregarding the others ('creaming strategy')? Or will he for instance ration all children, giving them all less attention, but equally divided? \n\nThis project is being executed in close collaboration with prof. dr. Victor Bekkers (Erasmus University Rotterdam) and prof. dr. Michael Musheno (UC Berkeley). \n\nThe EU FP7 Marie Curie Grant allows me to become a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, for the full academic year 2013-2014. Here, I will combine psychology and public administration research to develop - with others - a new research line on the 'psychology of public administration'. ",

The project will not only analyse the drivers and barriers social innovation, but also the actual outcomes of these innovations.

For example, many Dutch secondary school teachers cannot identify with the policy program called the Second Phase. This is of concern as, for effective implementation, some identification with the policy is required. \n\nI examined this problem by using the innovative concept of 'policy alienation'. One product is a measurement instrument to examine the degree of policy alienation of professionals. This can be used by policymakers, leaders and managers to assess and enhance the support for a new policy.\n\nTitle PhD Thesis: Policy Alienation: Analyzing the experiences of public professionals with new policies.",
