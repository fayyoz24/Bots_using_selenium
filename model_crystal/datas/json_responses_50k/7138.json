    "summary": "I spend my time and thoughts on the online world. The company I helped start, Opportunities MENA, is all about using online networking and research to understand more about closed off cultures.\nI love researching and understanding new ways of using the internet to find information I require.\nMy experience as a researcher and as a media and communications major, allows me to combine the two worlds into the new age of social networks. My strategy is using my network and online communities to find out any required information.\n\nI love people, and most of my time is spent talking to people and sharing my knowledge, both online and in person. I travel a lot to the Middle East and Africa to grow my network and share my knowledge of the vast world of the internet. I believe that there is no place I can't reach or person I can't talk to using the internet.",
