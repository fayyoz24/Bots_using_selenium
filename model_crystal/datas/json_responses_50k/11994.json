    "summary": "Hello everybody, \n\nI am Dragos, Senior Coordinator at MAATT - Strijders in de Installatietechniek - Covebo Uitzendgroep\n\nI've always been passionate about working and talking to people, and I've been doing that for a long time.\nThat's what I did both in Romania, when I offered legal assistance, and that's what I'm doing now in the Netherlands from 2018 until now, I work with people.\ud83d\ude03\nFor several years I work with peoples of different nationalities, different cultures and they trust me and tell me openly their career stories, their life stories. Not only do they trust me with their career story but they also have the confidence in me to find the best match for them with a new potential employer.\nIt is exciting, pleasant and at the same time stressful, but I have the greatest satisfaction once that perfect match has been made.\n\nI am convinced that a match is made based on the person, not on that piece of paper. Are you a TECHNICAL TALENT and ready to take the next step in your career? \n\nThen do not hesitate to contact me !",
