    "summary": "I am an experienced food scientist with a Msc degree of Food Technology. I am especially interested in healthy and sustainable food product design, including design of customized/medical products for the most vulnerable consumers (such as: infants, elderly people). I have an experience in New Product Development, pilot plant set ups, human trials, static and semi-dynamic in vitro digestion, thermal food processing and NMR metabolomics. Moreover, during my Bachelor degree and work in AIESEC organisation I gained knowledge and developed skills for sales, management, communication and budget planning. In my future work I would be happy to combine my interests. If you have any suitable positions, please do not hesitate to contact me (sylwia.bajdzienko@gmail.com).\n\n",

We have won a first price in the Ecotrophelia finals in the Netherlands and have presented our product during International Food Exhibition SIAL 2017 in Paris. We have also presented the Green Leaves Spread for the Queen of Belgium, during Sligro Food Innovation Centre opening (2017).\n\nIf you want to know more about Green Leaves Spread, please visit our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/greenleaves.nl/",
