    "summary": "The sustainability challenges we are facing today ask for a different approach, in which the balance between nature and humans is restored and value is more equally distributed. My goal is to create a positive social and environmental impact in the world and I love working on complicated challenges, particularly systemic issues such as deforestation, child labor, and the living income gap. I have researched these challenges from the perspective of international development as well as from the perspective of multinational corporations. I am convinced that the latter can play a significant role in transforming markets to sustainability through their supply chains. With a creative and critical view, I want to optimize processes and bring people together, and ultimately help create the innovative solutions that are necessary in the transition to a more sustainable world.",

The construction sector can, being one the largest producers of CO2 and waste, significantly contribute to CO2 reduction and resource depletion. In accelerating the transition to circular construction new forms of collaboration in the supply chain and a shift in behaviour of the actors involved are vital. With a multi-sited ethnography approach, I will study the sense-making of formal and informal rules in projects, and practices of collaboration in circular construction projects. As it will be action research, I will work together with practitioners in the field and look for possible interventions to contribute to the breakthrough of the transition agenda for circular construction.",
