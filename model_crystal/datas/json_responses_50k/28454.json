    "summary": "An enthusiastic, motivated young woman who is always eager to learn. That is me! I graduated with honors from three studies: a bachelor\u2019s in Educational Sciences, a master\u2019s in Learning and Development in Organisations, and a master's in New Media Design (a specialization track of Communication and Information Sciences). \n\nNext to my studies, I have always took all possible opportunities to further develop myself. Several side jobs, volunteering work, a board year, and more. Because of the combination of different studies and experiences, I have a wide range of knowledge and I offer a fresh, solution-oriented perspective. Besides, I have strong communication skills, interested in the world around me, I am full of ideas and have the power to empower others.\n\nWhat gives me energy? Learning new things, helping others succeed and having valuable conversations that really matter!",
