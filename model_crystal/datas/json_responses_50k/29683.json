    "summary": "Advisor Sustainable Industry at the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. In this position I advise companies on grants and subsidies for innovation projects. These are aimed at energy efficiency, energy savings and CO2 reduction. This to achieve the sustainability goals for the industry as written in the Dutch climate agreement in 2050. The target groups vary from SMEs that design prototypes to large companies (multinationals) that want to make significant investments into their sustainable transition.\n\nI am familiar with all industrial sectors and in the field of circular economy and recycling. I also have some experience with start-ups and financing (seed funding). Graduated as a chemical engineer, I consider myself a generalist with a focus on technology.\n\nI am a positive, eager to learn person who looks beyond the horizon and brings those experiences to my work. Strong in the process, but I keep an eye on the goal. Is it not as it should, then it must be as it may. I do not shy away from new challenges and experiences. I can have opposing opinions and advices, but they are also out-of-the-box.\n\nAs a networker and team player I like to socialize. I communicate easily at different levels and I'm open to different opinions. I get energy from other people's insights and perspectives in the field of sustainability and technology. I am a \"yellow\" person who is well-organized. A cheerful person to work with, but I\u2019m working seriously if necessary.",

In order to accomplish a interesting tour we used the contacts of professors and alumni to ask for a company tour and an explanation of their processes in proces technology or materials science. These trips would enrich our knowledge about the technological performances of Japanese universities and chemical companies, but also to broaden our horizon on their culture and their working culture.\nTo get  an overview of the companies we've visited, please check out our website. Also read the daily reports if you're interested in what we have seen and learned at the companies.",
