    "summary": "How do we communicate with farmers?\nHow do you bridge the gap between farmers and researchers?\nWhat are the interventions to drive change in food systems from the soil to the stomach?\nWhich innovative farming systems work where and how can they drive sustainability?\n\n\nAs a long time organic and regenerative farmer who went back to university these are the questions that run through my mind. \n\nFarmers are always experimenting and innovating. Sometimes the farmers are ahead of researchers and sometimes researchers are ahead of the farmers. Often the two do not interact or communicate valuable information. On my farm we are always innovating, even if it is just little things, but rarely did we know what was happening in the research. This is why I recently went to Wageningen University and Research to better understand what is being researched in agriculture versus what I hear, experience and see happening on farms. Being able to link farmers knowledge and experience to researchers and research to farmers isone way I want to impact the world. \n\nFarming is a complex business and science where understanding many different disciplines are required for success. \n\nHow to have successful farms that are not just sustainable in profits and yields but also in social and ecological services. This is what we have always strived for at my farm. But there are many ways that farmers can reach these goals. I know how to implement and study new farming systems to understand how to best change the food system to seek true sustainability. Understanding the business of farming is critical to keeping farmers on the land while reaching sustainability goals.  \n\nIF you are interested in getting in touch please reach out to me via Linked in or better my email, dhlareau@gmail.com",
