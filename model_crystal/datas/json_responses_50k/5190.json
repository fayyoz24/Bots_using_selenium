    "summary": "Dr. Chris Arts currently holds the position of associate professor in Translational biomaterials research at dept. orthopedic surgery at Maastricht University Medical Centre and Dept. orthopaedic biomechanics Eindhoven University of Technology TU/e.\n\nTranslational biomaterials research is performed for bone healing, infection treatment, spinal fusion and  spinal deformity correction from R&D towards clinical implementation with focus on both mechanical performance and biological efficacy and safety of newly develop biomaterials in animal models and clinical patients. \n\nHigh resolution imaging of bone density and bone microarchitecture (HRpQCT) and imaging of the physiological bone healing proces (PET-CT and PET-MRI) are essential and my part-time appointment at Eindhoven University of Technology offers great opportunities to have adequate support in material characterisation, image analysis with Micro CT and Finite Element Analysis and mechanobiology. \n\nInfection research is research on mechanical performance and biological efficacy and safety in animal models of newly develop biomaterials / coating technology for infection treatment. Secondly, the translation towards clinical use and further assessment of efficacy and safety on these newly developed technologies in patients is studied multidisciplinary. S53P4 bioactive glass is a biomaterial with great promise that we currently investigate in mechanical, biological and clinical projects.Within the Dutch National Science Agenda project NWA DARTBAC we develop material technology to curb antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics. https://nwa-dartbac.eu  \n\nSpine research aims to develop a new methodology to operate scoliosis patients and offer them 3D deformity correction over time, spinal growth and preservation of spine mobility. furthermore we perform research on optimisation of spinal fusion surgery results by developing new biomaterials and design new 3d printed cages. https://prosperosinterreg.eu \n\nThe ongoing development of Maastricht and Chemelot campuses in our area and the link to high tech campus and brain port in Eindhoven with 3-D print infrastructure that is being regionally developed in the south of the Netherlands is the specific area I see my future development as a scientist. In vivo imaging in patients using HRpQCT, PET-CT and PET-MR and FEA modeling will be important supporting facilities required in this transition.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacobus_Arts",

It requires a broad multidisciplinary knowledge and understanding of metallurgy, 3D print technology, computer modelling, mechanics an dynamics, orthopedics, biology, regenerative medicine, animal models and clinical trials.\n\nThe Prosperos project aims to develop personalized, smart, biodegradable and 3D printable implants based on magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) alloys. By accurately scanning the vertebrae with advanced imaging techniques, implants can be designed and printed patient-specifically. This offers enormous potential benefits to the patient in terms of reduced complications and faster recovery times.\n\nThe partners in the projects are (in alphabetical order): Admatec Europe Antleron Brainport Eindhoven Cerapedics Inc.

His Ph.D. thesis at Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen focussed on the usability of calcium phosphate ceramic materials during hip arthroplasty revision surgery with the bone impaction grafting technique. Currently, Chris is working in the field of translational biomaterials research with emphasis on biomaterials for use in bone defect healing, infection treatment and spinal deformity treatment. Furthermore, he is working on the development of high resolution imaging techniques to visualize incorporation and degradation of biomaterials in vivo in clinical patients. 3-D printing of medical devices or implants for bone healing is another one of his research pursuits and currently he is the PI for the Interreg Prosperos research consortium. He has co-authored over 65 publications in peer-reviewed international journals as well as book chapters. In 2018 he initiated the Translational Orthopaedic Biomaterial Interest Group (TOBIG).",

The recently established Research Interest Group musculoskeletal infection at the Orthopaedic Research Society headed by Josh Wenke, Eddy Schwartz and Chris Arts will be a forum where clinicians, engineers, and biologists disseminate and discuss the issues, approaches, and discoveries.  The topic will be broken into prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Clinicians will describe the problems, challenges and current practices. More importantly, their perspective on what is needed to reduce and effectively treat infections will be shared so the audience gains the insight required to target their innovations.  Findings from recent consensus panels on the topic of infection will also be shared and discussed to include a list of \u201chot topics\u201d.  We aim to build a dedicated infection research community presence during future ORS meetings.\n\nThe 2020 meeting will focus on prevention with future RIGs covering diagnostics and treatment.",
