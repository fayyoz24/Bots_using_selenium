As the sustainability team was very new, I had the opportunity to gain insights into all ongoing and future projects and somewhat take part in them. I was supporting my team members in many projects, shared my view points and opinions and had a lot of autonomy over my own projects which were about increasing employee engagement, collecting and analysing scope 1-3 data, competitive landscape research and analysis, and improving eco-product portfolio reporting and more. \n\nIt was a very interesting and rich experience and I have learned a lot on this journey. Nevertheless, I came across obstacles that challenged me. The fast paced and fast changing environment of the scale-up led me to react better to uncertainty and change, and improved my personal resilience & adaptability. \nShifting from being the sustainability to becoming more of consulting/advisory role within the company brought its own hurdles which taught me more about pro-active communication. \n\nOverall, the internship experience has been fantastic and I believe that I can bring many of the learned skills into my future career. \n\nThank you Helloprint and thank you sustainability team for this wonderful opportunity.",
