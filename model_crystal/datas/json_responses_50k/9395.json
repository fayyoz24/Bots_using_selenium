    "summary": "Fine art, mid-career artist, master artist,  catering to the needs of corporate buyers worldwide.\n\nIn my works I show connections between people traveling through life. These works are collected in an archive that shows my own life as a work of art. \n\nDifferent areas such as traveling, music and film are interrelated.\n\nPASSERS-BY\n2021 - 2023 Works painted from snapshots taken daily at train stations from the travelers. I show  the passers-by and the days of my life on the walls of my studio, gallery or museum. Each work is dated, numbered and archived.\nThis series also contains monochromes and diary fragments.\n\nSTARRING\n2018 - 2020 A series of paintings inspired by movies. \nObsessed with film images I made hundreds of photos and translate these into a new language. Actors have an extraordanairy physical expression. These works show man in different situations of existance.\n\nSELF PORTRAITS\nSince 2017 I use a special oil paint recipe with different resins. This provides color strength, durability, and greater clarity and transparency. With this new painting technique I make a number of self-portraits as a traveler and painter.\n\nVOCALS BY\n2010 - 2016 Because of my fascination with music I started to paint a series of abstract portraits on music. I put the power of various pop singers on canvas, using the movement of my body with oil paint in black and white or bright colors. This series has developed the abstract power in my paintings.\n\nWORKING ABROAD\nTo experience different cultures is valuable for me as an artist. \n\n1997 - 2000 I painted portraits, street scenes and landscapes during various trips to  Egypt, Greece and India, which led to new figurations and abstract landscapes.\nTwo of these works have been awarded with the Euregion Art Price 2001, Rijn-Maas-Noord NL / D. The work was regarded original, innovative and authentic.\n\nJE SUIS \u00c0 LA GARE\n1993 - 1997 I painted at ten different train stations in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. This project entitled 'Je suis \u00e0 la gare' resulted in several exhibitions, at home and abroad.\n\nARCHIVE\nThe archive, which now contains more than 097.500 pieces of work, always expands. \nAll my artworks are numbered and related to each other. It is an autobiography which shows my life as a total work of art.",
