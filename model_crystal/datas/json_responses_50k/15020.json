The last one (in Mexico) after it had been acquired by Stryker at the end of 2016.\n\nIn 2016 I have been the workstream lead for the processes Sales Order Management, Warehouse & Distribution, Transportation Management and Global Trade (Compliance) Management for the project \u2018Centrum Bridge\u2019. Objective of this project was to move the supply of products from all OEM (3rd party) suppliers based in EMEA to a newly created Regional Headquarters (RHQ) Warehouse, part of the Venlo CDC. The Venlo CDC started to do the global distribution of these products.\n\nIn 2014 Stryker created the European Regional Headquarters (RHQ) and after taking part in the (Oracle) design, I took full responsibility for all system transactions (Supply Chain function) following successful testing and go-live.\n\nIn 2013 I led the integration into the Venlo DC of the EMEA Distributor\u2019s (3rd party) business. Additional product labelling for countries like Turkey and Russia significantly increased the Value Added Service (VAS) activities  in Venlo. Stryker closed the warehouse in Switzerland.      \n\nIn 2012, after an acquisition from Boston Scientific, I was the project lead for the integration into the Venlo DC of the global distribution of Stryker\u2019s Neurovascular products.\n\nIn 2010 following an internal Supply Chain Optimization study it was decided to change the European business model and Stryker\u2019s first global Tier 1 CDC in Venlo was introduced. Being the Business Architect of the supporting European Oracle solution I ensured alignment with the role of the Central Distribution Center and the newly created Country Satellite Warehouses.
