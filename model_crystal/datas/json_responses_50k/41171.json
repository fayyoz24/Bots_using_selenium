    "summary": "In 2018, I cofounded Hi Live to help beginners make better art. I always wanted to reach out to my role-models and ask them questions. That gentle push is what I needed as a music maker, but I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. That\u2019s why we created Hi Live.\u2028\n\nPlaying basketball for 10+ years on a professional level, in parallel with my studies and a career in the music industry, has helped me in prioritizing and developing discipline and organizational skills. \nI am ambitious, result-driven and willing to continuously improve in order to excel in my career. \u2028I am trying to balance being both goal-oriented and people-oriented. Building strong relationships is one of my key strengths.\n\n\u2028\u2028I graduated at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, where I earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business and Economics, as well as a Master\u2019s degree in Marketing.\u2028 I played basketball for over 10 years at the highest level in the Netherlands and various National selections. During my time studying at Erasmus University, I started producing music under the name Bobby Rock. I am still actively releasing music as Bobby Rock. In 2019, I started a new alias with 2 friends under the name Zero Days. Our first release is planned for January 2020.",
