    "summary": "I am interested in numerical modelling across multiple disciplines such as fluid dynamics, atmospheric science and aerospace engineering. Uncertainty quantification is another active area of interest that is useful in obtaining much needed improvements in predictions of e.g., climate models by integrating information from observations. Currently, I am developing a probabilistic surrogate model to predict the climate impact of aviation NOx emissions.\n\nI enjoy building stable mathematical models (numerical schemes) for physical phenomena from scratch and also improving existing ones; which I do, using my programming skills in Matlab, Python and Fortran. I have also validated numerical models in fluid dynamics using experimental techniques such as Hot Wire Anemometry (HWA) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).\n\nI am well accustomed to work effectively; individually and as well as in a team.

The lack of closed form solutions in most cases continues to provide a strong incentive to seek stable and consistent numerical methods. This report deals specifically with the mixed and hybrid finite element formulations; ideas that were originally developed in the 1960's for problems in linear elasticity. Hybrid formulations have very attractive properties but are plagued with non-physical singular modes known as Spurious Kinematic Modes (SKMs). This report is devoted to the development of a hybrid scheme in linear elasticity that is free of SKMs. In the scheme, both the stress fields and kinematic fields are treated as primary variables and can hence be obtained together while also satisfying the equilibrium conditions throughout the physical domain. Subsequently, it is shown that optimal convergence is obtained for the stress and displacement fields. A versatile scheme is setup such that it can be solved efficiently by parallelisation of the system. Finally, an idea is mentioned regarding the extension to fluid dynamics.",

The project initially deals with the relatively simple Newtonian model by working on the Rayleigh-Plesset equation which is derived from the conservation of mass and the Navier-Stokes equations. The set of equations were solved with and without taking into consideration, the effects of surface tension. This method was then extended to a more general equation model that could be used to solve for several viscoelastic models such as Maxwell's model, Kelvin's model and Jeffreys' model. Later, these principles were then applied to predict and study the dynamics of nanobubbles whose cavitation properties may be employed to destroy or at least weaken malignant cancer cells during laser therapy.",

Along these lines, I created a research dataset using sophisticated climate models and an assignment related to the climate effects of aviation. The dataset consists of cost-optimal and climate-optimal transatlantic flights for an entire year and the assignment concerned the formulation of relevant research questions and an attempt to answer them using data analysis and a thorough perusal of relevant literature. The work was carried out by 10 Aerospace engineering bachelor students (2nd year) under my weekly supervision. The students had their first experience of research and produced a scientific report of high quality.",
