I learned a lot about how to market to a different culture, support teams with more expats than locals and supported the teams through Agile Transformation.\n\nNot only supported the 3 leads but also the team of Lead Assistants of 32, we were there as a team to support each other, implementing change and improving and streamlining processes.\n\nThank you Spark | Grant, Tania and Nathalie and Lead Assistants!",
