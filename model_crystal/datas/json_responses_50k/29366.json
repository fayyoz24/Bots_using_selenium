    "summary": "15 years of experience working for film festivals and I'm working for 10-12 festivals per year. \nI do mostly filmcontrole - inspecting the incoming screening formats before the projection and preparing them for the projection. I have a lot of knowledge about different digital files and DCPs. Working for so many different festivals also gives me a good and up-to-date overview and know-how of what formats and mediums are suitable for the projection at the festivals. I developed my own workflow of inspecting, managing and projecting in digital cinema. I know what works and what not. What might go wrong, when and how to prevent or fix it. \nIn 2020 film festivals started to move online or hybrid edition so I adapted to the new situation but have not changed my way of work: always analysing, finding out what works and what not, finding the best solution for each customer, event or festival. \n\nContact me if you need anything involving:\n- DCP creation (digital cinema package) - check out our website www.greendcp.nl\n- DCP repair (broken DCPs, issues with file formats) \n- DCP revision and administration\n- handling video files, inspection, conversion\n- video tapes revision\n- film and video projection on location\n- digital subtitling\n- live video streaming (panels, webinars, Q&A, introductions to events, film programs etc)\n- advice or technical support\n\nContact: polona@greendcp.nl",

So it's a way of converting video material to the digital cinema standard DCP format by using green energy. Green energy is produced by water, wind or sun and we don't consume animal products, so our production is very climate friendly. Providing advice to the film maker about delivering their film to a film festival along with a reasonable price makes it human friendly way. \n\nWith more than 15 years of experience in the filmcontrole department our speciality is delivering the right format for the film festivals. Working as a DCP doctor (fixing problems) at big international festivals I've seen the biggest mistakes possible and also many problems that could have been avoided. The DCPs mastered by Green DCP played with success at many festivals as well as small distributions. \n\nDuring corona film festivals moved the screenings online so we built and tested our own online streaming studio. We offered streaming of live events in a similar way as the \"normal\" festival screenings: walk-in slides, introduction, films, Q&A. The streaming studio is now rebuilt for DCP production, but Zoom support for online events is still available. \n\nWrite us if you have any other questions: info@greendcp.nl or check out www.greendcp.nl",

On April 1, 2021, the network will now launch the newly developed online portal THIS IS SHORT (www.thisisshort.com), which will make the respective festivals' content as well as new joint content\u2014including an online competition for European short films\u2014accessible on just one platform. With this project, the ESFN, one of seven EU-funded film festival networks, is formulating a counter-model to the fragmented film culture on the net.",
