This will learn students to go through the entire design process of a vehicle, including production and the testing of the final product.\n\nBriefly it comes down to this: within semester 3 you will, in a team context, design an economical  vehicle as possible. In semester 4 you will build and test this vehicle with which I participated in the HAN Eco-marathon at the end of the course. In the marathon the teams will compete to see who uses the least energy and who has designed and build the best vehicle overall. There is a prize for the team with the vehicle that uses the least energy and there is a prize for the most original/well build/best designed vehicle. The latter prize is decided by a jury.",
