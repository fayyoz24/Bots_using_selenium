    "summary": "As a designer, I enjoy delving deeply into the context, human behavior, and underlying systems to map the stakeholders and system flows, identify pain points, and find a strategic scope to tackle the problem. Thus, I continue to zoom in and out to address the underlying \"whys\" at play. Maintaining a balance between gain and effort for the stakeholders in this process is something I'm constantly thinking about in order to create value for them.\n\nI am also intrigued by the potential impact of new and emerging technologies and am interested to make them revolve around humans by first learning about them and finding ways to utilize them to benefit people.\n\nWith a background in product design, a heart for user research, and an eye out for the underlying system in place, I aim to make concepts concerning technology, people, and business that meet the needs of stakeholders and the systems.\n\nInterested in the same things? Feel free to send me a message! would love to connect.",

The envisioned system uses the input from the patients to learn to understand them by capturing their profile at the start as well as during the care in order to adapt to their needs in terms of coaching and help in their recovery as the outputs generated through different feedback loops integrated into the system in order to personalize the care.",
