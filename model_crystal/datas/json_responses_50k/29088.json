This single molecule technique was used to characterize the behavior of the helicase on a DNA hairpin and on coilable and nicked double-stranded DNA. We also investigated the effect of the single-stranded binding protein E.coli SSB on supercoiled dsDNA in various type and concentration of ions. Furthermore, we concluded that large T antigen assembled on the SV40 origin unwinds DNA efficiently as two seperate hexamers for large applied force on the DNA.\nMoreover, we observed that the binding of SSB on single-stranded DNA indeed plays a role in supporting the helicase activity. Our results are in agreement with the values obtained from other single molecule and ensemble assay experiments and bulk experiments on LTag SV40.",
