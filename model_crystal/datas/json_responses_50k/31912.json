    "summary": "I am a research scientist focused on the fusion between psychology and sustainability initiatives, with a background in project management and execution (Agile Scrum & Kanban). My career shift occurred as a result of working as an aid volunteer for refugees landing on the coast of Chios, Greece (2016-17). These efforts demonstrated that I can use my skills to save lives. I have refocused my professional life toward tackling people issues, so as to have a positive impact on society (and non-human creatures). \n\nAreas of interest: cognitions and processes underlying sustainability behaviors, using ecological frameworks (e.g., 9 Planetary Boundaries, Donut Economic Model, Earth3 Model) to inform psychological research and curriculum.\n\nPrior to psychology, I spent over a decade performing rapid product development of complex project using Agile Scrum & Kanban framework at technology, media, and non-profits companies including co-located and remote projects in Costa Rica, Greece, India, Ireland, South Africa and the United States.\n\nI've worked with Apple Inc. ($3M project), ABC/Disney tv ($3-6M per tv episode), Avon ($14M promotion) Phoenix Pictures (Rocky, Shutter Island, Black Swan, etc.), MTV, DirecTV, Reba, Taylor Swift, Silver Pictures (Matrix films, Predator films, etc.) Keith Urban, Trisha Yearwood, Jewel, Paula Abdul, Big Machine Records, Burger King, Emma, EMI Worldwide, Mazda Car Company, The National Hockey League NHL, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration NOAA, Provident and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.\n\nA team of inspired talented individuals working toward a common goal can accomplish anything. Such continues to be my privilege to serve, empower and participate with!",
