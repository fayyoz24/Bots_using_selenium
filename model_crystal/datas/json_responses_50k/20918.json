Urban gardens are proposed as a measure for increasing the social cohesion of people who participate in gardening. Additionally, there are many other positive effects on gardeners such as increased physical activity, health, well-being, fatigue reduction, relaxation, recreation, and reconnection to nature. However, only a limited number of people can take part in urban gardening and receive all these benefits because the amount of land is not sufficient for everyone. So, the question is how the benefits of an urban garden such as social cohesion and others can be extended to all residents of a neighbourhood. Garden aesthetics affect all people living in the area: they may not be engaged in gardening, they may also not participate in social events and meetings linked to the urban garden, but they definitely can see a garden every day and have some opinions about it. However, there is a lack of research that studies these effects. Thus, the main goal of this paper was to study the impact of urban garden aesthetics on place attachment of non-participants. Two gardens were selected by using the list of 'cues to care' for this purpose. The Q methodology was used to solicit opinions about the importance of garden aesthetics and their influence on place attachment. Three factors with different levels of place attachment were derived by using the tripartite model. The study concludes that there is a correlation between urban garden aesthetics and place attachment which depends on the following criteria: maintenance, diversity of plants, and garden visibility through the window or from the main entrance.",

But what is a home in a small Danish town and what does it mean to be at home in Skagen? \nI was surprised that \u201chome\u201d can tell so much about the owner you have never met before. However, you have to be unbiased during the observation and ask proper questions. It was extremely interesting to try this new method and, based on the obtained information, create an object specifically for that person. In my case, it was a lamp that characterised a mystifying inner world securely hidden from other people.\nIt was my first visit to Denmark. I\u2019ve never heard about Skagen, but I was excited to see the northern part of the country before Copenhagen. I was fascinated with the landscapes around the town. Once in the evening, I went for my regular run. I ran among the sea-buckthorn trees along the sandy road to the sea. The sand sparkled in the sun and was dense enough to run. Flocks of birds flew in the sky, and their cries mingled with the sound of waves. I reached the northernmost point and thought it was happiness. But I turned and saw a huge red sun that touched the horizon. The wind intensified, and the air was filled with particles of the sea. It was fantastic! I ran back through the fields full of mauve heather. Suddenly, two grey ghosts appeared in the grass. Two deer were chasing each other, but also they were running with me. Thank you Onsdagsskolen for one of the best days in my life.\n\nMore details from pp. 26-27 https://issuu.com/susanneeeg/docs/onsdagsskolen_18-19_avis_issuu?fbclid=IwAR2Z2scLOtqkiQLFzBMC-a_2qPD2PgONfhG6R8ALead8Vo9LlIbGSI2DSt8",
