    "summary": "I am a digital creative\u00a0through and through.\u00a0I have more than 11 years of experience with\u00a0high-profile brands\u00a0in the Fashion industry (Tommy Hilfiger & Suitsupply) and creative agencies. My expertise lies in concept development, art direction, Social Media activation, and UI design.\n\nFOR STORY LOVERS:\nDeep in the southern heart of China, in a city known by the name of Fuzhou, lived a young boy, JIE CHEN, an imagination even bigger than anything his mind could conceive. Drawn to everything that touched design and the visual elements of life from fashion to art, Jie drove his passion from grade-school drawings to diplomas. He graduated from Willem de Kooning Academy, at the University of Rotterdam in 2009. With a BA in Communication & Multimedia design, he was now equipped to embark on the journey of his career.\n\nHe laced his work with passion, precision and joy. As a natural communicator, his path very quickly led him to become the digital designer for a large marketing and communications company \u2013 Havas Worldwide (formerly Euro RSCG 4D). Following the leaps and bounds of the digital world, he merged conceptualization and visual interface design to give his clients truly seamless user experiences.\u00a0\n\nAfter a number of years in the digital design sphere, Jie turned to combine his expertise to a previously dormant passion: Fashion. He took off for SUITSUPPLY, the international menswear brand, where he directed the brand\u2019s creative digital agenda. In 2015, Jie took the next step on his path: a career as digital creative for TOMMY HILFIGER, where he took on fresh challenges, from a global eCommerce platform to the Runway show. After 5 fantastic years at TOMMY HILFIGER, Jie is setting off on a bold new path, as the owner of his own creative studio.\n\nTo be continued\u2026",
