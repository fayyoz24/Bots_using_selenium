    "summary": "Ana is the co-founder of Bohemi Digital, a creative marketing agency based in Ibiza with a global portfolio.\nShe is an entrepreneur and a problem solver - you will find her having dinner in a restaurant and while enjoying food she would come up with ideas on how the restaurant could increase their revenue by making small adjustments on the menu or in their service. She does achieve this online - by building websites that convert and fulfil her client's goals.\n\nShe starts with the end in mind and focuses on the objectives of the business and then finds the most effective ways to achieve them through digital marketing.\n\nShe lived in more than 5 countries, including USA, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain and has a Masters in Economics and Business Administration. She worked 10 years in 5 star luxury Hotels but when she turned 30, she decided to challenge herself more, quit her job and studied web development because she was curious about how technology works. She became a Full Stack Web Developer and a Career Coach in IT, supporting others to follow their dreams. \nShe believes that we can achieve anything we wish for in life when we are clear about where we want to go.\n\nBefore starting her own company, she worked as an E-Commerce Engineer, helping companies build their online presence through Web Design and Conversion Rate Optimisation.\n\nBesides building professional websites, she is driven by the business strategy meetings she has with her clients, helping them grow from an idea and a passion, to a profitable business.\n\nShe is a hopeless romantic and turned her passion of creating luxury unforgettable romantic experiences into a successful business. If you are in Ibiza and are looking for something unique and spectacular to do, check out Ibiza Secret Picnic - a luxury picnic company dedicated to create bespoke experiences, also specialised in designing the most romantic marriage proposals. \nWebsite: www.ibizasecretpicnic.com \nEmail: info@ibizasecretpicnic.com",
