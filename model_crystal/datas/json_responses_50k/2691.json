    "summary": "I am a professional musician, improv trainer, and researcher based in Groningen (The Netherlands). My passion is creating things from scratch and developing playful and creative practices for and with groups. \n\nDuring the past 11 years of Improv experience - both learning and training others myself, I have become aware of the potential of this art form, as it teaches essential skills for personal and professional life: being a better listener, becoming a better team player, thinking outside the box, dealing with uncertainty positively, not judging yourself or others, and accepting mistakes or unwanted outcomes.\n\nFor this reason, Improv is a basis in all my teaching methods. I provide soft skills training, but I also use it in much more specialized areas, such as helping musicians improve their stage presence and expressiveness (PhD research), or coaching them in how to enhance their creativity and find innovative formats for their concerts. I have also been running creative educational workshops for kids nationally and internationally for several years (creating things from scratch with kids is always so inspiring!). \n\nWhen I am not doing any of the above, you can probably find me on stage and behind the piano as an actress and the resident pianist of the improv comedy group Stranger Things Have Happened.",
