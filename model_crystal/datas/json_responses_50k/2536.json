The project focuses on the cruise port area, and the goal of the design is to provide a new identity to the Kusadasi coast line, by giving a more attractive look to the cruise port. These changes aim at making Kusadasi coast line the focal point of the city.\nThe approach to the project begins with the site analysis, which involves the whole waterfront and the inside areas. Moreover, there was a need to create a variety of services, lacking in the area, such as continuous connective paths for vehicles, cyclists and pedestrian, resting, eating and touristic points, as well as a gathering square.\nThe main challenge is the organization of all the cruise port services and facilities, since they have to be located in a zone that is going to become the centre of the city. Currently the project site does not have an important role concerning the city life, however with the new proposal, the locals and the visitors\ncan use the space and create full year benefits from the port.\nThe building functions and facilities are hidden by a green terrace, which is for public use, passengers as well as citizens. The specific feature is represented by possibility of being a structure in use for 12 months per year, thanks to the mushroom structure shelters that offer a shaded spot during the hot season.",

The research approaches included: spatial, socioeconomic and governance assessments which ultimately led to the development of a strategic plan and recommendations for the political decision makers and other agencies. The baseline assessment used both primary and secondary data in the form of stakeholder engagement to desktop reviews and even a simulation exercise which aided in development of neighbourhood profile. The spatial assessment demonstrated how the physical transformation of neighbourhoods can contribute to inequality in the case of Ijsselmonde both socially and economically. On these tenets the study was further developed. \nThe scenario building utilized two variables from each thematic area to project how an increase and or decrease in either can affect the city, demonstrating 4 possible outcomes for each thematic area. Stakeholders were particularly important throughout the entire process, but the conference/workshop in particular, was dependent on the feedback gained. The feedback given was used to develop a strategic plan that would address some of the more important issues identified. \nThe strategy addressed issues of capacity building, raising awareness and livelihood opportunities through urban agricultural initiatives.",

We are based in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Stockholm and Thessaloniki. | www.stipo.nl | \n\nWithin Europe, we are the co-founder of the European Placemaking Network, and of the network re:Kreators.\n\nWe are initiators of The City at Eye Level, a worldwide programme for improving cities, streets and places. We let buildings contribute to the quality of public space with their ground floors (the city at eye level). We turn streets, plazas and areas into places where people feel at home and want to stay (placemaking). With local communities, we develop and implement strategies for human scale in cities, area development, streets and plazas (co-creation). The method combines use, design and organisation (software, hardware and orgware).\n\nWith knowledge as a fundament, we help cities and their partners to develop strategies to create and improve their own great City at Eye Level. We share our knowledge open source, online and through the City at Eye Level books. | www.thecityateyelevel.com |",

                    "description": "The objective of the research is to explore the spatial inequalities through Complex Land Markets in 4 cities in Uganda and Somaliland. It will investigate the urban transition of these fast-growing cities by assessing the role of urban land markets, being understood as multiple and complex in producing or reducing inequalities. The research seeks to develop a more holistic understanding of how these cities work as and within integrated systems. In this understanding, the social and legal components of land markets institutionalise diverse practices of land transactions presenting an informal-formal continuum. CLM is an institution that has substituted to a significant extent the merely formal, partially dysfunctional land governance institutions.",
