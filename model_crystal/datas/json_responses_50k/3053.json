Over the past 2 years, I have been working for Mercedes-Benz at the Customer Assistance Centre in the United Kingdom Customer Services Department. While working as a CSR I have perfected my Customer Services skills and Negotiating Talents. I hope to continue my career by moving into another fast passed and success orientated company. Ideally this will be in the Biomedical or Health industries, which I have studied academically.  ",
