    "summary": "Over the course of 18 years I have had the privilege of using my finance and accounting background across numerous industries and countries. \n\nStarting in public accounting in the United States I became an auditor and CPA. I utilized my accounting and finance skills as a senior analyst for a global manufacturing organization before moving to Abu Dhabi where I worked with Formula 1, the Auto Touring Club of the UAE, and provided accounting and logistics for an Abu Dhabi based tourism company. \n\nMy journey then took me to New Zealand where I spent nearly six years working in the not-for-profit sector first as a finance manager and later as the chief financial officer of an organization that provided over ten million dollars annually to various charitable causes in New Zealand. \n\nThrough my experience and leadership I transformed the finance department into a paperless office and oversaw a technology overhaul that moved our operation into the cloud during the 2020 pandemic which allowed for a \"work anywhere\" office. I have extensive experience with remote and hybrid working models as well as extensive use of Microsoft Teams and Zoom. \n\nI also became a Power BI subject matter expert and used my knowledge to build and maintain dashboards and reports that were used throughout the entire organization. I'm now based in Rijeka Croatia and Groningen Netherlands where I split my time and work remotely as a Power BI specialist. \n\nI hold an active US CPA license, have over 5 years of Power BI development experience and have the right to work in New Zealand, the United States, Croatia and the Netherlands.",
