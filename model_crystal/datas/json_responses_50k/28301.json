    "summary": "I am currently undergoing an intensive Bootcamp from Springboard. During the Bootcamp, I will be trained as a UX/UI Designer. My passion is to develop aesthetically (UI Design) and functionally (UX Design) digital products to achieve user, business, and product goals.\n\nThe success of a user interface depends 50% on the UX process and 50% on industry knowledge. This is why I chose to specialize in manufacturing and automation.\n\nI recently wrote, designed, and published a 168-page Technical Sales Manual for BMO Automation. This document contains all the expert knowledge in the automation of CNC machines.\n\nI am currently working as a UX/UI Designer with a multidisciplinary team on BMO Xenon - A platform to dramatically improve manufacturing companies' productivity. It's great to see all my expertise in automated manufacturing now being applied to make BMO Xenon a success.\n\nI enjoy having interesting conversations! So would you like to speak sometime about UX/UI Design, manufacturing, or automation? Please send me a message! \n\n\n\nTools: Figma, Figjam, Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Creative Suite, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Microsoft 365, MS Visio\n\nSkills: UI/UX Design, User Experience (UX) Design, User Interface (UI) Design, Product Design, Interaction Design, Design Thinking, Lean UX, Design Sprint, Agile Scrum, Qualitative Research, Interviews, Observations, Quantitative Research, Research Synthesis, Empathy Mapping, Personas, Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD), User Journey, Research Presentation, User Stories, Site map, User Flows, Workshop facilitation, Low-fidelity prototyping, Sketching, Guerilla Testing, Mid-fidelity prototyping, Wireframes, Wireflows, High-fidelity prototyping, Design Systems, Component Library, Usability Testing",
