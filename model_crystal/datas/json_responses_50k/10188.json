    "summary": "I am a PhD student at Leiden Observatory working on radio astronomy and cosmology. My PhD projects cover ionospheric calibration, giant radio galaxies, the synchrotron Milky Way, and the synchrotron Cosmic Web.\nRecently, my team and I have discovered Alcyoneus, a giant radio galaxy of at least 5 megaparsecs (16 million light-years) long, which we report in Astronomy & Astrophysics. At least in projection, this is the largest known structure made by a galaxy! https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05427\n\nMy main other academic interests are biology, mathematics, and physics.\n\nYou can read more on my website: http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~oei/.",

This effort will lead to a state-of-the-art reference atlas that is unprecedented in terms of sensitivity and resolution in the mid-to-low frequency range (300 - 500 MHz) of the radio spectrum. The 400MUGS database will thus strengthen the science of near-future telescopes and surveys like Pan-STARRS, JWST, eROSITA, LIGO / VIRGO and LSST. Also, on itself, 400MUGS will drive forward a wealth of science cases including, but not limited to, the study of AGNs and their contingent alignment with large scale structure, polarimetric detection of magnetism in galaxies and extragalactic environments, and the characterization of hitherto unknown transients, high-redshift radio galaxies and pulsars.\n\nIn this project, I work on improving the advanced data pipeline that will be used for 400MUGS, which is polarization-enabled and has features to mitigate the effects of ionospheric turbulence. Also, I act as a Principal Investigator (PI) for the acquisition of uGMRT data to test this pipeline.",

            "description": "The radial velocity (RV) method is one of the most successful approaches applied so far to detect exoplanets. Rapidly rotating and asteroseismologically active stars prove to be more challenging targets for this method, as the stellar spectral line profiles become not only broadened but also asymmetrically perturbed in a time-dependent fashion. In this project, we aim to attenuate the effect of noise caused by stellar pulsations on RV data in order to improve the accuracy by which planets can be found. As a case study, we examine data of Beta Pictoris, which is known to be orbited by a giant planet that has hitherto escaped RV detection.",

In this project, we simulate and build a prototype of a new type of wavefront sensor (WFS) using the differential Optical Transfer Function (dOTF) technique. The expected advantage of the dOTF WFS approach over other methods is its low cost and relative simplicity.",
