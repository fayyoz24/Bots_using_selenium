Our digital infrastructure allows our clients to design and customize their own luminaires, place an order and received the 3D printed product on their doorstep in a matter of days.\nAll this is possible by using a modern software backbone that links all the required processes together. The diversity of technologies, languages and frameworks used here provides learning opportunities on daily basis and it is one of the biggest reasons I decided to join my team. In any given day I might implement a new feature in the Spring Boot java backend, update the API with a new REST endpoint, add a new topic to the RabbitMQ instance, tweak the  React GUI, update the Python software that controls the printers while deploying everything to Docker containers with docker compose.\nThe domain being so vast, here are some of the main technologies used:\nLanguages: Java 11, Python 3, C#/F#\nFrameworks: Spring Boot, .Net\nDatabases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL\nMessaging: RabbitMQ\nUI: Angular 9, React js\nOS: CentOS, Raspbian, Windows\nDeployment: Docker",

With this much traffic and a limited number of people to control it, delays are bound to appear. Along with the delays that are felt by both airlines and passengers, other factors like rerouting increase the fuel used and hence the operational cost.\nTo counter these shortcomings  Eurocontrol decided to intervene by creating a new communication platform that will cater to both Airline Operators and ATCs.\nAt its core this platform will facilitate free communication between stakeholders while offering a solid base of information gathered from multiple systems. It's expected an increased efficiency, reduced delays, saved fuel and money for years to come.\nAs part of the small team that started this project  I had the opportunity to be involved in all development stages starting with the conceptual discussions and feature gathering, going through the architectural challenges and integration constraints, working with business analysts while applying UX principles and putting it all together by implementing the first version of the application.\nThis project is built mostly on the open stack using Java  and JavaScript.\nThe backend is served by the Spring Boot framework while the front end is written  using Angular5  with Google Material Design components and Bootstrap 4. For persistence the DB of choice is PostgreSQL and for fast development and testing the in-memory H2.\nThis project offered me the opportunity to research the UX part of things. By using Adobe XD to generate mock templates we were able to iterate quickly through quite a few UI designs and test workflows before any code was even written. This saved us a lot of time.\n\nTechnologies used:\n\nProgramming languages:\nJava 8\nSpring Boot\nJMS\nJUnit\nTypeScript\nAngular 5\nHTML\nCSS\n\nDatabase:\nPostgreSQL\nH2\n\nContinuous integration:\nJenkins\n\nStatic code analysis:\nSonarCube\n\nSource Control:\nGit with Bitbucket\n\nCollaboration:\nJira, Confluence",

I mostly focus on backend development but often enough I find myself also in the position of the frontend programmer.\nDepending on the project I work as part of a team or take full ownership of the code. I found out that either way the best feeling you can have at work is when you start getting things done and when the TODO list loses entries.\nMy company takes a modern approach to the organization of teams and work load by implementing the agile methodology. Usually what starts the work day is the Stand Up / Status meeting in which everyone states their progress and their plan for the day. The division of work one level up is done by using sprint.\nRegarding the technologies I'm proud to say that I'm using Java 8 features and not just compiling legacy code with Java 8. Because most projects are done from scratch there is enough room to push for the use of modern languages and frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data and Oracle 12g DB on the backend while on the frontend side writing javaScript code with Angular 2, Node.js, Type Script and CSS.\n\nTechnologies used: \n\nProgramming:\n             Java 8\n             Spring Boot\n             Spring MVC\n             Angular2\n             TypeScript\n             NodeJs\n\nIDEs:\n             IntelliJ Idea\n             Oracle SQL Developer\n\nDatabases:\n            Oracle\n\nSouce Control:\n\t\tGit with Gerrit\n\nCollaboration:\n\t\tJIRA, Confluence",

The company's main focus was the development of an application sweet for the big, franchise driven corporations that activated mostly in the food industry.\nWe built applications from the ground up and my team was right there starting from the \"ground\" phase. We were making sure that all the necessary conditions were met and the foundation was there so that the frontend team could present real and useful data to the user.\nWe worked closely with the DevOps team on one side and the frontend teams on the other side creating the middle ground.\nWhile the process was mainly agile we were also acting as the R&D when the project was asking for such an endeavor. Because of that I got to work with multiple different technologies some of which I hadn't had the chance to work with.\nOn some projects I worked with Node.js on others I worked with Java 8 and Scala. I got to work with modern and relevant frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring Data, Jersey and Swagger and I got to try new ideas with frameworks like Vert.x . The APIs I was creating were mostly REST APIs and I was getting the work data from databases like Neo4j, H2, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.\nI usually was taking part at the client meeting where specifications where gathered and progress was presented.  \n\nTechnologies used:\nProgramming:\nJava 8,\nNode.js (javascript)\nPython\nFrameworks:\nSpring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Swagger, Jersey\nUnit testing:\nJUnit\nDatabases:\nNeo4j, MongoDB, PostgreSQL\nWeb Servers:\nTomcat, Undertow\nVersioning and Bug Reporting : GitHub",

I also get the best of the two worlds Software and Hardware by working in the IoT realm. For my position I was asked to become proficient in using PTC\u2019s own IoT platform called Thingworx. After reaching the sufficient level of knowledge I was designated trainer for this platform which opened a lot of new opportunities of meeting current or potential clients but also colleagues from all over the world that were eager to learn about Thingworx. I had travelled for teaching purposes in countries like Germany, Finland, Portugal and India.\nAnother aspect of my job is working on real life projects for direct customers and with this I was able to actively participate to the architectural development as well as the managing side of the project.\nOne of the most fun parts is coming up with new functionality for the platform extending it in order to meet the customer\u2019s needs. Also IoT offers me the chance to fully use my background by allowing me to work with sensors and electronic boards like Raspberry pi and Arduino.\nIoT being such a dynamic environment right now, the technologies I come in contact with are very diverse:\nProgramming languages: JAVA SE 7/8, JavaScript, C, .Net, Swift(objective C), Python\nServers: Apache Tomcat 7/8\nServices and communication protocols: REST, MQTT, SOAP\nDiverse databases: Neo4J, DataStax Enterprise, MySQL, PostgreSQL\nOS: Windows, Linux, OSX\nBoards: Raspberry Pi, Arduino. \nIDE: Eclipse, NetBeans, MS Visual Studio, XCode",
