Antibiotics play an important role in the management of these aquaculture infections. However, antibiotic resistance readily develops in pathogens following antibiotic treatment. Plant foliage of Bidens pilosa and Ocimum gratissimum were collected and tested for antibacterial potential against the Aeromonas genus in fish using the standard disc diffusion method and spread plate technique.  Foliage extracts from both plants showed significant inhibition to the bacteria growth (14.33 \u00b1 0.58mm to 13.00 \u00b1 2.00), with MIC and MBC range of 0.03gl-1 to 0.13gl-1. ",

Habitat provision is a water quality dependent ecosystem service and forms the basis for biodiversity. As water quality deteriorates, so do habitats, and ultimately biodiversity.  Using benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators, this study was conducted on the river Rur in Germany, to determine the effect of land use on the water quality and habitats in the three sub-catchments of the Rur. These were along a gradient of increasing catchment area under agriculture and urbanization, the Upper Rur, Inde and Wurm. Macroinvertebrates were sampled and habitats scored using the Rapid Bio-assessment Protocol standard sampling method. ",
