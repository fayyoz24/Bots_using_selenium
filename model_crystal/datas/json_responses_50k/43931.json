    "summary": "I work as a PhD student at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF in Davos, Switzerland. Here I investigate the mechanics of weak snowpack layers.\n\nI  finished my master thesis in the Soft Matter Group which is part of the Institute of Physics in Amsterdam. I followed the Advanced Matter and Energy Physics (AMEP) track of the master Physics and Astronomy. Because of my love for physics I tutor high school children and give them private lessons in mathematics and physics.",
