Eberhard had to step down because of illness in September 2017. Within four days, we hosted substantial inclusive applause with around 1,5k visitors, complete with 'Eberhartjes,' that originated from my design and has caused a movement of people using the concept: my favorites were the bakeries creating 'eberhartjes' cookies.\n\nFurthermore, I had the pleasure to successfully create a societal campaign for Centraal Beheer (Achmea), the biggest insurance company in the Netherlands, and come up with a direction for the future role of Centraal Beheer in The Netherlands. \n\nThe BKB Academy is a selective, one-year program that introduces 25 talented students to the world of political and social campaigning. It consists of monthly workshops and lectures by politicians, journalists, and campaign managers and a study trip to elections abroad.",

A lot of the performers come from a background that does not include education and/or support in their dreams and talents. \n\nI never saw this as something I 'had' to do. It really was volunteering in the essence of the word: a person who freely offers to undertake a task. That moment of having dinner together was very valuable for all of us, including myself. Exchanging stories and of course: a lot of laughter. \n\n"
