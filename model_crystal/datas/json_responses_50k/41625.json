    "summary": "I am a strategic, collaborative and results driven leader with over 10 years in executive management positions within the financial services sector. As an expert in leading strategy and risk management programs within a large, highly regulated and corporate environment, I have been a key driver in leading structural improvements, information gathering and decision making, managing risk strategy and building empowered, highly motivated and focused teams. Examples of outcomes achieved to date include: creating the company\u2019s first organisation-wide strategic plan, successfully facilitating business transformation / change strategy, significantly reduced risk profile and improved overall operational efficiency.\n\nAs a leader, I am fair, driven and focused on delivering on corporate objectives. In the last 5 years of my career in particular, I have demonstrated an innate ability to provide leadership, innovation, governance, and management required to identify, evaluate, mitigate, and monitor the company's operational and strategic risk, through the development and implementation of risk management tools, practices and policies.  With an intimate knowledge of the businesses vision, resources, processes and clients, I am able to ensure optimum compliance and deliver strategies aligned with achieving corporate goals and objectives.\n\nSpecialties: \n\u2714\tChief Risk Officer \n\u2714\tRisk Management\n\u2714\tBusiness / Strategic Planning & Implementation\n\u2714\tChange Management\n\u2714\tBusiness Transformation\n\u2714\tProcess Improvement\n\u2714\tBusiness Improvement\n\u2714\tContinuous Improvement\n\u2714\tRisk Strategy\n\u2714\tRisk Analysis\n\u2714\tResource Management\n\u2714\tTeam Leadership\n\u2714\tTeam Building\n\u2714\tProgram Management\n\u2714\tProgram Planning \n\u2714\tP & L Management\n\u2714\tStakeholder Liaison\n\u2714\tStakeholder Negotiation \n\u2714\tOrganisational Change\n\u2714\tProcess Re-engineering",
