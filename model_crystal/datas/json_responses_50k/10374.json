The challenge revolved around the question of how students can become catalysts of local innovation in Enschede's neighborhoods. Our solution is the Enschede Innovation Toolbox. It makes the abstract design process easier to grasp by representing it as a tangible and systematic roadmap, which can be followed easily by both multidisciplinary student teams and inhabitants of the city of Enschede. While aiming to establish connections between organizations, students, and inhabitants, we use local knowledge to tailor the design process to Enschede itself. By doing so, it supports students in becoming catalysts of innovation in Enschede.\n\nhttps://www.enschedelab.nl/bright-idea-studentencontest-levert-handenvol-mooie-concepten-op/\n\nhttps://www.utwente.nl/en/designlab/news/2020/7/694243/winners-design-contest-put-master-inserts-theory-into-practice\n\nContributors: Sefora Tunc and Nora Tunc",

I developed a novel scenario-based design framework based on empathy, value-sensitive design, and subjunctivizing transformation analysis. I am one of the first people to conduct a co-design study with a member from the SMA type II population; to the best of my knowledge, no literature was available at the time. Additionally, I conducted research on making complex design tasks more accessible to users, by studying the underlying mechanisms of associative and creative thinking.",

This award was granted during the Intelligent Interaction Design module of the Creative Technology bachelor's program, which revolves around user experience, grounded design decisions, evaluations of interactive systems, and artificial intelligence. For the HCI project, the interactive system SopraNOsolo has been developed. SopraNOsolo is an asymmetrical game designed for siblings of which one is neurotypical and the other has social and collaborative deficiencies caused by an autism spectrum syndrome. The learning goal is to enhance social and communicative behavior.  One of the players has to traverse a platform, while the other player cannot see what is happening in the game. The blinded player has to arrange the music notes in between the platforms to build bridges which can be crossed. The correct sequence of notes will result in hearing a familiar melody after stepping on top of them. Through communication and cooperation, the two players can complete the level together.\n\nThe design decisions have been based on various interviews with experts and stakeholders, low fidelity prototype confrontations, and heuristic evaluations.\n\nContributors: Kevin Folkertsma, Marloes ten Hage, Ikmareka Hunt, and Maaike Keurhorst",

Hence, the objective of this study was to research the stimulation effect of electrode orientations during monopolar DBS. Previous studies have assumed that the anisotropy of white matter could be neglected in brain tissue models to estimate the influence of DBS. The current study inspected whether this simplification was justifiable, by examining the sensitivity of DBS to electrode angles in both isotropic and anisotropic brain tissue models. The results showed that the volume of tissue activated (VTA) in the isotropic model showed little variability throughout all electrode rotations from 0-90\u00b0. Conversely, the activations in the anistropic model showed greater selectivity to the electrode angles, with a lower overall VTA. Hence, simplifying the conductive properties of brain tissue by neglecting the anisotropy of white matter could overestimate the VTA of DBS.",

The published deterministic model [2] was used as a starting point. All other numerical algorithms that led to a reproduction of the results of [1] were developed by ourselves. This includes constructing the bifurcation diagram, simulating the stochastic (bistable) model, and determining the success rates of neurostimulation along various timestamps in an epileptic spike-wave discharge. To further build upon the results of Taylor et al., we quantified the intercycle variability of successful absence seizure abatement. By doing so, we determined the optimal timing for neurostimulation with the highest success rate.\n\n[1] Taylor PN, Wang Y, Marc G, Justin D, Friederike M, Ulrich S, et al.
