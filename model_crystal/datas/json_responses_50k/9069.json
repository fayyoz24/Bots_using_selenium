    "summary": "After  High school in 1976, I  chose  for  French and English and obtained  my bachelor\u2019s degree for French in 1986. Beside, being a French teacher for several years,  I set up a French conversation course. \nDue to the lack of vacancies, I did jobs on voluntary bases; Like writer of letters of mediation at Amnesty International,  a presenter of the local radio news for a year, a Dutch teacher for refugees for two years and  as a  legal aid  and  interpreter  for French and English at the council for refugees until 1995. This was preceded  by a  training.\n\nThe novel  Interview With The Vampire inspired me to start  writing my book Eleonore in 1994, which relates a part of my life story and serves as a serious warning against raising inexperienced ghosts.\nAs I  can\u00b4t stand injustice, I also undertook actions like helping to put an end to the hostage-taking in Lebanon through correspondence  and contacts of mediation with authorities, embassies, and the families, a petition on the street to prevent the capital punishment of a Philippine servant who had killed her boss out of self-defense in Saudi Arabia.\n \nMeanwhile, as I took more interest in film and acting,  I  played  a part  in a reconstruction of a missing in a Dutch television program via an casting agency  and as a walk-on in several theater performances  in 1997  In 2004 I joined  a  theater performance which was located in a bus garage  with people of all classes of society, coached by some English directors.\nAfter  a training of dancing, improvising, theater techniques, music and expression, we set up \u00a8 Bus stop Vechtstraat\u00a8,  we performed with great success four times a week during three months.  \n\nThen I  joined stage 32 in 2005 and finished my book Eleonore,  which was published in  2007 by Raider Publishing International. It led to a lot of fuss media attention  which was my purpose. \n\n In the same year,  I  followed  an online screenwriter\u00b4s course of Dave Trottier and finished my first screenplay, St. Martin\u2019s Secret in 2007. I embarked on several scripts. like Lost Family Ties and  the three parts of The Vampire Mysteries. An urgent message of Dolphins during my meditating on them and being a keen environmentalist,  obliged me to write Heaven\u00b4s Revolution, which is about the threats to our planet, cruel oppression and the loss of freedom. I finished this project in 2021 followed by a shorter one , The Sign  which is about the revolution of sea life toward the junk in Earth\u00b4s oceans.   My work addresses social topics centered on mutual human relations \u2026 with just a touch of magic!",

The ocean is a vital ecosystem for all life on our planet, as it provides us with oxygen and has a very rich biodiversity. Action Groups like Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd \u2013 who do their utmost to save threatened marine life, stop overfishing, and fight for healthy oceans \u2013 propelled me to explore these characters.\n\nWHY DOES THIS FILM NEED TO BE MADE NOW?\nThe pollution and extinction of marine life will have serious consequences for all life on our planet. It will cause a catastrophic domino effect; as plant and animal species depend on each other. I chose the Covid-19 period because at that time many plastic masks and gloves were thrown into the oceans and Mediterranean. I believe this film will bring awareness about the pollution and motivate people to clean up the oceans.\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe oceans are huge and beautiful, full of animal and plant life. But junk \u2013 in massive amounts \u2013 pollutes the oceans and harms their inhabitants. Marine life gets fed up with humans throwing trash into their home, and these angry animals revolt. An eager team of oceanographers exposes themselves to danger to save the animals from fishermen who are determined to capture them.",
