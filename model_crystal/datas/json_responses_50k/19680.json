In this perspective I closely collaborate with the Dutch performing arts' scene, with festivals and venues in The Netherlands and abroad, but also with stakeholders like ministries (foreign affairs and culture), Dutch Culture and Dutch embassies.\nTo stay up to date about the developments in the performing arts, I watch - still with a lot of pleasure and enthusiasm - approximately 150 performances a year.\n\nBetween October 2014 and January 2022 the programme of Fonds Podiumkunsten that I worked for, was called Dutch Performing Arts.",
