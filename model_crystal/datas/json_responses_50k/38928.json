The exhibition strives to spreading the word about nanotechnology, and start a discussion about the possible future we're heading into. For the new call of products my Energy Belt was selected, to be futured in the new exhibition starting at the Dutch Design Week 2012. The Energy Belt is a belt which uses the natural processes within our bodies to burn excess body fat and convert it into electrical energy. The belt gives a new perspective on fat, where it isn't seen as a liability but as a possible usefull source in de future?\nPress the above link for a preview of the Energy Belt at Llowlab, Lowlands Festival",

We are continuously surrounded by waves, but we never see them.\n\nUntil now! Because here, at the cradle of radio and television, sound waves are being visualized. Whistle, clap, talk, sing or scream and see the waves you produce yourself. Experience how waves travel through space and bounce off the walls. Discover how different tones also produce different waves.\n\nWAVES is a world premiere. The project is based on the sound imaging technology of Sorama, which is commercially available in the brand new 1024 microphone Sorama Cam. WAVES is a joint effort of a team of 9 students of OPENLIGHT: the creative lab of the Intelligent Lighting Institute of the TU Eindhoven, and a team of 15 sound experts and software developers of Sorama, a spin-off of the TU/e that is located at Strijp-S. The result is a unprecedented interactive lighting visualization.\n\nThis 6-week project I performed as part of the student team from OPENLIGHT at the TU/e. We were responsible for the conceptual development of this installation, as well as the design of the visual appearance, experience and the first version of the visualisation code used. \n\nThe installation was originally developed for the light spectacle 'GLOW-Next' in Eindhoven, but has since then been at multiple events among which the Dutch Design Week 2014 as part of the exhibition 'Mind the Step'.",

We try to bring nano technology to the public and start a debate about the future. \nIn the NANO supermarket I work as a host, I welcome the visitors and guide them through the exhibition, answering questions and trying to provoke a discussion and activate their own thinking. I try to make them aware of the fast changes in technology and the impact it might have on their everyday lives. My goal is to try and get them to formulate their own opinion on these matters in an active engagement, questioning and discussing the products exhibited in the NANO supermarket.\nNext to being a host, I've also been given the opportunity to design a product for the NANO supermarket, which is now featured in the new line of products.
