    "summary": "With over twenty years of working experience for companies and foundations in Asia, Africa and Europe, I have built up an extensive track-record in leading multi-cultural teams and organizations, stakeholder engagement and in facilitating multi-stakeholder partnerships - mostly in the sustainable agri-food sector. I have a wide Dutch and international network. I am skilled in strategy development, organization/program design, multi-stakeholder engagement and setting up partnerships, managing intercultural teams, board engagement, and PR and external communications. My passion is engaging businesses in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. I am a creative thinker, problem solver, communicator and match-maker.\n\nAfter having worked in Myanmar for two years (2018-2020), I re-joined the Access to Nutrition Initiative again as Program Director in November 2020. In this role I'm responsible for overseeing the program team that manages various company accountability projects with the aim to increase companies' contributions to fighting malnutrition in the world. I'm responsible for stakeholder management, including companies in the food sector, NGOs, policymakers, academia, international organizations, funders and\ninvestors. The Program Team also covers ATNI's communication activities and donor relations. Between 2014 and 2018, I have also been engaged with ATNI as Senior Program Manager.    \n\nIn Myanmar I have been working for the World Food Program. I was responsible for founding the Scaling Up Nutrition Business Network: a network for companies in the Myanmar food sector with the aim to contribute to access to healthy diets. In addition, I was doing short-term consultancies, including coaching the Senior Leadership of a global Dutch feed company in designing, implementing and communicating a new responsible business strategy for its Myanmar operations, contributing to reaching the SDGs. \n\nBefore 2014, I worked as team leader for the Sustainable Value Chain Team of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in Amsterdam, advising food companies and (I)NGOs in Africa and Asia, and I worked for four years in Laos and Vietnam (manager/consultant for EU, ILO, WorldBank). I started my career working for Unilever in supply chain management.\n\nIn my free time, I am member and secretary in the Board of Nedworc Foundation, a Dutch social Enterprise that sustains and develops Dutch international cooperation expertise, and I write columns.",
