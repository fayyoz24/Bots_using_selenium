    "summary": "I didn't start coding at the age of 12. In fact, I wasn't into technology at a young age. My use of a computer was limited to paint and solitaire. Now, I am writing code to process complex data and extract useful information that is meaningful in healthcare.\n\nDuring adolescence, instead of investing time in understanding technology, I spent it practicing sports. From team sports such as basketball and football to individual sports such as swimming, surfing, and kickboxing. I loved every time I started something new: getting to know the people dynamics, learning new rules and techniques. I was all about experimenting new things. \n\nMaximizing the variety of topics I would be exposed to was also a reason for enrolling in Biomedical Engineering. From Physics to Physiology, from Biomechanics to Biology, with some Computer Science in between. Another reason was that I would engage in meaningful work.  Developing solutions that allow healthcare practitioners to achieve great patient outcomes keeps me motivated to work hard. \n\nDuring the BSc, I had my first experience with programming. I was not looking forward to it as I was scared that my lack of engagement with technology would be a disadvantage. It wasn't. I learned to enjoy programming and have used it for image processing, and data analysis. My perspective on technology changed and I am thankful to be able to get the most out of it.\n\nWith time, I felt I should focus on specific topics. My interest in medical imaging and the excitement of an international experience led to an MSc in Diagnostic Imaging and Instrumentation in the Netherlands. Moreover, this allowed me to do two internships and a thesis, hence, more exploration. It was during one of these internships that I had my first experience in applying AI to the medical field. I fell for it due to how meaningful the work felt and how much there was yet to uncover. Therefore, I spent the last 1.5 years diving deeper into the field. \n\nI hope this leaves you with a clearer picture of where I came from, and what sparks my interest.  \n\nFeel free to connect :)\n",

This model is to be implemented in the Trauma Department.\n\nWhat did I do?\n- Explored an open-source X-ray database to understand its characteristics and whether it could be used to train a deep neural network that would then be implemented in the Trauma Department. \n- Used pandas, Keras, matplotlib, and scikit learn.\n- Analyzed the results from performance metrics.\n- Implemented recently developed network visualization techniques that allow a better understanding of the model's 'thought process'.",
