    "summary": "I am currently leading a team of approximately 25 professionals who are active in the field of research and advice in the marine and coastal environment. Our main drive is to provide research and consultancy expertise, experience and tools to support complex planning processes with engagement of stakeholders, in which the interaction between the natural, socio-economic and institutional system is necessary. Core topics are i.e. Blue Economy, climate adaptation and resilience, DRR, adaptive planning and plastics from source to sea. Furthermore, we develop and apply tools such as FIAT and Agent Based Modeling to provide information and perspective to our clients. \nI am a connector who enjoys coaching my employees to further develop themselves and enabling them to do meaningful work that has an impact on society. I have a background in marine ecology and policy and have worked as a researcher/consultant on these topics at Deltares on a range of national and international projects.",

We were divided into couples and were split up over 4 different towns close to Tamale, where we filled in for teachers but also contributed to sustainable education, sharing experiences from the Netherlands to Ghana, but also from Ghana to the Netherlands. As a result of my background, I focused the classes I taught on science, but also gave English and math. The preparations included the organisation of funding for the trip and materials we needed, visits to Dutch primary schools where we set up theme days on Ghana, as well as the organisation of field trip for the teachers in Ghana itself. It was an amazing experience! "
