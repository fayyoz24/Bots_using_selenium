Experienced in leading teams, presenting, administrative work, critical thinking, and finding creative solutions to problems.\n\nI've been working in retail since 2017, that's where I get my sales and service experience from. I gained leadership skills when I was promoted from restocker to shift leader. I had to introduce new employees and show them the ropes of restocking empty shelves, in addition to that I got the opportunity to train a selection of employees to become shift leaders so they could assist me when necessary. This was a great experience for me because I could test my ability to see potential in them and let them further develop.",
