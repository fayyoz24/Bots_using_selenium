    "summary": "A highly motivated analytical thinker and conscientious researcher, with experience in research and analysis of cross-border serious and organized crime, human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Having gained experience working both for the European Union and the United Nations, I bring policy-oriented and evidence-based research to every project. My passion for law enforcement cooperation in criminal matters and intelligence analysis has led me on a path to career development in the crime research field. \n\nI have a proven ability to apply research methods and analytical thinking to various crime areas and I can adapt my knowledge to related technical fields. I am experienced in applying OSINT research tools and techniques to support the production of intelligence notifications and threat assessments. Subject-specific research expertise includes trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, the impact of COVID-19 on organized crime, corruption, cybercrime, illicit trafficking of counterfeit products and links between civil unrest, organized crime and terrorism. I have supported the production of global flagship reports, such as the Global Organized Crime Index and the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons. \n\nI am genuinely curious about connecting the dots and identifying patterns, trends and insights from a variety of subjects. Throughout my academic career, I examined global challenges in the context of geopolitical, historical and social developments, and gained research expertise in regional politics and security dynamics in the MENA region. \n\nI am multilingual and thrive in a highly international environment. Being one of the twenty students selected to participate in an intensive academic and internship program in Globalization and International Affairs in New York City, I gained first-hand experience in the work of the United Nations at UNHQ. \n\nOutside the academic and professional fields, I enjoy dedicating time to community projects and volunteer work together with my Rotaract family. I firmly believe in and care about the achievement of SDG 4 quality education and SDG 2 zero hunger. When not reading about psychology and human behaviour, you will find me jogging, painting, or planning my next trip to a new place.",

As data becomes larger, more complex and more dispersed, new ways and tools for optimizing the use of OSINT could become increasingly in demand, such as quantum computing, machine learning and even the use of the metaverse.",

            "description": "The purpose of this research project is to analyze the response of the Russian Federation vis-a-vis the enlargement agenda of NATO in Georgia. First, an overview of the Russo-Georgian conflict is given. Thereafter, the theories of structural realism and cognitive geopolitics are outlined and linked to the research puzzle. The empirical part of this project applies the variables of power distribution and perception of decision makers to explain the foreign policy of Russia towards the enlargement agenda of NATO in the case of Georgia. First of all, the findings of this study show that Russia was compelled to shift the power distribution in the 2008 Russo-Georgian war by creating a frozen conflict. This foreign policy action is explained through the structural realist approach. Secondly, the results show that the response of Russia is influenced by the perception of decision-makers in Russia, who see the expansion of NATO as a security threat. This aspect is explained through the prism of cognitive geopolitics. Finally, the project concludes by incorporating the structural realist approach with the cognitive dimension, proving that both theories are necessary in order to coherently explain the response of Russia vis-a-vis the enlargement agenda of NATO in Georgia.",
