After achieving repeatable results showing the existence of a high quality bio-oil from wood with an increased conversion of heavy hydrocarbons into CO2, a second phase allowed the production of a larger amount of oil, which would be further analyzed at the facilities of the other partners of this project.",

Next, using CFD tools, chemical reactor theory and concepts of turbulence in macro and micro scales, a set of performance metrics were proposed and used to analyze different operating conditions in the mixing tanks. This was translated into concrete information such as how much the residence times of streamlines deviate from the average residence time, how efficiently the energy dissipates from the mixers into the water, or the existence of dead volumes and bypasses that affect the system\u2019s capacity and performance.\n\nWaterschap Vechtstromen finally received our recommendations which include the use of different mixer speeds and orientations, noting that this would increase the mixing performance without additional power consumption.",

Possible negative effects of this are loss of accuracy of microwave data transmitted with parabolic receivers/transmitters, and increased vibrations.\n- I proposed the creation of a joint maintenance plan between the Control Center and the corporate Maintenance Business Unit for the older towers, given the high criticality of these assets.",
