    "summary": "I'm a lifelong storyteller, motivated by curiosity.\n\nMoving easily between commercial, non-profit, and editorial worlds, I've built campaigns for Levi's, Uniqlo, and Rolex; constructed domestic interiors on soundstages for Nordstrom; tried to keep up with the marathoners training in the mountains in Kenya; and dispelled illusions about facial symmetry in a viral portrait series.\n\nI'm a gamer, coder, photographer, mapmaker, data journalist, a dilettante musician, and a lover of stories written, filmed, or told.\n\nI believe that technology is a force multiplier, a tool to harness surprise, but it's also an inevitable, accelerating force. As we move through these interesting times I'm a believer in the positive power of human creativity at scale. \n\nI'm driven to connect technology with purpose, to tell bigger stories better, and to drive growth with lasting impact. \n\nSelect Clients:\n\nChristie's\nGQ Style\nLevi's\nRalph Lauren\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council\nUS Vogue\nCond\u00e9 Nast\nRolex\nUniqlo",

Each studio shoot required extensive pre-production and story boarding of motion and still components to maximize budgets. I worked as a director guiding a > 20px lighting / camera crew to create assets on deadline. Each shoot had a large cast, multiple lighting and set builds, and clients/managers/vendors on site.\n\nChristie\u2019s NYC, (2009-2021): Photography and creative direction for biannual Postwar/Contemporary and Impressionist Spring and Fall auctions. Working in the galleries and behind the scenes at Christie\u2019s during their highly-profitable auctions, I photographed and packaged materials that attracted sellers for the following season.\n\nRalph Lauren, E-Commerce Photographer (2012-2015): Creative Direction & Execution:  With Ralph Lauren and their studio partner R.R. Donnelley, I built lighting schemes and digital workflows for the e-commerce strategies of their Purple Label, RRL and RLX brands. During this period Ralph Lauren e-commerce sales grew to $3.96 billion.",
