As a manager I set up a team responsible for the recruitment of specialists within the Finance and Accounting specialization. As JP Gray was rolled out through Europe I served as part of the EU Management Team.\n\nHighlights include being awarded three prizes at our annual sales conferences in London: diversified team of the year, team leader of the year and top biller of the year.",
