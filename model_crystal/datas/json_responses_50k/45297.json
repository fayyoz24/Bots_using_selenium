These systems are often targets for criminal groups who exploit vulnerabilities in order to publish their own malware content on otherwise legit web sites. Based on CMS fingerprinting techniques plus Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n(CVE) scan, an automated malware and web site analysis can be made.\nFurthermore, we aim at constructing profiles of known malware and phishing sites so that other websites can be automatically matched against these known profiles in order to automatically classify them as safe or not - including the possibility of identifying and grouping these attacks as coming from the same gangs - and potentially detect zero day vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. These profiles can include information coming from advanced parsing techniques such as e.g. Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This can be attained by using machine learning techniques in order to create dangerous web site profiles which can potentially be enhanced with Semantic web Techniques.",

APT usually targets organizations and or nations for business or political motives. APT processes require high degree of covertness over a long period of time. As the name implies, APT consists of three major components/processes: advanced, persistent, and threat: \n\n- The advanced process means sophisticated techniques using malware to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. At AnubisNetworks we have systems in place that allow to monitor these viruses.\n\n- The persistent process suggests that an external command and control is continuously monitoring and extracting data off a specific target. We also expect this to be linked to botnets that are currently under watch by us.\n\n- The threat process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack and can be seen as a form of social engineering and spearphishing and we believe it to be critical in present and forthcoming attacks.\n\n\nAs a result of this study a sound estimation of what is feasible in the attack world is expected as well as a forensic tool to identify (partly) APTs: forensic evidence of APT or even more interestingly forensic camouflage should be investigated to determine the level of insecurity we have in respect to APT.",

            "description": "In this project, we designed, implemented and accessed parallel versions of algorithms used to perform feature selection for a website classifier. The main contribution was an implementation of an existing feature extraction algorithm targeted to GPUs, more specifically the routines used for the manipulation of the graph used to represent a subject\u2019s structure. In complex web documents the GPU\nversion achieved execution times 16x smaller than the ones of the CPU sequential version.\n\nAnother contribution was a concurrent server that resides in the GPU and offers services related with the processing of relevant features. The server makes an integrated management of the GPU resources. The assessment of the server was made by stressing with a growing rate of requests; the criterion used for comparison was the number of requests droped after exceeding a certain time threshold. The GPU server begins to drop requests when the request rate is 70 req/s; the multi-CPU version drops requests when the rate is 30 req/s. The framework used for building the GPU version can be used in other contexts where the paradigm of submitting a bulk of requests to the\nGPU can be applied. The work done made sound contributions for the enhancement of company\u2019s products and also assessed the technical and economical viability of employing GPUs techniques in other contexts.",
