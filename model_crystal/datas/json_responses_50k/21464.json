    "summary": "Result driven / Reliable / Proactive / Committed\n\nI get energy and motivation from solving problems and from building win-win relationships. I look for challenges and for something new to learn every day. I like listening - active listening - because I truly believe that listening is the key to all effective communication.\n\nI\u2019m an Industrial engineer specialized in logistics and supply chain management. Colleagues know me as a highly motivated person that can always be trusted to get things done and to help out when needed.\n\nInteresting facts about me: I speak fluently 3 languages (and I\u2019m working on my Dutch skills!); I cycled the Etape du tour twice and the Paris-Roubaix once; I spent most of my life in Italy but I also lived in the US when I was 17, and in Spain for a short time before landing in the Netherlands. And...they tell me that I learned to swim before I learned to walk (swim is probably a big word, I should say not drowning).\n",
