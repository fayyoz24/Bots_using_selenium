    "summary": "\"Innovation is successful disobedience.\"\n\nPassionate tech-savvy professional currently helping companies to unleash and scale the power of every team.\n\nI am a sociable, open-minded and talkative person, with a flair for communication: both in formal and informal contexts and within the most disparate cultural environments. I am always prone to discussion with the technical and business side of organisations, being an enemy of traditional functional silos. Problem-solving, commitment and the capacity to take into account different - even if contrasting - perspectives make me a highly adaptive person. \n\nMy interests cover different themes, ranging from disruptive innovation and technologies (Cloud, AI, blockchain, 3D Printing, to name a few) to sustainability and green economy. I am an avid vinyl collector and traveller by design. In general, I am always eager to learn and find interesting growth opportunities related with the next big thing in tech.\n\nKey Competencies:\n\u2022 Public Speaking\n\u2022 Curiosity Selling\n\u2022 Presentation Skills\n\u2022 Personal Development\n\u2022 Teamwork\n\u2022 Business Development\n\u2022 Stakeholder Management\n\n\n\u2709 acolautti@atlassian.com",

Despite the HQ being located in Italy, the company also has quite a strong presence in the American and Japanese markets. The firm is small \u2013 medium sized and its core business areas can be divided in three primary branches.\n1) Embedded pc\u2019s: An embedded system/computer is any computer that is a component in a larger system and that relies on its own microprocessor. \n2) HPC: High performance computers most generally refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business.\n3) Nano pc\u2019s: A nanocomputer is a computer whose physical dimensions are microscopic. The field of nanocomputing is part of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Electronic nanocomputers would operate in a manner similar to the way present-day microcomputers work. The main difference is one of physical scale. More and more transistor s are squeezed into silicon chips with each passing year (whatis.techtarget.com).\nOur case innovation is the machine to machine (M2M) platform. The company innovation was conceived in order to solve the problem of remote asset monitoring through a one-stop solution, something unheard of up until now, as competitors in the field have only focused on one part of the solution (i.e. hardware set up, IT infrastructure implementation, data storage etc.) rather than offering an end to end service. This innovation is also posed to take advantage of the \u201cInternet of Thing era\u201d, which refers to the trend of the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address for internet connectivity. The expectations for IoT devices and applications are extremely high in terms of both potential revenues and growth rate. Hence, we can see how Eurotech is trying to position itself early in such a niche market.\n",

The European Commission estimates\nthat economic losses due to traffic delays total \u20ac150 billion per year in Europe. Based on\ncalculations in Barcelona, Spain, a million drivers spend an average of 20 minutes every day\nlooking for a parking spot, producing 2,400 tons of CO2 emissions. (Smart Parking and\nenvironmental monitoring in one of the world\u2019s largest WSN, p.1)\nThe SmartSantander is a project that is meant to tackle our near future, i.e. to make cities\nmore efficient as 50% of the world population lives in cities and they are a major source of\npollution and waste. The project was carried out in a Spanish city Santander (180,000\ninhabitants) and its goal is to improve the quality of life for citizens and to give residents a\ngreater sense of involvement in the operation of the city. More specifically the aim was to\ncreate a sustainable, efficient, and green city, in which citizens can interact dynamically with\nlocal government and with the services themselves (Cisco 2014).\nThe means for the aforementioned cause are over 25,000 devices in Santander and the\nsurrounding area (sensors, mobile apps, informative screens etc.), which offer various\napplications in areas like public transport and mobility, traffic, environment, pollution, waste\nmanagement, noise control, climatology, security, water management and health care. The\nproject, which officially started in 2010 (building part ended in 2013), is groundbreaking in\nmany ways as it\u2019s the biggest \u201csmart city\u201d project yet, it involves very many stakeholders,\nand because of its remarkable success, it has fostered innovation and further collaboration\nprojects.",

            "description": "The purpose of this thesis is to study and analyse the Indian energy market, with a particular focus on Fuell cell technology. To have a better access to data in order to make a complete and deep analysis, this work is done along with DPS, a fuel cell membrane producer based in Denmark.\n\nDPS currently has a lot of projects, and one of them is about the Indian energy market. Together with this company we will analyse the structure of this market segment in India and see what are the potential applications for this technology. Then we will try to understand what is the best strategy to enter into this market and gain commercial success.\n\nThis thesis wants also to make the reader acknowledged about the state-of-the-art of fuel technology solutions and that this technology, if successful in a developing country such as India, can then have unlimited and profitable applications in developed countries as well.",
