            "description": "Every day around 3000 weather balloons are launched around the world to survey atmospheric conditions throughout the atmosphere. Currently, these balloons carry single-use sensor packages called radiosondes which collect and transmit data. When the balloon reaches its maximum altitude, it pops and the radiosonde simply falls into the environment. With these sensor packs containing lithium batteries as well as other electronics, this is highly unsustainable and with a cost of over 100 Euro per radiosonde, it is also expensive.\n\nTo solve this problem, I am developing a reusable radiosonde. The same electronics of the single-use sondes will be enclosed in a very small glider UAV, which will also be carried up with a balloon, but then will perform a controlled descent back to the sender. This way, the cost of weather balloon launches can be greatly reduced along with the environmental impact.\n\nSo far I have managed to access data on past weather balloon launches all over the world and perform data analysis on it to get an idea of the performance required of the UAV, as well as to evaluate the feasibility of the idea. Following this, I built a simulation environment in Python to test aircraft with different parameters in real world (simulated) conditions, to get a tighter grasp on the specific aerodynamic requirements for the UAV. I have also got in touch with several weather institutes and had an especially valuable call with one meteorologist, to get feedback on the idea and gather additional requirements and design objectives.\n\nFollowing this, I will be trying to make an initial design of the aircraft with simple CFD tools like XFOIL and CAD to start prototyping and testing the vehicle, targeting a test launch carrying used single-use radiosonde electronics some time later this year.\n\nFun fact: Thanks to an enthusiastic community of radiosonde chasers, you can track all the radiosondes in the air right now with radiosondy.info or sondehub.org !",
