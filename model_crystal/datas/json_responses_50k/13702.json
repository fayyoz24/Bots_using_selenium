    "summary": "Having impact in a commercially viable way is what drives me. For years, I believed this could be achieved best as a banker. It explains why I worked in a wide range of (international) banking positions for more than 15 years. When I broadened my horizon, I experienced that impact can also be achieved differently. I became  passionate about the opportunities of connecting social benefits, food systems, water, soil and business, due to my work in the field of holistic landscape restoration.",
