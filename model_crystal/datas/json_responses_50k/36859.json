The construction project has been jointly undertaken by Keppel Shipyard and its sister company Keppel Singmarine. The two companies were responsible for the installation and integration of marine, pipe laying equipment and outfitting. They were also responsible for commissioning the marine systems and conducting sea trials.\nThe ship arrived at Keppel Shipyard in April 2011 for outfitting after being constructed in China. An official naming ceremony for the new build was held in Singapore in September 2012. The pipe layer has been delivered in December 2012.\nIn her first job, the new vessel is being used to perform marine activities for the development of the Jack and Saint Malo (JSM) fields in the US Gulf of Mexico.",
