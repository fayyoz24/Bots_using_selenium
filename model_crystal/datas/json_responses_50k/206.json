    "summary": "Tamasine McNabb is a visual creative from Denmark, based in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Interior Designer and also founder of \u014cERUM Design, she is an aesthete at heart, a dreamer and an all round creative. After 8 years working as an Interior Designer gaining experience at various design studios in both Amsterdam and Dubai, she decided to make her hobby and love for creating art her work.\n\nBeing completely in awe of the world around us, Tamasine is forever inspired by raw materials, craftsmanship and the pure beauty of nature. Tamasine also loves to create a warm and cosy atmosphere in which she believes that art plays a big role; bringing a space together and making it complete. Art is a story, a personal experience and something that you can continually look at and get completely lost in which is exactly what BOKETO stands for. Like her name Tamasine, BOKETO is also Japanese meaning \u201cthe art of daydreaming and getting lost in thought\u201d.\n\nShe is fascinated by Japanese culture \u2013 in particular \u2018wabi sabi\u2019; finding the beauty in imperfection. She is very inspired by the Japandi style and loves to work with natural materials, warm, earthy colours and the technique of mixed media to create her artwork.\n\nOriginating from Denmark and further raised in Tanzania, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Kingdom and Dubai for the past six years, she is an International individual with an open mind, not afraid to take on new projects & challenges.",
