    "summary": "After finishing my master earth sciences cum laude, I started as a research technician in the Physical chemical laboratories of the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam. In this function I have gained management experience while leading a subdivision of the physical chemical lab and being responsible for the planning of all inorganic projects. I advise (PhD/PD) researchers and students (BSc, MSc) with the selection and set-up of lab and field experiments and often contribute to scientific articles. Although I enjoy my current function I would like to change my supporting role in science to a leading possibly by pursuing a PhD.",
