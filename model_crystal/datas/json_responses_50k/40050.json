    "summary": "I am an LLM graduate from Utrecht University, specializing in Law and Technology (Class of 2022-23). I'm passionate about bridging the gap between law and the ever-evolving tech landscape. I have a deep inclination to pursue my career in the field of data privacy and information security. My thesis in the Masters at UU was titled: Enhancing the Online Information Disclosure Paradigm: A Critical Analysis on Data Controllers' Compliance Practices and Remedial Solutions by Policy Reports in the Context of Articles 12, 13 & 14 of the GDPR. \n\nMy recent role at Signify, where I was part of the Privacy & Legal Compliance team in Amsterdam from April to August 2023, allowed me to dive deep into the world of legal compliance and privacy matters.\n\nI hold the title of a registered Advocate in both the Country Bar Council of \"India\" & State Bar Council \"Maharashtra and Goa\". My previous experiences include serving as a Legal Consultant at M&E Law Chambers, Mumbai, and working in the Intellectual Property and Technology, Media, and Telecommunications team at Krishnamurthy & Co (K Law).\n\nIn November 2021, I authored \"12 Quotidian Affairs: Time to Get Your Sh*t Together,\" a self-help book aimed at guiding young individuals through introspection in their daily lives. I have an exclusive tie up with Amazon and the book is available worldwide. \n\nCurrently, I'm pursuing a PGDBM (HRM) course at Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), with an expected graduation date in March 2024. I also hold a BA LLB degree from BACL, Nagpur, graduating in the 2015-20 batch.\n\nBeyond the legal realm, I've organized over 20 Yes Theory Events in India, bringing adventure and adrenaline to enthusiasts across the country. You can catch highlights of these events on YesTheoryIndiaOfficial's YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter pages.\n\nAdditionally, I've had the privilege of being a course instructor at New Learning Horizons, teaching children how to solve Rubik's cubes and play chess.\n\nIn essence, I'm a lifelong learner, a visionary, and someone who approaches life with enthusiasm and zest.\n\nLet's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and grow together.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Stay Connected:\n\nBlog: cappedextrovert.wordpress.com\n\nPodcast: \"Man's Multifaceted Monologue\" on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Breaker, PocketCasts, and RadioPublic.\n\nYouTube: Manank Panchmatia",

It\u2019s a self-help book for youngsters who are ready for an introspection of their own ways of living through their daily routine.\n\nAbout the book \u2013\n\n12 Quotidian Affairs is a book that makes an engaging reading of subjects that are generally laden with prescriptive discourses. Thoughts are the magical carpet which can take a person to the unknown worlds, through uncharted paths, to unfathomable heights, beyond the limitations of resources, reasoning, and rationality.\n\nThere are innumerable ways of looking at life, its values, its purpose, its complexities, its boons, and its banes. Everyone is independently yet coherently taking this journey of life from birth to death although there are co-travellers who seem to be bundled together. But all those apparent similarities are only external and no one else than the individual is able to reach the inner core of that individual.\n\nEach chapter in this book is independent of the other and is centrally based around the themed title. One can expect this book to give them an introspective look at their own ways of living through their daily routine. The book makes quite a lucid reading, with ample examples from various walks of life elucidating the concepts presented therein, in a style that the new-age citizen, the millennial would love to read, comprehend the ideas, and think time and again. This book covers vital aspects of mainstream practical knowledge youngsters are not taught in academic processes.\n\nYou can find the book here - https://amzn.to/3mAPCzM",
