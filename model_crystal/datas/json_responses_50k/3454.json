As Programme Coordinator, I was responsible for proper programme development throughout the organisation, supporting individual country teams on how to formulate programme plans and proposals, making sure they stay aligned with PUM\u2019s strategy and mission. Apart from coordinating internally, I was also a focal point for external programme partners, fostering relations, co-developing consortium programmes, co-authoring proposals to donors, connecting the different stakeholders and assuring established processes are followed properly on PUM\u2019s side.\n\nAs Project Officer within the country team for Mali and Burkina Faso, I administered and facilitated the proper execution of volunteer expert advice on location or remote advice to our clients. This included close collaboration with the Malian PUM representatives who scout for and \u2018acquire\u2019 clients, demands extensive knowledge about the country, its economy and culture, an eye for strategy and planning and a good grip on admin tasks such as arranging travel and visas or working in CRM systems and software such as Teams.\n\nIn addition to these two roles, I joined PUM\u2019s efforts to promote diversity, inclusion and sustainability in all its facets throughout the organisation and to contribute to the development of strategic documents and processes (an improved structure for programmes, guiding documents for programme development, action plan formats, a new ToC, etc.)\n\n\"Yves' academic background in development studies, his command of 4 languages (German, Dutch, French and English), excellent writing skills, along with his investigative and curious mind, are some of his assets that make him extremely suitable to work in a management position in international development, not only at operational but also at planning, management and monitoring level.\" - C.
