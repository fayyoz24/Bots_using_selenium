    "summary": "I\u2019m an HR Generalist who is passionate about improving employee relations and creating work environments that help get the best out of people to deliver great outcomes.\n\nI\u2019ve recently relocated to Amsterdam. Previously I was HR Manager at Options for Supported Living.\n\nA member of the Senior Leadership Team I was involved in strategic decision making and planning for the organisation and HR function, being a major contributor to the organisations ongoing development plan; embedding Options culture and helping shape the focus and direction of the organisation. I was also very hands-on operationally; not being afraid to get stuck in and work alongside my team of 4 direct reports or delegate when appropriate.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve received several awards for business and customer service excellence including a prestigious \u2018people's choice\u2019 award for special contribution, and recently in recognition of my positive impact at Options and support of staff.\n\nMy sales and marketing background has honed my ability to positively influence others, build relationships quickly and understand that people want to be listened to and know their opinion matters.\n\nI believe mistakes are only mistakes if you don\u2019t learn from them and if you focus your efforts on developing and supporting staff to be the best they can be everything else falls into place. Using this philosophy, I recruited, trained, and developed an exceptional HR team; significantly improving HR outputs, resolving previous employee and management issues and establishing a credible and employee-centric focused HR department.\n\nOutside of work, I love reading, with a focus on Personal Development, and learning new skills. I've taught myself to sew, knit, and crochet and have attended evening courses to perfect my dressmaking and pattern cutting skills. I\u2019m currently learning Dutch.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a new HR opportunity in Amsterdam so please get in touch if you feel I'd be a good fit (heidimclean_cv@hotmail.co.uk).",
