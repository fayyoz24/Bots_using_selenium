This project involved taking over and running a professional restaurant for two weeks, with all of the profit going to charity. Running the restaurant involved everything from designing the menu, buying and cooking the food to taking reservations and providing evening entertainment for our guests.\n\nThis project involved a great deal of organization, both before and during the event. Although the restaurant itself only ran for eight days over two weeks, it required months of organization before we could reach this moment. \n\nMy official role in the team was Sponsorship Co-ordinator, making me responsible for finding and securing sponsors to maximise our profit which would go to charity. Our theme for the restaurant was \"home-grown\", so I targeted local farmers who supplied us with fresh produce, either for free or at a reduced rate.\n\nHowever, this was by far the only role I took in the preparations for the restaurant. I took joint-lead in our search for a venue to host our project after our initial hosts dropped out only 5 weeks before the our opening night. Aside from this I also had an important role in promoting our project, and designing a professional menu that was both practical and attractive. \n\nDuring the event I played many roles: I was an assistant chef throughout the day; and in the evenings I worked in the restaurant, preparing and serving food.\n\nThroughout this whole project, I also had the experience of doing all of this in another country. Although the Netherlands is famous for its fantastic English, the language barrier could still pose various problems as my Dutch language skills were still quite basic. This was an extra element which made the whole experience even more interesting!"
