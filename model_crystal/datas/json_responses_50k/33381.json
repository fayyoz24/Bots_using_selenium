The new Amsterdam Marketing organisation combines the expertise of the four existing entities into one dynamic group that is responsible for successfully marketing the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area.\n\nAs a travel trade officer I was responsible for all travel trade activities focused on international tour operators and travel agents. I promoted Amsterdam as a tourist destination by participating in trade fairs (e.g. ITB Berlin, WTM London), workshops and sales missions, organising fam-trips, making the Amsterdam Travel Trade Manual, city maps and other materials, sending out the Amsterdam Travel Trade Newsletter and editing the content on www.iamsterdam.com/trade. Working in close collaboration with partners in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (museums, hotels, etc.) and NBTC Holland Marketing was always key when pursuing our common goal: attracting more visitors.\n\nThe Business Marketing team was also involved in attracting new businesses, meetings and conventions to the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area.",

We developed special theme years (e.g. Amsterdam Water Sensations 2010 and Amsterdam Art City 2009) and collaborated with NBTC Holland Marketing on international consumer campaigns in Europe, Russia, US, China and Japan. One of the highlights was the Cool Capitals campaign targeting the US market together with four of Europe\u2019s other 'cool' cities: Antwerp, Vienna, Valencia and Z\u00fcrich. \n\nBeing part of the project team for 'Explore a different Amsterdam' we set up a multichannel marketing campaign to highlight six different neighbourhoods in Amsterdam in order to increase the spread of tourists across the city. We developed creative visuals and taglines for each area, a special website, videos and 13 brochures in five languages, including audio tours and interactive maps. \n\nBesides the activities for the City of Amsterdam I also contributed to the activities which ATCB executed for the Province of Noord-Holland (e.g. editing of the Recreatiekrant Noord-Holland) and the Municipalities of Velsen and Zaanstad.",
