    "summary": "My ambition is to improve the aquaculture production process in re-circulation systems in order to achieve a more sustainable aquaculture practice. Enabling more production whilst using less resources. My interests are with fish nutrition, system design and stock management. More specifically in the hatchery stage of the aquaculture supply chain. I have excellent qualities as a researcher and product developer. I\u2019m an analytical thinker, critical, I process data well, and I\u2019m comfortable in reporting the outcomes of a study. At Glasaal Volendam I've found a job where I can combine production and research and truly contribute to a disrupting innovation in the aquaculture sector.",

This advice is structured according to the Business Model Canvas. The input for this model is provided by a market analysis and a brainstorm session, all fully conducted by the project group InnoBee.\n\nBased on the input of the market analysis (interviews with companies, questionnaires from students, interviews with students involved in similar collaboration platforms) it can be concluded that companies and students see possibilities for company-student collaboration in the form of a platform: InnovatieBuzz. For more information about this platform, please contact our commissioner, Jouke Kardolus of Oost N.V.",

The final comments by my supervisor, Johan Schrama, were:\n\n\"Rick made a good impression at both the lab and in the research facilities. He demonstrated excellent research qualities. Both lab and animal facilities personal considered him as a top 10% student. The first impression of Rick is that he is very modest, and often quiet. However, he showed great commitment with an excellent independent work attitude. Independent, but well balanced. If required he would ask for advice and assistance always on key issues in his research. He functioned already at a PhD level during his research. This was/is also reflected in this thesis report. The first draft of his thesis was already of very high quality. Based on more general comments he was able to alter his thesis very independently. His problem discreption and also his critical reflection of the research were of very high level, making good use of existing literature. As an aquaculture student he quickly grasped the difficult concept of net energy evaluation, a very easy and nice student to supervise\"",

Unlike many other Atlantic salmon producers, Langsand Laks produces market-size fish that are reared 100% RAS, and was the world\u2019s first to do so. Fish enter the farm in the egg-stage and leave the farm at a size ranging from 4-7kg. The production can be divided in two parts: a hatchery, containing fresh water and a post smolt grow-out facility, containing saline water. During 4 months I learned a lot about farming salmon and managing a company. In return, I conducted a literature study containing 29 pages, excluding references.",
