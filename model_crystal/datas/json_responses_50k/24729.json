Project involved literature review, innovative design, fabrication, and testing. \nThe model was designed on CATIA V5, and had improved designs from existing research works. Fabrication was done using CNC Turning Center, CNC VMC, laser cutting, 3D printing, wire EDM. \nTesting was carried out using two stage air compressor. Project included the development of supporting equipment such as rope brake dynamometer and orifice meter.",
