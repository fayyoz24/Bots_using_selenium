Design and Construction of a Flying Wing\nThe design of a flying wing that fits in a rocket payload (for surveillance of Mars as a precursor mission) that has excellent payload and range capabilities, with acceptable stability and handling.\n\n2. Design, Construction and Testing of a Wingbox\nDesign, construction and testing of a wingbox that complies with load and failure requirements while minimizing weight. Followed by the design of test set-up, destructive testing, and redesign. \n\n3. PIV of Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine\nExploration of the aerodynamic phenomena in the near wake region of a horizontal-axis wind turbine. Experimentation was conducted at the Open Jet Facility of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology and involved the processing and computational analysis of images from stereo particle image velocimetry. \n\n4. Low Speed Wind Tunnel Tests\nData acquisition, computation and analysis of 2D and 3D wing profiles at Low Turbulence Tunnel (LTT) of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering.\n\n5. Supersonic Wind Tunnel Tests\nExperimental investigation into the flow through a convergent-divergent channel with, and without the presence of shockwaves. Data obtained from supersonic wind tunnel ST-3 at Laboratory of High Speed Aerodynamics, TuDelft.\n\n6. Test Flight \u2013 Cessna 550 Citation II\nSimulation, verification, and validation of the development of a simulation model to accurately predict the performance and stability of the Cessna Citation II aircraft in its whole design envelope (its eigenmodes in particular). Test flight data obtained from experimental operation of Cessna 550 Citation II, registered PH-LAB operated by Delft University of Technology and the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR). Also experienced parabolic flight as passenger after performing Eigen motions for data acquisition. \n\n",
