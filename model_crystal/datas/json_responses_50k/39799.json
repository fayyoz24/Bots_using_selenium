As a team assistant. I used my observational skills to give feedback on how teamwork and activities could be improved. \nIn my role I had to decide what methods my team would use to represent how to undertake a project in developing team building skills, quickly deciding to do a mind map with simple words to get the meaning through to the audience. \nI supported a variety of activities, including process identification, root cause analysis and solution identification. \nI learnt how to be an effective team leaver by promoting others to be the best they can be.",
