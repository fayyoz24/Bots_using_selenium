This image was edited in a way it fits the wall of the newly renovated building of Zuid57. In this way Wilschut combines the informal character of society in Hong Kong with the more organised public space of the Netherlands.\n\nThe huge photograph of 480 by 955 centimeters follows the extraordinary architecture of the building from 1957 by architect Sjoerd Schamhart. The image covers the wall over the left wing of the building. Because it is printed on a thin foil it follows the structure of the wall and becomes one with it, like a second skin.\n\nSystem as Second Skin was part of an exhibition with several of Wilschut's works and was subject to numerous educational programs, like the Summer School of 2013. Together with Platform57, Wilschut also curated a one night film programme with works by Zachary Formwalt and Gerard Holthuis.\n\n",

The installation shows a close to nature copy of the pedestal of the statue of king Willem II, which is originally situated in the centre of The Hague. This wooden version suggests that a mob tore down the statue. In his exhibition De Bree showed several suggestive works, from fake but close to nature car bombs, to automatic guns. After the exhibition the installation piece on the square became a semi permanent work and was first removed in June 2013.",

The work is a chain of maquettes with ever changing perspectives. By walking through the installation and having to make turns to view al the rooms, the viewer becomes the camera. In collaboration with Filmhuis Den Haag, the project was shown at Platform57.\n\nNext to his large installation, Boagaert made a smaller room filling installation at Platform57; Untitled. This work is a collaboration with Mathijs Lieshout and was also shown at Re: Rotterdam. Untitled is a large installation with two sides. One side is a seemingly chaotic installation of wood, once you step through a window you enter a clean white room.\n\nThe side programme consisted of a film screening (in collaboration with Filmhuis Den Haag) and artist talks with Maurice Bogaert and Mathijs Lieshout.",

How can photography trigger us to associate freely or recall events, in which way can it access our memories or even replace a memory? \n\nIn my work I loosely use neuro-scientific theories and different photographic approaches to explore various aspects of the subject. Three pillars are important in every project; the concept, the photography and the presentation. In different projects the emphasis is placed on a different pillar. One project stresses the conceptual, in another the installation of the work is most important for exploring the subject matter. I adjust my way of working accordingly and seek different types of collaborations with other artists and scientists. Collaboration broadens my scope and deepens my work.\n\nWith my photographic work and installations I aim to address the memory of the viewer, make them associate freely and recall their own memories. My work is not about what is, but about what can be.",
