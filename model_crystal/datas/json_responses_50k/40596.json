    "summary": "I am passionate about creation, all things connected and everything out of the ordinary. I am infected with entrepreneurship and can't help myself in seeing the world as a playground of opportunities.\n\nAs UX Designer and PO I help companies in getting from an idea all the way to full realisation. I assist my clients with their conceptual process, requirements analysis, design phase, development and implementation. I like to be in contact with all facets of realisation and have developed myself accordingly in the past. My Interaction Design background makes sure I keep users centralised during this realisation process.\n\nI have great passion for the User Experience trade. I love working user centered and have always done so in the past. It's a way of thinking that always turns out to provide the best solutions.\n\nI help people that need help in getting their digital ideas and concepts done! I work hard and thrive on people that do so too. Large complex projects and platforms fascinate me and I love working with strong teams to get those realised.\n\nSkills: Digital Production, UX Design, Scrum, Agile, Concept development, Sales, RFID, Drupal 6/7, PHP5, MySQL, JQuery, Actionscript 3, Git",

We are a creative RFID concepts agency that helps brands with connecting their real-world presence with social networks and back!\n\nAs commercial manager I am responsible for all future client contact. This suits me. I love telling people what we do, did and are about to do. \nWhen needed I assist my brother (Creative Lead) with UX design. This skill always comes in handy when one is still in the concepting phase.\nI can't help but to see projects through to the end. At Fuzeo I really developed my  Scrum Master  skills. My rol as a digital and off-line producer came into scope. I really enjoy taking on projects and guiding our teams through the various phases of realization. At Fuzeo that means starting with the client and their first idea, or problem. Then taking them along in the concepting phase, showing them what is possible. When all is agreed upon (not to be underestimated) the agile production process can move forward, meaning that design and development go hand in hand, delivering working products each iteration and evaluating these together with the team and client. While doing so, I keep a strict eye upon the budget and deadline, making sure everything goes smoothly and all is delivered en implemented in-time. In the end it's the love that goes in to the projects that makes them so beautiful.\n\nClients:\nEndemol\nHeineken\nWieden & Kennedy\nHyundai Europe\nInnocean Worldwide\nIceWorld",

I developed front & backend applications. \n\nWe were a company that focussed on creative concepts and specialized in taking the initial clients idea to the next level. This is where I developed my brainstorming and concepting skills. \n\nI was the primary contact for clients. Listening to clients is a trade, not just to their words, but to their true question or problem. This often meant that they needed something different than what they're initially asking for. In my opinion problem solving often means finding the problem.\n\nIn the last years we started looking for new ways to manage our development process. We encountered Agile & Scrum. We developed and mastered ourselves in this process and ultimately found ourselves managing the development of a project with a fixed budget, but no clear end product. Even the concepting was agile! The result was great.  \n\nClients\n- Fitzroy\n- CCCP\n- Koan\n- Ajax (AEGON)\n- Basic Orange\n- Women Inc",
