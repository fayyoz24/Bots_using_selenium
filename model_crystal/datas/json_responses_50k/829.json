    "summary": "In the context of my Ph.D. thesis, I investigated the applicability of advanced analytical tools for mycotoxin analysis in cereal, cereal-based products, and biological fluids. The Governing Council of the University of Valencia (Spain) granted me an extraordinary Ph.D. in Pharmacy academic year 2013/2014. Consecutively, I was contracted as an Assistant Professor at the University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague (Czech Republic), Department of Food Analysis and Nutrition. During my stay at UCT, I successfully initiated a research line, food metabolomics, and headed my project, a contract funded by Generalitat Valenciana (Spain). I then worked at the Department of Food Quality and Nutrition, Edmund Mach Foundation (Italy), as a Research Scientist. I was actively involved in three JPI-funded projects, Food Biomarkers Alliance (FoodBAll), which aimed to develop clear strategies for food intake & biomarker discovery, HEALTHMARK, which investigated the complex associations between the gut microbiota, tryptophan availability, diet, and metabolic health, and ENPADASI, related to data sharing of OMICS. This has enabled me to make significant contributions and have an important record of accomplishment, with more than 40 peer-reviewed publications, five book chapters, including 25 first-author contributions. After finishing a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie project (TRIANGLE) and being honored with a \u201cRam\u00f3n & Cajal\u201d grant, I work as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor at Wageningen University and Research in a shared position between the Food Quality and Design and the Nutritional Biology groups.",

In a three year research program, the Food Biomarkers Alliance (FoodBAll) aims to develop clear strategies for food intake biomarker discovery and validation, and to identify and validate biomarkers for a range of foods consumed across Europe. The methods include extensive literature reviews, acute intervention studies, as well as analyses of existing intervention and observational studies. Importantly, metabolomics techniques will be used for the discovery of biomarkers as the main -omics technique.",

In this context, dietary phytochemicals have received increasing interest due to their suspected role in the prevention of cancer. Numerous studies report the chemopreventive effects of polyphenols. However, health benefits assigned to dietary constituents are still under controversy as can be deduced from the large number of applications rejected by the EFSA. Despite the crucial role of polyphenols in many biological cases, adequate tools to decipher the relationship between diet-microbiome-host are not yet available. To unveil the mysteries in the emerging field of personalized nutrition, TRIANGLE aims to develop a new in vitro model for the study of phytochemicals in CRC prevention. The most common approach to study the anti-proliferative activity of polyphenols against CRC involves the use of 2D cell lines. Although multiple hints on the possible anticancer effects of these compounds have been already published, these results cannot be extrapolated to human. Firstly, immortalized 2D cell lines differ metabolically from in vivo cells. Secondly, these compounds were not artificially digested and fermented. Therefore, a novel integrative strategy to deepen understanding of CRC is vital. To accomplish this, a real-life scenario is needed. In this context, colon organoids/tumoroids will be established. Afterwards, an apple will be digested/fermented in vitro using a batch culture colonic model inoculated with feces from lean/obese healthy donors. In the end, such polyphenol metabolites will be tested in colon organoids/ tumoroids and the mechanisms of action will be revealed by metabolomics and organoid assays. The outcome of TRIANGLE will significantly deepen our knowledge of polyphenols-microbiome-organoids, and, in the long term, will allow nutritional recommendations to be given for the prevention of CRC.",
