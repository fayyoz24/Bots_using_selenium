    "summary": "As a second-year BSc cognitive science and artificial intelligence student at Tilburg University, I am extremely interested in learning the different aspect of human cognition, however also how we can apply that knowledge to creating AI systems. Bridging the gap between the natural and artificial world is something I look forward to learning about in my studies.\n\nI am an international student, studying in a foreign country, which has given me exposure to a lot of different cultures and lifestyles. As a curious person, I love learning in general and about different ways of approaching a situation. I try to apply the things I learn in my day-to-day life, so I am constantly reflecting and attempting to better myself and how I go about certain things.\n\nIn the future, I believe all the skills and experience I have gained from past opportunities will help me adapt to different environments and help me perform to the best of my ability.",

A group of students would go to different houses that each had a specialization for the needs of the residence. My group had an array of different elderly women with a variety of personality and cognitive ability. This experience has helped me adapt to working with a variety of people and gain exposure to people I would not have run into otherwise. From this I learned how to adapt in certain situations as well as understanding and being able to gauge how the other person is feeling. My communication skills have greatly improved through this experience, not just linguistically (bettering my German fluency), but also the ability for me to express myself and articulate exactly the way people\u2019s minds were working."
