    "summary": "As an experienced product designer, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, ranging from pre-launch products to those used by millions of users. Over the years, I have collaborated with top companies such as Philips Hue, ABN AMRO, Liberty Global, Small PDF, and AR startups, as well as several SAAS early-stage startups, scale-ups, and multinational enterprises. Having lived and worked in four different countries across the globe, I have developed a keen ability to adapt quickly, pay close attention to details, and prioritize both business goals and user needs. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about my work, please don't hesitate to get in touch - who knows what we could create together?",
