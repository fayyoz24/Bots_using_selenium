    "summary": "An enthusiastic young professional continuously looking for new opportunities to develop more skills and knowledge on gender issues, political science and conflict studies. I am a critical thinker and ambitious individual that always wants to be optimistic. My Liberal Arts Education enabled me to have a diverse educational background. This allows me to view problems from different angles and disciplines, and finding creative solutions. Through my exchange semester I started to focus on the region of the Middle East and motivated me to follow a M.A. specialised in this region. Through my M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies I am learning more about the Middle East and specifically through a lens of gender issues. I applied this knowledge during my field research for my M.A. thesis on women's parliamentary representation in Lebanon. At the moment I am working as a Junior Teaching Fellow at Maastricht University. ",
