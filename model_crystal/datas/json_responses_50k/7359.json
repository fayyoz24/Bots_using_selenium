They need to do so, in order to develop strong relationships with all sectors of their communities - which in return will bring them long term financial benefits.\n\nAt DDA I work mainly with the boards, directors and fundraising managers of cultural and non-profit organisations. During this process I change the way they think by:\n- doing branding exercises\n- developing a Case for Support\n- helping them to understand the new reality of funding  and the changing role of boards.\n\nDid I make your curious?

TPR provided these services specially for not-for-profit organisations in the UK.\n\nThe Phone Room worked with a client's own database (for example, ticket-buyers, friends or donors) and, after careful data analysis, phoned and mailed supporters to ask for donations and donation upgrades. Clients soon found out that this service was very valuable for generating long-term donor income.\n\nAfter 17 great years I closed this company because the rise of digital communication led to a long-term fall in direct-marketing budgets.",
