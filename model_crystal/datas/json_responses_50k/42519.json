    "summary": "After working for a few months for a primary school and working for two years for a travel agency in China, I decided to study abroad for personal development.  I followed English tought courses in tourism and gained a bachelor (Leeuwarden, 2007) and master degree (Breda, 2008) in it.\n\nIn 2007 I met my Dutch boyfriend and in 2008 we registered our partnership. I did an \u201cinburgeringscursus\u201d provided by the city council and a language course by the \u201cVolksuniversiteit\u201d.\nSo besides my native language of Mandarin Chinese I also know how to communicate in English and Dutch.\n\nMy professional and educational background provides me with skills that are applicable to an office or commercial environment. I'm good in developing customer potential. I am always willing to help customers to the best possible. And despite their initial perceptions, I manage to keep them in as an existing- or acquire them as a new customer. A quality highly appreciated by my manager at the travel agency.\n\nI enjoy developing new products and setting up projects.\n\nSpecialties: international tourism, marketing research and development, project  development, eager to absorb and learn the information from different fields.",
