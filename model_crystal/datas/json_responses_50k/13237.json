    "summary": "Past\nI was born in Ukraine, capital town Kiev. After my study at the art academy and a number of exhibitions in Kiev I moved to the Netherlands. Besides Russian and Ukrainian languages I have learned the Dutch and English languages as well. \n\nIn the Netherlands I studied Creative Therapy in Nijmegen and a number of Psychology modules at the University.  After that I worked for almost 15 years in Mental Health Care as a personal coach. In my job as a personal coach I also did quite some administrative work for my clients as well as for the locations I was working for. For 3 years I was a member of the workers committee (OR) and I was busy with the financial part of the committee activities. \n\nTherefore, I wanted to know much more about Excel and to become skilful with it, because I needed it and I liked it. \nIn 2011 I started my study Bookkeeping (PDB), and it was going well. I have to say I learned it by heart and with pleasure. By the way, my grand dad was a technical engineer and father scientist, yes, I have a feeling for figures! Hereditary.\n\nSo, after the last exam of (PDB) I immediately started in September 2013 with Modern Business Administration (MBA), because I want to deepen my knowledge and to further strengthen my analysis skills. I finished it at the begin of 2016.\n\nSkills \n1 High ability to interact well with people, to engage with colleagues across the organization and to elicit cooperation\n2 High Analytical skills\n3 High Sales skills\n4 Medium computer skills\n5 High ability to synthesize, because of the ability to gain essential knowledge quickly\nBy the way\nI know both the cultures of Western Europe and Eastern Europe.\nMy ability to empathize with people makes contact very effective.\nImportant to add, I love people and I always try to make every deal not only a rational matter of fact, but attractive with a good feeling for my business partners (win-win).",
