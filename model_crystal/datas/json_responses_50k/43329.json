    "summary": "Since my youth the passion for machines was always present. Beginning with my small pedal\u2019s car offered by my grandfather, progressively the passion evolved for bicycles, motorcycles, cars and general machines. With interest for maths and physics soon I knew what I wanted to study \u2013 Mechanical engineering\n\nOne month before ending the university, I was invited by a teacher to make a internship at Efacec, one of the most known and prestige companies from Portugal. The challenge was exactly what I needed to develop the skills learned before. The university gives you the tools to make the job, but only the hands on job allows you to apply them and understand what means to be an engineer.\nBy developing machines I could improve my skills and experience the reality of the industrial world.\n\nAfter 2,5 years I was invited to join igus as a product manager. The goal was to be responsible for the commercial strategy and also with the knowledge in the machine design, help the team to find new markets and help customers with technical consulting. A very different job from the previous one, that allowed me to understand not only the technical side of a company but also the economic and commercial side of the industry. The job also made me study several lines of industry and the needs of each one of them.\n\nThese 2 professional experiences allows me to understand how to design machines, consider the company position on the market, think in a strategy to develop sales with efficient and competitive products and also develop marketing tools to win customers.\n\nIf you want to know more about me, feel free to contact by private message.\n",
