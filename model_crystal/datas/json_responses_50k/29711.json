ISAF is a coalition of states established to contribute to the maintenance of security, but which through their frequent engagement in actual warfare have become parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan. As a result, their actions are governed by international humanitarian law. This includes the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, i.e. attacks expected to cause civilian casualties at a level excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated. The hostilities in and around Chora have given rise to the question whether they might have violated this prohibition (a question ultimately answered in the negative). In this debate, self-defence was among the arguments raised in justification. Self-defence usually figures as a standard clause in the rules of engagement. These are texts which, established by commanders, permit or limit the use of force by their armed forces. The chapter briefly discusses the character of these instruments and of the clauses they contain. The focus is in particular on the self-defence clause. Self-defence may be individual or collective, and it may arise on three different levels: as national self-defence, unit self-defence or individual self-defence. National self-defence is the right for states to defend themselves against an attack or imminent attack. Unit self-defence is a notion generally accepted in military practice without having a firm legal basis in most countries. [...]\n",

What do we need?, 2 Journal of International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict 92 (2012).\n\nAbstract:\nSmall arms and light weapons have many devastating impacts on human security. Most states regulate small arms and light weapons in their domestic legislation, but this is done in a non- uniform manner, allowing the continued use and transfer of weapons. At the international level, various aspects with regard to small arms and light weapons are regulated. Therefore, treaty law with a focus on international humanitarian law will be considered first. This body of law regulates the use of these weapons to a certain extent, but not exhaustively. In a second step, customary international law with regard to such weapons is assessed, particularly focusing on the practice of international and regional initiatives. Recent and current initiatives such as the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects, and the Arms Trade Treaty will be considered. Furthermore, there will be a critical discussion on the needs for future regulation, especially reflecting on the idea of a comprehensive small arms and light weapons treaty.",
