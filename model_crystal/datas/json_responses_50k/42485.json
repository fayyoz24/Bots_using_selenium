The CX Department, is aimed at improving the customer experience while saving costs through smarter marketing execution and automation. For 37 countries in 26 languages. Within the CX Department the Marketing Communications team focuses on customer journeys, campaigns, PR and social media. With the right tone of voice and based on the strong Nikon brand. The Marketing Technology team consists of experts for website, eCommerce, marketing automation and social media automation.\n\nI was responsible for designing and implementing this new department at Nikon Europe. The preparations took six months which included discussions with the HQ in Tokyo. The main reason for setting up a new department was the changing environment. Contrary to the last 4 decades, Nikon is now facing a very dynamic and shrinking market, highly demanding customers, a smaller target audience, a different set of competitors and less resources. Therefore the focus needs to be on profitability, agility, empowered employees and a strong collaboration across markets. This implies a change in strategy, structure and company culture.\n\nContinuously I was looking for methods to do our work in the most efficient way and implement future proof changes. One of the next steps is to establish a deeper collaboration with all local marketing teams across Europe. In the process of digital transformation and Nikon becoming a more customer centric company, the CX Department plays a crucial role.",
