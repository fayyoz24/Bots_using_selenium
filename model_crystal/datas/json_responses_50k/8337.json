    "summary": "My purpose is to develop people and grow businesses beyond expectations through honesty, openness and transparency. I am passionate about supporting and inspiring people to realise their ambition \u2013 be that personally, in their businesses or both. I believe in helping people to excel in their meaningful, purpose-led and future-fit work.\n\nI have so far enjoyed a very rewarding career, spanning close to 40 years, which has been about leading real transformational growth in organisations, optimising strategies and developing great talents, teams and company cultures. \n\nI have led and experienced these in the variety of senior positions I have held across local, regional and multinational businesses both in retail and food service. During this time, I lived in Hong Kong, USA, Ireland, Germany and The Netherlands. I have travelled to all corners of the world and have very much enjoyed combining the best of what these different cultures and the globe at large has to offer with my work.\n\nBeing able to draw on this experience now to inspire other people to achieve their development goals is very fulfilling and I like to stretch myself across the full spectrum. On one side, I am currently coaching senior leaders to achieve their academic goals (including university degrees) and on the other side, I am training people with different abilities to reach their ambitions. I am also supporting entrepreneurs and leaders in family-owned businesses, scale ups and multinationals to grow their businesses beyond expectations and in a sustainable way. \n\n",
