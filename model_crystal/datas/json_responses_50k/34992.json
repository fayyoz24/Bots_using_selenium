    "summary": "Use my knowledge and experience in multiple settings to attain social beneficial targets. Contribute to the scientific knowledge base within the multi-dimensional fields of economics, management, automation, work processes and thereto-related backgrounds. Inform and entertain people with the modern communication tools that are available these days.\n\nSpecialties: System Administration (the IT-guy), Infrastructure and Management (the IT-manager) & System Analysis (the Smart-IT-guy)... But without joking: worked mainly as an IT-engineer in two fields: Logistics and the Semi-Governmental sector...\n\nFor a long time the wish to finish my Computer Engineering degree (of which only the final thesis remains) was there. No more though. After experiencing the negative side of the Dutch education system; I wholly thank all the teachers that had a positive impact on my education, but thank for recognition from a system that protects the bad teachers therein. Just so you know.",

Depending on the specific shift this was done independently or as a team effort, but was always aimed at guarantying end users with means and data to enable them to prepare deliveries to stores correctly and on time. Projects were aimed at furthering internal processes and creating means to do so. A description of the technical environment would be a mixed environment: standard Microsoft based systems for office automation, IBM mainframe, soft- and hardware mainframe clients and SunOS for corporate activities and data processing, but also Symbol hand terminals for a barcode system used when gathering products for an order and it\u2019s delivery.\n\nDuring this period there was an opportunity to attend a first-aid training course and a following corporate emergency services training course.
