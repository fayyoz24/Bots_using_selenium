    "summary": "I am a hands-on consultant with two decades of experience with non-profit and non-government organizations in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.  I am driven by a desire to contribute to communities and people across the world to (re)build their lives and livelihoods and thrive. \n\n\nAfter holding leadership positions in a wide range of crisis responses \u2013 from earthquakes in Pakistan and Nepal, displacement in Lebanon, Uganda, and Iraq to food security crises in Eritrea and Ethiopia \u2013 my focus is now on supporting non-profit organizations to manage and improve their outcomes through interim project and program management, training and advisory.\n\n\nUsing my insights and experience from working in highly demanding and complex settings with people from a wide diversity of backgrounds, I am able to quickly analyze situations, ways of working, and team dynamics. While I am not afraid to call out a problem when I see one, my greatest interest lies in working with you to identify and implement constructive and sustainable solutions so you can focus on the outcomes for the people and communities you support.",
