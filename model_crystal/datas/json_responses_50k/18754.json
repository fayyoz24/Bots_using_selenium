For researchers already involved in digital humanities, the conference proved to be a great opportunity to share knowledge and meet potential project partners. For those new to digital humanities, the conference provided a platform to get acquainted with both experienced and beginning researchers.\n\nAs project manager for this event, my responsibilities included planning and controlling, time and budget management, administration and archiving, planning (social media) marketing strategies, and collaboration with external suppliers/speakers/participants. Starting up the organisation's Twitter-account I accumulated over 100 followers within the first two months. The total amount of participants was close to 170.\n\nReviews:\nAlbert Mero\u00f1o-Pe\u00f1uela\n- http://www.cedar-project.nl/digital-humanities-benelux-conference-report/\n\nUlrike Wuttke\n- http://ulrikewuttke.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/dhbenelux2014/\n\nHeidi Elaine Dowding\n- http://www.thegloballibrarian.com/62/\n- http://dixit.hypotheses.org/277\n\nMax Kemman\n- http://www.maxkemman.nl/2014/06/grasping-technology/\n\nStef Scagliola for Historici.nl\n- http://www.historici.nl/nieuws/verslag-een-digital-battle-den-haag-benelux-2014\n\nMerisa Martinez\n- http://merisamartinez.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/and-now-for-something-completely-different-dh-benelux-and-the-freedom-of-digital-humanities/",

Over 180 people attended the opening of the conference and the exhibition that occurred at the same time.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands celebrated it's 100th birthday in 1913. Women's organisations seized the opportunity to organise a major exhibition: 'The Woman, 1813-1913'. The exhibition showed what women contributed to culture, economy and society, but it also dealt with abuse through domestic labour  and raised the issue women were seen as second-class citizens. In 2013, the Kingdom of the Netherlands again celebrated a centenary. In the past century, women gained the right to elect and be elected, to employment and economic independence and equal control in relationships. The lectures during the conference 'The Woman 1813 - 1913 - 2013' were linked to the themes of the exhibition of 1913.\nHRH Princess Beatrix attended the opening of the conference, hence continuing a tradition: her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother were present at the opening of the exhibitions on the historical development of the position of women in 1898, 1913 and 1948.\n\nI was responsible for organising the opening ceremony, for which planning and controlling were my main tasks. This included keeping regular contact with the different stakeholders: the conference organisation, the venue and HRH Princess Beatrix' team.",

The conference aims at bringing together academics working in disciplines that have so far worked within independently operating scholarly traditions, promoting innovative, multidisciplinary exchange and dialogue. The conference will examine the transformation of traditional editorial practice into a digital environment and the creation of innovative opportunities like the use of digital tools and media. \n\nThe conference lasted for three days, in three different locations and attracted over 100 participants.

See also https://lnkd.in/bYfYPZh and https://lnkd.in/bcUD2E9 for some video impressions.\n\nSince its foundation in 2001 Stichting Limmen Ludiek has organised the following events (all of which were Guinness World Records at the time of completion):\n2001 \u2013 largest cocktail (2001 liter) > regional record for BeNeLux\n2005 \u2013 largest pyramid built with beer crates (63.365 crates)\n2010 \u2013 tallest LEGO-tower (30,52 meter)\n2015 - largest mosaic made from wine corks (180,96 m2 / 401.731 wine corks)\n\nAll of the events mentioned above have been made possible by hundreds of volunteers, as well as many sponsors (most of which locally based, as well as national and international sponsors). This contributes to the tight-knit connections between the inhabitants of Limmen and other communities within the Council of Castricum.\n\nMy responsibilities include managing the catering and entertainment divisions, as well as acquiring sponsors and volunteers, amongst others."
