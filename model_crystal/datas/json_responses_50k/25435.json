    "summary": "Energetic, persistent and skilled Aerospace engineering graduate from the Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands specializing in Numerical Modelling, Aircraft Design and Propulsion. Over 1.5 years of experience in mathematical modelling using LBM (Lattice Boltzmann methods) in MATLAB/Simulink & CFD analysis, and five months experience as a software engineer using C++ during the internship at Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training. Furthermore, my technical skills include ICEM, CATIA, ANSYS FLUENT and Microsoft Office Suite.\n\nWith my adequate skillset and expertise, I look forward to a career as an Application based simulation software engineer or CFD analyst where I would deliver successful results with my best skills and thrive as an enjoyable team member to work with.",

In addition, flight simulators give more control to the instructors, such as specifying weather conditions.\nThis internship assignment mainly focuses on the wind module that allows pilot instructors to specify wind vectors on different altitudes. The goal is to study the existing wind module that is currently being used for the B737 training simulators and make it robust for future changes.",
