Those big data analysis skills were developed during my Masters and PhD study and include high performance computing, population genomics, quantitative genetics, gene expression analysis, allele specific expression analysis, pathway analysis and eQTL-mapping analysis. I also have hands-on lab experience with molecular biology and analytical chemistry.\n\nMy software programming skills have developed over many years and are among others: Statistical programming in R and Python, Linux bash script, C#, PhP, HTML, Javascript, jQuery, CSS as well as managing MYSQL and Microsoft SQLserver databases. In the past five years I have worked frequently with image editing softwares: photoshop, illustrator and 3D modeling software Blender.",

My thesis was submitted for examination on May 7th 2021 and is currently under review. My PhD project focused on 1. Studying associations between heavy metal concentrations within blood of 836 healthy adult females living in the United Kingdom and their gene expression levels in subcutaneous adipose, blood cells and skin tissue. I am currently writing the manuscript for the publication for the results of that study. 2. To characterize genetic variants within coding sequences that modulate the allele specific expression of said gene. For this study diploid personal genome sequences were constructed for 500 female twin volunteers, RNA-seq reads were aligned and quantified for allele specific expression analysis. During my PhD projects also collaborated for another publication where my role to verify an hypothesis on allele specific expression data, as published: Genome-wide scan and fine-mapping of rare nonsynonymous associations implicates intracellular lipolysis genes in fat distribution and cardio-metabolic risk.",

Proto-oncogenes such as HRAS and KRAS are no exception to this fact and are often found in human cancer cells. During this research I studied the role of the n1046 gain of function mutation in let-60, a homolog gene of HRAS and KRAS, in Caenorhabditis elegans. To get a better understanding of genetic influences on this mutation, let-60 n1046 was crossed in two genetically divergent Caenorhabditis elegans strains N2 and CB4856. Using quantitative genetics we highlighted genetic regions which modify the downstream effects of let-60 hyper activation. We identified six transcription factors that targeted thirty targets on chromosome X. We showed that lin15b, a negative regulator of vulva development, transcription was significantly influenced by genetic variation.",

Collectively, these processes are named the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response is the guardian of the genome and organism. Tight and just regulations of the DNA damage response are crucial and cell type dependent. In this study we followed the DNA damage response on transcriptional level in mouse embryonic stem cells at three time points after exposure to either gamma-, UVC-radiation or Cisplatin (cancer drug). Using various clustering algorithms we detected that these treatments induced an orchestra of events leading to potential repair, antioxidant activation, apoptosis and differentiation. We investigated genes of several DNA repair pathways, i.e. the global genome nucleotide excision repair, transcription coupled repair, base excision repair, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Each treatment activated different repair pathways.",
