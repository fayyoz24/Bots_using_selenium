    "summary": "Nice to meet you. Welcome to my profile!\n\nMy name is Sies and I'm a social, technical, philosophical and practical human from Eindhoven. I use my extended experience as a mechanical engineer and love for physical creation to make my own products and help others in realizing their designs. I enjoy finding out how things work and like finding answers to questions other people might have. \n\nTwo days a week I create furniture with a team of people who are unemployed for various reasons. My job is to give them a sense of belonging while guiding them to become more and more skilled at making furniture. \n\nIn my studio at Strijp S in Eindhoven, I can manufacture quite complex items using my own CNC milling machine and the available professional woodworking and metalworking equipment. \n\nIn my spare time, I'm active in promoting sustainability; both professionally and voluntarily. Currently I am amongst others active in promoting an extremely efficient and affordable solar car (www.aptera.nu) as a voluntary ambassador. I also enjoy talking philosophy with everyone. Especially with kids.\n\nI'm looking to collaborate with people who are aiming to add value and purpose to this world. Projects revolving arts, music, theater and sustainability have my interest.  \n\nDo you have an interesting idea that you want to bring to life and could you use professional help with the technical realization? Please don't hesitate to contact me!",

This project meant being responsible for constantly balancing the design for optimized manufacturability, serviceability, reliability and cost while being able to meet all requirements. A lot of cooperation took place to align with stakeholders of interfacing modules and specialists who needed to provide information or perform actions on my behalf.\n- Designing crash dampers, focussing on acquiring the exact load cases for proper qualification and assisting the supplier in building competence for products with rubber-metal adhesion, mainly with process and tooling reviews and supporting (thermo-)mechanical FEM analyses. This project ran in parallel with the linear actuator design.",

I'm very motivated to support initiatives that radically reduce the waste of energy. Aptera is a company with which I share a lot of values. To promote them I'm active in providing information on social media and by writing articles on my enthusiast website.\n\nPlease check it out! https://www.aptera.nu"
