    "summary": "With both master degrees in Business Science and Engineering, Anne Pier has a broad experience as an consultant and trainer in working with non-profit organizations for over 30 years. The last five years particularly focusing on increasing organizational effectiveness through enhancing awareness interdependency between individuals by implementing circular methods in general and Agile Scrum frameworks more specifically.\nMain qualities are a deep understanding and experience of the connection between people.\n\nResearch shows, that in a globally interconnected world, the best innovations and deepest work satisfaction result from using a circular approach. The synchronicity produced through the use of specialized roundtable techniques, will allow participants to experience the sublimity of effective problem-solving, while simultaneously improving organizational unity and work motivation. \n\nThrough the approach of PULSE, that consists of experiential, reflective, active, game-based and peer-to-peer learning, participants acquire not only knowledge and experience of the principles that govern modern society, but they also in an entertaining way improve communication skills, achieve a high level of cooperation and mutual responsibility and awaken the awareness of interdependence between them.\n \nAlso, by collaboration between participants, which is not limited by usual differences (gender, socio-economic status, education level), a natural flow of ideas and talents is being enabled so participants are encouraged to come up with high-level innovations during the training that will help them to build a productive enviroment, even in their own organizations/teams according to principles they themselves adopt.\n\nParticipants experience:\n\u2022\tNew energy, new ideas;\n\u2022\tJoy in life, trust in the proces en willingness to give their commitment to necessary changes;\n\u2022\tConcrete results in relation to the operational work.\n\nAlso on YouTube, PULSE Human development",
