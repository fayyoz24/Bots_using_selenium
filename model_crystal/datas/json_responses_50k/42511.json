My investment strategy is based on the value investing philosophy using quantitative tools including DCF valuation, agent-based modelling, Monte Carlo simulations and econometrics methods as well as using qualitative criteria concerning management, quality of a business and consumer preferences.\nI believe that in investing psychological advantage is as important as analytical. For that reason, behavioural factors and tools play a central role in my decision making.\n",
