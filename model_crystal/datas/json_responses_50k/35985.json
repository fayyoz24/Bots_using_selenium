    "summary": "\u2022  I am an enthusiastic electronic engineer passionate for digital design. I am constantly looking for new challenges, learn and master new techniques, tools, languages and in general ANYTHING worth of a challenge.\n\u2022  I have more than 12 years of VHDL design experience. I've been involved in the implementation of real-time image processing, simulation and verification of digital systems for MRI,  and lately implementing algorithms to drive and control a piezoelectric device for Phacoemulsification surgery.\n\u2022  I have a BSc in Electronic Engineer (UTFSM, Valparaiso - Chile) and a MSc in Microelectornics (TU Delft, Delft - The Netherlands).\n\u2022 My endless goal is to be an expert in design, verification and implementation of custom algorithms for FPGAs/SoCs/MPSoCs in order to solve a problem or need.\n\u2022 In my previous career path I worked as project manager for the Telecom Business in South America. I have experience in leading a team of engineers in the installation, integration and migration of Pre-paid, Voice mail and SMS platforms in many countries of South America, Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nSpecialties: \n\u2022 Proficient in VHDL Hardware Description Language.\n\u2022 Good experience in FPGA based design and implementation \n\u2022 Good knowledge in C and C++ Language.\n\u2022 Good knowledge in Matlab/Simulink.\n\u2022 In my daily work I use: Xilinx Vivado, Xilinx SDK, Xilinx Vivado HLS, Mentor Graphics ModelSim and Matlab/Simulink.\n\u2022 Project management.",

This new plastic flake sorter uses a different technology than the air jet expulsion system (which I cannot disclose now). I am in charge of design the driver for this technology. Plastic flake sorters rely on fast and high resolution line scan cameras so this is also part of my responsibilities. First I will design and  implement the electronics and the image signal processing for color sorting, aiming for 4 tons/day of sorted recycled plastic. Second I will implement hyperspectral camera driver and image processing to sort plastic flakes by properties such as Melt Flow Index (MFI).\nThe final goal is to have an electronic system that can capture images, process them and generate driving signals to the sorting mechanism while monitoring other critical variables, such as temperature, angular speed, conductivity and pressure. \nCertainly, the most challenging topic is the use of machine learning for image recognition in real-time processing.",

Implementing Digital Signal Processing to control an ultrasonic piezoelectric device. I have developed the Hardware Application Layer to interface an ARM Cortex A9 processor with the programmable logic. I am using  Matlab/Simulink to describe the state machine for the application layer.\n- Past project: Development of a Portable Test System for the filed engineers to qualify the status of all the inputs and outputs of the Ophthalmic Surgical Device called EVA.

The firmware for each controller was developed in C and compiled for an 8051 based microcontroller.\nIn my first assignment I had to find and correct problems within eight different controller boards. Because of a new microcontroller derivative the watchdog to trigger was fired too soon, sending the boards to an error state. Using C-coding, I modified the way of assigning new values to some of the function registers of the microcontroller.\nIn the second assignment I had to investigate a loss in communication reported in the CAN/CANopen protocol of one of the controller boards. I developed a console tool for windows that analyzes the report logs of the CAN bus. With this tool I was able to perform a root cause analyses. The tool was a GUI developed in C++, to monitor the CAN bus. Using APIs from a 3rd party USBtoCAN adapter, I integrated the tool with real time monitoring functionality.",
