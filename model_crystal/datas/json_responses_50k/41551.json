Most of these works focus on using simulation tools for the estimation of channel load and the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) which is going to be very time-consuming for large traffic density and also does not give us much insight on the influence of the various parameters on the channel load or the PDR.\n In our work, we have used analytical modelling for quick estimation of channel load and PDR for dynamic moving traffic where vehicles generate messages based on their message generation conditions which depend on the manoeuvre the vehicle is performing.\nIn our work we have modelled for the channel load in different communication technologies like DSRC/IEEE 802.11p and also LTE-5G based on Cellular V2X. We have also focused on the effects of Decentralised Congestion Control  (DCC) on the communication channel load.",

In this paper we discuss how information communicated through vehicular networking can be used for controlling an autonomous vehicle in a multi-lane highway environment. A driving algorithm is designed using deep Q learning, a type of reinforcement learning. In order to train and test driving algorithms, we deploy a simulated traffic system, using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). The performance of the driving algorithm is tested for perfect knowledge regarding surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, the impact of limited communication range and random packet loss is investigated. Currently the performance of the driving algorithm is far from ideal with the collision ratios being quite high. We propose directions for additional research to improve the performance of the algorithm.",

            "description": "Chassis Simulator 1000 also called as CS1000 is low cost equipment developed by Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Ltd, which can be used to perform non vehicle dynamics tests. CS1000 is used in testing the electronic control unit. Input to CS1000 is given from an application present in a windows computer by the tester. The data that are sent are vehicle information like speed, battery voltage, sensor information, CAN signal information etc to CS1000. The output of the CS1000 will be the actual values that are given by the sensors present in an automobile. Users can give input from the computer to the CS1000, output of which is passed to the ECU. In this way the ECU is tested for different vehicle conditions. \nTo make the whole system to work in real time, we need a real time Operating System. As Linux is freeware, it is cost effective to develop a Real Time operating system based on Linux. Further in future, in case we need to upgrade the OS for some reason, it can be done without asking permission from anyone. The source code for Linux is available on kernel.org free of cost. This source code needs to be patched with a real time patch which is also available in the same place. RT Linux supports priority based scheduling and not time based scheduling, i.e. there is no feature in Linux by which we can schedule a process to occur at equal interval of time. Hence a time based scheduler is developed. The developed RTOS is then checked for its efficiency in real time by toggling a pin in RS232 at equal interval of time. Using the developed RTOS messages are passed from the computer containing the RTOS to the CS1000 through USB for switching on the ignition and switching off the ignition. The response is then calculated to be in real time.\n",

This obstacle can be overcome by using a cost effective robotic arm that can efficiently sort objects based on its colour. This method of packaging is fast, efficient and does not require continuous monitoring, hence increases the production and growth of the industry. The main objective of this project was to build a robotic arm that can sort objects based on its colour. As the title says, it is a combination of image processing and embedded techniques. The image processing technique is used as the vision to identify the colour of the object and the embedded technique is used to perform the mechanical operation of the robotic arm. The working of the arm is a simple cyclic feedback system, where the computer vision detects the colour and sends the information to the robotic arm which performs certain set of operations based on the results obtained and moves back to its initial position and the cycle continues. The images of the objects are obtained by using a webcam instead of a high range digital camera thus making it cost efficient. The image processing algorithm is applied to the images using OpenCV which is an open source platform used to perform computer vision. This platform has a library to perform various image processing techniques to get accurate desired results. The movement of the robotic arm is controlled using Arduino microcontroller which is programmed to perform specific operations based on the demand. The major difficulty of integrating image processing and embedded techniques is done by eBox-3300MX which uses computer on chip architecture and has Microsoft XP as operating system. By using webcam and eBox the overall system is made cost effective and thus making it affordable for small scale industries.",

During Internship i did a project on configuration of Linux as a realtime operating system. Being new to linux shell programming at that time, it was quite a challenge for me, but with time I learned about it with support from my team and completed this project. \nAfter completion of this project I was rewarded with a position in the same team as a Software Engineer. This gave me more challenging yet interesting topics to work on.",
