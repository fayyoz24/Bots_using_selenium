    "summary": "I am facinated by nature, people and their connection. As a kid I wanted to become a forest ranger or start a political party for tree conservation. As a consultant I am building bridges between people and organizations to facilitate projects to create green and healthy environments.\n\nAs a biologist I started working in the financial sector; using monetary streams to create a positive impact on climate and biodiversity, whilst pushing the financial sector as a whole to become more sustainable. At the DOEN Foundation I focused on supporting innovative business models for sustainable landscape restoration. Now, at the OAK Consultants family I get to work on green development projects; connect content with a clear process while making sure to involve the most important stakeholders in the process for an optimal outcome. I do this with enthusiasm, care and a good eye for the dynamics in the area. I am at my best in complex situations, where an innovative mind and a social point of view is needed to come to a supported end result.",

A central element to the job is dealing with stakeholders, contractors and external partners as well as allocating project budgets. As first point of contact for both applicants and clients, I monitor the procedures regarding project applications from start to finish. This involves evaluating and reporting, executing due diligence, organizing and related account management duties. \n\nWithin the Circular Entrepreneurship program I focus on landscape restoration entreprises. We finance entrepreneurs who combine regenerative practices with a solid business case, while learning about the opportunities and barriers in this field and helping the entrepreneurs forward. We do this not only with financial instruments, but also by connecting them and trying to move the sector towards a green and inclusive economy.",
