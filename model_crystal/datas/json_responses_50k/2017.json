    "summary": "Growing up, I always thought I\u2019m going to be a professional dancer or artist. I spent hours and hours on taking dancing lessons, painting, practicing, performing, and even teaching a class or two.\n\nUntil the summer of 2015, when my aunt signed me up for a tech summer camp at Stanford University to study programming languages for a month, a decision that I certainly didn\u2019t not like. But then I found my love for computers. This summer, the spark that was missing in my life ignited the instant I step foot in that tech camp. I spent my summer vacation evenings buried in my laptop, trying to implement small games like Conway\u2019s Game of Life, Bulls and Cows or my own version of Pac-Man in C++ and Java. I found a way to combine my creative side with the newly found passion for programming. Since then, I can\u2019t get enough. \n\nI signed myself up to study Information Communication Technology and Software Engineering. Since 2015, I\u2019ve explored many programming languages starting with C++, Java and Python. So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Laravel, WPF, Elm under my belt. I\u2019m most specialised in C# and currently working with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, Blazor and gRPC. I am always excited to research and try out different programming design patterns, methods or frameworks. \n\nWorking in the Software industry since my first year in university, I have great experience in team-work and Agile methodologies. There is certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. Thus, I\u2019m focused on constantly learning and improving myself.",
