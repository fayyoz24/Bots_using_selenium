    "summary": "As a sustainability consultant at Manzeera Solutions and co-founder of wegozero's zero-waste map, I'm empowering businesses and consumers to improve their sustainable practices, while am actively applying my interdisciplinary knowledge in sustainability marketing, law and sustainability governance.\n\nGraduating from a Russell Group university with honours in International Relations, while contributing with various extracurricular roles in different societies, I have completed my master degrees at the world's no.1 university for Communication Science* and the oldest law school of the Netherlands (ranking top 10 in Europe and to 50 worldwide**) \u30fc alongside working at wegozero. With my unique cross-sector qualification, I am enthusiastic about continuing my professional career, applying my knowledge beyond the walls of leading research-institutions. Being able to analyse issues from a legal, a social-political, and a persuasive-marketing perspective has proven to be a powerful tool of mine: it enables me to apply a critical perspective from different viewpoints in problem-solving. \nBesides research, analytics, sustainability, law and marketing, I have been into finance and many extracurricular roles of responsibility, as a president, a non-law representative, a student ambassador, a master's committee member, and others. \n\nI am looking forward to support Your sustainability journey towards a net zero.\n\n* QS ranking University of Amsterdam, 2018 \u2013\n** QS ranking Leiden Law School, 2018 \u2013",

A meter-deep pit with drug waste that causes major environmental problems (Keukenkamp, 2021). This is a nightmare for nature and these substances can be very dangerous for humans (Drinkwater Platform, 2021). In the first half of 2021, the number of drug dumping increased by 64%, making it a major problem (Police, 2021). All this data is problematic, which is why innovative ideas are important.\n\nWhy is this challenge important?\nThe drug barn of Europe. In the world of drugs, for example, one can look at Brabant. In Bram Endedijk's book of the same name, there is even a chapter called 'Breaking bad in Brabant', but this problem does not only occur in Brabant. Tens of billions are lost in the drug industry, many people are killed, officials are bribed and kilograms of drug waste are discharged. This drug waste is toxic to humans and animals and can end up in the ground water due to dumping (Roks et al., 2021). A study by Kruize and Gruter (2020) shows that the police in the Netherlands discovered 191 dump locations in 2019. This given, there is always a dark number that plays with it. The police do not always find all the dumps and so in reality there will be more than 191 dumpings.\n\nPreventive or repressive\nA problem can have both a preventive and a repressive solution.\nPreventive: A prevention solution focuses on preventing a problem. The intervention therefore takes place before the 'offence' occurs.\nRepressive: Repressive action revolves around suppressing certain behavior. Following certain rules or handing out fines can have a deterrent effect. This is about punishing 'wrong' behaviour."
