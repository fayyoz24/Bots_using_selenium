    "summary": "I am currently studying inter-organizational partnerships at SCOOP, a research and training center dedicated to the study of sustainable cooperation. I am passionate about egalitarian \"horizontal\" alliances and the methods to make them more viable and efficient. In particular, I am exploring how to prevent systemic inequalities that may arise from resource or status differences between partners.\n\nWhat is so special about the management of inter-organizational partnerships? Here we deal with two differences simultaneously: between organizations and between the people who represent these organizations. Surely within one organization it is hard enough to manage people of differing status, experience, and attitude. Adding differences in organizational procedures, cultures, and goals makes this setup even more complicated. If not properly addressed, these discrepancies can evolve into conflicts, decreased participation, unfair resource allocation, or even partnership decay.\n\nIn my research, I focus on ways to prevent, or mitigate, the negative effects of personal and organizational differences in horizontal partnerships. As a sociologist, I believe that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" recipe for every partnership and each case requires its own context-specific solution. Each partnership is a complex system and we must always consider how changes in one domain\u2014say, decision-making procedures or governance mechanisms\u2014would affect this system as a whole. Having international experience in industry and academia gave me insights into the features of collaborations in both domains as well as various cultural contexts. I find it extremely rewarding to help practitioners navigate an array of organizational studies and promote sustainable and science-driven governance.   \n\nMy key expert areas are: \n- qualitative & quantitative research;\n- program evaluation using various evaluation methodologies;\n- research design;\n- interdisciplinary research.\n\nI would love to get in touch with people who are working on similar topics and are interested to know how my research can help them govern collaborations in a better, more sustainable way.",
