The aim of this project is to facilitate bona fide travelers, as well as to raise a stronger barrier against travelers who pose a risk to national security.\nIn order to improve decision making on visa applications the BAO (Buitenslandse Zaken Analyse Omgeving) has been created, a system that allows additional information to be collected from external sources such as the KMAR, IND and DT&V. A selection of high-risk visa applications is sent by seven participating RSO's (Regional Support Offices) for data entry. This is processed by the analysis environment in order to get (a) specific code(s). These are sent back to the RSO's by the data entry team. The decision-making RSO employees in turn use these codes to give his opinion on the relevant visa.\n\nData entry tasks:\n- Import of visa data from the National Visa Information System (NVIS) to an Excel form\n- Transfer of this information to the NVIK (Branch of the National Police)\n- Keep track of a list of the files send to NVIK on Share Point\n- Process the data received from the NVIK into NVIS\n- Offer support to improve the process\n- Process and keep track of sanction lists\n\nAdditional tasks:\n- Schedule and keep track of meetings via Microsoft Outlook\n- Attend and offer support in meetings\n- Book meeting rooms and register visitors via Planon",

Most studies done on endophytes focused on the positive effects on plant growth. During the micropropagation process however, whereby large quantities of plantlets are clonally produced, endophytes can have pathogenic effects on plantlets and thus might cause large losses for companies. Gerbera jamesonii (gerbera) is an important cut-flower for many horticultural companies with tissue culture contamination often causing problems during the production process. In this study we designed a protocol in order to prevent or reduce the high microbial contamination rate in gerbera tissue culture by isolating endophytes from both mature greenhouse plants and tissue culture plantlets of gerbera. \n\n- Collect and study related scientific articles \n- Design experiment \n- Prepare tissue culture growth media\n- Prepare bacteria growth media\n- Microscopy\n- Operate HOBO-system\n- Data analysis\n- Develop protocol\n- Write article\n- Present findings",

Recently, the relationship between plants and soil-borne microorganisms is a topic studied more often, focusing on the pathogenic effects of microbes on plant growth. However, a more indirect effect mentioned recently was nutrient competition between plants and their soil-borne microorganisms. To study this effect via plant-soil feedback experiments, we grew plants in different soil-types with different treatments and at different nutrient concentrations. We used Jacobeae vulgaris (syn. Senecio jacobeae) plants of one genotype propagated by tissue culture at the Leiden University and plants of another genotype germinated from seeds. \n\n- Collect and study related scientific articles \n- Design experiment \n- Prepare tissue culture growth media\n- Tissue culture preparation\n- Grow plants\n- Germinate seeds\n- Data analysis\n- Write article\n- Present findings",
