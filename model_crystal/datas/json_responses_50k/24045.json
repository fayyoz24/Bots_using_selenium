The mission of the D@S Lab is to bring together TU Delft expertise in Design and Computer Science to establish a centre of excellence in HI for Societal-Scale Design. HI can play a key role in reducing the complexity of design for large-scale societal problems by orchestrating large-scale design activities involving people, data and machines; by informing effective design interventions; by predicting the impact of design interventions; by monitoring and learning from the implementation of design interventions, and by adapting design interventions over time to maximise their impact.",
