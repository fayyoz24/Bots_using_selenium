    "summary": "I feel very strongly about creating a fair, equal and equally enjoyable work environment for everyone, regardless of one's gender, race, sexual orientation, background or other label. Creating a diverse workforce is not necessarily the goal in itself, however, creating an inclusive culture within our organisations is. Not to tick the box, but because I want to do what I can to contribute to a future where everyone is valued, respected and appreciated.\n\nBorn of Dutch parents, I grew up in Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia and feel this has contributed to my wish for more understanding towards one another. It has also helped me in adapting quickly to new situations and being able to converse with all manners of people and making them feel at ease.\n\nMy strengths lie in presenting, facilitating and bringing people together. My areas of expertise are diversity & inclusion, unconscious bias training, intercultural management and inclusive leadership.",

You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't. - Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n\nI am a Diversity & Inclusion trainer, consultant and keynote speaker. My speciality lies in D&I themes such as bias-training, inclusive leadership, intercultural communication, empowerment programs and mentoring & sponsoring programs. Prior to this I worked as Diversity Manager for EY. I feel strongly about creating a fair and equal working environment for everyone, regardless of gender, race, background, sexuality, age or whatever defines us. Creating a diverse workforce is not a goal in itself, but creating an inclusive organisational culture, especially within the corporate realm, is what I most love doing.\n\nOften asked to give keynotes, most recently in Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Diversity Association, at Rabobank for Coming Out Day, at Nike for their EMEA leadership team, at Deutsche Bank for their Inclusion Event, at EY for their Career Watch Program, Johnson & Johnson for their Women\u2019s Network Event, ABN AMRO Private banking for their mentoring program kick off and NN (Nationale Nederlanden) for their Diversity launch. Training and consultancy clients include various law firms such as De Brauw, Blackstone & Westbroek, consultancies as KPMG and Deloitte, various universities including Delft University of Technology, and various governmental organisations including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ABD.",
