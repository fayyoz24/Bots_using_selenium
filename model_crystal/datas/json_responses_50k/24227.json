    "summary": "Program Manager, Policy Officer and Strategy consultant in Healthcare, Welfare, the Public Domain and International Relations. From 2014-2016 local governor (wethouder).\n\nCombines an analytical mind with excellent communication skills. Communicates well with people of all backgrounds and hierarchical levels. Is used to work in complex multi disciplinary settings and projects and is skilled to bridge the gap between people who are more monodisciplinary oriented.\nEnthusiastic and result orientated. Able to work both as a team player and independently. Proven experience in managing projects and programs, change management, performing complex analyses, oral and written reporting and organizing events. Also experienced in guiding and training groups and chairing of committees.\n\nMy personal drive is to solve complex societal issues. I believe in an open approach. I have a special interest in intercultural communication and working in international settings. As a result I finished a postdoctoral study on international relations and an extracurricular study on intercultural management, work for the ministry of Foreign Affairs and for NL Works and gained working experience in Mexico and the US. Learning other languages is one of my passions which is of great help with the desire to address people as much as possible in their own language.\n\nFrom May 2014 until november 2016 I had the honour to work as alderman/local governor (wethouder) at Gemeente Zuidplas. Main responsibilities (1) Implementation of legislation on Welfare and Care, from nationally guided welfare and care to locally guided welfare and care (Decentralisatie WMO en langdurige zorg), (2) Policy for Internal Operations of the Municipal Organisation (Interne Bedrijfsvoering Gemeente) and (3) Customer Services (Dienstverlening).",

These consortia typically comprise of businesses, knowledge institutions and the government. We refer to this combination as the \u2018triple helix\u2019. We believe that when the government and corporate sector collaborate, this will result in a better proposition with potential for realising a greater impact. Hence my motto \"If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together\".\n\nI get energized when I  work on programmes that transform business models in order to create positive social impact. Especially when this contributes to solving major challenges of our time, like the tranistion to clean energy and foodsecurity. The mix of technological knowledge, innovations and bringing together different parties to ultimately achieve sustainable impact is very inspiring. It is  both a great responsibility and pleasure to contribute to this.",
