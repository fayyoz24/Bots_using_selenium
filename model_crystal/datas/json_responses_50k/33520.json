A growing human population and their need for land and agricultural development has resulted in a significant loss of territory for the wild elephant populations in Sri Lanka. Crop raiding by elephants frequently initiates violent responses from local farmers, whose entire livelihoods depend on their farm products. Project Orange Elephant (POE) is helping to ease this tension.  \n\nSLWCS is working with local communities to create alternative forms of agriculture and provide new cash crops, including oranges and limes which work as a buffer crop against elephants. By growing a barrier of citrus trees around their rice and vegetable crops, rural Sri Lankan farmers are creating an effective elephant deterrent and providing new, sustainable income while keeping their families and wild elephants safe."

With over 80% of the population of Kampot Province directly depending on fishery, the conservation of these forests is crucially important. Therefore, the Regional Fisheries Livelihoods Programme of the FAO supports mangrove restoration efforts in the Trapeang Sangkea Fishery Community in Kampot. I have been involved in this programme through providing education about the importance of mangrove ecosystems to the local communities as well as through replanting mangrove areas and developing mangrove nurseries.
