    "summary": "I\u2019m an expert in the field of sustainable careers, performance and the well-being of human capital in organizations. In a rapidly changing (digital) world, we should help individuals excel in the current work context, without compromising their productivity, employability and vitality in the long term. I'm convinced that a committed, motivated and fit - both mentally and physically - workforce determines future success.\nFor me, that solution lies in a fundamentally different approach and a paradigm shift in the relationship between employee and employer. They need to enter into a more equal and mutual working relationship. Only if they regularly discuss that working relationship, career success and career ownership, can there be a win-win situation for both parties.\nWith my company Zest for Work I want to enable growth, inspire action and mobilize positive change on these themes, for individuals, teams and organizations. Because work is simply more impactful and fun when you are at your best.\n--- Next to leading my own organization, I\u2019m a strong professional that has the unique combination of being a sensitive and people-oriented person with an analytical technical industrial background - and corporate leadership experience. With 10 years\u2019 experience in the corporate world in various roles, ranging from Corporate HR, Occupational Health and Wellbeing to Supply Chain, I bring a broad understanding of the business, together with extensive experience on the topics of sustainable employability, human performance and wellbeing. I\u2019m an ICF certified Coach and hold a Master's degree in Science, and post grad in holistic nutrition.\n\nBesides my passion for what drives and motivates people, I\u2019m passionate about outdoor sports and mountaineering - which is quite a challenge being born in the flattest country on earth.\n\nWant to how you or your organisation can start thriving instead of surviving?
