    "summary": "It is my believe that each person reacts in a different way to an (working-) environment. This can differ per person, but also per moment or activity. Where previously a more general workplace approach was applied about, this will increasingly shift to an approach that focuses more on the personal needs of different types of people and their activities: \nA comfortable workplace that meets these different needs, which will increase well-being and vitality. This holistic approach will lead to more effectiveness and happiness at work. Control, or a sense of control and stimulus regulation such as noise, privacy and personal space are important factors. Also view www.ahrend.com/en/hybrid-working-community and www.ahrend.com/en/expertise/acoustics\n\nIn my professional future I want to focus on in developing, substantiating and propagating workplace concepts. By learning to speak the 'language' of organisations and give a voice to the different, sometimes unknown users by listening carefully and translating their needs. And making them enthusiastic about the plans we are working on together and the changes that are involved.\n\nI design workplaces and provide acoustic consultations. Regularly I give webinars on the vision of the working environment as described above and give master classes acoustics to both national and international organisations, architects and students. Colleagues and customers characterize me as a passionate, professional and indicate that the combination of a modest attitude with thorough professional knowledge is very pleasant.\n\nDuring my studies at the Willem de Koning Academy in Rotterdam I learned to develop concepts. I have built up professional knowledge at Alynia Architecten and at Ahrend. Deepening of this knowledge through the Masterclass by Valtteri Hongisto 'Acoustics in open plan offices' at Level Acoustics TU/e and 'Environmental Psychology' at the UvA. \nProjects at Ahrend e.g.HumanTotalCare Son (Well Builing certificate gold), Headoffice of Roompot, acoustic advice e.g. for Rabobank and TenneT.\n\nIn my spare time I like adventurous backpacking vacations. I have been travelling through SO Asia and India through remote areas  under basic conditions and done several tracks through the Himalayas including Mount Everest Basecamp. I also like reading, sailing and hiking with my 2 dogs.\n\nEducation\n-Interior Design - Willem de Koning Academy \n-Environmental Psychology - University of Amsterdam\n-Masterclass Room Acoustics, openplan/ activity based offices - TUe Level Acoustics, Master: Valtteri Hongisto",
