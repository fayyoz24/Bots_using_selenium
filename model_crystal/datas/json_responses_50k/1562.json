    "summary": "Patricia is a Circular Business Strategy Consultant at Circle Economy. She has been working directly with businesses to identify case-specific circularity opportunities, allowing clients to improve their actions towards a more circular business model. She also has experience facilitating the best practice and learning sharing within coalitions, strengthening the benefits of collaborations. \n\nShe previously worked as a researcher at Utrecht University on packaging reuse and circular economy for CRiSP (Centre of Research in Sustainable Packaging) in collaboration with the University of Twente, Wageningen Food and Biobased Research, and the KIDV (Kennisinstituut Duurzaam Verpakken). Her focus was on understanding how companies reuse packaging in their businesses, what are the barriers and drivers to implementing it, and the environmental impact of reusable packaging compared to single-use options. \n\nShe was a guest panellist at the 7th Reuse Conference in Brussels and in the \u201cReusable packaging for the fashion industry\u201d from Fashion for Good in Amsterdam in 2019. Since then she was invited to speak at webinars and present to different organizations, including for the Portuguese Plastic Pact in 2020.",
