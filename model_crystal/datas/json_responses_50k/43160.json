    "summary": "Back in France after 14 years spent between Denmark and the Netherlands, I wish to bring my experience and energy to help bridge de gap between research and industry and support the rise of sustainable development in water environments.\n\nSince my engineering studies in Le Mans (ENSIM) and Copenhagen (DTU), I had the opportunity to acquire a wide range of both technical and commercial skills in the highly innovative Hearing Health sector in the Netherlands. Very much focused on innovation and customer relations, I particularly enjoy identifying and implementing win-win solutions with a pragmatic approach and a pro-active attitude.\n\nNow settled in La Possonni\u00e8re (49) with my partner and her two daughters, I take advantage of this transition to apply my skills towards innovative and sustainable sectors, and of my free time to renovate the house while waiting for our first child.",
