    "summary": "Documentary filmmaker & producer, with a background as a political assistant in the European Parliament, Dutch diplomat (mainly in EU affairs) and journalist writing for Dutch newspapers & magazines. My stories examine the life choices people make and what these choices tell us about 'Europe' and the systems we live in. Trained as an historian (wrote my thesis on the geopolitics of oil in the Caucasus after the demise of the Soviet Union) I remain fascinated by our recent history as a way to understand the present. I made several short films for museum exhibitions. My recent work focuses on leadership challenges in this fast changing world as we face the rise of authoritarianism. \u2018Notes from Brussels - three women in pursuit of their European dream\u2019 is my feature length documentary debut. The film was theatrically released in Brussels (December 2021) and in four Dutch cities (2022), screened at film festivals and at numerous events with a focus on Europe, leadership and wellbeing at work, and was broadcasted on Dutch TV & NPO Start (May 2023);\n\n\"\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude00\"\nTV Magazine of Dutch broadcaster VPRO \n\n \u201c\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\u201d\nCinema magazine \u2018De Filmkrant\u2019\n\n\u201c\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e, \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e. \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\u201d\nMagazine on International Affairs \u2018Clingendael Spectator\u2019\n\nMore info (trailer, credits, reviews, booking of film for your event): https://www.notesfrombrussels.eu/\n\nCurrently researching a documentary that examines the evolving moral vision and geopolitical role of the Netherlands on the world stage.

The film showed at film festivals and at numerous private events within international organizations (NATO, EU institutions & agencies), consultancies, women-networks and universities. In May 2022 the film was released in Dutch film theaters and toured Maastricht (Lumiere Cinema), The Hague (Het Filmhuis Den Haag) and Wageningen (Movie W Wageningen) with a final stop in Amsterdam (Het Ketelhuis) on July 4th. Most screenings were linked to animated after-discussions, with the engaged participation of the film's cast (main characters and myself) as well as stakeholders in EU politics, diplomacy, security & defense and female empowerment networks.",
