The position included the guidance of other developer (including Seniors) and the collaboration with Principal Developers and Engineering Managers to determine the area strategy.\n\nHere are some of my achievements during that period of time:\n\n- Governance. Creation of guidelines to evaluate if the performance of migrations to our new web applications framework was in line with our expectations. These guidelines, based on historical data, gave clear limits to developers regarding performance and helped them to make the correct decisions while evaluating experiments. In addition to the creation of the guidelines I kept a close eye on every experiment for Extranet to check the performance impact. This helped my team to detect outliers, revisit the migration and fix it.\n- Implementation of a system (in Java) to gather web vitals metrics. This system is currently in production and receives requests from different web applications, including our main website as well as others. It receives millions requests per day.\n- Collaboration with other areas of the company to migrate our backend systems to kubernetes.\n- Creation of a tool to generate Grafana dashboards automatically so our teams can have visibility of the behaviour of the systems they own.\n- Maintenance of Extranet server-side rendering core functionality. I introduced performance improvements reducing the DB footprint by 75% and update operations by 99%. I also coordinated the works to solve a long outage that affected the system gathering important contributors together, organizing daily meetings, setting and evaluation hypotheses, testing and solving the issue.\n- Mentoring of developers at different levels.",

During part of my time in this position I was acting as a Lead Developer as part of my trial to move to that role. Here are some highlights of my time as a Senior Developer:\n\n- Co-creation of a modern web stack for Extranet for modern web applications development. It was a big step and the first one towards the deprecation of Mason and the adoption of Vue.js pages. With this we also created a strong separation of concerns between the backend code and the frontend code, which was previously very entangled inside the Mason files.\n- Dogfooding and refinement of the framework through page migrations before releasing it to a broader community.\n- Improvements to the code resulting in a reduction of 2 seconds per call compared to the original version (called millions of times per day).\n- Definition and documentation of the best practices for the framework usage.\n- Main contact point for the migrations of other pages\u2019 backend code.\n- Performance improvements of the Extranet\u2019s home page. The page suffered from a severe performance degradation with requests taking 15 seconds (and spikes of 25). I lowered the wall clock leaving it between 3.7 and 4.6 seconds. I achieved this without previous knowledge of performance improvements. I shared my new acquired knowledge and recommendations with the community and implemented alerts to notify the owners to reduce the possibility of this happening again.\n- Support for the implementation of a self service system to allow our partners to manage users, including creation and rights configuration.\n- I helped to change the culture in the company introducing code reviews in my area.",

This reduced the total page load time by 40%. These changes also allowed accounts with a high number of properties to access Extranet, which was not possible for them before.\n- Creation of the backend to allow Booking's partners to perform bulk operations on all their properties and increase their efficiency. From that moment our partners were able change a handful of properties or thousands of them at the same time through our website. Currently this implementation is still in use. Millions of changes have been made using it.\n- Part of the GDPR team which helped the company to be compliant with personal identifiable information regulations.\n- Migration of the backend reservations system, including the detection and fixes of bugs to measure the system SLOs.",
