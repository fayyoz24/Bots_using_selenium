    "summary": "Arjen was for 20 years in his role of co-owner and COO one of the main business accelerators behind Rituals. A company which he and his partners built from scratch to a leading beauty & lifestyle brand with a global presence of over 800 stores, (digital) partnerships and webshops in over 30 markets with roughly 8000 employees. \n\nArjen's personal motto is 'making the most out of the everyday' and especially the notion of enjoying every special little moment in life. He is very much a self-taught man, by being independent and by learning by doing. And that's the way he inspires himself and other people around him with tremendous energy to take on every challenge to make this world a better place, step-by-step.\n\nMany years ago he promised himself that there would come a time to start 'giving back to society'. Together with his wife Eliane he started the ShareAndWonder Foundation that supports charity projects in East Africa, among which educational programs in Zanzibar and forestation projects in Tanzania. In addition to that they support eco-preneurs who create truly sustainable businesses. \n\nHaving traveled the world for many years, learning seven languages and being inspired by different cultures he is now ready to contribute in a new way.\n\nA sportsman by heart, an avid reader & writer by choice, a chef by coincidence and a family man by nature.\n\n\"If you can do it today why wait till tomorrow!\"\n\n\n",
