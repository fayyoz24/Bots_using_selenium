                    "description": "Since I was 14 years old, I always dreamt about going to the United States. When I graduated from high school I went with my mom to New York City for a couple days. It was amazing!! Seeing things with your own eyes what you usually see on the television. Walking around in such a busy city that never sleeps, seeing Central Park and celebrating Independence Day. It was a lot of fun!\n\nIn August 2016 I flew to NYC with a few other au pairs from the Netherlands and then I flew to Portland, Oregon. Where I was going to stay for one year and taking care of two little boys. Eventually I decided to extend my year for another year, so in total I stayed for 2 years. \n\nI was taking care of the kids during the week and half a day in the weekend. I was working more then what I did in the UK, but I also have had my own car so I could go anywhere with the kids. My host dad is from Belgium, so towards the kids I was speaking Dutch. \n\nI joined the family with the American traditions like halloween, which was so fun. I went pumpkin picking with the family and I was surprised that not only the kids were going to dress up and go around the neighborhood, but also the grown ups. We also celebrated St. Nicolas and Kingsday. (Dutch celebrations) \n\nI travelled a lot around the US to different places and flying became easier and easier. (NYC, Toronto (Canada), San Fransisco, San Diego, Belgium/NL, Virginia, Utah, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Seattle). I did a weekend course in San Diego and Utah to learn more about the culture/history of America and we did some excursions as well. \n\nAnd before you know it I was already back in the Netherlands again. The time flew by in an eye wink. The boys were growing up so fast. I was learning so much, having a lot of fun, improving my English and discovering different places. It was another dream come true!",

The reason why I wanted to go to England was to improve my English language, to take care of the kids and to learn how to be on my own. \n\nTo get there I\u2019ve had to fly by myself, which was a big thing for me to do back then. Not everything went as I hoped it would be, because I was standing at the wrong gate, my suitcase broke open as soon as I landed. Not a fun first flight, but I learned a lot. \n\nEven though I was taking care of two kids during the week I was also helping out around the house with cooking and doing the laundry. I spend my free time with my friends, host family, horse riding or baking.  \n\nTo meet new people and to make new friends I\u2019ve had to speak the English language. I knew the basics, but I could still learn a lot. All the friends I\u2019ve got back then were all from different countries so we had no choice, but speaking the English language. It amazed me (and it still does) hearing them speak in their own language and still be able to talk to them through the English language. It\u2019s incredible what you can do in this world by only speaking English..\n\nI also learned how to adapt myself to a new family, but also a whole new culture and how to be independent. After you\u2019ve been in a different country you will look at things differently. I look in a different way to the Netherlands, but also about my own life growing up. You realize how good things are, but also know how things can be different. \n\nLooking back at my life it was a huge step in my life to step out of my own comfort zone and jump right into a different new life. It was scary for sure, but also fun and exciting. I\u2019m really happy I did that, because when I came back home everything was the same, but me.",
