Myself and a fellow second level student were among the first youth ambassadors to take part in this programme in Ireland. We worked as a team to encourage and facilitate youth-led advocacy among Irish young people with regards to a range of developmental and social justice issues. The primary focus of this role was to examine the importance of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in a global perspective. I was responsible for presenting and educating younger students on human rights, sustainable development, advocacy and international organizations such as the EU and the UN along with the work and importance of non-governmental organizations. This was done through supporting ERI campaigns along with devising independent awareness strategies. I was part of an international network of ambassadors who shared ideas and supported campaigns to create a global wave of effective social policy change. I visited the United Nations in Geneva as part of this role and attended the 34th Human Rights Council which gave me an insight into the applications of public policy, diplomacy and sustainable development in an international environment.\nhttp://www.edmundriceinternational.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ERI-Youth-Ambassador-Project.pdf"
