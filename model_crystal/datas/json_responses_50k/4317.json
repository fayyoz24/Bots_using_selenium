The result was a fresh new brnad concept named ICIDU.\n\nSourcing products in the Far East and developing new products with Chinese vendors were some of the tasks I liked in particular. It is always great to develop something new and seeing it take of!\n\nWith a small team we have rebranded the concept ICIDU and created a completely new packaging- and sales concept, ready for the European market. We have successfully sold the concept within our own group (MyCom stores) and to independent resellers in the Netherlands and Belgium. ICIDU was successfully sold in Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n\nWithin my role as Business Unit Manager I also visited some of the main customers of the BAS group. These could be larger retailers and independent resellers in the Benelux region. Eventually I was invited to take over the  responsibilities of the Sales Manager and manage a team of 9 FTE.\n\nDuring sourcing trips I would spend 1-2 weeks in the Far East and visiting European distributors or retailers would usually take 2-3 days. Average international travelling component would be around 20% - 25%.",

Development of the entire Addison product line, purchasing the required products in the Far East, exporting these products with my export team to European retailers and -distributors and leading the sales- and office team (6 FTE) describe my main activities.\n\nIn the beginning, Addison was a small retail brand developed by Dawidenko in Noordwijk but when the company was sold to Samas and later to Corporate Express / Staples Advantage it also became a B2B brand in the Staples catalogues, giving it extra European exposure. Later on, the Addison products and sources were also used as the foundation of private label products of Staples Advantage. \n\nWe have been able to successfully roll out the Addison brand to leading European retailers and distribution partners in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Turkey and Scandinavia.\n\nOne of the visible results of this job was that I often joined travellers in an airplane that were using products that I had developed!\n\nThis role required extensive travelling. Both for longer periods (2 \u2013 4 weeks) to China, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong as well as shorter trips to European retailers and distributors. The travelling component  was between 40%-50%.",

Some of our products had a limited shelf life and cross border business was quite complicated with different import duties and -regulations per country. Not to forget the many different currencies we sold in at that time. A great first job with interesting learning curves! \n\nI would spend approx. 30% of my time travelling to European customers with a focus on Scandinavia.",
