Main focus was on the products Afterloaders and robotic seed delivery equipment, grade BF for applied parts. The Afterloader have a radioactive tip connected to a wire that penetrates the cancer tumor for a diversity of body sites. The seed delivery robot for prostate cancer insert radioactive capsules in the prostate via pre inserted needles. I was working with analogue and digital electronic design as well as a project leader. We follow the medical design standards 60601-1, third edition. Hazard analysis and quality management are taken very seriously and are also compulsory for medical equipment.\n\nHere is an extract of some of my projects:\n\n-\tRe-engineering of the Micro Selectron Afterloader because of obsolete components and new regulations. I was here the project manager and the lead engineer of all the hardware electronics, also responsible for EMC and safety aspects.\n-\tImprovements of the robotic Seedloader for prostate treatment. A self made sensor was made to measure the radioactivity rate of each seed. This was a higly sensitive circuit where pA (pico-amperes) was measured. By lowering the noise in the analogue electronics the accuracy was greatly improved and the high demands of this device could be accomplished. \n-\tA new concept have been created in collaboration with UMCU hospital in Utrecht. All brachy treatments have the disadvantage that you can not be completely sure that the treatment was done as expected. A revolutionary design was made to monitor in real time the complete treatment with an MR, Magnetic Resonance, scanner. I was designing an Afterloader that could be used in the same room as the MR scanner. The idea is to minimize patient transport and time between imaging and treatment. I was the project leader and the lead engineer for this project. The first prototype is now in use for patients at the hospital in Utrecht.",

Risk management was a major topic. Participating in early negotiations with clients regarding budget and functionality of the final product. Important for Chess was my ability to understand what the client really want, which is not always what they say. You have to fully understand the problem to find out the real need.\n\nIn a major project, where I was the project leader, we developed a new wifi unit for Lucent technologies. My strength was to keep both team members and higher managers updated with the present status, summarizing progress and upcoming challenges in a eye-catching manner. Often simply by a colourful A4 sheet hanging on the door for everyone to see, refreshed every day. I find a great pleasure in content and satisfied clients, especially as Lucent asked me back as a project-leader for the next project.\n\nAs a HW engineer I worked with analogue as well as digital electronics. One project, for example, was from FROG Navigation System BV, where we developed a part of their motor management system for driver less vehicles. There I designed high sensitive inputs in combination with fast high current switching technology and some embedded software.\n\nEMC and CE certifications forms an essential part of my work. I was chosen to be the leader of Chess EMC/CE \u201cdiscipline-team\u201d. This was a team specialized in EMC theory and regulations as well as practical implementation on design, schematic and layout level.
