    "summary": "We all want to feel safe, belong and add value, don't we? To feel good about ourselves and what we are doing. \n\nMy work aims to support senior professionals in their leadership and change cultures at work moving towards more human leadership.\n\nMy background: after a successful 20+ year career in international communication management in the corporate sector & general management in health care facilities, I now design and deliver senior leadership programs. My experiences living and working abroad, built cross and intercultural sensitivity which allows me to work with a broad range of people as well as organisational cultures. \n\nI hold an MA in Communication, am a certified Stanford trained Compassion facilitator, a certified coach and experienced facilitator and mentor to senior leaders. My approach is systemic, somatic and holistic, combining different wisdom traditions in online as well as live programs.\n\nToday, I work at THNK, school for creative leadership and act as compassion ambassador for CCARE at Stanford University. I am commited to living life with my full presence and an open heart. It\u2019s about striving to be non-judgmental and kind in each interaction. And attempt to bringing these qualities of the heart to the forefront of our systems and decision-making. I believe that directing your attention inward first builds awareness, calms and clears the mind, and supports you find root in where you are, where you came from and where you want to go. As leaders of organisations as well as in your personal life. Then only can you have and take response-ability.",

Much of her poems are a conversation between herself and the different parts of her Jewish, German, English, and Dutch heritage. She also ventures into more recent work around being brave and moving away from those family ties to moving into a new way of being. By holding the conversation lightly, deeper connections and new insights are woven into the evening with ease.\"",

Tutors will work with students as they brainstorm, write, and revise their poems and help prepare students to record their podcasts and explore audio editing and online publishing.  \n"
