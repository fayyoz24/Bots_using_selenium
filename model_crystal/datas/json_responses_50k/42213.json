    "summary": "[NEDERLANDS: KLIK RECHTSBOVEN] A passionate generalist with a green heart and a global mindset. I am dedicated to contribute to our society by standing up for those that are most vulnerable. My background in humanities and the government has strengthened my belief in a multidisciplinary approach in which all talents and backgrounds are needed. I feel comfortable with an organisation in transition, in which I aim to connect people and inspire them to think in solutions rather than obstacles.\n\nMy strength lies in being flexible, culturally sensitive and asking critical questions when needed. I always look for creative ways to achieve my goals. I thrive most in an inclusive environment where there is space to innovate, reflect and explore new ways of working together.",
