    "summary": "I studied computer science at the Erasmus University Rotterdam and ever since my graduation project I have been interested in using IT for international trade facilitation. As researcher I published various papers on the relationship between trust and control mechanisms, contract modelling using formal logic and automated negotiation between autonomous agents.\n\nAfter some time in the academic world I got involved hands-on and worked in various innovative procurement-related projects to introduce EDI, e-procurement, reverse auctions, vendor managed inventory, procurement outsourcing etc. at large industrial organizations such as Akzo Nobel, General Electric and Shell. \n\nIn 2005 became an expat and worked the next 10 years as project procurement manager in Germany, France, Nigeria and Kenya on projects for Shell and Total. In Nigeria I trained local staff and ensured that all local content objectives were accomplished.\n\nIn 2015 I returned to the Netherlands to work for Bluewater on various FPSO and SURF projects for Total Angola and Shell UK. I negotiated multi-million US$ contracts, ensured the on time and on budget delivery and handled claims, performance guarantees and warranty issues. I also worked as the onsite representative for Bechtel at Yokogawa to deliver the ICSS system for the BP West Nile Delta project. I enjoyed travelling the world to visit clients, yards and manufacturers.",
