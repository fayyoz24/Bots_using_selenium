I started by exploring the relationship of AMF and SOM on natural raspberry populations, which could be helpful as a benchmark for crop production. I investigated 15 natural raspberry populations in forests and examined the relationships between fruit production and AMF colonization rate and SOM content. From 2018 to 2020, I conducted three pot-field experiments by adopting either two out of the three factors (insect pollination, AMF and SOM) and each experiment accompanied by four levels\u2019 fertilizer treatments, with raspberry as the study system. I have tested the interacting effects of the experimental factors on the production of raspberry (total yield) and relating parameters (flower number, fruit set, fruit number and single berry weight), and on visitation rates of pollinators. The results mainly reveal additive or synergistic beneficial effects of insect pollination, AMF and SOM on production, while benefits of AMF and SOM vanished when conducted them combinedly. Part of the findings have been published in a peer-review journal, and the rest are in preparation. I dominated the whole processes of the experiments, from designing, building, regular managements to harvest, also from data analysis to writing and submitting for publication, with kind guidance and supervises from my supervisor team.",
