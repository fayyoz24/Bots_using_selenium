    "summary": "Markets: drinking water, waste water, utilities, energy\nTechnology: Maintenance & Asset Management, Outsourcing, SAMP / AMP, ISO55000, VDM-XL, IAM\nSkills: connecting people, innovation, industry 4.0, IIoT, Digital Transformation, process management, Reliability Engineering\nValues: integrity, trust, independence, persistence, sustainability, self-starting, loyalty, knowledge and result-oriented\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nI have a drive to understand my clients and the market developments and to combine this with up-to-date knowledge to add value. Asset Management is a connecting discipline by definition and I'm driven to connect people to make Asset Management work. New developments like Industry 4.0 and IIoT need cooperation with (knowledge) partners and I feel that my broad development (technical and managerial) provides overlap between MaxGrip and partners, enabling effective cooperation.\n\nI feel most comfortable in development processes when there is a need for creativity, trust and the ability to bring people together to find solutions. It is my strength during these processes to model and visualize issues to create a shared understanding, which contributes to adequate decision-making and further steps in the process.\n\nBoth in my professional life and personal life I like to contribute to sustainable solutions and to decrease our environmental footprint. I take action towards zero emission in my house, to minimise the MaxGrip footprint and to help clients minimizing their footprint. In this perspective I'm happy to be active in the markets of Energy and Drinking & Waste Water, the latter who make the transition to suppliers of raw materials and energy.\n\nImportant values for me are integrity, trust, independence, persistence, sustainability, self-starting, loyalty, knowledge and result-oriented",
