    "summary": "With a robust foundation in business and finance, I took the lead at our family's enterprise, Teddy Kids, in 2010. Under my leadership from 2018, Teddy Kids didn't just become a prominent daycare in Leiden; it evolved into a symbol of quality. With our flagship centers on Rijnsburgerweg and the iconic Lorenzkade, combined with our distinctive pink and blue Tesla fleet and our endearing alpacas, we've cemented our brand. Our bilingual curriculum, anchored in excellence, has made Teddy Kids the go-to institution in the region.\n\n2019 was a pivot year. Driven by my innate passion for construction, I diversified our portfolio. Today, we've stamped our mark in prime locales such as Leiden, Den Haag, Tulum, and Dubai.\n\nThe journey continued in 2022 with the launch of TISA \u2013 a state-of-the-art international business/STEM school in Leiden, dedicated to nurturing the next generation, starting from age 3. Our first year was nothing short of phenomenal. From our students' inaugural company projects to their captivating performance in the Nutcracker Christmas show, we've set a high bar.\n\nToday, we are in August 2023: as TISA Leiden celebrates its maiden anniversary, we also spread our wings with the introduction of TISA Lisbon. Our global TISA community now enriches the lives of 90 eager learners. In the same breath, Teddy Kids marks its 19th year \u2013 a testimony to our relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\nDiscover more about our ventures:\n\nTeddy Kids: www.teddykids.nl | Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/teddykids.nl/\nTISA: www.tisaschool.nl | Instagram - http://instagram.com/tisaleiden/",

The system was designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, automating tasks such as rosters, invoicing, tracking illnesses, and even payments. This automation meant branches could reduce paperwork and bookkeeping, leading to better quality care at reduced costs.\n\neKids had aimed to be the one-stop-shop for busy parents and managers.\n\nThis was a passion project close to my heart. For several years, I poured my energy and resources into it, even establishing an office in India with a dedicated team of 15 developers. However, despite the dedication and commitment, the project came to a close and entered an indefinite pause. There's a possibility that one day we might revive and take it further, but for now, it remains a cherished experience.\n\nThis journey equipped me with invaluable skills.
