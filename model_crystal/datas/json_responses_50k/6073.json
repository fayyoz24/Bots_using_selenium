    "summary": "I concluded my Integrated Master\u2019s Degree in Bioengineering at the University of Porto (Portugal) in 2018. I performed my MSc thesis project at i3S/INEB in Porto and the central aim was to engineer a 3D tumor microenvironment to study the crosstalk between cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and vascular cells. A heterotypic 3D breast cancer model was established based on a vascularized porous scaffold combined with an epithelial cell-laden hydrogel. After my graduation, I worked as a research fellow in Prof. Jo\u00e3o Mano Lab at the University of Aveiro (Portugal). My work was focused on the development of spherically structured 3D pancreatic-stromal heterotypic tumor models for combinatorial drug screening.\n\nIn September 2020, I joined MERLN as a Doctoral candidate. My PhD project is part of a European project called JOINTPROMISE that aims to develop an automated, GMP-grade platform producing large, patterned and vascularized joint implants providing also a paradigm shift for generic automated manufacturing of organoid-based tissue implants. The main challenge to engineer osteochondral tissue is to mimic their complex structural organization and functionality. My goal is to implement bioprinting approaches for the creation of a stable and transient chondral microtissues to be incorporated in the aimed implants.",

K\u00fchn\nResearch project: Light-triggered and bio-engineered anti-microbial hydrogels\nUnder Erasmus+ programme, I worked as a research intern in the University Medical Centrum Groningen and University of Groningen (Netherlands), where I focused on the development of light-triggered and bio-engineered anti-microbial hydrogels, under the supervision of Dr. Patrick van Rijn. I studied the possibility of using cyclodextrin modified alginate hydrogels as a delivery tool for the newly photo-switchable antibiotics developed by Wiktor Szimanski and Ben Feringa. I studied the photo-responsive system using UV-Vis, IR, NMR and used peptide chemistry for the hydrogel development.",
