    "summary": "I am a maritime professional with 30 years experience in the industry, as a Ship Captain offshore and subsequently, as a maritime consultant onshore. I am developing energy efficient maritime technologies - detachable autonomous thrusters for dynamic positioning of ships, subsea magnets and digital twin simulation models for ports.\n\nMy passion to improve the efficiency of the maritime industry led me to establishing advisory services for planning and optimization of ports and logistics. I created a team of naval architects, offshore engineers, civil engineers and port planners, and completed over a 100 marine consulting projects which included port development strategies, ship-to-ship transfers, financial modeling & cost optimization, risk assessments and nautical studies.",
