Activities included seismic interpretation, prospect evaluation, resource and risk estimation among others.\n\u2022\tLed the evaluation of a 1590 Km2 exploratory area (Block N37) located in deep to ultra-deep Cuban waters, including seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation. Quantified recoverable resources > 1.000 MMbbl in a strongly faulted and pledged carbonatic environment.\n\u2022\tLed the macro project \u201cEvaluation of Exploratory Opportunities in Latin America 2011\u201d for the international branch of Petrobras (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela and the Caribbean).\n\u2022\tIdentified 30+ successful locations in Cuervito and Fronterizo blocks (\u201ctight gas reservoirs\u201d) located in Burgos basin (M\u00e9xico) after seismic reinterpretation and well analysis.\n\u2022\tCoordinated the generation of the geological static model for the exploratory offshore block Moruy II (Gulf of Venezuela; neighbor to Perla Field) including proposals for two exploratory wells with risked recoverable resources > 2 Tcf. \n\u2022\tCoordinated the team in charge of quantifying resources in Carabobo I (OOIP > 45.000 MMbbl) located in the Orinoco heavy oil belt in Venezuela. \n\u2022\tLed the process to acquire Moruy-3D (offshore Venezuela) and N37-2D (offshore Cuba) seismic surveys. Supervised several seismic processings and reprocessings.",
