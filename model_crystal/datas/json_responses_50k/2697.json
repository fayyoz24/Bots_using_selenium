We automated the underlying cost allocation process. The Be & Lux project (2007) lasted 10 months and reported EUR 14mio benefit. The operational chain of activities were handed over to Hungary and are still running.\nOur new team developed and implemented systems to present detailed margin by matching costs to revenue. Contract teams were trained and instructed to check their financial margin. \nI ran project MUcci with 2.2FTE for 11 months (2010) checking margin of 201 accounts with a net result of EUR 4.1 mio and a monthly run-rate up EUR 259K (92K revenue). We trained our colleagues in Hungary how to use the systems and control margin.\nIn 2008 time reporting was introduced and trained by me at Bespoke helpdesk (35 members).",
