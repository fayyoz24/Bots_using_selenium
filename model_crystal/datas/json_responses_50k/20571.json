    "summary": "Sometimes your body does what it wants to do and not what you want it to do! You meet hard to place physical / emotional challenges. That is what I work on and have helped many people with. \n\nI use a mix of old Eastern more 'energetic methods' and up to date Western therapeutic approaches such as Focusing and Somatic Experiencing. I always work with how you relate to your body. I interact with people mostly with just words. Touch helps in some cases. I get good results even by telephone or Skype over long distances. I use Dutch, English or French. \n\nI used to be scientist with a career in the Netherlands and the USA (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Later I became a business consultant for strategy in Europe.\n \nAfter I \"retired\" I moved to Thailand to study and practice Taoism with Master Mantak Chia. I became a senior instructor for Chi Kung and a teacher and practitioner of Chi Nei Tsang and Energy Healing. I liked the holistic approach of body AND emotions. In my therapy I incorporated these methods with up to date Western methods such as focusing - to connect with the wisdom of your body - and somatic experiencing - for trauma resolution.\nAt present I am mostly in the Hague, in the Netherlands, but also regularly in Paris and the Boston area in the USA.Yet, I can work anywhere by telephone or Skype.\n\nSpecialties: Psycho-Somatic work, Trauma Resolution, Regression-therapy, Game of Transformation, Chi Kung, Chi Nei Tsang (Chinese energetic massage), Advaita Vedanta",

I worked with many organizations and in many fields: development isues, social consequences of technological change, changing customer preferences, environmental sytems, health care and life styles, urban systems. Usually I did not know anything about such fields and would quickly learn. Because of my different way of looking at these systems from cybernetics people would also learn together with me and see their reality with different eyes. I moved on to other fields but am ready to more work in this area.",

In most cases I found that people who came to me had other problems which had nestled in their body. I would steer our discussion in an appropriate direction and at the same time do some massage. That worked fine. So I later trained in Somatic Experiencing to be better able to deal with trauma and in Focusing so that I could also teach people how to communicate better with what they felt in their bodies.
