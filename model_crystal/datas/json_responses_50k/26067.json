    "summary": "I\u2019ve been through Europe for work and studies. Along the way I discovered that my passion is bringing people from different cultures and backgrounds together. Coming originally from Ukraine and having to start my life all over again a few times  in a few different countries, I had to overcome various challenges. Integrating, looking for work, overcoming differences in mentality and adapting to new environments. \n\nNow my goal is to help others in this same situation. \n\nWith experience in project management, marketing, event organization and my Finnish education in International Business Management, I am still learning to bring my personal vision to work. Learning new skills and new ways is my greatest pleasure. Life taught me that the only stable thing in the world is change, that\u2019s why I believe that learning is a never ending process.\n\nIn my current role of Project Coordinator, I manage projects that are aimed to help Ukrainian refugees to feel more comfortable in this new country. Also, we organize events throughout the Netherlands to bring Dutch and Ukrainian people together, to support newcomers with their search for work. \n\nYou can reach me at +31620970731 or adelinapotrymay@gmail.com",
