    "summary": "I am a Chemical Weapons Inspector (Analytical Chemist) within the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons based in The Hague working towards a world free of chemical weapons by verifying compliance of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nOriginally from Vancouver, Canada, I have degrees in Analytical Chemistry from Carleton University and The University of British Columbia. Formerly, I was with the R&D arm of Canadian National Defence at DRDC (Defence Research and Development Canada) at the Suffield Research Centre in the Chemical Biological Assessment & Protection section. I am a former Governor of Medicine Hat College that provided governance oversight and strategic vision to the 3,000 student (2100 FTE), 440 employee comprehensive community institution and its $60 million annual budget.\n\nAt Carleton, I studied chemistry focusing on analytical chemistry. Under the co-supervision of Dr. RT Patterson & Dr. Bob Burk, my undergraduate thesis used analytical chemistry to explore geochemical markers to identify land use changes preserved in lake sediments. Throughout my undergrad, I was an integral part of Dr. Tim Pattersons Carleton Climate and Environmental Research Group by planning & taking part in field work and preparing & analyzing samples & data.\n\nFor my M. Sc. in chemistry, I was part of the Okanagan Regional Chemical Analysis Centre at UBC Okanagan that did a wide variety of chemical analysis using various analytical techniques and instrumentation. I developed novel ionization sources for mass spectrometers and hardware development for chemical analysis. We looked at mechanisms of Photon Induced Chemical Ionization (PICI) in Atmospheric Pressure Photo Ionization systems and Stationary Sample Introduction (SSI) methods. \n\nAt UBC Vancouver, I was working towards a Ph. D. in Experimental Medicine with Dr. Juergen Kast at the UBC Biomedical Research Centre. We were looking at developing new mass spectrometers to better characterize and understand biochemical process of blood. I helped develop hardware to fragment proteins and peptides using photo-generated electrons to induce ECD/ ETD like dissociation to identify post-translational modifications. I also researched new methods to study protein-protein interactions in our studies of causes of cardiovascular diseases.",

With my chemistry and logistics background, I assisted in the preparation of instruments for missions by inventorying and packing. My extensive IT background was useful, when after gaining in depth knowledge of the current version of ODMS, I evaluated beta versions of future versions of ODMS and worked with the software developer to identify and fix bugs. It was a self driven initiative that has led to new, more time efficient solid state hard drives that will soon be deployed in mission laptops. After hearing feedback from an AC inspector about the long time it can take to wipe a mission laptop on some missions I proposed, evaluated and presented results of the new solid state hard drives that are dramatically more time efficient. My extensive mass spectrometry and method development experience was useful when I developed GC-MS/MS methods looking at CW metabolites in biomedical samples that aided in the recent biomedical proficiency testing. I updated, developed and delivered several presentations on behalf of the Lab. In a branding effort, I designed various Lab branded gear (shirts, lab coats, medallions, pens etc). I was eager to assist the Verification Division in various outreach activities including a successful OPCW Open House and science outreach to a local school. My outreach garnered strong praise up to the Director of Verification. Throughout my time at the OPCW, I demonstrated the core values of the OPCW of Integrity, Professionalism and supported Equality.

While investigating biochemical properties of blood, I researched the fundamentals of tandem mass spectrometry focused on advancing a new dissociation technique that allowed for characterization of labile (delicate) modifications to peptides in blood samples. I was the principle operator of a QToF instrument and conducted maintenance and repairs (minor and major) to ensure maximum uptime. My research added the capability to detect, not seen before, modifications in blood samples that were relevant for cardiovascular diseases. Conducting research on the proteomic make up of blood gave me significant experience with handling of biomedical material, sample cleanup, extraction, concentration and analysis.",

The second part of my research was to design and built a simple photo ionization source capable of operating at ambient pressure without specialized gases making it perfect for field sampling. Additionally, as part of the Okanagan Regional Chemical Analysis Centre I used a number of instruments for analysis (both for research/ teaching and fee for service): FTIR, ASE, XRF, ICP OES, Isotope MS, NMR, LC, GC.",
