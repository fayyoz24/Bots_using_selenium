    "summary": "Hi there. My name is Vincent. AskMeAnything[tm].\n\nI\u2019m a senior data professional who worked as an engineer, researcher, team lead, and educator in the past. I\u2019m especially interested in understanding algorithmic systems so that one may prevent failure. As such, I\u2019ve had a preference for simpler solutions that scale, as opposed to the latest and greatest from the hype cycle. \n\nLanguages: Python, Javascript/HTML, R\nTechnologies: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Polars, Keras, Pytorch, Docker, Jupyter, spaCy, Pytest, FastAPI, Typer, Rich, Prodigy, Jinja2, alpine.js, htmx, and whatever CloudStuff[tm] from the CloudProvider[tm]\n\nIn the past I've been: \n\n- a popular tech recruitment meme \n- co-founder and co-chair of PyData Amsterdam\n- a data/open source evangelist with a track record of speaking\n- creator/maintainer of a whole bunch of open-source packages, some of which kind of got popular; https://github.com/koaning/\n- an avid advocate of natural intelligence\n- involved with many data projects; from data mining techniques to bayesian recommenders to deep learning to hashing tricks and NLP\n- training 1000+ people in person\n- endorsed many times on linkedin for \"awesomeness\" \n- an educator on https://calmcode.io\n- a blogger over at https://koaning.io\n\nMy university background is in applied mathematics, econometrics, and operations research with a slight specialization in algorithms and machine learning. I taught myself how to code during my master's degree, which turned out to be a very very smart thing to have done. This was despite some of my professors warning me not to spend too much time on it. \n\nI am an informal techie, I enjoy building good systems that make the world a nicer place to live in. I have issues with work environments where growth, greed, and ego are favored over honesty.\n\nContact me any time you like, but be aware that I'm only interested in technical problems worth solving. I\u2019m pretty happy with my career. To any recruiters/tech-bros, I'll gladly point it out to you if your manner is inappropriate. \n\nThat said; I really don't mind getting nerd sniped when it comes to interesting problems, so if you just want to briefly discuss a data problem then I'm all ears and known to give free advice.",

This was an understatement, to the extent that I needed therapy for a few years. It's very hard for me to have good memories of this place, which I acknowledge is very awkward for many of the colleagues that I did enjoy working with. I regret promoting the company and still find it mentally exhausting when I'm reminded of my time there. I would appreciate people keeping this in mind when they interact with me.\n\nIt's a real shame because I like to think I did decent work during my time there. I was the first \"data scientist\" they hired and helped a lot of companies get better at what they do by using data. Eventually, within the group, I was the senior go-to person when it came to algorithm design. As one of the first hires, I played a fundamental role in building the company. I was also responsible for bootstrapping two and a half data traineeships, worked on dozens of impactful projects and I trained over 1000 people.",

Learned a lot, decided I didn't want to be a consultant that needs a suit in order to work. I also feel that if you communicate that you are a big-data firm you should understand that Excel/SPSS is a joke and that Silverlight is a definite no-no.\n\nHaving said this though, I feel that this is not one of the worst 'you-must-wear-a-suit' consultancy firms in the Netherlands. If you are a going to become a graduate and you want to try out consultancy, consider calling for the student internship. You will learn a lot about the world of consultancy and this will make it much easier to make life choices later.",
