    "summary": "Every company has a story to tell; one that will captivate, educate, broaden horizons, entertain and leave a lasting impact. But let's not forget - it also has to hit the mark. That's where I come in, as the wordsmith who weaves a tale that connects with the audience.\n\nWith more than a decade of experience across multinational Fortune 500 companies (getting old!), I've donned both the individual contributor- and small team leader hat in the field of corporate communications. Whether I'm going solo or leading a pack of specialists, as long as my work contributes to the company's success, I'm all in.\n\nI've been fortunate to delve into a diverse range of projects \u2013 internal and external, digital, marketing and change communications. I've crafted comprehensive communication strategies from scratch, streamlined efficiency with communication audits, and launched award-winning programs that have boosted employee and client engagement, increased brand awareness and sales, and facilitated change.\n\nI've put pen to paper and produced a wealth of articles, videos, blogs, press releases and social media posts. I've even introduced new communication channels to organizations. When faced with a challenge, whether low engagement, resistance to change, a lack of trust in leadership or high turnover, I tackle it with data and empathy.\n\nMy work has sharpened my negotiating skills with senior executives and challenging stakeholders. I build a strong network and strive to become a trusted partner to leaders in all things communications.\n\nI'm a continuous learner, creative, resourceful and curious \u2013 a team player at heart, analytical, practical and adaptable. I love seeing projects come to life and pour my heart into my work. \n\nWhen it comes to communications, I don't just talk the talk, I write the write, film the film, and tweet the tweet. Let's create a story worth telling!\n\nIf you'd like to know more, don't be shy - drop me a line!",
