The meeting brought together select academia from Africa and from China as well as representatives of the United Nations Environment Programme. The forum provided a platform to share experiences and develop a mechanism for collaboration in order to catalyze accelerated achievement of sustainable development goals in Africa and Asia as a tangible example of South-South collaboration. (2) Successful holding of the meeting on a Global Universities Partnership on Environment and Sustainability (GUPES). The GUPES meeting brought together university professors and administrators from a wide range of disciplines and fields related to environment and sustainable development mandated to identify global priority areas in environment and sustainability policy and research initiatives; define the agenda for the GUPES in universities and other institutions of higher education; set up operational modalities for GUPES to align with UNEP's activities with universities and partners. (3) Drafting the reports of the two meetings which are now UNEP official documents. I further developed an implementation strategy for the newly established GUPES. The implementation strategy suggested initial approaches to implementing the outcomes of the meeting. This strategy was organized around the institutional development of GUPES including issues related to its legal status and governance, the mainstreaming of GUPES into the Rio+20 process and towards a GUPES Strategy Document and Action Plan. It formed the basis for the activities for the Interim Steering Committee of GUPES and for UNEP in its education related activities, especially in the framework of the Rio+20 World Conference on the Environment and Development.",

The event offered unparalleled fora for high level exchanges on topics such as the peaceful settlement of interstate disputes, international criminal justice and the future of accountability mechanisms, the role of The Hague Conference on private international law as the world organization for cross-border cooperation in civil and commercial matters, etc.\nThe event was organized in collaboration with The Hague Project Peace and Justice, with the support of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipality of The Hague.  \n"
