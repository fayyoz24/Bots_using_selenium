    "summary": "\"Marlies, I don't know what it is with you. You are like a silent diesel engine*. You came in, sat down and I never had to look after you for the following 6 months... Things were just taken care of. No matter what I asked of you.\" - Intern guide Floris at my farewell drink after successfully completing an internship at EMI Music, back in 2009. To this day, it's still the weirdest, funniest and most accurate compliment I have ever received. \n\nFast forward to present day: I am a creative online marketeer, who keeps your online marketing activities running smoothly. I prefer to keep a low profile (still not keen on being the centre of attention), I'm more of a doer than a talker and I'm a bigger fan of accuracy and quality than of quantity and jobs half-done. I like challenges and don't mind rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty. I specialise in content and email marketing (/data base marketing), but I stand my ground when it comes to SEO, social media, Google, lead generation and customer journeys. Besides that, I'm also very skilled in designing my marketing content. Whether it's a simple (Google) banner, an (responsive) e-mail template, a landing page/simple website or a print catalogue, DM or flyer, I can turn any idea into a design that works.\n\nOutside of the office space (and sometimes not so out of the office space) I have a love for music and a few years ago I took up my childhood dream of learning to play guitar! \n\nKeywords: creative, hands-on, eager to learn, determined, precise, communicative, analytical and sportive\n\n* De stille dieselmotor, in Dutch.\n\nCertifications: \nSilverpop Engage Fundamentals Certification - June 2014.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to all the info on my profile: Check out my own website for my portfolio, a little summary of all the things I have done over the years. http://www.destilledieselmotor.nl/ \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
