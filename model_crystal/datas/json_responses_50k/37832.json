    "summary": "The science is clear: humanity is critically crossing planetary boundaries and endangering life on earth. I\u2019m driven by an awareness that the multitude of crises \u2013 climate, biodiversity, resources \u2013 will disrupt the functioning of our societies. Adapation has become just as important as mitigation. \n\nIf we want to preserve thriving communities we must collectively build resilience. I see the circular economy as a promising framework to address underlying root causes and I\u2019m dedicated to catalyzing it in my beloved living environment: the province of Utrecht.\n\nBesides, I believe that citizens have a critical role to play in driving the socio-ecological transformation. Harnessing the power of grassroots movements and taking collective action is imperative for building a more inclusive, equitable tomorrow.",
