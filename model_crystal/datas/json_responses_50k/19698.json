    "summary": "Spatial planning, socio-economics, education and health are fields that interest me greatly. I would love to spend my career exploring and offering policy recommendations to the many varied complex issues related to my interests, and analyzing the endogenous feedback from various mechanisms operating in their subsystems.\n\nI recently graduated the master's degree in System Dynamics at the University of Bergen in Norway, for which I have written my thesis in co-operation with the OECD. Prior to my study in System Dynamics I have completed a bachelor's and master\u2019s degree in Communication Science and I have spend some years gaining work experience. \n\nFurthermore, I am working on expanding my knowledge of Group Model Building and Interactive Learning Environments.",

            "description": "ABSTRACT\nPerfectionists regularly experience problems when making decisions and, when a decision has been made, experience problems with staying committed to their choices (Mallinger, 2009). Perfectionists have unreasonably high standards, towards which they strain compulsively and unremittingly, and they measure their self-worth primarily in terms of accomplishment (Burns, 1980; Pyszczynski & Cox, 2004). Since perfectionists measure their self-worth primarily in terms of accomplishment, perfectionists can experience short-term fluctuations in self-worth stability due to self-evaluative emotional reactions to events of accomplishment (Kernis, 2005). The inability to retain choice commitment can leave perfectionists unable to observe the accomplishment that could have resulted from their choice if they had committed to it. Without the needed sense of accomplishment a perfectionist\u2019s self-worth can decrease. This makes perfectionists susceptible to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and even suicidal ideation (Burns, 1980; Crocker, 2002; Kernis, 2005; Levine, 2012; Pyszczynski & Cox, 2004; Ramsey & Ramsey, 2002). This paper proposes the use of System Dynamics as a modelling tool to explain the interrelationship of the various mechanisms that are part of the underlying structure which causes perfectionists to often be unable to stay committed to their own choices. Furthermore, the dynamic hypothesis and the resulting behavior may help perfectionists to better understand themselves and may aid in the perfectionist\u2019s ability to retain their choice commitment.",

Furthermore, and key to system dynamics modelling, I have helped students to improve the behavior of social systems by designing feasible, cost-effective, and transparent public policies with minimal adverse unintended consequences.",
