    "summary": "I am a marketing master student from Tilburg University looking for a creative and challenging position related to content creation, customer journey and user experience from March 2023. If you are looking for a versatile employee for the position, who have the ability and personality that blend well with the team and the job, then I am your person.\n\nMe in short, I can offer fresh perspectives, am open-minded and thirsty for knowledge. I am not afraid to multitask, because this is what makes me unique.\n\nMore about my strengths, a few points that I am proud of myself are:\n\n\u2705\u00a0Adaptability: I am able to work on multiple projects at once and adapt my approach quickly when needed.\n\u2705\u00a0Communication: I'm open to feedback and always strive to improve upon things I've done before.\n\u2705\u00a0Conflict resolution: I'm good at finding ways to work through problems without resorting to confrontation or yelling.\n\u2705\u00a0Dependability: I'm reliable, responsible and committed to completing tasks on time so that we can move forward in our projects.\n\u2705\u00a0Problem solving: I like being able to look beyond the obvious solution when given an opportunity and come up with new ideas or alternatives quickly (and never give up!).\n\u2705\u00a0Teamwork: I believe that collaboration is key when it comes time for us all to work together towards our common goal: making this world a better place!\n\nI have worked hard on developing myself as an employee, as well as an academic student. I have experience in RStudio statistical software to track and analyse data, and able to interpret data accurately. This has helped me in my studies as well as my thesis writing. I have also been able to set goals for myself, such as improving my communication skills or learning more about digital content creation. This has made me realise how much potential I have within me. Fun fact: I actually taught myself Adobe Creative Suite (InDesign) and Illustrator for designing logos, banners, illustrations, as well as Premiere Pro for video editing,  all though small online courses and YouTube instructions. \n\nI have a passion for creating beautiful content that will help the company grows, as well as a desire to make sure that you're providing the best possible experience for customers. I have been working as a Digital Content Intern since September at Bugaboo, where I was responsible for creating content that would be published on websites.\n\nI am open for any coming opportunities, so my inbox is open for contacts and connections.",
