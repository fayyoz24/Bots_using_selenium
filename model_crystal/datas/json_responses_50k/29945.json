    "summary": "First and foremost, I am an enthusiast for sustainability and passionate about companies that are trying to make a difference in the global energy transition. I am obsessed with the idea that apart from inventing clean technologies for energy production and storage, it is also imperative that the current industrial processes become more efficient and productive. And the onus to do so, rests not just on the shoulders of a few, but everyone who is capable enough to recognize the problems that mankind faces. This is put beautifully in the statement of Robert Swan \u201c The greatest threat to this planet is the belief that someone else will save it\u201d.\n\nFor my first professional contract, I chose to work with WWIL where I kick started my career by converting the energy from the wind into electricity. I took the responsibility to solve the mechanical issues with 133 wind turbines at the wind farm, and their yearly preventive maintenance. Working with a task force of 42 technicians and managing their activities at sites in a structured way greatly enhanced my interpersonal skills.\n\nIn search for the next challenge, I collaborated with Zero Emission Fuels BV. ZEF BV is trying to develop a small scale plant that can convert air and sunlight into liquid fuels, essentially giving us an inexhaustible source of fulfilling our fuel needs. In one of their teams, I took on the task of developing their Electrolyzer system that converts water into hydrogen and think of creative ways to remove dissolved carbon dioxide from water. Later on, I switched teams to work towards the development of their methanol reactor too, which converts hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic fuel. I designed, built a pilot reactor, and conducted experiments on it to show a 161% increase in yield and to fully characterize the reactor experimentally for different process conditions.\n\nOutside of office, I really enjoy pencil sketching. It is something that develops patience, an eye for detail, and drive for perfection in me which I tend to carry forward with everything else that I do. Because to be good at it you need to accept the fact that no matter how well you do something, there is always a way for it to be slightly better. It is this quality that makes my sketches good and also helps me succeed professionally.",

The task at hand was to develop a compact electrolyzer that can produce hydrogen at 55 Bar operating on solar power. The work involved a lot of product design & development, rapid prototyping, experimenting & material testing, systems & control coupled with design integration & plant scaling. Key highlights of the project were:\n\u2022\tConceptualized and demonstrated the use of a new degasser system integrated withing the electrolyzer that uses the escaping oxygen to reduce the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration in the electrolyzer medium in order to increase the longevity of the alkaline medium.\n\u2022\tFabricated the entire design of the electrolyzer using a PocketNC milling machine and assessed the utility of HDPE as a cheaper material for mass production.\n\u2022\tUndertook experiments to exploit the geometry of the electrolyzer and purity of oxygen to achieve degasification and integrate it with the rest of the electrolyzer.\n\u2022\tBuilt and tested the efficacy of a hall effect type proximity sensor to ascertain the fluid level inside the pressurized electrolyzer from outside without the need for any electrical pass-through.\n\u2022\tDesigned, built, and demonstrated a pass-through for fluid and gasses which can withstand the gradient of pressure from 55 Bar to atmospheric pressure",
