This required a great deal of understanding of the international commercial trading terms and tax/legal requirements for imports and exports. In parallel to this I also managed and maintained the reconciliations and submissions of accounts for this area, in line with US GAAP and SOX. I acted as the coordinator within the team for analysis and action plans, travelling on multiple occasions to Morocco to engage management in order to implement strategic changes for the business.",
