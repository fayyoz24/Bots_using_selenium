            "description": "Wind power as an auxiliary form of propulsion for commercial ships has again become of great interest as a possible means for improving fuel efficiency. Delft University of Technology, in collaboration with University Politecnico di Milano, is currently developing a Performance Prediction Program for wind-assisted commercial ships. As hybrid vessels, the performance of a wind-assist concept will depend on the contribution of the wind propulsor, alongside the efficiency of the conventional propulsion system. Due to the auxiliary thrust generated by the wind propulsors, the existing engine and propeller operating conditions will change. Not only will the propeller mainly operate in a lightly-loaded condition, but it will also operate in an oblique flow. This is a key interaction effect for wind-assist ships, and was the focus of this bachelor thesis. \n\nThe \u201cintegral advance ratio\u201d method of F. Gutsche has been used to research the axial inflow data for propellers subject to oblique inflow. In particular, it is of interest to test the method for small leeway angles (less than ten degrees), since this the expected range of operation for wind-assist vessels and below the range considered by Gutsche. Therefore, this research outlined the effect for angles between 0\u00b0 and 10\u00b0, which was yet unknown. A numerical model, that proved its applicability for large angles, was constructed. Results showed an increase of both thrust and torque for a propeller in oblique flow. Also open water propeller tests, performed at the TU Delft, were conducted supporting these results.\n\nFinalizing the Bachelor Thesis, a Bachelor Thesis symposium was held. The project of \u2018Propeller in Oblique Flow\u2019 was awarded the best presented study out a total of 8 projects. \nAfter obtaining this award we participated in the UfD-Damen Bachelor Awards 2016. Unfortunately we weren't awarded one of 5 main prizes but we were awarded an incentive prize of \u20ac500,- for just missing out on the top 5.\n",

During this minor we followed courses with the focus on entrepreneurship in third-world-countries. In the second half of our minor we went on an internship in Africa. We worked on a development project for Q Energy Consultants in Uganda.\n\nIn Uganda wood is used for cooking, but thanks to Q Energy Consultants they can use biogas installations for this daily activity. But only solving the problem regarding cooking would be near-sighted. By finding other applications to implement this biogas installation, Q Energy can help far more people on an entrepreneurial level. There are currently multiple installations for different consumers, small household installations for individuals or small communities, but also bigger institutional installations for schools, prisons etc. These installations can also be fitted to electrical systems so they can grind, roll and mix.\n\nThe demonstration site of Q Energy is a site where interested communities or farmers can take a look at the installations and even get courses on construction, maintenance etc. The projects is already up and running but improvement are necessary. The installation and the entire demo site need some improvements to motivate the locals even more. \nOur project group, the \u201cQ|Ugangers\u201d, consists of three Technical University of Delft students whom will be taking on the challenge. The goals are improving the demo site current application and implementing new ones and furthermore achieve a successful pilot project that will run economically independent.",
