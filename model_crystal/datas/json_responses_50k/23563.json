I used Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) for the diffusion measurements. I also studied the correlation between mechanical, biological, biochemical and diffusive properties of condylar cartilage of different ages.\nI compared a developed model for artificial aging with natural aging on the biomechanical response of cartilage in the jaw joint. The results of this investigation showed that collagen crosslinking as a marker of age-related change in the tissue does not make the cartilage (fibrocartilage) of the jaw joint stiffer in natural aging. However, artificial aging resulted in stiffer cartilage after aging increasing collagen crosslinking.\nThis project was part of the Move-age programme (joint doctoral degree).",
