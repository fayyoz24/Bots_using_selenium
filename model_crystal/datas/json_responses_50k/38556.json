    "summary": "It all starts with You: seeing, understanding and accepting the Other. \nAs long as everything goes well in a multi-cultural environment, you don\u2019t notice any cultural differences. But as soon as things go different than expected, that is when culture plays up and you start noticing the differences. What matters is that you identify these misunderstanding as cultural and address them accordingly - before they turn into irritation and frustration. \nDuring my international studies and my career at IBM, I worked with colleagues from several European and Asian countries, USA and South America. The Hofstede model (that quantifies and illustrates the dimensions of cultural differences) helped me to make sense of the differences I encountered. Combining my professional background and the Hofstede model, I now help multinational teams to avoid and overcome cross-cultural communication obstacles. ",

Initially, we focussed on migrants arriving in the Netherlands. Using stories, we describe misunderstandings and both perspectives - with suggestions how to bridge the cultural gap. \nWe have expanded the scope to also address newcomers in Germany and Luxemburg. In the near future, we will expand to cover more cultures and more countries.\nTo foster the cultural awareness, we have developed games to play in schools and in immigration classes that trigger constructive conversations about the different cultural backgrounds.
