    "summary": "I have been working in Marketing for over 15 years now and I never get bored of it. I couldn't imagine working in another role - mainly because it is always changing. Technology is moving so fast there is always something new coming up. I need to be abreast of developments to ensure I am on top of my game. Marketing encompasses so many things and I love the fact my current job is very challenging and crazily busy - I thrive off that! \n\nI am always looking to further my skills and knowledge, and that's why I am working in a completely different industry - out of my comfort zone. \n\nI am responsible for an international team to drive global strategy and deliver tactical global and local campaigns. This involves a whole load of processes, creating efficiencies and structures to get the most out of all our efforts. \n\nI am the Project Lead for our automated marketing platform to improve every customer journey. With this machine, together with our digital transformation, there is an untapped opportunity to stand out from the crowd through smart marketing. \n\nSpecialties: Marketing Strategy, Customer Acquisition, Website Management, Brand Management, Online Marketing, Events and Promotions, Campaign Management, Internal Communications, Bids and Tender Writing, Media Schedule Management, Agency Management, People Management, Marketing Cloud",
