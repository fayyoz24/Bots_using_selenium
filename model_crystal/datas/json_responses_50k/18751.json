    "summary": "I am an ambitious person who aims high and is always open to learn and grow. Studying at the best Hogeschool in the Netherlands has allowed me to build up many business skills in the fields of Marketing and Sales, Finance, Operations and Supply chain, Human resources, Entrepreneurship, Sustainability, and Internationalization. Most importantly, however, I have also developed essential soft skills needed for a future professional, including teamwork, intercultural communication, and self-awareness. \n\nAdditionally, I have experienced how businesses operate in real life through my internships in Digital marketing and Supply chain analysis. Due to the latter, I developed a curiosity to for the world of Data Analytics, and have explored it further through additional courses and projects. \n\nMy next adventure starts at the end of August 2023 when I will start working full-time and write my thesis in order to graduate.",

            "description": "This project was connected with building an executive recommendation for the future operations of Oatly. It was seperated in four main departments, namely Marketing, Supply Chain, Human Resources, and Finance. I was part of the latter as I was interested in diving deeper into the topic and learning how to manage a company's financials on a corporate level. \n\nI was responsible for analysing Oatly's financial statements from the last four years in order to estimate its financial health based on profitability, liquidity, and solvency value drivers, as well as evaluate its share price and compare it to the current market price. It was found that the bsuiness has very poor financial health, which is why a root cause analysis was conducted. Based on the results, a turn around strategy was proposed to avoid bankruptcy. Then, a 10-year P&L was created to show the change in gross and net profit as well as operational expenses. In order to illustrate the value Oatly will create with its new strategy, a discounted cash flow statement was also constructed, with the help of which a new valuation was made. In the end, with the new turn around strategy it was estimated that Oatly's share price will increase from its current valuation of -$12 to $3 over the next 10 years.",

In order to achieve this, a scope was created in order to decrease the number of locations considered. Then, after a SWOT analysis of the company, 4 countires were chosen that were believed to be a good fit for the company's needs and goals. The countries were then graded based on  specific criteria and risk variables. Each factor had a different positive or negative score depending on how important it was for achieving the business objectives. In the end, it was found that out of the pool of 4 countries, including Denmark, Germany, Poland and Spain, the German market is the most attractive for the e-bike brand to expand to.\n\nThis was a group assignment made with 3 classmates.",

My task was to look into their colllected data set so that I can analyse the supply chain operations of one of their customers. The aim was to try to find cost savings in a way that was not yet implemented by my client. \n\nThis project allowed me to deepen my skills in Supply Chain and Finance, as well as Data Analytics. Moreover, the data points were located and researched in an Excel spreadsheet. This means that I also learned how to create and manipulate Excel Pivot tables in order to dissect the information and find spikes or trends. \n\nAfter investigating, me and my team came up with solutions to reduce costs. Keeping in mind the differing needs of DSV and the client, I came up with strategies that create the right balance of saving expenses while still being beneficial to the client. I did this by providing different scenarios (optimistic, realistic and pessimistic) with estimated financial savings. In the end, I was able to find 500,000 euros of savings annually, as well as provide advice on how to reduce redundant shipments and increase the accuracy of the collected data.",
