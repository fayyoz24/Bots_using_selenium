    "summary": "After finishing the Bachelor of Applied Science in Business Administration, I wanted to expand my knowledge and therefore I started studying the premaster and master Organization Studies at Tilburg University. In the last phase of the master I researched the influence of Private Equity investments on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitment of organizations.\n\nAfter graduating, I started working at Copaco in Eindhoven as a Product Manager. In this role, I managed five brands, overseeing the product assortment, inventory, sales, and marketing activities.\n\nAfter working at Copaco for over a year, I decided to go on a backpacking journey through South East Asia. For approximately 8 months, I enjoyed different cultures, trying diverse cuisines, and making new friends. Now that I have recently returned to the Netherlands, I am ready to start a new challenge with renewed energy.",
