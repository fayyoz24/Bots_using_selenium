    "summary": "Qualified Lawyer in Brazil and Portugal | Master's Student at the University of Lisbon | Arbitration | Commercial & Contract Law | Trade Finance | Technology\n\nWelcome to my LinkedIn profile! I am a qualified lawyer licensed in Brazil and Portugal. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Lisbon. In addition, I also participated in a master's exchange program at Erasmus University in the Netherlands for a year, which further enriched my academic journey.\n\nWith fluency in Portuguese, English, intermediary Spanish, and basic Dutch, I excel in multicultural environments and thrive in fast-paced office settings. I have a proven ability to handle multiple tasks, pay meticulous attention to detail, and effectively manage my time.\n\nMy expertise lies in Commercial and Contract Law, Trade Finance and Banking Law, and International Arbitration. I am particularly passionate about these fields. Furthermore, I have expanded my knowledge in technology-related legal areas such as Intellectual Property Law, Computer and Law, and Trade Finance and Banking Law through specialized courses at Erasmus University.\n\nIn addition to my legal skills, I am proficient in various systems including Vantage, Companyinfo, SAP, CRM, Recover, Citrix, JDE, Reports Now, CPJ, Ethos, and the Microsoft Office suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel).\n\nCurrently, I contribute my skills as a Lending Transaction Management Expert in the Reporting, Monitoring & Lending Analytics Team (\u2018RMLA\u2019) at ING Corporate Sector Lending Netherlands.\n\nFeel free to reach out and connect. I am always open to engaging in professional conversations and expanding my network.",
