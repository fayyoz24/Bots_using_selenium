    "summary": "I am a German and Australian Dual Citizen. I was born and raised in Sydney Australia and have recently moved to the Netherlands to continue my study.\n\nI am currently studying a Masters of Game and Media Technology at Utrecht University. I have been a hobby game developer since I was 14. Recently I began taking this hobby more seriously and have committed to learning the Unity and Unreal game engines. I have been programming for several years covering C++, C#, python, Java, VB.NET, HTML/CSS, Processing. I have also decided to learn more about Data Oriented Programming, ECS, and Unreals Mass system as that appears to be a promising technology in the field. \n\n\nI am a graduate from The Australian National University for a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Human Centric Computing. Previously I have worked Epicon for 2 years as a full stack developer. I then spent one year and six months at Telstra Purple as a technical consultant focusing on supporting a splunk enterprise deployment.  I also spent one year at Spinify as a Junior Developer, working with React Native and Node.js web systems.",
