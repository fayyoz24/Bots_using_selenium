After the required trainings, I started my first contract on board the MSC Lirica, a cruise ship of MSC Cruises Company, as Tour Agent. I worked for MSC Cruises in this position for three contracts, on three different ships until November 2012.  My job consisted of organizing and selling excursions and assisting the guests off shore. It allowed me to understand the importance of revenue and how to increase it without sacrificing the service, but also to have a knowledge of selling techniques, to work with external travel agencies and to interact with every kind of guest from all over the world.",
