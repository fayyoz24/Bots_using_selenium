    "summary": "Design has become a game changer. Design leadership increases profit, drives innovation, and creates social good. Those who understand and act on this insight outsmart their competition. \n\nI am fortunate to work with fantastic clients from across the globe helping them manage all aspects of design at a corporate level: accelerating design & development processes with design thinking, agile and lean principles, putting in place the right people, methods & tools, developing scalable design systems, and turning good ideas into great experiences. Smarter, faster and at lower cost.\n\nMy clients span a broad range of industries: financial services, oil & energy, medical technology, chemicals, real estate, telecommunications, public safety, automotive and professional services.\n\n\u2028\u2028I feel comfortable in the ether of design strategy as well as the granular details of user research, digital product design and design systems.
