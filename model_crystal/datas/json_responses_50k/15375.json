    "summary": "I have been working at high-tech companies for over 15 years, using my background in engineering to help people do more with technology. \n\nColleagues describe me as an energetic leader with an agile mindset, and a big advocate of transparency, open communication, and continuous learning. Clients trust me to guide them through complex technology projects with confidence, as I understand the unique taxonomy, language, and pressures of the manufacturing sector. \n\nI\u2019m also fascinated by the evolving trends of the industry, such as the drive for growth and innovation, shorter time to market, better security and risk management, and smarter supply chains. For me, the key to success across all of this - and the future for manufacturing as a whole - lies in augmenting people with technology.",
