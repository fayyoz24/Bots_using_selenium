    "summary": "With a diverse and eclectic background, I bring a unique perspective to the table, always thinking outside the box as a professional. My journey began as a producer in Brazil, where I thrived in roles such as an executive and infrastructure production manager for large-scale events, including Rock in Rio. Additionally, I led a production team responsible for creating 10 episodes of a documentary series for Brazil's most prominent sports channel.\n\nSeeking greater stability, I transitioned to the realm of sales at Warner Music, where I adeptly handled musical rights and license agreements between Warner and various agencies and production companies.\n\nUpon arriving in Europe, my career took exciting turns. I achieved recognition as one of the top 10 participants at a startup weekend hosted at Google Headquarters. Subsequently, I had the privilege of working on projects with renowned companies such as Facebook and Bloomberg while residing in Dublin.\n\nHowever, it was upon reaching Amsterdam that I truly found my calling, both in the city and in my professional pursuits.\n\nThroughout my journey, I have consistently impressed my colleagues with boundless energy and an unwavering commitment to achieving objectives. I firmly believe in the power of data as a guiding map and am passionate about working intelligently to deliver exceptional results.\n\nIn summary, my diverse background and experiences have shaped me into a resourceful and forward-thinking professional, poised to contribute my unique skills and perspectives to any endeavor I undertake.",
