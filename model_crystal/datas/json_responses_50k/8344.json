    "summary": "Enthusiastic and driven commercial professional with many years of experience in the seafood industry. \nFrom childhood on, I have worked in the fish business and practiced several different jobs, ranging from packing and processing to buying and selling fish and seafood products. From 2007 until April 2016, I worked at Royal Prins & Dingemanse, one of the biggest producers of shellfish and crustaceans in Europe. In this period, I was mostly in charge of sales and I managed various customer accounts and the sales force. In May 2016 I took on a new challenge at a group of Belgian seafood companies, where I was responsible for the general and commercial management of the company Daniels Azuur Vishandel and the sales of fresh seafood at Multi Fish N.V. (both located at the Belgian coast in Blankenberge). \n\nBut because the shellfish industry remains to be my passion I made the switch back to this industry. On the first of February 2018 I started my new job at Nord Contact B.V. who was mainly active in the field of sales of fresh mussels from the biggest German mussel farm Leuschel and the Danish mussel farm Wittrup. On the first of May 2019, we joined forces with the group Barb\u00e9, who is the biggest farmer (bottom and rope culture) in Holland, and started the joint venture Aqua Mossel. \n\nOn May 1st 2020 Triton Mossel, who is one of the biggest farmers of Ireland and has mussel farms in Holland, joined our company and from that time we sell fresh mussels under the brand name 'Aqua-Triton Mossel'. Aqua-Triton is now responsible for about a third of the total Dutch mussel market and is specialist in farming and selling of the big sizes mussels (Golden and Jumbo).\n\nOn May 1st 2021 Aqua Triton Mossel took over all trading activitities of shellfish specialist Le Petit P\u00eacheur. In this way we can also supply live crustaceans and shellfish to our international customer base, like fresh oysters (a.o. Umami and Ostras de Aveiro), lobsters, crabs, vongole, cockles and razor clams.\n\nI am now responsible for the sales of our products to mainly the (nternational) Out of Home market.",
