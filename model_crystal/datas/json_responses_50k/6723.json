Untill then communication protocols between Point Of Sale (POS) and Payment Terminals were always using LAN. These protocols could not be transported over public internet without extra measures, because of lack of encryption and authentication.\nThe CAT combines the on-line and off-line world and is the first CCV terminal that enables EFT transactions initiated in the cloud (website) and processed on the regular PINpad (Vx820) without extra measures in a full secure way. The CAT is provided as a PSP service. In stead of starting a iDEAL, PayPal, Mastercard or Visa transaction from the website, the website starts the transaction towards the PINPad directly using the same interface.\nPilots for kiosks (semi-unattended) start in Q3 2017. A solution for a full browser based attended POS devices is expected in 2018.\n",

For launching customer Q-Park we created a solution for the Off-street Parking Environment which gave the possibilty for users to drive in, drive out with debit or credit card. A PayStation (Pay on Foot) solution, Access Control to the Parking Garage and WebService made the solution complete. EMV, Tokenisation, No CVM (also for Debit cards) are the keywords within CCV Motion. CCV Motion is an online system, but also provides a solution when internet is unavailable (stand-in) or a card reader is out of order (manual procedure to book transactions) by storing transactions locally and evacuating the transactions later by usage of the WebService without storage of any PCI DSS sensitive data. \nBy putting CCV EMV-terminals (with SRED and Open Protocols certificate) into the Entry gate Exit gate, PayStation and Door Reader and usage of CardTokens generated by these terminals, the entire parking environment (Gates, PayStations, DoorReaders, PMS and network) is out of scope for PCI DSS. \nThe TOP 5 key players in Parking Management Systems in Europe have implemented or are busy implementing CCV Motion. Currently CCV Motion is up and running in the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Germany and United Kingdom. Other European countries are expected to follow soon. \nCurrently the CCV Motion is extended with contactless NFC payments (PayPass, PayWave).",
