    "summary": "I am an experienced ICT Consultant with a solid background in industrial automation, manufacturing, logistics, GIS/GPS and finance. I\u2019m looking for a challenging position, where my leadership and technical capabilities can be applied.\n\nWith \"hands-on\" software development for global manufacturing, test and logistics, I gained experience with the entire hardware and software production life cycle for a Fortune 500 company. In more recent positions I acted as an engineering lead/manager on projects focused on industrial automation and factory infrastructure. The attention to quality originates from my focus on test automation in high revenue production facilities. \n\nIn my last assignments I worked in consultancy on an internal cloud solution and on test automation for mobile communication for a military GIS and navigation application. I prefer to work in agile teams in a high tech environment.\n\nDuring the period he worked in the UK, I learned to work with people from different culture. I\u2019m a team player and am able to effectively communicate at different levels of the organization. Because of that I\u2019m able to build bridges between the business and IT and formulate a clear vision on future architecture.",

The Bol.com warehouse contains ~3 km of conveyer belt, that connects the various package handing stations for both inbound and outbound. The resistance against this change at TGW side had to be managed.\n\nApproach & Achievements\nMost of of the development and governance processes are defined for the new hardware environment. The requirements have been analysed and documented. A proposal was prepared for modification of the contract with TGW. A test administration system was setup and a first start was made in test automation. A simulator was introduced at BOL\u2019s test environments and that helped to setup an integrated Acceptance environment for end-to-end testing.\n\nResults & Added value\n\u2022\tThe go-live of the new infra was successful.\n\u2022\tThe new infra and way of working resulted in much less downtime.",

All equipment will be controlled by a central control room. Intervention team's communication and positioning is handled from this control room using mobile devices. Ard-Jan had a leading role in the team that is responsible for automated deployment, configuration and maintenance of the complete IT infrastructure of software, datacenters, controllers, camera's, card readers, actuators etc.\n\nApproach & Achievements\nWe used the ERP product \"Windchill\" to define the static hardware and software installation and ServiceNow for the more specific configuration parameter definition. Ansible was used to orchestrate the deployment, with Powershell, ksh, python, Java, Selenium and Sikuli as supporting languages. Jenkins was used to define the CI chain, with Bitbucket, Git, Jira, PyUnit, Junit, Maven and Nexus. \n\nResults & Added value\nSavings of around 16 M on an investment of 4M comparing manual v.s. automated deployment and testing.",

The first team worked on migration plans from Quality Center to the Rational life cycle management suite. The second team focused on the introduction of test automation and we decided on the use of Selenium for GUI testing. The last team developed a simulation tool for the testing of core components that did not have a GUI.",
