Focus was placed on developing a sustainable solution and ensuring vehicle certifiability by 2025 according to JARUS standards. A full design iteration of the vehicle's conceptual design was performed up to the subsystem level. Non-technical considerations were explored by performing an analysis of the operations and logistics of the system, a market analysis, risk analysis, and system cost estimation.",
