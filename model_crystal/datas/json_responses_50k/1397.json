    "summary": "I am a third year chemistry student looking to get more experience in organisations and leading functions. I always like to do extra activities besides my studies, like different committees or projects, but I would like to do this on a larger scale. Besides these kinds of projects I still do classical and contemporary ballet. I am very determined, good at delegating and seeing the bigger picture. I can adapt to other people when they need it but I am not afraid to stand my ground when necessary. ",
