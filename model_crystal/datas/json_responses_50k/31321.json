    "summary": "Hi, thanks for looking me up. I\u2019m the Global Director of Sales Operations at Intertrust Group, specializing in corporate strategy and marketing for financial services. I've been fortunate to work with some amazing people first at ASB Bank in New Zealand, and now at Intertrust in the Netherlands. My ever-evolving skillset includes acquisition & lifecycle marketing, data analytics, developing strategic partnerships, business strategy, sales operations, experiment design and coaching.\n\nWhen you come to Intertrust, you expect a focus on quality, personal service and attention to detail. You expect it delivered by highly professional people with uncompromising integrity. Intertrust delivers high-quality, tailored corporate, fund, capital market and private wealth services to its clients, with a view to building long-term relationships. Intertrust works with global law firms and accountancy firms, multinational corporations, financial institutions, fund managers, high net worth individuals and family offices. Today, we have thousands of specialists working all around the globe, including the world\u2019s most important financial centres. As a result, you get a world of local expertise working with you to meet your goals.\n\nI value any company that\u2019s tech focused, growth-centric and has innovation in its DNA. Sharing these values is why I work hard to stay relevant, agile and always evolve. \n\nOn a personal note, I'm a huge sports fan having played rugby, cricket, football and tennis and I'm an enthusiastic but not very skilled snowboarder. I also enjoy reading a good book or spending time with friends and family.\n\nLet\u2019s connect.\n\nJames.Gibson@intertrustgroup.com\nIntertrustGroup.com",
