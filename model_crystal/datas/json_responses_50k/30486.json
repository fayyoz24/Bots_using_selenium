(The second largest educational website after Wikipedia) I was hired as an early employee during a growth phase as Brainly scaled to 200+ employees and an international presence. My role included driving multi-million dollar B2B revenues from display ads from global markets (US, LATAM, EMEA, RU, APAC) with brands selected to target a Gen Z vertical market, developing client relationships with Fortune 500 firms. \n\nI orchestrated Brainly\u2019s growth strategy which included initiatives for community building, content marketing, and social media. This included hiring and driving a growth team.\n\nI spearheaded international sales beyond Poland to significantly grow YOY direct sales and expanded the sales strategy to leverage outsourced sales teams in Russia and Romania and temporary reps in Brazil and Indonesia. During my tenure we grew average deal size and sales per rep while lowering contract headcount, accelerated lead gen with no new ad spend, and increased programmatic revenue (strategic partnerships, yield optimization, video header bidding, more ad inventory).\n\nI also played a key role in establishing the first US-based commercial team (ad ops, sales, biz dev) and advised the board on topics including use of the freemium model and M&A opportunities.",
