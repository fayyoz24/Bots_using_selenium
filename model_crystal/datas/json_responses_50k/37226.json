    "summary": "About Ezra:\n\nNowadays fully concentrated on the future and transition of the Rabobank Group. Focus areas are innovation, leadership development, sustainability and strategy. Involved in Banking for Food Inspiration Centre, Rabobank Foundation, Corporate Communications and Human Resources. Not having a banking background gives me permission to keep the important outside perspective on the way we do business in the Rabobank Group.\n\nNext to my work at the Rabobank I am the fellow founder of Transitieteam Zeeland (Transitionteam Zeeland), focussing on personal and organizational cross- fertilization between leaders and organizations in the Provence of Zeeland (The Netherlands). Striving to a more agile and sustainable way of doing business in the future.\n\nThe Ocean Clean Up, UCG Group, Sanoma Learning, Adam\u2019s Recruitment, VODW, Shell Global Marketing, Solidaridad Foundation, FMO Entrepreneurial Development Bank, Friesland Campina, Province of Zeeland, Province of Limburg, YCAB Foundation (Indonesia), Machu Picchu Foods (Peru), Fight for Peace (UK), Oxfam Novib, Bartime\u00fcs, Nevobo and as member of advisory board with De Sportmaatschappij.\n\nMeaningful change starts in people, and change starts when people are out of their comfort. I am\u00a0in the constant search for people's circle of influence, driven by their personal drive and purpose. Inspiring people and discovering how to use their ultimate potential in a meaningful way gives me energy and it is where I flourish.",
