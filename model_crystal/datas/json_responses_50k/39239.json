    "summary": "I finished my B.Sc. and M.Sc. studies from the Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT), Egypt in 2013 and 2018 respectively. In Alexandria, Egypt -an ABET-accredited system. During the five years of my undergraduate education, I was ranked 4st with honor. After graduation, I worked for two years in the Oil Petroleum service companies, especially in the field of cathodic protection corrosion control using the impressed current techniques, which able me to gain a piece of great knowledge in the fields of power electronics and solar energy. Also, I worked as an electrical installation engineer in the petroleum platforms that require highly specified standard devices.  During this period, I have worked as a part-time teaching assistant at the electrical and control engineering department in AASTMT -an ABET-accredited system till I was recommended to be a full time teaching assistant in Electrical Marine Engineering Technology Department at the same university.\nNow, I\u2019m a Ph.D. student in the university of Zielona Gora in Poland, I\u2019m working as ESR1 in \u201cSCENT - Smart Cities EMC Network for Training\u201d Project. SCENT is one of the projects that was funded by the Marie-Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network within the Horizon 2020 Program of the European Commission, SCENT is a consortium of three universities, supported by 12 industrial entities, in the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n",
