    "summary": "I'm an accelerator and a force of change. Not hindered by status quo, I go in with a fresh and creative mind to improve any situation. As an agile and accomplished General I focus on coaching and self-empowering teams towards ambitious long-term commercial results, not just on managing them. Forging professional and personal bonds in leading roles, I have achieved solid results in Product & Portfolio Development, Program Management and Process Management, mostly in B2B, ICT, Digital Transformation and Wholesale Partnerships.\n\nMy extensive experience in working within different companies, fields and cultural frameworks, means I will adapt to your specific situational needs in a heartbeat. My analytical and social prowess allow me to dissect a challenge, create an environment in which the challenge can be met, oversee programs through to outstanding results and get all stakeholders onboard in the process.\n\nBut more importantly, I'm a great and professional guy to work with. I'm interested in what you do and how we can work together so you can do it even better. Feel free to contact me to see how we can create value together!",
