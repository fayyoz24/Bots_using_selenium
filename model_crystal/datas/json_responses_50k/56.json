    "summary": "A Swiss Master's Student in Computer Science (MCS) at the University of St. Gallen, holding a Bachelor's Degree in Artificial Intelligence from the Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I have an international background - having lived in Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. I'm interested in leveraging AI and Data Science to solve modern business challenges.\n\nI believe in the importance of stepping outside of my comfort zone to obtain a broad skill set and believe in understanding all point of views on a topic. This allows me to observe interdisciplinary connections and has driven me to a combined interest in AI and Business Development. Within AI, I'm primarily interested in data science, data engineering, machine learning.\n\nI have work experience in international sales and marketing, building B2B relationships and connections within the IT sector. Furthermore, I've developed more technical skills outside of the scope of my degree in the field of Data Engineering and how to work in a large company and team through my internship at Johnson & Johnson.",
