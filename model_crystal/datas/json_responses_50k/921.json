    "summary": "In both my personal life and my career I have had the privilege to experience how much strength and energy one can obtain by setting goals and reaching them at some point in time. Therefore, I am keen to always aspire to new standards and aim to live up to them in the best possible way. My passion is to extrapolate this principle to others as well. To provide others with an eye-opening mindset, supporting them in reaching their goals and learning from other people\u2019s views is what drives me. I find pure happiness in the \u2018wow-moments\u2019 in which expectations are exceeded.\n\nIn my career, I gain energy from combining my analytical capacities with my communicative skills. With my enthusiastic yet down-to-earth way of providing others with insight in complex matters, and by using my strong presentation skills to achieve this, I can add my unique value. \n\nI am interested in efficiency matters that involve an econometric background. Analyzing problems using mathematical and econometric theory in order to both create and explain new ideas, tools and solutions that make a difference within an organization is what fascinates me.\n\nPeople describe me as dedicated, adventurous and social. My no-nonsense attitude creates an open setting in which people easily feel comfortable and respected in a natural way. My most important values in life are honesty, openness and devotion. I constantly seek to learn and develop myself in personal and intellectual fields. In many ways my view on life is that the sky is the limit!",

I have gained working experience in the departments of Internal Accounts,  Risk Analysis, Health Insurance, Damage Claims and Proxy Management.\n\nNext to this, there was a significant focus on obtaining a 'helicopter view' in order to spot, analyse and solve inefficiencies throughout the entire organization. As a result, I spent roughly 80% of my time on spotting inefficiencies and consequently designing, discussing, internally 'selling' and developing standalone efficiency software tools (using ao. Visual Studio, SQL Server Management).\n \nStarting from scratch, this resulted in a highly developed and complete software package containing business logic, automated calculations, Excel report generation and formatting, database connections, XML messaging and Outlook plug-ins. \n\nThree main business improvements resulted from using the software that I designed and delivered:\n\u2022 Efficiency:  multiple 30-min manual tasks became 5-min automated tasks, the most significant improvement was in a 16-hour manual task that has become a 2-hour task using the software.\n\u2022 Accuracy: due to automated calculations, the number of inaccuracies due to manual calculation dropped drastically.\n\u2022 Consistency: the implemented business logic and automated calculations lead to Mutsaerts now being sure to offer consistent pricing proposals and insurance conditions to like-for-like prospects and customers.",
