    "summary": "I am a senior executive and entrepreneurial leader in the logistic and technology industry with +25 years of experience. I have delivered outstanding profitability e.g. as Chief Supply Chain Officer for DAMCO where I could grow profitable the business with +10% after previously 8 years of constant decline. Having a proven track record of developing successful teams as the technology team at DAMCO which developed a super modern digital platform with a big data solution and a service oriented architecture. On the back of this I have developed 2 digital products now being live in the market and scaling successfully. \nI have helped existing brands in the logistic industry to find ways to grow, scale and automate, as e.g. a leading warehousing company with its footprint in an Asian country helping to achieve number 1 market position. \nI love and live international environments with different ways of working, strong leadership at the intersection of different cultures and performance feeling at home in fast-paced and dynamic environments. This helped me to successful close acquisitions in the US and France and manage the integration to one even more successful organization. This was also helped by my good understanding of investor relationship management.\nVery strong on running the day-to-day management and highly adaptable to different work environments. For example by turning around the loss making warehouse and distribution business of Maersk and at the same time doubling the business.\nI am an eexperienced senior product manager successfully launching new businesses delivering cross-company impact. Understanding emerging markets and technologies, pioneering work and client relationship. As expanding the warehouse business of Maersk to Western Africa and successfully entering new verticals in these markets. \nDeep experiences in digitalization always looking for the next generation IT, very familiar in agile development, innovation, being a futurist and having a strong track record on global development coordination, always with a strong focus on generating scalable businesses.\nOutstanding logistics experiences in next to all business areas as e.g. global supply chain, warehousing, contract logistics, freight forwarding, road transportation and air&ocean freight.",
