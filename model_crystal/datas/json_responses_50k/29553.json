    "summary": "In my current role as a product owner I act as a liaison between sales, support, product management and development teams. I manage requirements received from stakeholders in line with the product roadmap and the release plan. Furthermore, I create functional requirements, add into the product backlog, and refine and prioritize accordingly.\n\nIn general, my goal is to help clients and implementation teams to develop better products. I enable a bridge by converting clients\u2019 business needs and requirements into specific \u201cdevelopment-language-ready\u201d specifications. I elicit and process customer requirements, performing research and analyses of the domain, as well as competitors in the field; with an outcome of defining the competitive advantages of our customer products. Based on these findings, together with the customer, the path for the implementation and further growth of the business is chosen, and the strategy outlined.\n\nI come from a physics background, spending almost 10 years acquiring strong mathematical and analytical skills. This was a solid base for a smooth switch to a career in finance; namely a role as a Business Consultant / Financial Manager and an ACCA student. This experience gave me a comprehensive vision of the businesses and their operating systems, also, empowered me with the skillset to explore the business branches, such as production, services, trading and other industries, in more details.\n\n As a step up, the next phase for me was the position of a Business Analyst at an operational level. This role also requires a level of financial management and navigation of the IT solutions (e.g. ERP solutions). Hereafter, I have dived deeper into the IT product management/business analyses and grown professionally within the role.\n\nThe combination of the previous experiences, including the analyses of the situations, processes and issues, allows a bird\u2019s eye view on potential comprehensive solutions. The additional expertise in risk and gap analyses provides a route to a balanced solution, which can be formalized and implemented.",
