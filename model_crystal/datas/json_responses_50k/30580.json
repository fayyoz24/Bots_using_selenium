    "summary": "In general I'm enthusiastic about the natural environment and processes that occur within. During my bachelor Earth Sciences at Utrecht University I enjoyed hydrology and geochemistry the most and I gravitated towards doing research in surface water (&contamination). For my Bsc thesis I did a data analysis on heavy metal contamination in the Dutch part of the Meuse river at the hydrology faculty.  \n\nFor a year I followed my passion for climbing and worked at Boulderhal Energiehaven BV for a year where I fulfilled the function of shop manager, training youth & adults and work a lot of bar shifts.  Besides I had the chance to train a lot and experience lifting my climbing to a higher level. \n\nDuring this sabbatical year I determined that I want to make an impact on climate change and started the master Climate Studies at Wageningen University and got acquainted with meteorology and enjoyed the courses very much. This led me to writing my thesis about Arctic boundary layer meteorology at the Meteorology & Air Quality department and eventually an internship at Weather Impact. For this company I evaluated the performance of a rainfall nowcasting tool based on satellite imagery. \n\nI feel blessed to have gotten the opportunity to start working at Weather Impact after graduation.",
