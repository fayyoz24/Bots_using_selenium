The artists crossed paths in Rotterdam while studying at Codarts Conservatory, and they are all currently based there.\n\nUnited by their Greek heritage, the members felt a strong urge to create music deeply rooted in their home country's traditions, infused with jazz influences and a modern touch. Their musical style can be described as gentle, poetic, and vibrant, representing a fusion of jazz and traditional music elements.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by lockdowns and the COVID-19 pandemic, the band started collaborating right away, recognizing a unique musical connection among them. Even during the restrictive period of the pandemic, they managed to compose new pieces that prominently incorporated Eastern musical elements.\n\nStarting from November 2021, Merem embarked on a series of tours across the Netherlands, Western Europe, and Greece. Over the past year, they unveiled two singles: \"Yiasemi\" and \"Athina,\" both composed and produced by the band members themselves. Their debut EP was recorded in March 2023, followed by the release of the single \"Daripe\" in June 2023, a precursor to their full album scheduled to drop in September 2023. The band also had the privilege of performing at the prestigious North Sea Jazz Festival in July 2023.",
