    "summary": "I am a lecturer in a new course, an associate degree in Animal Management (Diermanagement) with Van Hall Larenstein in Velp. My principal expertise is to teach about monitoring and managing wildlife, but now I also teach about animal welfare surveys of domesticated animals and take part in various modules from education to communication to entrepreneurship. Alongside my teaching activities, I am a study career councillor, project coach and supervisor, module co-ordinator and take part in the research of a new professorship about a sustainable equestrian sector, my role focusing on increasing biodiversity in the equestrian sector. \n\nPreviously I did research at the interface of animal, movement and population ecology. I had a 5-year postdoctoral position (3 year 1.0fte, 2 years 0.5fte) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, and Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), in the Netherlands. The project was Cumulative Human Impact on biRd Populations (CHIRP; www.chirpscholekster.nl) where the aim was to identify the relative and cumulative threats across the Oystercatcher's life cycle, focusing on both variation in space (regional differences) and time (seasonal). I developed a complex integral population model for the oystercatcher with a detailed description of the model being published in Ecology, https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecy.3615. \n\nI did my PhD in Sweden at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) where I studied the movement ecology of moose with a principal goal of strengthening the link between movement ecology and conservation. One of the key publications was a framework describing how we can better integrate this knowledge, a forerunner in this field that has been widely discussed among both researchers and practitioners, https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2015.00155/full\n\nI did my MSc in Conservation Science at Imperial College London earning a distinction, where I published my dissertation on how landscape structure influences browsing damage by red deer. I did my BSc in Wildlife Conservation at the University of Kent when I also passed with distinction. Here we travelled to the amazon for our project where I studied the abundance of diversity on waterbirds. \n\nI have also done volunteer fieldwork in for example protecting leatherback turtles in Costa Rica and performing wildlife inventories in Madagascar.
