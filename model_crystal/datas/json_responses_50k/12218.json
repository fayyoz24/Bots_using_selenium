The detrimental consequences of long-term accumulation of genotoxic therapy-induced senescence have been reported to exert pro-tumorigenic effects and treatment-related toxicity in breast cancer patients mediated by SASP. FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have been revealed to induce cellular senescence without pro-tumorigenic properties and are able to suppress the expression of proinflammatory SASP. However, the effects of CDK4/6i on genotoxic therapy-induced senescent breast cancer cells have not been well-defined. Here we show that the addition of CDK4/6i into a genotoxic therapy regimen is able to alter the characteristics and SASP expression of senescent breast cancer cells. Our findings observe that the combination of genotoxic therapy and CDK4/6i resulted in a lower percentage of senescent breast cancer cells that regained their proliferating feature, except for the radiation and abemaciclib group. Looking at the SASP expression, the presence of CDK4/6i in the doxorubicin-treated cancer cells induces a senescent state with lower expression of most key SASP factors while the presence of CDK4/6 escalated most key SASP expression levels in the radiation-induced senescent cells. Our findings highlight the different mechanisms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in inducing cellular senescence as well as the different efficacy of CDK4/6i type, which eventually leads to different senescence characteristics.",

            "description": "Nearly all countries worldwide have been affected by the enormity of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, including Indonesia. This pandemic has a variation in symptoms and the number of deaths among Indonesian COVID-19 patients, which could be explained by the nonspecific immunity provided by the cross-reactive epitopes from LAVs (BCG, OPV, and MMR). However, there is still a lack of base evidence showing the cross-reactivity between these LAVs and SARS-CoV-2 specific to the Indonesian population. Through in silico approach, the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate T cell epitopes were predicted against HLA alleles specific to the Indonesian population. The generated epitopes were then compared with the OPV, BCG, and MMR sequence to identify similar patterns. The cross-reactive epitopes were further rechecked and inspected for their population coverage in Indonesia. Both BCG and MMR contain 15 and 7 strong binding cross-reactive epitopes specific to the Indonesian population, which have 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions compared with SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Despite that, the cross-reactive epitopes are potentially able to induce either cross-reactive CD8+ or CD4+ T cells against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, most cross-reactive epitopes have similar or higher population coverage than SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, ranging from 4.83% to 73.5%. In contrast, no cross-reactive epitopes were found from OPV specific to the Indonesian population, which may be due to the genome nature of poliovirus. Overall, these identified cross-reactive patterns may serve as a pillar for uncovering the full potential of beneficial cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 and future\npandemics.",

Besides that, silver nanoparticles also gain research interest for wound healing due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This project aims to develop a wound dressing made from silver nanoparticles incorporated keratin-pectin hydrogels and evaluate the hydrogels' wound healing capability and antimicrobial activity. Twenty four mice were divided into three treatment groups, consisting of control (gauze), pectin 2% + AgNP, and keratin-pectin 1:2 (2%) + AgNP. The wounds were observed, and the wound size reduction was measured at allocated times. A wound swab was also performed to analyze the antimicrobial activity of the hydrogels. Both pectin AgNP and keratin-pectin AgNP groups demonstrated superior wound healing properties macroscopically. However, the pectin AgNP group had a higher wound size reduction percentage than the keratin-pectin AgNP group on day 6 (p <0.05). There was no significant difference in wound size reduction percentage found between each group on days 3 and 9. Due to detached wound dressings during the study, the antimicrobial evaluation was also inconclusive. Further histology study is suggested to uncover more wound healing potential of silver nanoparticles incorporated keratin-pectin hydrogels.",
