    "summary": "I started my journey as a Software Test Engineer and I have an experience of more than 9 years in the software industry. Initially, I worked in the waterfall model, and then a few years back I was introduced to the world of Agile. I was thrilled by the concept of servant leadership in agile software development. With this newly found knowledge, I started supporting my team and then become a full-time Scrum Master. I am very passionate about agile development and I would like to share this passion with others.\nSo far I have learned that while improving individuals or a team, one can improve themselves.",
