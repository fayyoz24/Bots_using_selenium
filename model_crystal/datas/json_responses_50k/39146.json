    "summary": "Two things fascinate me in life: entrepreneurship and sports. I\u2019m happy when my actions have an impact. Impact, I like this word: to decide, to find solutions, to innovate, to create, to act. That's how I project myself everywhere in the future, confident.\n\nAs a pro athlete, I learned a lot and developed myself. But I also realised the issues that all athletes face when training at high intensity. They overtrain, and their body & mind are put under high stress and pressure. That's why PULSE has been created. With our amazing team, our mission is to help athletes understand their limits, so they can go beyond them. We give them a tool to maximise their performance so they can surpass themselves.",
