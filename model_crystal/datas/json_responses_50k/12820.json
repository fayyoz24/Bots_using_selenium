    "summary": "I have recently finished my master study in Artificial Intelligence at the Radboud University in Nijmegen and am now looking into my next steps. I enjoy learning new skills within the programming field and working on challenging topics and projects. My primary interests include two different directions. The first of which is the application of programming skills to help people or the climate. This can for example include medical applications. My other interest is the use of programming for development, with my primary interest being in game development. \n\nMy work experience includes working on a bachelor thesis and a master thesis, as well as performing an internship at ASM Pacific Technology Limited within the field of computer vision. In addition, I have worked as a teaching assistant for various courses at the Radboud University. Other part-time jobs I have had include giving tutor lessons at my secondary school and in my home town.",

The goal of the client was to create a base for an application that could potentially be used to motivate children to go outside to play more often. The idea for the application was to include challenges, based on which points could be earned. Subsequently, those points could be used to buy items in a 'store'. These items could be used to modify a player character. My role in this project included back-end development using JavaScript, parts of the front-end development using React, and parts of the design.",

The underlying data was created by asking participants to listen to an audio file while repeating the heard message. Subsequently, the developed tool was created to mark mistakes in the audio transcript, by comparing the transcript to the intended text. Various types of mistakes could be distinguished, such as phonetic, semantic, repetition, form, skipped or mistakes in the transcript itself. The results of the algorithm could be manually corrected afterwards.  A distinct focus during this project was to use the agile scrum method to manage and organize the project. Tools such as JIRA and GIT were used.",

The player could move and jump around in a space-like environment. Additionally, the player was equipped with a tool that could shoot 2 colours of portals which were connected to each other. By jumping through a red portal, the player would be launched out of the blue portal while preserving velocity.  Various levels were built based on this portal-shooting premise. In addition, various types of static or moving platforms and speed boosters were implemented.",
