    "summary": "ERWIN KESSELS (1973) received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degree (cum laude) in Applied Physics from the TU/e in 1996 and 2000, respectively. His doctoral work, which was partly carried out at the University of California Santa Barbara, was a study of the plasma deposition process of silicon films. In 1999 he was the recipient of the Coburn and Winters Award of the AVS Plasma Science and Technology Division. As a postdoc Erwin worked at the Colorado State University and at the Philipps University in Marburg. In 2002 Erwin was awarded a fellowship by the Netherlands Academy of Sciences and he joined the Department of Applied Physics of the TU/e as an assistant professor. His work covers the field of synthesis of thin films and nanostructures using methods such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and etching. His research involves the development of new techniques and processes for a wide variety of applications such as nanoelectronics and solar cells. This work is carried out in collaboration with industrial partners such as ASM, Air Liquide, FEI company, IMEC, NXP LAM Research, Levitech, Meyer Burger, Oxford Instruments, Philips, and Q-Cells. The research is complemented by fundamental studies of the plasma surface interaction using advanced surface-sensitive diagnostics and nonlinear surface spectroscopy. In 2005, he spent a sabbatical at the University of California Berkeley. In 2007, he was awarded the Peter Mark Award by the AVS Science and Technology. Since 2011 he leads the Plasma & Materials Processing group (40+ group members) as a full professor. He is also the scientific director of the NanoLab@TU/e clean room facilities.\n\nSpecialties: (Ultra)thin films, (plasma-assisted) ALD & CVD, surface diagnostics, (non)linear spectroscopy, solar cells, silicon technology, nanoelectronics",
