    "summary": "Excited to share my journey as a social media manager and journalist with 15 years of experience.\n\nI'm a Senior Social Media Coordinator at ASICS; I manage the global @asicsrunning Instagram account, which I implemented, and the ASICS Europe channels on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. I have managed and grown various brands' online presence in the past years through strategic social media campaigns and engaging content creation.\n\nI moved to the Netherlands in 2016, specifically to the picturesque city of Delft. My first experience was in a startup in Rotterdam called Sweek, where I was a Marketing Manager for 2,5 years. I was responsible for social editorial calendars, content creation for several platforms (i.e. social channels, blog, email marketing), influencer marketing, community management, graphic design, customer support, sales, and business development. It was a great opportunity to do what I love, start my career from scratch in a foreign country, meet nice people, and develop new skills.\n\nAfter this versatile position in the country that I decided to call home, I had the opportunity to work for Oliver Agency inside Diageo, one of the largest beverage multinational companies in the world, as the Social Media Manager of the two most prominent brands of the premium portfolio: Ciroc and Tanqueray. \n\nI have graduated in Journalism in Brazil, where I worked for worldwide advertising agencies, such as Edelman and Wunderman, and also for the largest Brazilian publishers and news portals (iG, UOL, Editora Abril, and Globo Cond\u00e9 Nast).\n\nI've already worked with brands such as HP, AMD, Symantec, Norton, Disney World, Bosch Power Tools, Petrobras, Always, TRESemm\u00e9, Dove, Honda, C\u00eeroc, Tanqueray, Gucci, ELLE, InStyle, Glamour, Microsoft, Vivo, Hershey's and Bauducco.  \n\nSkills:\n\u25ba Social media and creative strategy\n\u25ba Content marketing and creation \n\u25ba Influencer marketing\n\u25ba Partnerships with third-parties  \n\u25ba Visual guidelines and identity\n\u25ba Copywriting (Portuguese & English)\n\u25ba Video editing \n\u25ba PR\n\u25ba Business Development\n\u25ba Voice-over\n\n#SocialMedia #Journalism #ContentCreation #Storytelling #DigitalMarketing #Communications",
