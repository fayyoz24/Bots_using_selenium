    "summary": "My name is Aleksandra and I am a pianist, piano teacher, ensemble artist, accompanist. I moved to the Netherlands in February 2022 and in September I started my second Master's programe at ArtEZ University of the Arts in Zwolle. My first full music education I have got at Perm Institute of Culture in Perm, Russia.\n\nDuring my 20 years performing experience I took part in many concerts and competitions not only in my hometown but also in many other Russian cities (including Moscow and Saint-Petersburg) and abroad (Poland). That helped me a lot to improve my piano playing skills.\nSome of the competitions:\n- International competition-festival \u201cTRANSFORMATION\u201d. \u201cSpring festival\u201d - Saint-Petersburg, Russia, 2010 (1st place)\n- VII International festival-competition \u201cZAMKOWE LATO ARTYSTYCZNE\u201d - Miedzywodzie, Poland, 2011 (1st place)\n- Open regional competition festival of chamber ensemble performance - Perm, Russia, 2014 (1st place)\n- International competition-festival \u201cUral starfall\u201d - Perm, Russia, 2016 (Grand Prize)\n- IV International competition-festival \u201cRussian starfall\u201d (Concertmaster art) - Perm, Russia, 2017 (1st place)\n- VI All-Russian Music Competition \"Spring in Prikamye\" (Ensemble) - Perm, Russia, 2018 (Grand Prize)\n- IX All-Russian Music Competition \"Spring in Prikamye\" (Concertmaster art) - Perm, Russia, 2021 (1st place) \n\nWhile I was studying in Russia I did some research projects. As a result I published several articles:\n- the analysis of piano compositions of Rachmaninov, Schumann, Chopin, Webern;\n- teaching and performing style of Oborin, Virsaladze.\n\nI received several master-classes from great pianists and teachers who are:\n- Polina Fedotova (professor of Moscow State Conservatory, Honored Artist of Russian Federation);\n- Igor Olovnikov (professor of Belarusian State Academy of Music, Honored Artist of Belorussia); \n- Evgeni Mikhailov (Professor of Kazan State Conservatory, Honored Artist of Russian Federation).\n\nI truly belive that teaching is my life path. I was working as a piano teacher, accompanist and correpetitor for 5,5 years since 2016 at Perm Music School named after the composer E. Krylatov. I have got a precious and wide experience in work with children and adults and can find a suitable way in communication with each of them. I am a good mentor for my pupils and students and I guide them in a gentle and fun, but serious way in order for them to grow as musicians.\n\nAnother practi\u0441al experience I have got is working as an organists\u2019 assistant at Perm Philharmonic Concert Hall, as the second instrument I learnt is the organ.",
