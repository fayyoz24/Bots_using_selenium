    "summary": "Hello there!\n\n   I have been the youngest partner in a Brazilian criminal law firm, where I was the responsible attorney for pro-bono cases and international clients. Besides being a qualified lawyer with years of  demonstrated practice in national courts, I also have experience with academic legal research in Brazil and Internationally. I hold a Master of Laws (LL.M.) in Advanced Legal Studies in Public International Law with an International Criminal Law specialization from Leiden University/NL and have recently worked for the Legal Representative of Victims at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL). But, most importantly, I am a very driven and hardworking person who never misses the opportunity to connect with others.\n\n\n\n   At the moment, I am acting as a Visiting Professional in the Appeals Division at the International Criminal Court.\n\n\n\n-> Based in The Hague/ NL.\n\n-> Feel free to contact me and connect.",
