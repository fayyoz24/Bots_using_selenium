    "summary": "Currently, I work as an engineer at the research reactor at the Technical University Delft. It is a job that combines my scientific interests and technical background with the need for a precise and thorough work style. As a member of the engineering staff at the reactor, we are responsible for the design and evaluation of (components of) the reactor, from the core to attached instruments.\n\nProfessionally, I started as an experimental physicist in experimental condensed matter physics, with a focus on physical vapour deposition. During my research I've employed computer modelling, thin film growth, vacuum technology and electrical measurements to investigate various material systems. In addition, I have managed such equipment and its users, as well as designed new vacuum equipment from the ground on up. I built on those lab management skills in further jobs, working on new systems for heat storage for houses.\n\nI am not only interested in the technical side of science & technology, but also in the history, philosophy and organisation of science in a more general sense. An engineer is not just working on the machinery, but works and lives in a broader context.",
