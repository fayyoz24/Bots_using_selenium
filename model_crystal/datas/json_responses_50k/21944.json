    "summary": "I am currently leveraging media to generate conversations around Netflix's titles in EMEA. \nI previously helped build HP's in-house digital media capabilities for all markets within EMEA and contributed to building the first ever in house regional employer brand team at Oracle (EMEA). I started with a digital advertising background in agencies in Mumbai and Bucharest, explored the employer branding space for a few years and developed a taste of other related areas - from media planning and execution, brand research, creative campaigns design, to managing relationships with media and agency stakeholders. \n\nWhen I'm not working, I'm looking to try new things. Recently, I've been improving my Spanish, my APMs in Star Craft 2, reading a lot of SF and searching for scenic hiking trails.",
