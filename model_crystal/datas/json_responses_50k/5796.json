    "summary": "Program manager aiming to make the dutch govermental building portfolio more sustainable by amongst others looking at ways to electrify the construction process. Looking at synergies across different ambitions (circular economy- nature inclusive - water management). Long term over short term. \n\nOver 7+ years of work experience in both co-creation and multi-stakeholder projects. I am driven by finding the sweet spot between idealism and pragmatism. And like my Biblical namesake, I am motivated to save humanity from the great flood and hopefully positively contribute to biodiversity on the way.\n\nThis is my personal profile with my personal believes and opinions, some things might not reflect the opinion of the organisation I currently work for.",

Our mission is to unite the rainbow allies and the LGBTQ+ community in support of our cause. We stand for the value of ALL creatures and hope we all find our inner unicorns. That is why we chose the narwhal, the unicorns from the sea as our symbol.\n\nWe believe that there is a strong link between diversity issues and biodiversity challenges. Just as every individual has the right to live freely and openly, so too do all living creatures have the right to exist and thrive. By protecting biodiversity, we can create a world that embraces and celebrates the rich diversity of life.\n\nThe Narwhal Rainbow Alliance aims to support biodiversity protection through empowering local communities and projects. Since local communities often have a deep understanding of the ecology and biodiversity of their territories. This is knowledge which has been acquired through generations of lived experience and observation.\n\nThe foundation also focuses on promoting diversity through education. By using examples from diversity in the animal kingdom, the Narwhal Rainbow Alliance aims to promote conversations in schools about sexuality, gender and inclusion.\n\nJoin us on this journey towards a more vibrant and diverse world. Whether you are a rainbow ally or a member of the LGBTQ+ community, your support is vital to our cause. Together we can make a difference and create a world where everyone is welcomed and celebrated.\n\nwww.narwhalrainbowalliance.com",
