We have taken the widely acclaimed Dutch Bicycle Design \u2013 that has been part of our culture since 1885 \u2013 and added modern day technology to offer everything a daily commuter could simply ask for. This resulted in a striking range of LEKKER Bicycles to inspire the world to embrace cycling like the Dutch.\n\nIt was founder Meindert who left Amsterdam for Australia\u2019s Bondi Beach and immediately fell in love with all that Australia has to offer. But, there was just one thing missing: his bicycle.\n\nA commuter bike that he could ride to and from the beach, to Varsity, to the market, to his buddy\u2019s house, and then home. Meindert wanted a Dutch-design bike, but finding such a two-wheeler proved to be difficult, and he ended up buying a bike from one of his Dutch friends.\n\nEnthusiastic responses to his bike from Australians inspired him to bring a quality, beautiful, stylish and, above all, cool bicycle to Down Under. He wanted to create a bike that would ride and look like a dream. The series of bikes took shape in late 2009. No word could better describe what he had always envisaged the bike to be: LEKKER.",
