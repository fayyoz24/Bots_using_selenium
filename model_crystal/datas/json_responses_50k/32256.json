I got to work here with help of StartPeople employment agency, my main task was to help with the production of the domes. These domes had to be assembled by drilling some holes in them and then put some plastic screws in them so they wouldn't fall apart. According to the wish of the consumer we were able to put up to four layers of plastic in to each other per dome. Domes could be totally black or green or totally transparent, or anything in between. I sometimes got to assemble these domes myself, together with a colleague. Pretty interresting that was! It all sticks together with some doublesided stickytape. These domes could be extreme heavy, size did matter. After a short time I got to help with the loading of the domes. They were quite a lot I can tell you, lots of small ones and regularly a lot of bigger ones. I also saw a good chance to make my Art Academy studies come to good use. I saw chanche to think about a device that would speed up the production line a little by making a mobile packaging carriage. I got to draw it and worked it out in to a 3D structure of  blue cardboard. I got to present it to the chef and after a while my idea came to discussion. Tense times those were! But eventually I got to talk to the designer team and they thought of it to be usefull. They never really incorporated it into the workline but the idea was the thing that was very much appreciated. I had asked for a pair or workshoes and the abbility to inform people about it, and that is exactly what I got. Very nice!!! I lost my job here because of a withdraw in the efficiency results. Not me to blame.\n\nwww.Jet-Bik.nl",
