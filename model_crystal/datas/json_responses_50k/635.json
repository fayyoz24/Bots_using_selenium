    "summary": "I have been an active member of several organizations, including the Youth Parliament of Aruba, the International Order of DeMolay of Aruba, and Scouting Aruba. Through my involvement in these organizations, I have gained invaluable experience in leadership, problem-solving, and quick decision-making. I am also someone who enjoys expressing my opinions, and I am skilled at doing so in a professional and constructive manner.\n\nIn addition to my leadership skills, I have received numerous awards and completed various courses in different areas. For instance, I hold a first aid and AED certificate, which allows me to help those in need. I am adept at managing tasks and leading projects and group assignments. I take the initiative to find tasks to do rather than waiting to be assigned them.",

My responsibilities included caring for the children, organizing activities, preparing food, and teaching them basic cooking and baking skills. I also mediated conflicts between children and informed parents when necessary, as well as answered any general questions they had.\n\nIn my last month, I had the honor of being the camp coordinator for the Oranjestad location. As the camp coordinator, I helped plan the camp, ensured that all youth workers had the necessary equipment, and resolved any logistical issues that arose. Additionally, I contacted other organizations to give presentations or provide assistance with equipment, such as coordinating with the fire department to have firefighters spray water on the children during water day. When the two locations were combined for events such as beach or sports days, I worked with the coordinator for the San Nicolas location to ensure a smooth operation and come up with on the spot ideas when time needed to be filled",

Additionally, I prepared various types of snacks, organized and facilitated engaging and creative activities, and assisted with other general tasks as needed. Through my work, I developed strong teamwork, communication skills, and patience, while also gaining a deeper appreciation for the importance of empowering youth.\""
