    "summary": "Investigative researcher with over 13 years of experience in investigating (gross) human rights violations committed by states and corporations, gathering evidence used in and out of court. \n\nI was academically trained in the investigation of international crimes, applying legal and criminological research methods. In freelance capacity, I have managed a vast number of field studies in countries such as Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Uganda and Vietnam to provide evidence for both case development and advocacy strategies. \n\nI specialise in two main areas that sometimes overlap: corporate accountability for gross human rights violations & retaliation and violence against human rights defenders. \n\nWith the goal of bridging the corporate accountability gap, I have documented human rights abuses in the extractives, garment, agribusiness and finance sectors. I have worked extensively with communities and environmental defenders to seek justice for harm done by development finance and to challenge corporate power. Furthermore, I conduct research on the powers and strategies that aim to suppress the work of human rights defenders. This includes violence against women's rights activists and against those raising concerns about harmful business practice, as well as the harmful impacts of CFT regulation on human rights defenders.\n\nPractical skills and experience:\n\u2022 research and investigative methods for  documentating international crimes and human rights violations for fact finding and case building purposes\n\u2022 interviewing key informants in fragile settings and managing content and logistics for field research\n\u2022 research methods for impact assessments - including interviewing techniques, survey development, focus groups, and OECD-DAC standards for impact evaluations\n\u2022 developing advocacy strategies for justice initiatives",
