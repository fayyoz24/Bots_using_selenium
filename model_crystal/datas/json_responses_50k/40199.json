    "summary": "I have always enjoyed studying the world around me and learning new skills as life went along.\nAfter journeying through the Dutch higher education system from 2002 onwards, I moved to Finland in 2007 to finalize my Master's training and pursue a Ph.D. \n\nMy time as a Ph.D. trainee was marked by gaining a deeper understanding of my chosen subject (Campylobacter distribution in Finland), learning to network at domestic and overseas conferences and receiving pedagogical training necessary for university teaching. As a non-native English speaker I also received 'Teaching through English' training.\n\nI came back to The Netherlands in 2016 to become a teacher at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. I joined the Biomedical Laboratory Sciences program, which was then going through an educational transition process. During this process I was involved in the deconstruction of courses, developing intended learning outcomes (ILOs) and combining the knowledge, skills and ILOs together with new didactic insights into a revamped curriculum. \n\nI did not do this on my own and I learned to collaborate more so than I had done before, recognizing other people's strengths and help them to further develop skills and competencies.\nI also became proficient in the use of educational technology (e.g. Kahoot and Socrative), learned to scrutinize and improve examination and have become a certified examinator and assessor.\n\nAs skilled laboratory workers are in demand worldwide I have also pursued collaborations with higher education programs abroad. This has resulted in exchange agreements with institutes in Belgium, Finland and Wales. I am now in the process of further developing my organizational and people managing skills. To this end I am presently the chairwoman of the curriculum committee; a position in which one provides structure and guidance to the other members and warrants a resilient and modern curriculum.",
