Envision's programs focus on experiential education in which participants learn by doing. Through their programs, students develop the skills and resources they need to achieve their full leadership potential and to succeed in an ever-evolving world. Envision is a nonpartisan, taxpaying educational organization based in Vienna, Virginia, USA. With programs held across the United States of America and internationally, Envision educates over 25,000 scholars a year.\n\nI attended the ISLP on Diplomacy held in China (in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing), and Hong Kong. The programme places students in scenarios where they are required to negotiate, compromise and handle complex conflict resolution differences, cross-border trade and issues pertaining to globalisation.\n\nThe programme further allowed us to engage with a number of Chinese universities, social organisations, Chinese business, as well as the American Embassy, the Polish Embassy and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs with regards to issues on Chinese Foreign Policy. During the programme, I was required to lead a number of my peers from various countries in a variety of diplomatic projects \u2013 ranging from environmental, trade and military issues facing the Chinese Government and the new role it seeks to adopt on the world stage.\n",
