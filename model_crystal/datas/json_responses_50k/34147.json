With an overall solid understanding of the risks related to ML/TF, the Netherlands has an adequate legal framework to tackle financial crime. However, further actions are needed to prevent legal persons from being used for criminal purposes and to strengthen risk-based supervision.\n\nSimon Consulting developed this webinar to explore the key findings of the Mutual Evaluation Report of the Netherlands, such as supervision, Ultimate Beneficial Ownership and Financial Intelligence. We provided a comparative analysis with Germany and our insights into how future developments in the Dutch system can influence your financial institution.",
