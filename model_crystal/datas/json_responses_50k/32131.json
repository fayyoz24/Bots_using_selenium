During this internship a visual tool that works hand in hand with FINESSE was designed in Python. This tool, PF2q, uses a quick estimation process to partially bypass FINESSE, making working with FINESSE more convenient and easier. PF2q can be found on GitHub https://github.com/Karel-van-de-Plassche/PF2q.\n\nExcerpt from the final reports abstract:\n\nA problem currently faced by researchers is a mismatch between experimental data, in this case from ASDEX Upgrade, and a software package used to reconstruct plasma equilibrium before a crash, FINESSE. The safety factor pro\ufb01le, also known as q-pro\ufb01le, was used to compare the ASDEX and FINESSE data. Another software package, PF2q, was designed in this report to solve this mismatch. PF2q, using the Grad-Shafranov equation and Finite Element Methods, was able to quickly estimate the q-pro\ufb01le from an input pressure- and F-pro\ufb01les. This was then used to provide the experimenter with a visual tool to make the matching of data easier. PF2q calculates the q-pro\ufb01le within 1% relative error, and was able to estimate the q-pro\ufb01le given input pressure and F radial pro\ufb01les within 1ms.",

To keep up with this need, investigators in the COBRA-institute carry out fundamental research ranging from basic research in physics on novel materials to system applications.\n\nThe work described in this report focuses on two devices used in the COBRA research programme: the XFP and the Zarlink transceiver. The XFP is a high speed transceiver that is commonly used for high bit-rate communication in computer networks and telecom links, while the Zarlink TIA/LA transceiver connects photodiodes to the electrical system. The devices have to be configured before they can be used in experiments. The user should be able to control the devices even with little knowledge of software. For this purpose, a control system has been made. The user can control the devices with a computer by using LabVIEW, for which an user-friendly graphical interface has been designed. A separate system using only a keyboard in combination with an LCD screen has been made for when the user only needs basic functionality. The Arduino board was chosen to serve as a link between the computer and the stand-alone version. It communicates with the XFP board via I2C and with the Zarlink transceivers via a two-wire interface. The user interface has been constructed in LabVIEW, to provide the user a user-friendly graphical interface, while its modular design ensures future programmers will be able to improve the current software. \n\nThe software has been written to give the user full control over the devices. At this moment, the software has not been sufficiently tested yet. In future work, the higher level functions should be tested in an experimental environment. However, basic functions of the software have been tested with a positive result, and there are strong indications the higher level functions are working as intended.",
