    "summary": "Hi There! My name is Nienke Jansen and I am an Internationally oriented real estate professional currently working as Senior Asset Manager. My strength lies in my broad set of knowledge and skills. Due to extensive experience in different educational and professional challenges I am not purely trained in Real Estate. These competencies help me to understand the bigger picture and support me in connecting real estate markets and dynamics to broader processes and organizational challenges.  \n\nAs Senior Asset Manager for Crossbay I am directly in charge of all the Dutch and Belgian logistics assets. This entails a dedication to our clients needs and managing the properties from a to z. Whether it concerns project management related to commercial, technical, financial or sustainability topics, I do it all! \n\nI further subscribe to the following competencies: \n\u2022\tLanguages (Dutch, English and Spanish)\n\u2022\tCoordination, Project Management and Communication \n\u2022\tEducation (teaching)\n\u2022\tDutch Politics (through different functions within an established political party)\n\u2022\tNon-governmental organizations and development project coordination\n\u2022\tInternational Relations and International Political Economy\n\u2022\tLatin American Studies and Research",
