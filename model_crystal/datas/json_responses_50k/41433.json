    "summary": "Since a kid, I was sure that computers and earth are strange and have some harmonic similarities. When I was 18, I thought of doing computer engineering. It was a marvelous tour in my life where I get to understand machines and learn their languages. I felt like a superhero, I felt that I understood Alan Turing more deeply now.\n\nWhen I was 23 I got my first job as a MySQL software developer and could talk to machines but the earth did not seem happy. It was dirty and resources are fading. While visiting nearby villages for company-sponsored social work, I saw what beauty this planet holds and how are we ruining it.\n\n I was determined to pursue my currier in Environment engineering. It took me 10,000 self-talking sessions to gain courage and move forward, but despite mental fatigue, I knew my calling. Once I say I\u2019ll do something, it will happen.\n\nNow, I put that awareness and knowledge to work as an Environment Engineer and Sustainability Data Engineer for firms. I don\u2019t have to climb any mountains\u2026but I do have to move them. I\u2019m well-versed in my computer department with proficiency in java, c, python, machine learning, and data engineering. Apart from technical skills, I am also acquainted with planning and relationship management.\n\nI have work experience of 3 years in the software and sustainable development industry and I have learned various new skills.\nIf I seem enough interesting from my profile, I would love to grab a coffee and talk about the future in your company, please send an email my way.\n\nCompetencies: Data Engineering, Weather Database Managment, LEED, BREEM, Microsoft Office, Wastewater Treatment, Water Treatment, Water chemistry and microbiology, Sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals,  Java, Python, C, Mysql, Management, Net Zero Carbon, Carbon footprint",

When I had my break I went to her to offer water, with teary eyes she recalled her home where she had well in her house. She was thrown out of her house by her son and daughter-in-law, as she seems to occupy unnecessary space which could be given to her grandchildren.\n\nFrom that moment, I was determined to do something in my capacity for elderly people.
