Heijnsdijk from the department of Public Healthcare at the Erasmus Medical Centre. \n\nPatients with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are more likely to reach adulthood due to ever-improving treatments. However, little appears to be known about End-of-Life (EoL) guidance in adult CHD (ACHD) patients. What is the current situation regarding EoL conversations in patients with ACHD?\n\nThe project consisted of a field study, as well as literary research. The field study consisted of creating questionnaires for patients with ACHD and for doctors of the department of Congenital Cardiology at Erasmus MC. Qualitative research was conducted on the basis of the results of these questionnaires. The literature search consisted of searching for relevant articles on EoL interviews with ACHD-patients.\n\nThe conclusion of this research was that the current situation around EoL conversations with ACHD patients leaves much to be desired. In addition to a lack of documentation regarding EoL interviews, there is also a discrepancy in perceived incidence of EoL interviews between patients and doctors. Advice was geared towards encouraging the creation of uniform, yet individualistic, strategies for the EoL conversation.\n\nThis work was graded with \u2018Excellent\u2019.",

The aim of this project was to give medical and linguistic information to low-literate residents with a non-Western background from Delfshaven, Rotterdam. \n\nResidents with a non-Western background and functional illteracy were invited to participate. The participants (n= 305) followed a program of five lessons in the Dutch language and five theoretical lessons about medication and health. These classes were given by medical students who we recruited to volunteer as teachers in the project. Before and after the program, participants were tested on questions linked to the subjects that were covered in the medication and health lessons. \n\nScientific research into the effect of this was titled: 'The effect of teaching health-related vocabulary and essential medical knowledge to functionally illiterate adults'. Results showed that teaching health-related vocabulary and essential medical knowledge to functionally illiterate adults in Delfshaven, the Netherlands led to an increase of 25% in theoretical knowledge.",
