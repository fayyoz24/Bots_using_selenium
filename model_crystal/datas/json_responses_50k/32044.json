    "summary": "I'm a multimedia designer specialized in concept design and e-learning. I come up with ideas, work them out to be solid concepts and love seeing them work in the real world. I also enjoy teaching students about concept design,  graphic design, creativity & personal growth and coaching them at Fontys Academy for Creative Industries. Here I've also set up and ran a course on creativity and personal growth together with a colleague of mine. Every year I read several books and articles to keep 'Creativity Quotient' as the subject was called, evolving, so that our students could get the most out of it and take big steps towards finding and achieving their dreams. Due to changes in the university's educational concept this subject has now made place for challenged based learning, in which I coach a company and fill in a spot in several development teams that work on this new form of education. \n\nIn the past I have also worked in e-learning, where it's always been my goal to not only make (digital) learning material, but to make the students (whatever their age) enjoy working with it. If possible, have them enjoy it so much that they forget they're learning. \nOther things I do and have done contain: illustration, storytelling, character design, imagineering and experience design, logo- and multimedia design, marketing and photography.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016 I have started and finished a full time pre-master and masters program at Radboud University Nijmegen, while still working at Fontys ACI as a lecturer. Therefore I am now Bachelor of Multimedia (fall 2009) and Master of Arts (summer 2016) in communication and persuasion. I graduated with a thesis on using narrative in textbooks for better recall of the information. \n\nSpecialties: Concepting, Imagineering, Illustration, Design, E-Learning, Personal Growth / Coaching, Usability, Teaching",

These short digital courses were meant to use in school for kids ages 10 up to 14 and were mainly about cultural subjects. \n\nThe concept that could be used on every thinkable subject in short is about two teens, working in the library in a part time job as researchers. Whenever something strange happened (like a really old letter found in a book or a painting stolen from the library) these researchers were the ones figuring it all out. This way a mysterious story was woven around every subject and the user would be asked to help out as an actual researcher and solve the mystery, while learning about the subject in the process. \nIn fact, the whole idea is to lure kids into learning. They're having fun solving the mystery and sometimes forget that they are actually learning a lot in the process.",

In the year of the kick-off I was still a student myself, about to start graduating. For three years I've been one of four workgroup members. Making sure there was a Lab Session every week.

            "description": "While studying Communication & Multimedia Design I've worked on numerous projects. Still this one still stands out, because it was so different than the others and surely a great experience. \n\nFor a street theatre festival we were asked to create part of the festival involving digital media. Our client wanted a big projector screen in the middle of the city centre, showing pictures that visitors of the festival would make and bring to us. Also they wanted us to interview visitors, asking them how they were experiencing the festival. We as creative students found this plan quite boring and decided to lift it to a higher level. We set up some crazy concepts and they were all turned down... We figured out they just didn't know what to think of it, because they'd never seen anything like it before and so we decided to go through with the ideas anyway, because we were sure they would work out well on the festival.\n\nIn the end we created several colorful wooden stands. One where we had some computers to upload the pictures of visitors, which would be projected on the big screen. We build a tiny theatre with a fabric tent-like top and red curtains, in which a visitor could push a red button and then record a video message of 15 seconds, talking about the festival, while seeing themselves on the screen in front of them. These video's also got projected on the big screen. Last but not least we thought of an extra use to the big screen: a giant computermouse game! We created a huge mousepad with a gigantic mouse on it that actually worked. Kids (almost the same size as the mouse itself) would move the mouse around, controlling a character on the big screen that they had to steer through a maze (looking like the city we were in) and bringing in to the festival. Touching a wall meant starting over. \nAll elements were populair and the theatre (\"15 Seconds of Fame) has even been used for similar purposes later on, but the (at first turned down) \"Mega Mouse Game\" was a huge hit.",
