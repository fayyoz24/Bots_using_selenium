    "summary": "What drives me professionally is the chance to assess equities for investment portfolios by focusing on sustainability. I take into account relevant environmental, social and governance risks that have potentially-material effects on the performance of investee companies.\n \nMy experience over the years has taught me that governance and environmental aspects have proved much easier to grasp than social issues when objective and subjective considerations play a critical role in assessing sustainability. Publicly available data and information remain the primary evidence to substantiate my neutral judgment and opinion.\n \nNot only do I follow general guidelines and methodologies, including financial, managerial and sustainability accounting standards, as well as discounted cash flows and multiples for the sum of the parts. But also do I use bespoke buy-side research toolkits in which I am capable to draw investment conclusions and to provide suggestions to institutional investors, especially pension funds, for building portfolios.\n \nLuckily, I have been able to live in various continents and countries with different languages and to work in different organizational settings. I quickly adjusted to new job functions, corporate cultures, and working groups. This rapid transformation has been instrumental in my career path.\n \nI also enjoy training international students and hearing that they find my courses useful because they can directly apply the knowledge and skills gained in class to their jobs. I hold a Ph.D. doctor degree from Leuven University in Belgium and a B.K.O. university teaching qualification from Twente University in the Netherlands.\n \nOffline, you can find me admiring art including ikebana or enjoying opera and dance performances. Besides cooking at home for family and friends, I also love to have dinner in restaurants to celebrate special occasions.\n\nSpecialties: \nequity research \ninternational trade\npatent systems\nmaterial transfer agreements\nESG\n\nFields: \nbanking\nconsumer \nbiotechnology",

            "description": "This study is dedicated to a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the patent system in Europe. An effective system for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights represents an essential element for the growth of economies, which are based on the generation and exploitation of new scientific and technological knowledge. The well-known risks of market failures in the private financing of innovation investments call for a continuous effort of policy makers to the improvements of the tools that are expected to guarantee proper private returns from R&amp;D activities while protecting also the interests of consumers and society at large. The increased salience of patents to companies competing in the knowledge economy has raised concerns throughout the world in the past decade about the actual effectiveness of the current patent systems.",

            "description": "The aim of this article is to put into critical perspective the empirical findings on\nsecrecy and withholding in research. In other words, by taking existing\nempirical literature into account, it is intended that a crucial question is\nanswered: Is secrecy and withholding in research harmful or innocuous to\nscience? To understand how secrecy and withholding in research have\naffected academic science, empirical studies have been placed in the wider\ncontext of Mertonian underpinnings of the anticommons threat. The turning\npoint in testing the effects of secrecy and withholding of data and material\non scientific research was marked by statistical studies based on surveys and\nbibliometric measures. These two types of empirical studies have given\nanswers to the basic question since academia was threatened by different\nmodes of practicing science.",

            "description": "This article provides an empirical assessment of the performance of the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in terms of science, tech- nology, and innovation. This study is relevant because it employs a larger data set, examines more countries, and covers more years than previous studies. The results indicate that these countries had differing patterns of performance, and the pattern of growth among them was asymmetrical. Additional findings suggest that these countries performed idio- syncratically with respect to the six quantitative dimensions we examined. Our research includes a form of comparative policy evaluation that might assist the monitoring of the implementation of \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0098Vision 2020\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The results simplify how we determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of national innovation systems and are relevant to policy dis- cussions. In relation to transferability, the findings demonstrate similarities to the European Union with regard to performance and governance.",

At the end of 2005, the European Commission awarded a contract to a consortium of leading European innovation organisations to support the process of adapting existing, and designing new, tailor-made, innovation policies. In a nutshell, this is what the Sectoral Innovation Watch (SIW) was all about. Its overall aim was to provide policy-makers and innovation professionals with a better understanding of current sectoral innovation dynamics across Europe and the results obtained during the first phase (2005-2008) showed that the situation varies greatly at both country and sectoral level. \nA fundamental question is to what extent and why innovation performance differs across sectors. During the SIW second stage,  the activities on innovation indicators, models and statistical analyses at sectoral level were continued with updates and a further deepening, along with qualitative analyses. A number of changes compared to the first project phase applied. In addition to the six sectors of biotechnology, food and drink, electrical and optical equipment, automotive, space and aeronautics and textiles in the first phase, three new sectors of wholesale and retail trade, knowledge intensive services and construction had been added. Also, the horizontal focus had been extended to the five themes of eco-innovation, gazelles, organisational innovation, lead markets and national specialisation. More than before is future a focal part of the Sectoral Innovation Watch, with foresight of sectoral innovation challenges and opportunities as one of its major tasks. This was a highly participatory exercise that involved different groups of actors, in an attempt to shape the future. ",
