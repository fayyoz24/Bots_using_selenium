    "summary": "Introduction\nCurrently, I am looking for a full time position in which people and organisations can build on my experience and expertise in the fields of Finance, Accounting and Mortgage Banking as well in complex turnaround situations. \n\nCareer overview\nWhen I started my career as a Dutch certified public accountant (\"Register Accountant\") at EY I was given given the opportunity to work and live overseas. I worked and lived for five years in Jakarta, Indonesia and in New York City, USA. These years have greatly benefited my ability to deal with differences in people, culture and business practices. \n\nAfter working in audit and corporate finance for EY until 2005, I switched lanes and joined the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers as a managing director and CFO for their newly started mortgage business in the Netherlands (ELQ), This startup Company was profitable in its third year of operations and after the demise of Lehman Brothers in 2008, I was together with my 3 fellow directors able to manage the Company outside the bankruptcy of its parent company through a management buy out after a major restructuring of its operations. The Company remained profitable and focused on special servicing of consumer mortgages. The acquiring company Veron Capital B.V. expanded into new areas of loan origination and provided special servicing solutions to major Dutch Banks. \n\nIn 2016, after the sale of my shareholdings in these Companies, I have been advising people and private companies on an interim/project basis in the areas of management, strategy and finance as an independent consultant. \n\nIndustry Knowledge\nAs an auditor at EY, I have worked mostly in an international setting and for global clients in various industries including banking.\n\nAt Lehman Brothers and after the buy-out , the focus was on mortgage banking and all the issues relating to that in the areas of credit, securitisation, funding, capital markets including private equity and hedgefunds. \n\nGeneric Skills\nThe people I have worked with rated me as a great team player and innovator with a passion for understanding the core of issues and winning the hearts of the people in making wise decisions as well being honest when the reality did not match the intended results. \n\nSpecific Skills \nAudit\nAccounting\nFinance\nManagement Reporting\nCredit\nStrategy\nCrossing point of finance with legal\nStartup Companies\nRestructuring\nNew Business \nTurnaround management",
