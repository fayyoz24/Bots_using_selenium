    "summary": "Most of my experience prior to 2015 is music related, however due to the inconsistent nature of music work, I have since branched out into the front-office/back-office environment such as customer service (Booking.com) and office assistant type roles (HPP Exhibitions). I also have experience doing physical work such as post delivery (PostNL) and logistics (Hudson's Bay).\n\nMy most valuable experience was setting up my own business (www.noveltone.com). A company which composes and sells custom-made music for radio, podcasts, movies etc. This is still an ongoing side-project of mine and my business partner's. \n\nStarting early this year, I have been doing Dutch to English translating work for 'THE NEW Translations' and have since branched out into doing translating through my own company - 'Bourne Vertaling'.",
