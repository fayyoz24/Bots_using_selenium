    "summary": "Huntington Beach and Southern California are great places to live and work, which is why Paul Van Berkom chose to call it home. With farm roots in Powers Lake, North Dakota, Paul came to Southern California in 2001. Real estate is a passion for Paul, and with an international business degree from Cal State University, Northridge, it is easy to see why more than 25 families in 2021 called him for help buying and selling.\nPaul has been a part of the Coldwell Banker family for 12 years, but he isn\u2019t just passionate about helping families find their next home. He is also a consultant with The Academies of Social Entrepreneurship (ASE) affiliated with UCLA which trains non-profits on how to be financially viable and loves being a part of other Orange County community events. \nWhen Paul isn\u2019t in the office or volunteering, you\u2019ll often find him working out, and enjoying time with his friends, and family members. He also flies back to North Dakota twice per year to plant and harvest his family\u2019s farm. \nPaul and his Team will do everything in their power to provide you with the best Customer Service possible.",
