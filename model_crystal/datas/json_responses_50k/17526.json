    "summary": "Since beginning my doctorate in 2012, I have developed my research at the nexus of Cultural Anthropology and Science and Technology Studies (STS), focusing on values in (human and animal) health care practices. In my work I combine philosophical reflection with empirical study of care practices. Next to advancing theories of valuation, care and biopolitics, my work informs public deliberation on complex health issues.\n\nIn my doctorate I examined care practices targeting obesity as part of the ERC project 'The Eating Body in Western practice and theory' led by Annemarie Mol. I showed that while the dominant approach to obesity emphasizes self-control and bodily discipline, other forms of care differently negotiate diverse values, such as having a healthy body, leading a good life, financial constraints and other practicalities\u2014work that has led to a new theoretical perspective on the ethical and practical considerations of handling a multifaceted health problem. My PhD dissertation was awarded a cum laude distinction and received the Premium Erasmianum Thesis Prize. In my postdoc at the Values group in Linkoping University, led by Steve Woolgar, I continued to study self-care practices, focusing on Dutch rehabilitation centres targeting chronic pain and fatigue \u2013 both health conditions that are notoriously neglected in contemporary western medicine. \n\nDuring my research on health care practices, I began to wonder how care might be negotiated across different divides and in different contexts. These questions, along with the emerging focus on ecology and multi-species relations in anthropology and STS, have inspired me to develop a new research project on veterinary practices in livestock production. Supported by a Veni grant from the Dutch Research Council, I now examine how in a world caught between the growing demand for meat, pressing ecological challenges, and the rising concern for animal welfare, veterinarians negotiate diverse concerns and contribute to changes in the livestock sector.\n\nI have teaching experience in Anthropology and Philosophy of Science, as well as master thesis and PhD supervision.\n\n",

As part of this team I studied how self-care is taught in health care practices targeting burnout and chronic pain. My ethnographic focus was on the self-care techniques meant to achieve the transformation to an active self-caring subject, such as setting boundaries around the self; rewriting behavioural patterns; and learning to feel one\u2019s needs and sensations. These reveal that professionals don\u2019t just ask clients to do differently, but teach them to feel, think and appreciate differently altogether. In the process, rehabilitation clinics negotiate normativities of (self-)worth, vulnerability, productivity, relationality and health.",
