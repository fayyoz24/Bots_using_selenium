Results included a checklist document for designing foresight studies, a method selection tool and advice on how to improve RIVM foresight studies. Subsequently, RIVM announced the following year as \"year of the foresight study\" (Jaar van de Toekomstverkenner).\n\nIn addition I contributed to a Horizon Scan concerning the current and future use of nanotechnology in different categories of medical devices, and the associated risks and opportunities. The results were presented at the CLINAM congress (Basel, 2015) and published in a public RIVM report.",
