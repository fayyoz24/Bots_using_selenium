    "summary": "A highly motivated and enthusiastic mechanical engineer who successfully defended and graduated MSc in Mechanical engineering with specialization in Design, Production and Management (DPM). The final Master thesis was carried out at Fokker Aerostructures. I face a future of many challenges that I am eager to confront. Starting from ideating phase to final design concept and working on processes is my cup of tea. I thoroughly enjoy the obstacles as a Design engineer that needs to tackled. Experience with various mechanical related software's and acquired with necessary skills as a starter & also willing to learn further. I am excited to know what lies ahead.",
