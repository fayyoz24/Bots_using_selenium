    "summary": "With a multi-disciplinary background in Development Studies, I want to contribute to a better world by combining academic excellence with practical relevance in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over the years, I\u2019ve written on numerous topics including partnerships, advocacy, social movements and inclusive development. To me, fulfillment comes from making academia and its explicit type of knowledge more relevant to society when it is combined with the tacit knowledge that practice brings.  In my research, I speak academic and practitioner languages to ensure that ideas and experiences flow back and forth between the two domains. As an academic, I cooperate with practitioners and I try to add value through membership in advisory boards and contributing to policy discussions.\n\nMost of my academic teaching goes beyond theoretical models and emphasizes the importance of discussing real-world experiences, cases and solutions.  As an educator I hope to inspire and inform professionals working on the SDGs, ultimately enabling them to take better decisions. As program lead for AMID Masterclasses International Development, I work with people from the Development Cooperation sector working mainly working for government agencies, NGOs and foundations. I also lead AMID Community Building, an innovative program aimed at helping companies to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals using the principles of  Social Movements: change from within and below.",
