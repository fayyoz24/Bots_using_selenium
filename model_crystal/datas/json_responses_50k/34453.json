    "summary": "I\u2019m a sustainability/climate change expert and social entrepreneur. Right now leading a global team at South Pole conducting project development, implementation and project management services in the field of climate change mitigation i.e. sustainable technologies & nature based solutions, AFOLU.\n\nThe tasks include overall supervision on project development as well as strategic thinking and decision making on team management, QA/QC and workflow/process optimisation within the unit. The above is achieved in collaboration/coordination with the portfolio, operations, global sourcing & climate policy teams. \n\nThe int\u2019l award winner (2011-2021 Environmental Finance) project development and implementation (PDI) unit - with +200 highly skilled experts - is in charge of an effective and smooth supply process within the climate mitigation action chain. The team is amongst the best and can effectively handle diverse, complex and multidisciplinary topics with high quality and innovative approach. The processes within the unit are designed, and constantly improving, to smoothly and transparently identify, develop, quantify and verify a variety of environmental products e.g. CO2 emission reductions (ER) credits, renewable energy certificates (REC) and sustainable development goals (SDG) under various schemes e.g. UNFCCC, Verra (aka VCS), Gold Standard (GS4GG), Social Carbon (SC), Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCBS), ISO mitigation claims/certificates, Women and Gender Standard (W+) etc. \n\nOur risk assessment and management (RAM) tool together with our systematic QA/QC and M&E processes insures high quality projects with long term socio-ecological safeguarding mechanism in place. \n\nExample of products and services: initial project assessment (IPA), full due diligence, project design document (PDD) development, methodology design and (digital) monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) planning as well as validation/registration and verification/issuance, ground implementation services, monitoring & evaluation reporting (M&E).\n\nExample of climate project scopes: Renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste/water management, biofuel/biogas/biomass, green urban development, transport, CCSU, hydrogen, community-based projects (e.g. cookstoves, domestic biogas, water purification, solar home systems), Nature Based Solutions (NBS) / AFOLU i.e. Afforestation & Reforestation, REDD+, Blue Carbon, Land Use, Agriculture, Biodiversity and Communities.",

The objective is to support the global project teams to reach their targets in a smooth, effective and high quality manner. Above support is also backed by our (digital) data science policy throughout our internal and external processes and deliverables, led by the Digital Innovation team.\n\nThe unit is structured to facilitate strategic support to projects teams and other practices within the CP unit. This structure includes practices such as the Quality Assurance & Quality Control (QA/QC), Digital Innovation, Nature Based Solutions scopes, Sustainable Technology scopes, Implementation and M&E affairs and Standards & Methodologies. \n\nPDME together with the Technology Strategy as two global functions of the Climate Projects unit lead the process of coordinating and channeling our harmonised project strategy, quality, knowledge and IP in support of our global climate project objectives.",

The mission is to eliminate financial hurdles as well as negative environmental and social impacts in agricultural and other land/nature use activities. Dasht aims to accomplish this by increasing awareness and knowledge among local communities/farmers and NGOs and by inspiring them with innovative, pragmatic and sustainable solutions. \n\nDasht aims at bringing capacity and knowledge/awareness to farmers and alert them on the dangers of non-planned, environmental unfriendly and cost/effort intensive manners, that how they can become resilient and mitigate the impacts of climate change. We strive to showcase to communities, by piloting small scale projects, on how to save their land and other vital natural resources by implementing sustainable farming practices and measures that are also financially sustainable at the same time. The goal is to make farmers aware how to modify their planning and implementation for efficient use of resources and other needs. \n\nIn order to achieve the above, Dasht facilitates knowledge transfer in support of the organic farming and circularity movements around the globe. Dasht's local offices provide a direct point of contact and offer advisory, project engagement and management services as well as  monitoring and follow up service as required.",

FRES offers households and small local businesses access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy (e.g. derived from solar energy). FRES Netherlands provides the expertise and investments needed for the FRES businesses to start up, grow, and most importantly, become self-reliant.  Currently there are five FRES companies in Mali, South Africa. Burkina Faso, Uganda and Guinea Bissau. A new FRES company will be established in Cameroon in 2016.\n\nThe majority of 1.2 billion people who have zero access to electricity are in about a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today such as jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes. Sustainable energy is opportunity as it transforms lives, economies and the planet. On 1 January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2014 adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at an historic UN Summit \u2014 officially came into force. Out of 17 SDGs, goal 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, something that FRES strives to achieve daily.",
