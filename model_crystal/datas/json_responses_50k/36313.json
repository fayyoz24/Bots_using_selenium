Yet during the winter periods, significant floods occur, blocking the movement of goods and people. This is especially a problem for the children of one village as the only school is in the neighbouring village. \nTo improve quality of life and design a suitable bridge, Mr Boutghrit brought together engineering students from Scalda and HZ who can work together on the project to reach the aims, named \u2018No Bridge too Far\u2019.",
