I've been working in the iGaming industry as a content manager, editor and reporter - mostly at PokerNews - for over 10 years. My professional interests include everything from content marketing to people management, with a track record of delivering outstanding results in a fast-paced and challenging environment.\n\nOne thing you'll quickly learn about me is that I love to travel around the world. Whether its exploring new destinations or just visiting old friends, this passion has taken me to some pretty cool places already. Running has always been one of my passions as well (yes, even on vacation), so it's not uncommon for me to explore a new city by running it.",
