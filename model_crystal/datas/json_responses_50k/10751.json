Criticality is a designation of the level of assurance against failure needed for a system component.

The so-called Adaptive Mixed Criticality (AMC) scheme was used as a starting point for Mixed Criticality. That scheme was extended from two to more than two criticality levels and it was complemented with specified behavior for criticality level changes.

In particular we focus on large-scale project-based design and development of this kind of software.\n\nThe various parts of our PDEng degree programme aid to develop the capability of individuals to work within a professional context. It advocates a scientific research based approach to solving problems, a systematic way of collecting evidence and a critical, reflective, and independent mind for the analysis and interpretation of evidence.\n\nIt adds an additional dimension to a full M.Sc. programme by extending it and integrating it with new elements. The emphasis is on developing and strengthening (exercising) the competencies necessary for finding technical solutions. For finding such solutions an effective collaboration with representatives of different domains in inevitable and this is practiced during the programme. During our programme our PDEng trainees focus on systems architecting and designing software for software-intensive systems in multiple application domains for the High Tech Industry.\n\nAfter successfully completing all requirements, trainees are awarded a Professional Doctorate in Engineering degree.",
