Text categorization has evolved into a fully blossomed research \ufb01eld the recent years providing solutions for a wide variety of real-world applications. This wide variety includes applications in spam \ufb01ltering, authorship attribution, sentiment analysis and language identi\ufb01cation.\n\nThis master thesis purports to take a closer look at text classi\ufb01cation. A novel text classi\ufb01cation method is introduced that is based on the construction of a Markov chain. The new method is \ufb01rstly evaluated in the area of Name Entity Recognition for identifying people\u2019s names and places from a given document. It is also tested against Naive Bayes in the area of Authorship Attribution.\n\nSimulation results show that the novel text classi\ufb01cation method performed particularly well at the current level. Building on the new method looks promising and this procedure can provide a topic for further research.",

However, if we philosophise the importance of a mathematical axiom, we shall say that a list of axioms may develop a theory in Mathematics, but at the same time this does not prove that the theory is unique or enough. In the second half of 19th century, mathematicians constructed non-Euclidean Geometries by replacing the parallel axiom of Euclidean Geometry, with an appropriate alternative one and they showed that if the system based on Euclid\u2019s axioms is consistent, then the new constructed system remains consistent. As a consequence of that and after Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, mathematicians had finally a sufficient evidence to give an answer to the question \u2018\u2019Is Euclid\u2019s geometry the most convenient description of the world?\u2019\u2019, and the answer was no.
