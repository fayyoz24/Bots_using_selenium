    "summary": "I have a keen interest in human behavioral psychology and international relations. My life goal is to bring international attention to ethnic minorities which are being persecuted in their native land, such as the Kurds in Turkey, Armenians in Azerbaijan, and the White peoples of South Africa.\n\nMy aim is to make people think deeply about not just what beliefs they hold, but why they hold them are where the sources of their beliefs lie. In desiring to make people reflect upon the ideas and vales they hold as self-evident I aim to make my audience engage with themselves and spur them to evaluate their own beliefs critically.\n\nExperienced and capable in transforming even the sloppiest project team into a lean, mean, research machine. Studying Human Rights and International Relations at Radboud University and helping my fellow students with their own research projects as well as English and academic skills. Very keen on working with anybody interested in relieving human suffering, especially in the form of prejudice and racial discrimination. \nStraightforward, honest, compassionate, and personable personality, yet with a realistic and pragmatic worldview. Comes with an analytical mind and excellently honed supervisory skills. I can ensure plans are carried out effectively and efficiently while maintaining a friendly and open atmosphere. \nNot afraid to take charge if needed, but feel more at home in an executive supervisory position.\nGoal-driven, level-headed, justice-minded, resilient, and adaptable.\n\nI love to be challenged and have to think to overcome obstacles. I will never shy away from giving my honest opinion about anyone or anything, and expect everybody to do the same to me. I will never shy away from giving my honest opinion about anyone or anything, and expect everybody to do the same to me. I would like my colleagues to be serious, dedicated, and knowledgeable. I greatly prefer working with no-nonsense professionals who are good at separating work from their personal lives. I am at my best when working under pressure, thus tend to be attracted to stressful situations.",
