I systematically extracted all available heritability estimates of glaucoma and closely related traits from the literature and summarized the evidence by meta-analysis.  I did bioinformatic prioritization and functional annotation of glaucoma genes using previously identified genetic variants and bioinformatics databases. I prioritized 142 most likely causal genes for glaucoma, of which 64 were novel for glaucoma. I assessed the risk of autonomic dysregulation and blood pressure in glaucoma.  I also I developed and validated a myopia proxy, which was based on self-reported responses to distance/near vision status and the reason for and/or age at first glass use. With the proxy, I was able to identify myopic people with reasonable high accuracy.",

RTC is the second leading cause of death in developing countries and it affects the economically active population group. My interest stems from the fact that although developing countries have the lowest number of vehicles, the number of death and the economic loss due to RTC is disproportionately higher. I conducted an observational study to identify risk factors among taxi drivers (short distance riders) and forward take-home message for stakeholders. Under the supervision of my promotors, I was responsible for all levels of the research work; starting from data collection (fieldwork), data analysis, interpretation and thesis writing.",
