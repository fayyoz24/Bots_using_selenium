Tiny optical probes penetrate into the tissue and provide high resolution imaging with the use of modern computational techniques. The performance of fiber-based imaging highly depends on the quality of the fiber. To ensure this quality the end of an optical fiber is observed with an optical microscope and checked if the cut is clean. In this project an low-cost optical microscope for fast and accurately imaging of the fibers is designed and build. The microscope works with different types of bare fibers from conventional single- and multimode probes to custom designed photonic crystal fibers.",

These applications are processed manually, which is a very slow and biased process. That is why PitchDrive requested an algorithm that labels the strength of a founder with a score from zero to one. To get this \"score\" a decision tree was used which filters out the most important features which were then put into a logistic regression algorithm who ranks the founder strength from zero to one.",
