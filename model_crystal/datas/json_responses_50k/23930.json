    "summary": "I completed a Master of Human-Technology Interaction (HTI) from TU Eindhoven this summer. I switched my interest from Mechatronics, my Bachelor's program, to HTI, as my Master's program. Because I wanted to see more connections and possibilities between technology and humans. I found myself more interested in solving practical problems that people have or will have when they use a service or product. \n\nDuring the study of the master's program, I gained experience in both qualitative research and quantitative research, such as focus groups, interviews, surveys, user tests, statistic analyses in Stata, etc. I also got used to working in a multicultural environment with people of different specialized backgrounds. I've been exposed to multidisciplinary domains, for example, psychology, psychophysiology, cognitive engineering, perception, and of course, UX design. This knowledge, at a theoretical level, has made me more aware of the close connection between humans and technology and the infinite possibilities. I applied these knowledge to my projects and look forward to more practical opportunities in the future to convert theory into REAL innovations and improvements. \n\nInvolving people in the development of a product is appealing to me. Scenarios, stories, inspiration, surprise, satisfaction, confusion, and difficulties that occur between humans and technology are motivations that prompt me into the UX field.  I love immersing myself in the process of digging, observing, and investigating the habits and needs of users. I enjoy seeking out novelty when facing new tasks or challenges. Seeing users from their past to the future and improving user experience with technology services will always be a challenging and fulfilling journey for me. I am open to a job related to UX as a starting point of my career.",

I cooperated with the LGBTQ+ community at TU/e to include diverse gender identities in this project. \nThree focus groups with people of different gender identities were conducted online and each of them lasted at least 60 minutes, the longest one lasted for about 90 minutes. These online discussions provided me with 77 pages of transcriptions (after transcribing, correcting, and formatting).

We aimed to develop a personalized and AI-driven dinner recipe recommendation application that allows users to maximally use leftover ingredients in their pantry and fridge. We discussed the features for the application and I took the charge of data mining and documentation because I had more background knowledge about statistics. I used WEKA (a software for operating machine learning) as a starting point to understand machine learning and acquire skills in dealing with data. With the collected data, first I merged two datasets: the user profile dataset and the interaction log dataset. Then, I cleaned up these data. For example, removing incomplete instances, attributes without significant variations, re-grouping some numeric data to reduce dimensions and making the data to be more evenly distributed. I tested the data with different kinds of algorithms (e.g., J48, RandomForest, ZeroR) and selected suitable predictors to achieve decent and reasonable predicting results. The final prototype presents users with personalized recipe recommendations after submitting their personal profiles and offers a functionality to filter the datasets on their available ingredients.\n\nIn this project I...\n- Discussed and constructed the conceptual interaction interface with teammates\n- Created fake persona to add more variation to user profile attributes within the collected datasets\n- Employed machine learning algorithms on the data through Weka to establish a prediction model suitable for integration in the application\n- Gained an initial understanding of machine learning and got acquainted with some algorithms\n\nTools: Weka (Machine Learning), Xtensio (User Persona)\nSkills: Data Mining, User Test, Machine Learning (Weka), Application Design (framework)",

The target users are mainly two kinds of people: technicians in factory (i.e., admins) and farmers (i.e., users). They would have different needs for the website, thus I differentiated and diverted them at login, navigating them to the corresponding site frames. For example, admins had to have a holistic view of the products all over different regions, therefore, I arranged the Failures Summary module in the framework for admins and also allowed them to sort by failure types and regions. For users, it would be helpful if they could have the guidance or manual when their machines break down because in this way they could deal with the problem by their own. Hence, I set up a Troubleshooting module for the users and also have a page of Contact in case users could not solve the problem after their own try.\n\nIn this Project, I...\n- Analyzed the functional needs of the website for different target groups\n- Developed a website with a simple interface and the ability to communicate with the back-end database\n- Separated these functions into small modules and designed the web layout\n- Connected some parts of the front-end to the database via PHP file, and after searching and comparing data, leaded to different types of homepages (i.e., for admins or users) or displays the required information\n- Used PHP Data Objects (PDO) to connect to the database and transfer the corresponding data by distinguishing the device name\n- Used Echarts to visualize the data\n\nTools: Wampserver, Dreamweaver, Navicat, ECharts\nSkills: Web develop, Data visualization",

I worked with two teammate for two weeks, from defining the problems to building the prototype and filming the video demonstration. \nIn details, the speech recognition function was divided into the voice recognition module embedded in the control terminal and the recognition APP installed in the phone. By collecting the user's voice information and reducing the environmental noise, the effective voice information was transformed into recognizable words and matched with the words in the waste sorting phrases library. After the voice recognition information was successfully matched with the words in the library, the specific information was transmitted to the control terminal, and the information was transmitted to the human-computer interaction system to complete the voice interaction by making the specific voice response audible through the speaker. The control terminal controlled the corresponding mechanical structure after receiving the specific signal to make the right trash can lid open, and waited for the user to put the waste in the trash can. The device could be equipped with an induction system to close the lid automatically or close the lid after command was recognized.\n\nIn this project I...\n- Developed the application used for speech recognition via Bluetooth connection\n- Draw the circuit simulation in Proteus\n- Design the prototype, including connections between each part, props and the scenario\n- Filmed and edited the video demonstration, combining stop motion with mock up scenario to make the presentation more entertained\n\nTools: Arduino, Adobe Premiere, Proteus\nSkills: Application develop, Video editing",
