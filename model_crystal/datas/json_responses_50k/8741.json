    "summary": "Dear network, \n\nWelcome on my page. My name is Noa Rijnenberg and I am 20 years old. I was born in Almere, but have been living in Enschede which is both in the Netherlands. My native language is Dutch, but I have chosen to write in English on this platform. My key skills are taking initiative, being disciplined and being interested. My goal is to bring out the best in myself and see where my limits are. My working career started at the age of 12.  Not because it was necessary, but because I really wanted to do something. \n\nCurrently, I am a second year student at Saxion Enschede University of Applied Sciences. I am studying commercial economics and specialized in concept marketing. I am also a class representatie and was able to pass my propaedeutic in one time.\n\n",
