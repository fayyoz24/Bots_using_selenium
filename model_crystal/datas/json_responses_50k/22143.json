    "summary": "Sukumar Daniel, an innovative architect and strategist, has long dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge and the propagation of groundbreaking ideas in technology based service delivery in enterprises.\n\nUnrestricted by convention, he is a driving force for innovation, embracing emergent systems and championing for a data-centric world.\n\nKnown for his advocacy for Emergent Operating Models (EOMs), Sukumar's vision is for businesses to transition from static structures to more dynamic, flexible ones. Drawing parallels from nature, particularly a butterfly's metamorphosis, he navigates companies through the intricate process of evolution in the face of constant change.\n\nAs a prominent voice for data centricity, Sukumar propounds a radical shift from application-focused methods to prioritizing the preservation of Event data in imutable streams. He views data as the enduring essence of business, transcending the temporary lifespan of applications, to drive long-term growth, real-time decision-making, and taking innovative leaps in technology.\n\nSukumar has articulated these thoughts and strategies through numerous LinkedIn articles, inviting and facilitating thoughtful discussions on these subjects. His work emphasizes the value of data streams, the significance of breaking free from application constraints, and the transformative journey of Emergent Operating Models.\n\nIn the next chapter of his career, Sukumar sees himself continuing in the roles of coach and evangelist, promoting continuous evolution and embracing the data-centric paradigm. His passion is to inspire the young and experienced alike, fostering an environment that encourages mutual growth and the exchange of ideas. \n\nSukumar invites everyone to join him in shaping the future of business in the digital era.",
