    "summary": "\u27a4Born and raised in Pakistan, graduated from Singapore, and studying and working in Europe, I am on a mission to contribute towards a more sustainable and inclusive world. \n\n\u27a4Currently, I am a doctoral researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology, trying to uncover how the governance of current energy systems can transition into more collaborative and regional forms in the future. I also speak, consult and advocate on climate change and open science, and write about peak performance.\n\n\u27a4Previously, I have; completed a double degree master in Sustainable Energy and a bachelor in mechanical engineering; taught at a high school; taken a sabbatical of 8 months to travel around Asia to discover my passions; and worked as a mechanical engineer in the transport sector.  \n\n\u27a4I am a big believer of lifelong self-development, continuous learning, welcoming change, and empowering others for the same. I also routinely obsess over politics, history, culture, adventure traveling, big tech, stocks, cricket, and coffee. \n\nIf any of the above sounds interesting, let's connect and have a nice cup of coffee?",
