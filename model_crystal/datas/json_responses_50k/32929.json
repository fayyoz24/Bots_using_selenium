The idea behind these systems is to delay ships capsizing and prevent human casualties. If the ship can stay afloat and stable for a longer period of time, people can be rescued on board is the basic concept. \n\nThese systems are not yet designed and MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) and SARC gave us the task as project group to engineer a feasible concept design for such system. We made this feasible concept and concluded the thesis with a 9.0 on average!",

So that came with a lot of fun, but also with a lot of troubles (from not having electricity for days, to washing my clothes myself by hand). I experienced the good and bad sides of the business world, but also to bridge the gap between different cultures at the workplace. Besides I learned to come up with creative solutions to problems, since we had to change our plans often. In the end it were three wonderful months, with a lot of lessons, fun and a project to be proud of.",
