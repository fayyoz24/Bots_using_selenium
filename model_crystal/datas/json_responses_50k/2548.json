As the President of the club, I could hone in on my leadership skills and not only create an active membership of 20 scholars, but also raise enough money to support a soup kitchen on a monthly basis for orphaned children in Windhoek. To market the club to my fellow scholars, I spoke regularly at school events and was also invited to speak to the Windhoek Rotarians. These achievements were recognised by the Head of Examination Deputy Assistant of the Ministry of Education in Germany and I was awarded the prestigious prize for \u201cOutstanding Social Engagement\u201d. These activities show that I am organised and although I am committed to academic work, also want to expand on further opportunities outside of my studies. "
