The app makes it easy to select the time and place you just need to create a prioritized list of friends and send the invitation. What if your selected friend does not see the invitation? Don\u2019t worry. You can set a time limit after which the invitation will erase itself and will automatically go to the following friend on the list. In case your friend denies meeting the invitation will straight away go to the following friend on the list and it will do so until one of your friends agrees to meet you at the time and place you have suggested. Save your time and meet more with Hang Around!",
