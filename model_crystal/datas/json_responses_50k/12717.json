    "summary": "Washed dishes in the North-Brabant province (Breda, Avans University and Tilburg, Fontys University) while recovering from a burnout. I'm still recovering currently. \n\nIn 2016 I graduated under the northern lights while working on cellulose chemistry and completed the Biobased Chemistry BSc at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda. \n\nNow I\u2019m 28 and I\u2019m, next to webdesign and dishwashing, looking for way(s) to combine my fair and sustainable excitements. \n\nI\u2019ve many passions, including decentralization via local currency, ecovillages, circular economy, local products and energy via biobased chemistry, turning waste into \u201cthe new gold\u201d and so on, and so on...! \n\nI'm the one who's always positive and excited, because I know for sure that the future is shining bright. I'm convinced that beautiful and valuable dreams create reality! We're along for the ride!",
