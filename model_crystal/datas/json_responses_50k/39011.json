    "summary": "I am an Assistant Professor at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, and a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Appearance Research in the United Kingdom. \n\nAs a researcher, my key mission is to improve the way that people think and feel about their own body. My research projects are centred around this aim. They focus primarily on investigating (1) how negative body image is caused and maintained; (2) how people can develop and maintain a positive body image; and (3) intervention techniques for fostering a more positive body image. My research techniques span both quantitative and qualitative methods.  \n\nAt Maastricht University, I am also the coordinator of Mind Your Body, a course in the Bachelor of Psychology concerning body image research. In addition, I am an Associate Editor for Body Image: An International Journal of Research, and a consultant for EVERYBODY Consulting and for Meta.",

Negative body image is a public health concern because it has serious consequences for both physical and psychological health. Yet, existing body image interventions have only small effects. Therefore, this project aims to develop effective approaches to improving body image. I propose that body image can be effectively improved by focusing on body functionality (i.e., what the body can do, rather than how it looks). Specifically, I predict that focusing on body functionality improves body image via increased (i) body-complexity: the number of distinct aspects that comprise the body-concept; and (ii) body-self integration: the degree of integration between the body-concept and self-concept. Two randomised controlled trials will be conducted in women with a negative body image (Study 1) and women with rheumatic disease (Study 2). I will conduct the project at the Centre for Appearance Research in Bristol (England), the only centre in the world that specialises in body image research. This project will provide insight into novel mechanisms of body image improvement and could offer a feasible new approach for body image intervention. ",
