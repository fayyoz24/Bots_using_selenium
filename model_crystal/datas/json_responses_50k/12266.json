    "summary": "Content Manager at Alpine Hearing Protection. I'm very passionate about all things related to the media we consume, especially the ways in which we connect with them. I'm also a huge sports and music nerd on the side- I even produce my own songs for fun and go to concerts on a very frequent basis. I'm deeply invested in a wide variety of things, ranging from gaming and politics to fashion and skin care, and even scuba diving. I'm a quick learner who becomes enthusiastic and energetic about new things very quickly.  I like to bring this energy to the teams that I collaborate with and use my love for knowledge to continually improve myself and my work. \n\nI have experience creating content for a wide variety of purposes, including social media copies, internal communications, and online marketplace/ webshop material. I also have experience with editing videos, photography, and using Photoshop. My core competencies lie in using data and insights to identify opportunities, as well as creating communication materials that resonate and engage audiences.",
