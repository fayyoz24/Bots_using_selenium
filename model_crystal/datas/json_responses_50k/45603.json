    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my LinkedIn! \n\nWho am I?\n\nI am born and grew up in Amsterdam, went to school in France and Belgium, and I have obtained  two degrees in International Business Administration with a specialisation in Finance from KEDGE and KU Leuven. \n\nNow, I am pursuing a Masters in Finance & Banking at KU Leuven. I am super passionate about technology, social good, and the economic machine.\n\nAt this very moment, I am leveraging my status as a student to learn, absorb, and experience many social or professional experiences which has proven to me in the past that this is the most effective and fun way to develop both as a human and as a financial analyst in spe.\n\nOn top of that, I am the proud co-founder of Merit Gear which specialises in custom bikepacking gear, backed by the Daniel Carasso KEDGE Business Accelerator. With various collaborations, our gear can be found in up to 40 countries.\n\nI believe that combining my passion for adventurous bicycle riding and my sense of social responsibility with a business degree in global scope makes me a great asset in any (business) environment and team.\n\nMathew is an out-of-the box-thinker, passionate about matching solutions with expectations, desires and dreams.",
