    "summary": "Mt PhD research is  finished June 17th 2019. I love to put my scientific knowledge in practice in a dynamic working environment in cooperation with  colleagues. Learning about new work related topics or people is what suits me. That's why I choose to do a PhD after my Masters degree. Because I'm really dedicated to what I'm working on I relax by reading a book or I exercise and play tennis. I love to read crime, English or American, and forget about time. \n\nWhen I was in high school I played tennis regionally and I helped at the local club on Friday afternoon with the 'Friday afternoon children' activities. Due to my love for sport and my experiences with helping children I went to Groningen to become a gymnastics teacher (Hanzehogeschool). I started to work in this field in Enschede at 5 different elementary schools, teaching about 500 children per week. After two years working full time I chose to stop working and study Biology (Radboud University). During these 5,5 years I discovered my interest in research during my internships. I can still dream about western blotting  at the Cell Biology lab together with my supervisor. after mij MSc I found a PhD position at the Utrecht University in the group of Johan Garssen.\n\nDuring my PhD I had the opportunity to visit several congresses to present some of my work, in the Netherlands (EMIG, FIGON) but also to Istanbul (EAACI), Davos (WIRM) and Dublin (EMIG). The last congres (FIGON) I won the second prize for my poster presentation. At these congresses there are so many opportunities to meet other scientists and discuss work or new ideas. Going to congresses is also great because I got to experience other cultures. I always tried to extend my stay for a day or two to see local (touristic) highlights. \n\nI was a (assistent) teacher for several courses during my Research Master In Nijmegen and during my PhD in Utrecht for two different courses. I love research and teaching.\n\nSince May 2019 I work for Driestroom as a 'personal care taker' (ZBO) to help children with any kind of difficulties  they have during school. I offer assistance during class  in the region Arnhem-Nijmegen, for gymnastics and other school work. I try to  travel to and from work by bike. \n\nFor the elementary school my children visit, I gave the gymnastics for almost two years voluntary during the school's start-up period from 2018-2020. Currently I'm an active member for the youth committee of the tennis ub T.V. de Hoge Wick.",

Other researchers have already shown that these non-digestible oligosaccharides can significantly decrease CMA in this mouse model (Schouten, van Esch, de Kivit). We used 3 different structures (GOS/FOS/AOS) with or without Bifido Breve, a beneficial bacterium for our intestine to diminish the allergic effect. To gain insight in the mechanism behind the protective effect of the non digestible oligosaccharides, I\n- compared single oligosaccharides to GOS/FOS and GOS/FOS/AOS\n- used antibodies to inhibit the preventive effect of GFA\n- investigated the effect of GFA in a vaccination model\n- Evaluated the effect of GFA in combination with vitamin A or vitamin D on Cow's Milk Allergy\n\n$ week olk mice are subjected to a cow's milk challenge via an intradermal injection in the ear. Anaphylaxis, body temperature and ear thickness are measured. Subsequently serum of blood, the intestine tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and sometimes even bone marrow are investigated using ELISA, FACS, restimulation assays, PCR and qPCR, cell culture and histology. With these techniques we tried to decipher what occurs in innate and adaptive immunity focussing on dendritic cells and T cell interaction. Most of the experiments were done in collaboration with colleagues and interns, so a maximal result could be obtained from one study.\n\nMy PhD position also required teaching for our department Pharmacology, this was a pleasure for me  to do. The first two years I assisted in the first year course Cell Biology and the third year I assisted in the third year course Immunology. And last but not least I was a member of the 'Infection&Immunity' board, which organised the education for the PhDs and MSc.",
