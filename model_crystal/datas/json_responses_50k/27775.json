The system consists of Anaerobic / Aerobic / Anoxic / MBR and disinfection steps. \n \nKubota have trained the Sustainable Engineering Consulting team to design, implement, construct and maintain the MBR units in accordance with their international standards. \n\nThe treated effluent discharge quality will exceed General Standards to be recycled for process and wash water.\n",
