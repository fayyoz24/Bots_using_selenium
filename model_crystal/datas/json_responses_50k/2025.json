I am interested in the relationship of forms and functions in mass productions; how the form appeared because of function but not only aesthetic. I was wondering how they work and how people use or misuse them. During the research I questioned what jewelry can be and its characters, and compared jewellery with other ready-mades. My practice is combined these daily objects with jewellery, focus on the tensions between \"sense an",

However, its form, its motifs and its material imitate Chinese porcelain and pagoda.\nI began this project to continue the process of replicating and transforming which is the history of Tulip Pyramid. I wanted to explore the question of \u2018creativity in copying\u2019 and the question of identity.\nIf a Tulip Pyramid were to be imitated in nowadays China - a country which is a mixture of common and private ownership, of collectivism and individualism, troubled by the issue of counterfeiting and appropriating intellectual property - what would result be? I invited five young Chinese designers from different design disciplines, to reflect the culture and the history of imitation and innovation. They each designed two layers of the pyramid. I claim ownership of the final product together with these five designers, to further explore the intellectual property of this object.\nI see myself as a Tulip Pyramid. My origins are in China and I\u2019ve been transformed in the Netherlands. What does that make me?\nThe education in the Netherlands gave me another perspective of design. I found a flexible area outside the practice of design for mass-production, using my personal experience to ask questions about mass-production in a design discourse. For a second pyramid, I imitated and mixed up famous Dutch designers\u2019 iconic works with my former works, to question their influence and the institution that formed me.\nGraduation is the starting point of this long term project. I expect that in the future, this project will keep growing and developing.",
