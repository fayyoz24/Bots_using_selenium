    "summary": "I am a graduate student from South Africa and have just completed  pursuing a International Bachelor of Arts and Culture at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am a creative and ambitious individual with a passion for (Influencer)marketing and PR, and I am excited to share my experiences with you.\n\nI have acquired a range of skills in written and verbal communication, content creation, influencer and social media marketing. In my current role as an Influencer Marketing specialist at Snuggs  and my previous experience as a PR assistant at MVRDV, I have developed a strong understanding of how to create successful influencer marketing campaigns that deliver results. Additionally, as a member of the external events committee of the New Fashion Society, I have learned how to plan and execute large-scale events that increase association reputation and build connections among professionals in the fashion industry.\n\nAs a student of the creative industries, I gained  a solid foundation in understanding cultural and creative industries, as well as the key actors and stakeholders involved. My experience as an intern and assistant has given me a desire to learn and continue growing in my career. I am energetic, determined, and ready to take on new challenges in a full-time position.\n\nIf you are looking for a dynamic and driven individual with a fresh perspective on marketing, I am the perfect candidate for you. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to help your team achieve and exceed their objectives. Let's connect and explore how my professional and personal profile can benefit your organisation.\n\n Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",
