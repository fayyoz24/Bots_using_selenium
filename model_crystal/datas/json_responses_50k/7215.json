    "summary": "Born and raised in Aruba, a small island in the Caribbean, I came to the Netherlands to pursue a degree in higher education in 2017. Since then, I have earned a Bachelor degree (cum laude) in International Studies with a focus on East Asia and a minor in Safety, Security and Justice, and a Master's degree in International Relations with a specialization in Global Political Economy, both from Leiden University. \n\nIn addition, I've also spent most of my university years working with Model United Nations of the Hague as the Under Secretary General of Media Creation, while also volunteering for Beyond South America in a similar role. \n\nI am currently planning to take an advanced writing course in Dutch at the LOI to improve my writing abilities. \n\nMy areas of interest lie primarily in foreign relations and cooperation with a focus on Dutch - Asian and/or Caribbean affairs, international economics and politics, environmentalism, diplomacy and social justice.",
