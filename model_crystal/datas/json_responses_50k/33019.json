    "summary": "I am a Brazilian Forest Engineer and Lawyer, who came to the Netherlands for a master\u2019s degree in Development Studies. I took the Major in Agrarian, Food and Environmental Studies, because it connected both of my backgrounds, combining political sciences with the management of natural resources.\n\nI have a diverse set of professional experiences. Throughout my career I was given different roles and developed a wide range of expertise from operational, commercial, and business development fields, to project management and technical analysis (GIS; land regularization and social cadaster; topography; forest surveys; Environmental and Social Impact Assessments; and so forth). But among all things I've done what I like the most is connecting with people and institutions, creating synergies regardless of the position title or the project I was working with. \n\nI strive in collaborative environments, coordinating teams, negotiating to reach common ground, building relationships to foster intersectional interests, and liaising with internal and external stakeholders \u2013 apart from my solid environmental background. To apply those skills in favor of sustainable development initiatives is my purpose and passion. My philosophy is: \u2018do what you love, with presence and energy and generate positive impact\u2019.\n\nWith an entrepreneurial focus and due to my system thinking mindset, I developed an innovative and sustainable business model targeting ecosystem services and forest offsets at the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest (a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve), adding value to my clients\u2019 strategy while mitigating environmental impacts of deforestation and ensuring economic value for a preserved piece of tropical forest. This initiative was recognized amongst the Best Practices on Natural Capital Business Management in a national wide call of cases promoted by Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV), a Brazilian think tank.",

It started from a partnership between the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), the National Confederation of Industries (CNI), and the German Cooperation for Sustainable Development (GIZ), under the TEEB Regional-Local Project, with the Center for Sustainability Studies at Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation (FGVces), and it was also supported by the Boticario Group Foundation.\nThe business model I've created consists of an innovative initiative targeting tropical forest offsets, adding value to my clients\u2019 strategy while mitigating deforestation impacts and ensuring economic value for a preserved piece of tropical forest. I was pleased to be recognized amongst the 16 selected cases that showed how the management of natural capital creates value for companies and, at the same time, for the ecosystems they are part of. \n\nlink to the publication: http://www.p22on.com.br/en/2018/10/02/transacoes-naturais/",

We both had side projects: he was a University Professor, whereas I was ahead of the consulting company. Within Florestec I had positioned to focus on business-to-business relations, whereas in this law firm I was acting as a direct advisor focusing on individual interests in conflicting scenarios, such as farmers and rural landowners vs environmental rights. \n\nMy role was to provide both technical and legal advice on how to comply with the complex Brazilian environmental regulation, in subjects like the Forest Code (Federal Law), Atlantic rainforest and Cerrado legislation, Environmental fines, and Environmental Crime.\n\nAlso, through strategic partnerships, I performed as an independent expert for third-party firms, in the preparation of legal statements and opinions related to environmental law, climate change, working conditions & labor rights, and social housing rights. \n\nA good part of my work was to conduct legal research, collect pieces of evidence, draft documents and to prepare clear analytical reports. As a Lawyer, I also presented cases in the court environment and had to logically follow up the selected strategy and to support argumentation during trial procedures.\n\nI managed to successfully defend family farmers and rural producers in environmental criminal processes, mainly related to the occupation of wetlands and riparian areas, and harmful conduct against native forests and non-permitted occupation of protected sites, reaching fair environmental compensation measures through legal agreements supported by the Environmental Agency and Justice Departments.",
