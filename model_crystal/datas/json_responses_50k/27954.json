    "summary": "With over 30 years of experience in finance, accounting, and administration, I am a financial crime investigator at Holland Integrity Group (HIG), the leading independent investigation and advisory firm in the Netherlands in this specific area. I have a well-developed financial, entrepreneurial, and strategic vision, combined with an in-depth cross-cultural understanding and a passion for my clients.\n\nAt HIG, I manage the accounting and reporting functions for the group, and also conduct complex financial fraud investigations for profit and non-profit organisations. I help organisations to increase their resilience to misconduct and violations of integrity, to prevent and detect undesirable conduct and fraud, and to protect themselves, solve problems, and repair damage. During almost 4 years I was also a board member and treasurer at the foundation Centre for Organisational Integrity, where we promoted integrity compliance through education in their organisational structures and cultures. I am a Harvard alumnus and an anti-bribery and corruption specialist, with a strong drive for justice and moral courage. I am fluent in Dutch, Portuguese, and English.",
