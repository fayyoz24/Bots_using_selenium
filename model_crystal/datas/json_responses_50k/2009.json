To practically support these new mothers, the goal of this master thesis research is to identify the consumer needs for women in their postpartum period, especially taking into account the threat of postpartum depression. A Literature review, a customer survey, and interviews with experts were used to meet this goal. 105 mothers with children under three years old participated and completed the survey, while three experts were available for an interview. From the results, it can be concluded that 79% of the women would be interested in a food box especially for women in their postpartum period, as long as the meals are healthy, time-saving, and easy to prepare. Also, 70% might be interested in joining a supportive platform about the connection between nutrition and mental health.",
