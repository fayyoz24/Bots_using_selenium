    "summary": "After graduating with a bachelor\u2019s in Human Science (Communication). I became very interested in the communication field. This led me to strengthen my field and focus on mass communication. Therefore, My Master\u2019s degree was in Digital Film and TV. At the same time, I have been working on my own project in TV Production as a private business which strengthens my working experience in this field.\n\nIn addition to my solid theoretical understanding of mass communication and my practical experience, to strengthen my skills, I have attended several practical courses in media skills. So I have certificates in Filmmaking, Journalism, and in Public Relations.\n\nMy research and practical experience have given me a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of mass communication at different levels and from different perspectives.",
