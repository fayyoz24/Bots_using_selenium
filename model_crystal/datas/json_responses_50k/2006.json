Some you will know, others you might not- but all should be on your radar as kick ass women, who are the key driving forces behind top businesses. Women that will help shape the future and realise ground breaking innovation.\n\"These trailblazers, innovators and boss women play a major role in challenging the industry\u2019s norms of what makes a leader. The InspiringFifty are important role models for encouraging more girls and women in technology, as well as inspiring future leaders and entrepreneurs to follow in their footsteps. Role models must be seen to be truly effective\u2026 because seeing is believing. You can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\"",
