These settlements have an estimated total population of 80 000 inhabitants living in crude shacks without any sewerage, electricity, running water, garbage collection, healthcare or schools. A large percentage of the shacks house families with no adults. The eldest child, usually not older than 10 years of age, has to try and find food and also protect the younger children.\n\nThe Ukajede Foundation supports 9 cr\u00e8ches in this informal settlement; supplying each school with the means to prepare a warm meal for each child daily, stationery; cleaning material and maintenance assistance"
