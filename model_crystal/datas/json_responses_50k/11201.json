    "summary": "I'm a 22-year-old Portuguese student, currently based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. With 17 years spent in Portugal, my life was heavily steeped in academics and a variety of sports. My journey then took me to Dubai for two years, where I completed my International Baccalaureate at GEMS International School. It was here that my love for sports led me to become an assistant coach for the GIS Jaguar academy football team.\n\nNow residing in the Netherlands, I'm furthering my education at Erasmus University of Rotterdam. Alongside my studies, I work part-time at Vegan Junk Food and actively participate in university events with different student associations, such as serving as a guide during Eureka Week. I also proudly sit on the board of the Erasmus Portuguese Association's first team.\n\nTaking my passion for football with me, I've started a team with some friends to compete in the Dutch amateur league. My life journey is a blend of education, work, cultural exploration, and my love for sports, and I look forward to the opportunities and experiences ahead.",

These first year students that have just arrived to the Netherlands to start their university studies need to be provided with a warm welcome as they will live in this city and study at this University for the next couple years.\nIt was a very good experience to help these students create connection with others students and help them with any information they might need about how is it to live or study in the Netherlands.
