    "summary": "I recently earned a Master in Laws in European & International Human Rights Law at Leiden University. Prior to that I received my J.D. at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where I focused on criminal, constitutional, and international law, and worked in criminal defense at a student clinic. I have also completed online courses in International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Criminal Law (ICL). I am currently looking for a job in the United States in one of the following areas: IHL/ICL or other areas of public international law, criminal defense, discrimination law, constitutional rights, or human rights. I am interested in an entry-level attorney position, and am open to trial practice and working on appeals/habeas corpus.\n\nPrior to beginning my LLM program in Europe, I completed a dual program at Tulane University, receiving both my Juris Doctorate and my Master in Social Work. This allowed me to learn about the law, while also gaining a greater understanding of how the law affects people. I gained skills in legal research and writing, as well as community advocacy and case management. I learned about U.S. criminal law, constitutional law, international public law, and international human rights law, as well as how a nonprofit is organized and run and the effects of trauma on individuals. I chose to then study international law in Europe to gain a better perspective on how the U.S. legal system fits globally and how it can be improved. While my Masters program focused on International Human Rights law, I participated in Leiden's IHL legal clinic and interned at the U.N's International Residual Mechanism for  Criminal Tribunals in The Hague, gaining experience in IHL/ICL.",

I co-wrote a report, together with fellow students and under the supervision of a professor at Leiden University Law School, which was submitted to the Special Rapporteur.  \n\nI worked specifically on the report section regarding what policies digital technology companies- especially social media companies- have taken to combat disinformation. This included an analysis of the effectiveness of these policies on human rights, such as the freedom of expression, as well as how disinformation can lead to discrimination against minorities.  ",
