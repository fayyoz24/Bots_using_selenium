Together with my amazing co-founder, Kees van Voorthuizen, we built a fully-functional intranet from scratch \u2014 and peaked 170 signed-up students during our launch in September of 2019 at The International School of The Hague.  \n\nDespite positive feedback and numerous pivots, we eventually made the very difficult decision of putting the project at a halt as the risks and responsibilities outweighed the rewards for continuing (and sold our website domain). \n\nNevertheless, see below how Tribecamp's interface looked like when it was live!",
