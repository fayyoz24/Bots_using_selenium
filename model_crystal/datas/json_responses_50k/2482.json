    "summary": "www.carellanters.nl          \n\n\nCarel Lanters was educated at the Academy of Fine Art AKI in Enschede (1976-1981). During his education he initiated the department beyond matter (later: mixed media). His tutors were Sigurdur Gudmundson and Ad Gerritsen. By way of sublimation he intensifies observation. He is not locked in one technique or material. For some complicated situations he developed monumental works, but he also integrates his art in daily life by arranging street furniture in a new order. He develops experimental work; work for exhibitions and for the public space in which he also operates as a curator. He is married with the South Korean artist Lee Eun Young.\n                                              \nIn the publication \"CL\", Gerrit Willems writes concerning his work:\nAn artist may incorporate almost everything in his work: Nature, literature, dream images, trivial images of daily life or grand examples from art history, indeed anything. However, defining the inspiration of an artist does not bring us closer the secret of his art. The fact that certain images are a starting point does not entirely explain the final result, which evolves from an enigmatic and almost inaccessible process. We may have words in mind and express thoughts into words. It is as mysterious to have images in one\u2019s thoughts, as it is to express thoughts into images. A thought becomes an image and the image continues the thought, one might say (with a nod to Nijhoff, the Dutch poet). One image leads to another. That\u2019s what thinking is in visual art.",

            "description": "Cill na Seacht nInion, or the church of the Seven Daughters, is a puzzling site almost lost in a rocky landscape of small fields in Ceathru an Chaisleain south of O\u2019Brien\u2019s Castle on Inis Oirr, Ireland. The site seems to have been a circular cashel or stone fort modified as an ecclesiastical enclosure. In the southern part of the cashel there is a rectangular pile of dry masonry presumably a leacht or altar, or penitential station; several stones protruding through the grass nearby may mark graves. \nThree conjoined rectangular walled structures lie outside the line of the cashel wall on the east and the easternmost of these contains a tall cross-inscribed slab sadly broken into three pieces in or about the late 1979s. The cross itself is a simple two-line Latin cross with a ringed head, but it is represented as standing on a more or less rectangular base, the sides of which are formed by two smaller crosses. this may be an echo of the custom of flanking a large cross with two smaller ones representing those of the two thieves.\nAlmost nothing is known about the Seven daughters though there is a tradition that they were the daughters either of a British or a Leinster king: the memory of their collective name and these stony remnants are all that survives here. However, their cult was fairly widespread in Connemara where a number of holy wells bear the name Tobar na Seacht nInion. One other site on Inis oirr with female associations is the so-called Cathair na mBan (\u2018the fort of the woman\u2019) which is located near the late 18th century signal tower (one of a number on the western coasts built to warn of a French invasion) south of O\u2019Brien\u2019s Castle. Far from being a fort Cathair na mBan appers to be a ruined circular cairn about 13m across; it may possibly be a prehistoric hill-top cairn. \n\nProposal for casting the cross in bronze and installing it on top of a wall near the site. It is an artistic research by Carel Lanters. ",

Work and presentation period Jan, Feb, Mar. 2023\n\nDuring a first walk in the border area near Beek (NL) and Elten (D), the area where both artists have their roots, they ended up in the old church in Hoog-Elten. There they saw the image of St. Machutus; a 12th century sculpture of Mary and child, of which the head was replaced in the 17th century by a man\u2019s head: St Machutus. Reason for Lucas and Carel to model this representation; modeling the body and head separately from each other and then placing them on top of each other. At the same location they found a stump sticking out of the ground that they knew associatively would be of great importance; Pulled out of the ground and inverted, it turned out to be a new representation of Machutus. For this they made a reliquary: 3 caps of plaster which partly encompass the stump and represent the space of an invisible head.\nhttps://carellanters.nl/projecten/das-wasser-fliest-die-grenze-entlang/?lang=en",
