    "summary": "Since September 2022 I am studying in The Netherlands (Nijmegen) Arts and Culture. In the meantime, I would like to use my skills in a job in The Netherlands.\n\nI have been interested in arts since I was a child, it has always played a huge role in my life. Already in kindergarten, I went to drawing competitions and singing competitions, and I usually achieved excellent places in them. I also continued my elementary school studies at an art school, where I majored in drawing and later in dance. I studied dance 14 hours a week, so thanks to that we won various ballroom dance competitions with our dance team. I also went to music school, learned to play the piano, and continued to participate in singing competitions. I continued my studies at Herman Ott\u00f3 High School in Miskolc, which is one of the most prestigious secondary schools in Hungary. I took part in five years of Spanish training, as a result of which, in addition to my C1 English language exam, I also passed the C1 Spanish language exam. Despite the fact that I did not receive an art education during my high school years, my interest in art did not decrease, and I even immersed myself in certain fields of art. I started learning light music as well as classical singing, with which I won several competitions. In addition, in my third year of high school, I won the Drama OKTV, and in my fourth year, the Art History OKTV. The OKTV (Orsz\u00e1gos K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Tanulm\u00e1nyi Verseny) is the most prestigious high school competition in Hungary, so its winners are preferred by universities during admission procedures. As far as we know, there has never been an example of someone getting an OKTV from two different subjects.",
