    "summary": "Feel free to message me public funding for technological innovations. \n\nMy drive is to trigger and capitalize on innovations across both public and private stakeholders. I am naturally curious about how technology works, implicates and empowers various SME's, enterprises, governments - and on a lower scale - departments, business units, employees and communities. I find myself having a cause when I identify shared goals that are urgent and important, but are often overlooked by myriads of (often valid) reasons. My approach then is to decompose the problem analytically and be systematic, and at the same time be open and humble. \n\nI have a specialization in Governance and (Information) Technology, as such I am interested in solving problems related to: \n- Big Data innovations, such as in the field of Cyber Security by applying Machine Learning.\n- CO2 innovations, such as a CO2 Smart Grid, afforestation policies (Bos \u00e9n Hout), Power to Gas (eg. for Offshore Windfarms), Solar PV solutions, Zero-Emission housing, Bio/Green gas, circular economy for waste incineration plants. Interests mostly sparked by experiences with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n- Soft spot for the combination of the two: \u201cBig Data for Climate\u201d.\n\nKey competence: \n- Trend and market research, actor and stakeholder analysis, goal analysis, systems engineering, data analytics (statistics, machine learning, decision trees, neural networks), transition management, process and project management, (multiple) case studies, business models, idea creation, business process model and notation, data workflow diagram, enterprise architecture modeling language, and computer simulations.\n\nParticularly involved in the Dutch R&D law (e.g. WBSO) and European innovation grants, such as INTERREG and the Horizon2020-SME instrument.",
