    "summary": "On March 1st 2022, I became the Chief Technology Officer at Optica, the leading organisation for advancing optics and photonics worldwide. The reason I chose Optica is simple - It\u2019s a perfect match. That's even more so in 2023. We have embarked on the Optica Global tour to connect industries in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. \n\nOptica's industry program ranges from large events like OFC to deep-dive, focused technology discussions, Executive Forums, online and/or face-to-face, with every link in the value chain. We regularly update you on what's coming up in this Linkedin feed.  \n\nOptica Industry meetings have no hierarchy. If you are one of the executives attending, you will have equal opportunity to do business, whether you represent one of our largest members or a single start-up/scale-up.\n\nIf we have connected, you already have my Optica e-mail address and mobile number. Based in Europe, I would encourage you to reach out. The biggest reward I get is genuine smiles on people's faces after they close a deal.\n\nThere\u2019s not enough space in a LinkedIn summary to be comprehensive about exactly what I do together with brilliant Optica colleagues. I am constantly amazed at the growing number of friends both photonics and quantum optics who are willing to engage. Perhaps I can help as a trusted troubleshooter or strategic thinker? If so, please connect soon! Onward!",

That includes:\n\u2022\tthe impact of a global chip shortage and the various regional Chip Acts that are emerging\n\u2022\tthe continuous search for qualified talent, \n\u2022\taccess to affordable and trustworthy market data (In 2023, Optica has vastly improved its service to corporate members in this regard),\n\u2022\tselecting the right investors at the right time, \n\u2022\taccess to test-before-invest technologies,\n\u2022\teffectively promoting your products and services by clarifying your unique selling points, \n\u2022\tengaging with relevant young startups for partnership, investment or acquisition,\n\u2022\tand last but not least, (actually most important), engaging with the end-users. \nEverything my team and I do in Optica's industry program is intended to advance solutions to those challenges. Remember that any meetings I am involved in will have no hierarchy.  If you are one of the executives attending, you will have equal opportunity to do business, whether representing one of our largest corporates or a breakthrough scale-up. If you also find navigating through the sea of PR difficult, remember that what matters is meeting the right people at the right time!

Establishment of a Chaotic Communication Link using QD Twin Stripe Lasers. \nUnder the supervision of Prof. Daan Lenstra, dean of the faculty of Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at TU Delft. I worked towards establishing an open space chaotic encrypted communication link. During this project, I designed, fabricated and characterised Quantum Dot-based twin stripe lasers (laterally coupled Fabry-Perot lasers). The evanescence coupling between the stripes enables these devices to work in a chaotic regime. Two of these devices can synchronise, generating a chaotic carrier wave that can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. \n\nThe work related to chaos was used in several renowned publications.\n\n2. Production of an integrated tunable laser using filtered feedback. Between 2007 and 2010, I collaborated on the design, fabrication and characterisation of a novel and fastest-to-date integrated tunable laser for telecom and sensing applications, in which 2ns switching operations have been measured. The device used an integrated Fabry-Perot cavity with deeply etched DBR mirrors, an AWG that filters several Fabry-Perot modes, and several SOA gates at the outputs of the AWG to select a mode and feed it back into the cavity, forcing single mode operation. In this project, the theoretical aspects \u2013 filtered feedback simulations- were carried out at Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium, while the experimental and fabrication work was done at TU Eindhoven. I was also in charge of guaranteeing collaborative interaction between both teams. \n\nThis project gave me excellent experience in the scientific community involved with Photonic Integrated Circuits and tunable lasers.",
