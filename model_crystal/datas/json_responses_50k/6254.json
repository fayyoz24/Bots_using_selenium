    "summary": "Kaide Gonzalez is a Swedish/Chilean dancer, who specialises in House and Hip Hop dance. He started his professional training at \u00c5sa Folkh\u00f6gskola in Sweden and this is where he deepened his knowledge of the different street dance styles by attending: Five Styles (2009-2010), Hip Hop One Style (2014-2015), House One Style (2016-2018). His dance is described as playful, creative, unpredictable and grounded while enjoying the exploration of the information his body holds. \n\nIn 2018 he moved to Amsterdam, The Netherlands to study a Dance Teacher education at the Academy of Theatre and Dance. Alongside this he frequently participates in battles internationally and have been teaching at various places, both in Sweden and The Netherlands. \n\nHe has been working with the company CCNRB/Black Sheep in France as a dancer in the performance \u2018Earthbound\u2019 which is still ongoing. And most recently, he was a co-choreographer of a performance called \u2019Striving to be(come)\u2019 which was performed during Malm\u00f6 Dance Week.\n\nAs a dancer and future choreographer, Kaide aims to be free from labels while being mindful of, but not limited by the Hip Hop dance experience that he has gathered in his career. He intrigued by the notion of an \u2018\u2019in-between\u2019\u2019 and wants to invite his audience to experience something that disregards genres. For him the training and technique of the dancer is there to establish links between the memory of the body and its presence. Therefore, he researches movement by stripping his dance from certain elements of Hip Hop while influencing the movement language through the use of tools from contemporary dance and movement practice that he has interpreted and translated in order to see what comes out of it. He is currently developing his own movement practice that lays the foundation for his dance, which he calls \u2018Leviathan Flow\u2019. \n",
