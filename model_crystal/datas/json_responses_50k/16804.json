    "summary": "I aspire to be a leader and an explorer within the field of wildlife conservation. Living abroad for 20 years, in a country with a different social, cultural, economic, and environmental context and values, has encouraged me to explore and gain a better understanding of the conservation problems at hand. This background I believe, has allowed me to view conservation situations in a broader and more open-minded way, and continues to motivate me to explore the various ontologies that exist in how conservation is viewed and carried out, in order to find ways and solutions that would benefit both people and nature.\n\nI feel driven by purpose, curiosity, passion, commitment, dedication, and the drive to create change by spearheading conservation action through science and public engagement. I believe sharing stories in tandem with scientific research, experiences, and photography and film, has the power to enhance our collective awareness of the beauty of nature but it also exposes the harsh realities and the catastrophic problems at hand in the field of conservation. I believe, however, that at the fork of the dichotomy, lies a void that is to be filled by inspiring and creative ideas and solutions. A void, that not only encourages a new way of thinking, but a void that also encourages us to reflect and to rekindle our connection with ourselves and with nature, thereby bringing about concrete change. I hope to inspire and engage other young conservationists, whilst giving a voice to nature and wildlife and in so doing, propelling conservation research and solutions for the betterment of humanity, and nature.",

This alone, is enough to show the significance of individual identification. Given the numerous anthropogenic threats elephants face, the unique management problems that arise from confining elephants within fenced reserves, the economic and the environmental impact elephants have, data derived from individual identifications is invaluable to monitoring trends and patterns of Loxodonta africana numbers across spatial and temporal scales, in assisting management decisions and in gaining insight into aspects important for the welfare of elephants. \nThe code is an approach, but also a tool to ease the process of identification. As it comprises information on the identifying features that make an individual unique, using the code limits observe bias, one of the main factors that can make the code redundant. In re-defining the terminology of a nick and the addition of a term to indicate the magnitude of the identifying features observed, will further limit observer bias and improve the robustness and the practical applicability and effectivity of the identification code in field studies. As a search tool function, the code also aids with data organization and management, crucial to long-term monitoring. With this being said, it is strongly considered that elephant populations under study are individually identified first, given the vast number of ecological questions that can be investigated that are otherwise difficult or even impossible to examine.",

The remote rainforests of Central Borneo offer a fascinating opportunity to study hybridisation as herein is found, a hybrid gibbon - a cross between two subspecies Hylobates albibarbis and Hylobate muelleri. The hybrid was discovered in 1979 and one of the least well studied primate species in the world. Using bioacoustics, I am to conduct a vocal analysis on the female gibbons great call to establish a quantitative basis through vocal analysis that will allow for the identification of hybrid gibbon groups. The singing behaviour in gibbons is the primary way they communicate with their mates, identify conspecifics, and defend their territories. Therefore, in addition to establishing a quantitative basis for recognising hybrids, I will use calls to derive key conservation metrics such as population distribution and density estimates, while comparing vocal parameters between groups across a spatial and temporal scale. \n\nThis research is conducted in collaboration with Universitas Gadjha Mada.",

We conducted pilot community workshops, educational programmes and elephant behaviour and identification surveys. The aim of this trip was to test, revise and improve these activities and to establish standardised and structured protocols for data collection. Educational programmes were implemented and conducted in a way that empowered the communities, with local leaders playing a central role in the ideation and implementation of these activities at schools and communities. Lastly, the goal was to establish an inventory of the identified Forest Savannah Elephants at Kariega Game Reserve and develop a long-term educational strategy that would enhance and empower community-based conservation."
