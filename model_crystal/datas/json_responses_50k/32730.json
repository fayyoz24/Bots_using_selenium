    "summary": "There are multiple things that matter a lot in life. Of course you have the obvious, like family and friends, but people tend to forget how important it is to work on their personal skills. It is extremely important to work on softskills like international communication, leadership, negotiation and management. With this in mind, I am always searching for experiences to develop myself without losing the important perspective. That is why I went on exchange for half a year to Japan, did a lot of committees and was part of the Central Student Council of the TU Delft on behalf of ORAS!",
