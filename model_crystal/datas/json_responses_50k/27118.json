To run the simulations, I used a hydrological software on a terrain model.\nThe work consisted in searching the ideal location and case study by looking up the flood historical records. Then, I gathered all the data needed for the construction of the model and processed it to create a mesh, used as a basis for the hydrological simulation together with hydrological time series for the boundary conditions.\nI ended my work by the writing of a final report explaining my methods and the first results I obtained.",
