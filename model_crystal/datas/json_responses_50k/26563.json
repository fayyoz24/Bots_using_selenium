    "summary": "My passion for electrical engineering began in my teenage years which were spent building computers, electric guitars, effects pedals for music and more. Fast forward 7 years and throughout both my undergraduate degree and my current PhD Candidacy, that passion and excitement is still the point that drives me in everything I do. My background has taken on many different aspects of engineering from circuit design, to control, to its current focus on signal processing and optimisation. In this way, I am always driven to try new things and am no stranger to the world of up skilling and developing new toolsets for a given task. \n\nIn contrast to my work, in my free time I can often be found hiking in the mountains, swimming in lakes, skiing when ever the snow is good and generally enjoying the outdoors. I am also a keen musician and have a particular weak spot for applying my engineering skills to the task of sonic production.\n\nI am also a keen talker so if you would care to learn more and sit down for a chat, please don't hesitate to contact me via my email address (tom.sherson@gmail.com).",
