The U.S. Climate Change Discourse during Obama\u2019s Second Term\nMeasuring Reframing Strategies with Affiliation Discourse Networks\n\nThe scientific community almost unanimously finds that climate change is real and man-made to a\ngreat extent. Nevertheless, the issue is still debated controversially in the U.S. public discourse. This final report of a research project conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has the goal of developing and illustrating a tool for the measurement of reframing strategies, using elements of Discourse Network Analysis, and hereby combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The developed tool is able to track reframing processes over time and in constant comparison to the behavior of other discourse participants. It is validated in an empirical setting: Reframing strategies of main Democrats and Republicans during the second term of the Obama presidency (2013-2017) are tracked and analyzed. Based on the analysis of 1,624 statements extracted from Twitter entries, the case study finds that the U.S. climate change discourse is more multifaceted than the mere discussion about the validity of scientific findings between so-called \u2018deniers\u2019 and \u2018alarmists\u2019. Both parties applied identified reframing strategies, such as broadening the argumentation, shifting the accentuation of concepts, as well as concept transformation and amplification. Whereas Democrats increasingly tried to stress the role of a broad, consensual societal movement with the ideal of an economically prosperous and healthy carbon-neutral society, Republicans such as Donald Trump started discrediting the climate protection movement by labelling the coalition as elitist or pointing out negative impacts of renewable energies.",
