Coffee farmers have been underpaid for great coffee for decades. This is not only unfair, but also endangers your daily cup of coffee. We have seen that young people don\u2019t want to take over the farms of their parents because of a lack of perspective. And who would invest in climate protection measures if you don\u2019t earn enough for a decent living? \n\nThat is why we focus on paying coffee farmers a living income price for their coffee. On top of that we pay enough to their cooperatives to invest in improvements. We also invest in Microfinance for coffee farmers. \u20ac1,- out of every kilogram of coffee sold is being invested through the Pure Africa Foundation. We make a difference by offering farmers a cost covering 6% interest rate instead of the usual 25% interest. Research has shown that farmers make more long term investments with our loans.\n\nPure Africa mainly supplies coffee B2B in offices in The Netherlands and Belgium. We also sell green coffee within the EU. Our customers find transparency, fair business and a high quality product important.",
