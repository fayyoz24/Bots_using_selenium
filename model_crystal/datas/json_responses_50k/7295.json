The topic included an introduction to feminism, womanism, queer theory and transgender studies. The main point of the lecture was to instill the importance of intersectionality in the students; the idea that one woman's experience might differ from another through the matrix of race, class, sexuality or gender identity. Ultimately, it made the point that intersectionality leads to more inclusivity which results in more diversity. ",
