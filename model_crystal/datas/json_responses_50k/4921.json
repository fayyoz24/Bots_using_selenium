    "summary": "Hey there! I'm Jo\u00e3o, but you are welcome to call me John. I am currently a backend engineer working with python/Django for an awesome Amsterdam based startup named Dexter.\n\nPrior to that I have had a diverse experience working in the industry and academia alike. This means a wide range of positions and industries. I even had my 5 minutes of fame when I appeared on tv while demonstrating a project to Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister at the time. \n\nBorn and raised in Brazil, I have also inhabited Canada and Scotland. Currently I dwell in the Netherlands, where I plan to stay for a very long time. I love learning about different cultures, and the international atmosphere we experience in the Netherlands is one of the big reasons I like living here. It's not just bikes!\n\nI am happily married and enjoy outdoor activities, in particular football, cycling and hiking. I also enjoy listening to music, playing board games (I am also designing my own! stay tuned), and watching series and movies with my wife.\n\nLast but not least, all my hostnames are characters from Middle Earth.",

That, coupled with my easy-going personality makes it so I can facilitate the communication between non-specialist stake-holders and the engineers on the teams.\n\nThe domain is responsible for making all the teams independent at Sendcloud and each operate on a slightly different layer. \n\nMy responsibilities as a product owner consist of determining on which projects each team will work and when. Together with other stakeholders I craft the strategic plan for the domain.\nI have the final say on the prioritization of projects. This involves managing the resources and engineers we have to see what can be delivered when, to ensure maximum value to our direct customers (other engineers at the department) and our final customers.\n\nAnother big part of the job is adjusting to changing requirements and making sure what we are doing still delivers value, for that we work in SCRUM. Furthermore, stakeholder alignment and expectation management are part of the daily routine.\n\nDevOps focuses on providing the tools to build and run production grade services in AWS, our cloud provider. This also includes making sure our observability and alerting stack can serve the entire department.\n \nMeanwhile, infrastructure focuses on application level improvements that also enable the rest of the organization, such as providing libraries to enable resources and working on architectural topics which span the entire department.\n\nOutside my PO responsibilities, I also act as a strong communicator within the teams, making sure we have a strong team culture and that everything is running as it should.",

I led, alongside a colleague, the design and implementation of the use-case.\n\nThe group already had expertise on how to run a cellular network using x86 computers using Open Air Interface, a free open source 3GPP implementation. I designed the automation of that process by using systemd services which would start the required scripts to run all the required network services in the appropriate order and save the logs for future inspection. This enabled a Pop-up Network (PUN), which was backhaul agnostic and that could be deployed in under 2 minutes by untrained personnel, providing secure communications via a local cellular network to be used by the medical outreach teams.\n\nI was in charge of designing and implementing a patient record management application, both backend and frontend, in order to show how the PUN could be used in real-world . To speed up development, I used Python, for the backend, relying on Django for object persistence and Graphene for the GraphQL API. I developed the front-end in HTML5 using Angular. The application could not be hosted at the university due to network policies, therefore I resorted to Docker and Google App Engine to deploy both the frontend as well as the backend. The code was version controlled using a private Git repository hosted on GitLab. On top of that, I also configure API calls from Matlab and assisted a colleague in setting them up on an Android application, as a way of integrating other people\u2019s work into the demo. In the end, we presented the result to the Scottish First Minister and received outstanding feedback, as well as widespread media coverage. It was followed by the announcement of a substantial funding awarded to the University of Glasgow to set up the Scotland 5G Centre.",

The first was regarding cellular networks and consisted of proactively determining the occurrence of failures via identifying the root cause of problems. \n\nThe solution was a two-tier K-means approach on aggregated call data record data. The first iteration separated the nodes into those with and without problems. Then, at the second stage, another K-means round was performed only on nodes with problems, thus clustering them by type of problem. Another PhD Student took this project from here, designing a supervised learning approach to classify unseen nodes according to the obtained clusters, which could then be used by an operator to diagnose almost in real time the cause of an issue in the network with more than 99% accuracy.\n\nThe other application was related to the non-invasive continuous seamless identification of truck drivers for the safety of logistic operations. My proposed solution was to identify the drivers based on signals from a wearable device (smart watch). In order to tackle that, they have gathered data on 3 drivers, and provided me with the anonymized information. Since feature extraction can be quite challenging, I opted for a Deep Learning approach, where features are extracted by the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).  To improve the correctness of the predictions, I implemented a post-processing algorithm which greatly reduced the number of false alarms and elevated the accuracy of the approach to above 90%. \n\nI have presented the results to them on 2 different occasions, one follow-up meeting in the middle of the project time-frame and another one at the end of the project. Both meetings were attended by varied audiences, including their CTO, lower level management and developing teams. The presentations were well received with several questions being asked and an outstanding feedback.",

However, my strong OOP foundation and my ability to quickly grasp new technologies made it possible to learn the language in less than a month and deliver my first project within 2 months of having started. That project consisted of an automated code converter which would parse in Delphi source code and produce Java skeletons, with routines in Delphi commented out in the body of methods. This was done as the company was in the process of migrating their source code from Delphi to Java. Naturally it had to be developed in Java, the new company standard.\nThe project was so successful that it gave me political capital within the company to propose a new development workflow, where only senior developers would be allowed to edit corporate source code (classes which were used by all the company\u2019s systems), and where I would be in charge of reviewing their changes and proposing improvements. Quickly, this new work-flow paid off and clients noticed the systems to be more stable. As a result, I was promoted to project manager and reopened the R&D division and took that development further, reporting almost daily to the CEO. Notably, one of the many projects that was handled by my team was the integration of data from portable medical monitors with the company\u2019s clinic management system. I also participated in the implementation of a PDCA framework in several departments in conjunction with other managers and a third party consultancy.",

My role was to develop a parallelization process for the deployment of the feature extraction techniques on a Linux blade server, as well as to implement image registration (alignment correction) and brain segmentation. I used ANTs for the registration and segmentation, as that was a state-of-the-art tool to perform those tasks, and shell scripts for the process automation. The batch of images was split in bash and sent to different nodes on the server, that were then processed and the result was fed into Matlab scripts (also running headless on the server) that were provided by teammates.",

Since it involved low level components and the motor had a third party proprietary library written in C++, I decided to develop the project in C++ as well. Because the robot ran on an embedded linux platform, I used eclipse as my IDE with cross-compilation.",
