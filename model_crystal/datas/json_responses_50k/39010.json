    "summary": "Curiosity is my reason for living: it is never time to stop learning and getting empowered.\n\nMy flexibility in working on different projects and environments, together with my propensity to take benefit from a wide people's connection network, made me focus on specific skills that I would be enthusiastic to put at service for a company. In my former experiences I ackowledged some main aspects of my personal working identity, summed-up in the following characteristics:\n\n- Strong attitude in socializing and sharing information with stakeholders, matched with a natural propensity for presenting products/ projects/ ideas etc...\n- Hard-working: embracing the company mission means respecting deadlines and being as much productive as possible.\n- Attention to details: every single aspect, also the apparently insignificant one, can have an impact on the final outcome.\n- Sense of responsibility: I always seek for more responsibilities as possible. Getting involved in a project means pro-actively contribute to its' realization.\n\nI chose to diversificate my academic education, opting for a bachelor in Italy and a master program in Netherlands. The combination of two different educational approaches pushed me to develop different aspects of my skill pool. Spirit of improvisation, creativity and flexibility (addressable to the experience in the Italian university) together with solid methodology, open minded approach and group working imprinting (addressable to the experience in the Dutch university) made me proud of my growth. Moreover, I accomplished a Data Science bootcamp in Barcelona to get to dice into the Tech industry!\n\nIn my free time I enjoy playing boardgames, socializing and gettinig updated on geo-political events occurring around the world.\n\nFor any doubts, feel free to text me on Linkedin or by email: franksimonettiwork@gmail.com",
