    "summary": "As an artist I concentrate on the following questions: \u201cHow do the events of the past influence our life in the present?\u201d and \u201cWhat changes in us through the years and how?\u201d\nThe past two years I worked on a series of paintings called Crossing the life. This is a series of biographical nature, where I compare my life to that of my predecessors. Each painting is not just a story, but is in a certain way a self portrait, a part of me. \n\nI graduated from the Surikov art academy at the faculty of painting in 2020. In 2019 I moved to the Netherlands and since then I have lived and worked in Rotterdam. There I am  registered at the CBK Rotterdam and am a part of the artists association Karmijn.",
