Within the Elster Group about approximately 7500 people are employed worldwide.  Elster as well as Instromet are active in equipment for natural gas and produce accurate equipment for measuring gas flow.\n\nIn the roll as international product manager I was engaged at Instromet several years after they were taken over by a German investment group that also owned Elster. There was a considerable overlap in the product portfolio of both companies. I led a steering committee in charge of minimising the overlap of both portfolios. For this job I had frequent meetings with my German colleagues in Mainz and the people in Silvolde, Holland. As a result the large instruments are nowadays built in Holland, the small ones moved to Germany.",

In order to maintain the relationships with customers, I travelled regularly to England and Germany. \n\nAfter a re-organization my responsibility was extended to the assembly department of 12 people. Together with the logistics manager, we restructured the logistics system in such a way the lead time and delivery performance drastically improved. In the same period with the help of the engineers, assembly manuals were made. In combination with training, the assembly team became flexible.",

I was hired by Leica Microsystems Lithography as a project manager; I managed multiple suppliers that worked together on the development of a new generation of electron bean pattern generator. These machines are used for wafer production. A number 5 machine was realized during my involvement. \nFor the Stichting Research Centrum Kalkzandsteen, I was part of a team that developed a prototype slot cutter for capturing fine dust. Based on my idea TNO did a patent investigation. I managed a project on a rapid prototyping machine for various engineering plastics products directly generated from a 3D CAD file. This project resulted in a working machine. For OCE I did the project management for a team that developed methods for the positioning of precision mechanical parts of an inkjet nozzle. Through prototypes, the functioning of the ideas was demonstrated. I did a project for Van Essen Instruments; I was in charge from prototype to O-series production for an oxygen sensor.",
