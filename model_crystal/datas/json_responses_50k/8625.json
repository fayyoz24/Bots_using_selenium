    "summary": "With an extensive international experience and success in various roles, my problem-solving personality looks to solve business issues in a pragmatic sense - if you don't do it right, don't do it.\nI want to help customers push the envelope on how they engage with customers, and don't think it should be just focused on just one aspect (an app, an email), but rather how different roles such as service, commerce, sales and Marketing can benefit from a holistic customer view, where data is seen as the foundation to maintaining and building the relationship.\n\nWhat motivates me?\nLearning is my number one motivator and I hope it always will be. Learning should not only be in the classroom though, and I feel like learning from what to avoid is as effective as learning what to do. It is this double sided approach which motivates me to put myself in and succeed in challenging and changing environments. \nChange. I have found working in environments where change is happening often forces people to be open to other ideas and breaks down walls. Change is an opportunity for me not only a risk.\nEveryone says that honesty is important, but for me it is imperative. While we don\u2019t always like what we hear, it is important to know, after all, feedback is the start of improvement. Having an open dialogue in the workplace has built trust for me and where there is trust there is the ability to focus on results and not on the roadblocks along the way.",
