    "summary": "Hi! Welkom op mijn profiel :)\nIk ben Karim, een happy-go-lucky guy die gelooft in de kracht van heldere communicatie. Ik krijg erg veel energie van het helpen van anderen; of dit gaat om het helpen van een passende uitdaging, om passende training te ontwikkelen of om simpelweg processen of tooling toe te lichten. \nDaarnaast heb ik een achtergrond en ervaring met Security Awareness. Ik krijg erg veel energie van het coachen en trainen van anderen en haal hier veel voldoening uit.\n\nThe Future Group, opgericht in het jaar 2000, bestaat uit een consortium van maatschappen gericht op hoogwaardige ICT dienstverlening. Iedere maatschap kent haar eigen vakspecialisatie. Iedere vakspecialist binnen TFG heeft een universitaire- of HBO opleiding, minimaal 7+ jaar relevante werkervaring en een unieke specialisatie. In 2018 zijn er meer dan 300 ondernemers exclusief aan TFG verbonden. Hierdoor is TFG de grootste fysieke community van zelfstandige ICT ondernemers in Nederland.\nThe Future Partners, opgericht in 2019, is ingericht in Tribes. Je hebt al voldoende IT kennis in huis en vindt het leuk om verschillende opdrachtgevers te voorzien van advies. Daarbij wil je de vrijheid hebben om je eigen keuzes te maken. Je merkt echter wel dat je nog wat ondersteuning kunt gebruiken. Dan is het concept van The Future Partners echt iets voor jou. Wij leren je in 3 jaar alle kneepjes van het ondernemerschap! \nAansluiten of heb je een vraag? Stuur me vooral een bericht of bekijk onze website: https://the-future-group.com/",

Every 50 cents per consumption were given to the cause of reconstructing the University of Mosul, which was close to be being destroyed completely by bombings and attacks in 2017."
