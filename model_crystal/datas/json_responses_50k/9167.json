    "summary": "I currently spend my time managing core infrastructure products, servicing cross vertical transactional capabilities at Booking.com, more specifically reservations. My main focussing is on increasing reliability, efficiency and robustness, and working towards our company objectives. \n\nBooking.com is an online travel agency, originally focussing on accommodation. However, the business has grown tremendously, and is now focussing on enabling a connected trip for customers, where flights, cars, accommodation, attractions etc. all form part of the product offering and potentially a single reservation.\n\nMy focus is people, product and process. \n\nI love being involved in the career growth of the people around me, ensuring they have all the training, skills and EQ required to continually excel.\n\nWe work in a very agile fashion, where data drives decisions and change comes naturally.\n\nI have been working in the Software Development space many years. Programming was my first passion!\n\nSoon however, I realized that there is so much more than just code. I delved more and more into software design and architecture, before stumbling into the cauldrons of technology management.\n\nI am quite philosophical about software and the use thereof. I like to apply proven practices to the management of projects and programs, where and if applicable.\n\nDefinitely theory Y. Love innovation. \n\nOn my plate:\n - Product manager - infrastructure, Booking.com\n\nOn my side plate\n - Recently relocated to the Netherlands, so getting used to winter\n - Trying to continue my PhD\n\n\nContact me at: justinbredenkamp@gmail.com",

The project aimed at replacing the existing Husky Meter Reading Solution with a Mobile Computing Meter Reading Solution. The new Mobile Meter Reading Solution utilises leading edge Technology such as i-Mate Devices (combination between PDA and Cellphone) and the GPRS Network as provided by Vodacom.\n\n\n\nThe significance of this solution is that it provides Business Solutions on a PDA screen size device. Accenture developed this asset based on similar Field Force Enablement (FFE) solutions developed for Tablet PC's in the UK and U.S.A.\n\n\n\nThis solution leads Rand Water into the new era of Mobile Technology and will result in significant bottom line savings for the company.  We are looking at packaging this solution to on-sell to other utilities in Southern Africa.\n\n\n\nI would like to congratulate the following team for their extraordinary effort:\n\nSchalk Kock;\n\nJan Louw;\n\nKalpana Ramjee;\n\nMelody Taylor;\n\nJustin Breedenkamp; and\n\nDavid Spencer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKind Regards\n\n\n\nWilliam Mzimba\nDirector\nAccenture South Africa\n\"",

The vacancy for a systems architect arose at Altech Netstar and after meeting Eugene Terblanche for an interview I couldn't resist.\n\nAltech Netstar have unique problems which require unique solutions. Vehicle tracking results in millions of location based transactions flooding into the systems, as well as heavy reporting requirements outgoing.\n\nI was introduced to GSM products and got involved in the design of a SIM management solution. This would allow the business to receive, provision and assign SIM cards for different uses to different places. Tracking of these SIM's are of great importance to ensure auditability of the costs as well as proper functional compliance of the units in the field.\n\nAltech Netstar sent me on a post-grad course at the University of Stellenbosch's Industrial Engineering faculty, covering Systems Architecture, Program Management and Systems Engineering. Of all the items the Project Management course created the most excitement.\n\nI followed that up with a PMBok course which was an eye opener!\n\nThe opportunity was presented to become a project manager on a project to rewrite Altech Netstar's fleet management solution. The current solution had become outdated in terms of functionality as well as technology.\nIt was a long term project and I unfortunately never saw the closure of it.\n\nIt was here that I realised I love the interaction between the development team, the client and the business.

This is where I had my first taste of Agile development and real high performance development. Marc ran a clean shop where every developer knew what was assigned to him her, with everyone's tasks culminating into the end solution seamlessly.\n\nMy first project was the rewrite of the Sun International Casino Management Solution. There were many architects, more testers and even more developers. We even had some old guys looking at the old C code to relate the requirements to us!\nThe solution was a ASP.Net web application connecting to different tiers and connectors (to casino devices).\n\nHowever, my favourite projects were two mobile solutions. \n\nThe first was a meter reading solution for Eskom (sole developer), whereby the field agents used my app running on iMate smartphones to take electricity box meter readings and and synchronise their job sheets with a service I deployed in the cloud.\n\nThe second mobile solution was very similar. Rand Water agents had to take water meter readings and also turn off/on water supply where necessary. Again I implemented a service in the cloud along with iMates in the field.\n\nBoth solutions were running on Windows Mobile, which back then was bleeding edge. I was on the phone to Microsoft developers in Germany daily to discuss issues/solutions of the framework.\nJust using the GPRS connection was seriously tough.",
