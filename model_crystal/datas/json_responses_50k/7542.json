    "summary": "I am a value-driven professional with a keen interest in helping people and organisations achieve their full potential. \n\nCuriosity, kindness, and reliability form the bedrock of my values. I find particular delight in the company of people who have the audacity to dream big, accomplish tangible results, and recognize that the journey of solving challenging problems is more fun when done as a team.\n\nAs a first-generation university graduate with a underpriviliged background I experienced firsthand how it is to having to do more than most just to catchup. I have also seen how the support of just a single person can change the entire life trajectory of someone. My life's mission is to become that supporting someone that can help others drastically improving their lives. \n\nI would like to dedicate my professional career to make the biggest possible positive impact at organisations that put their people at its heart. Let this be HR, DEI or People Operations I am dedicated to create an organisational culture where everyone feels valued, understood and supported. \n\nI bring the following superpowers to the team: \n\ud83c\udf31  Adaptability\n\ud83d\udcca  Analytical Skills\n\ud83c\udfa8  Creativity\n\u2764\ufe0f  Empathy\n\ud83d\udca1   Problem-solving\n\ud83d\udccb  Project Management\n\ud83e\udd1d Stakeholder Management\n\ud83d\udd52 Time Management\n\nMy achievements would not have been possible without all the support I received along my journey. I would love to pass it on: so if there is anything you think I can help you with please feel free to reach out and I will try my best to help you.",
