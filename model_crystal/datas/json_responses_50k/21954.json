    "summary": "Very experienced designer and developer. 40 years in the frontline of innovation in education and the public domain as a whole. Pioneer in urban risk management, active citizenship, public value management.\nMy goal is to add value to the way we handle the inevitable risks that come with living together in the tight space we call 'city'. The fragile pact amongst people making the city requires engagement rather than policies, experiments rather than drawing board planning.\nI look at 'the New City', dominated by networks, and requiring innovative approaches to keeping the city healthy. \n\nIn all this the good governance of urban risks is a condition for urban functions such as economic development, learning, playing, working, living. Dealing with urban risks requires new attention and  new urban professionals. Ultimately, what I do results in informing these professionals and adding to their tools.\n\nI use academic and professional ways, means and methods. To that I add a strong dose of artistic, creative, design oriented activities. A mix of media creates the space for the kind of change needed.",

Each exploration is input for Pop Up Public, which are game based workshops in which urban communities can experiment with different approaches to circumstances in the city that are bothersome, or beneficial.

Main reason is that as a 'regular' I can add value to the courses I am committed to more effectively. Added to an overall responsibility for the character and quality of the curriculum at Safety and Security Management Studies I teach and coach. \nMain domain is the changing perspective (and actively changing the perspective...) in the way safty and security are given attention as part of ubanisation. \nAlso I am involved in developing new learning tools, especially in the domain of 'serious games'. This nicely links with how I started my professional carreer.",
