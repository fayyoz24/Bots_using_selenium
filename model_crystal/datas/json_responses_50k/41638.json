The project looked for new ideas, approaches and innovations and was intended to be creative, exploratory and non-judgmental.    The Radical Learning Group scanned the horizon and looked for innovative and creative approaches that will enhance and lift the quality of teaching and learning at La Trobe.\n\nThe core Radical Learning Group included: Associate Professor Claire Macken, Director, Flexible and Online Learning Development projects, Associate Professor Kay Souter, Radical Learning Project, Dr Christopher Scanlon, Senior Lecturer, School of Journalism, HUSS, Matthew Riddle, Senior Lecturer (Academic Development), FBEL and Tony Jarvis, Associate Dean (International), HUSS.",

The last couple of decades have seen universities investing significant funds and resources in the construction and retrofitting of learning spaces based on the promise of various Returns on Investment (ROI). This has meant that claims about the influence of active learning spaces on student learning are often not substantiated empirically which in turn means that the Return on Investment (ROI) on learning space development can be difficult to define.  This collaborative research project focuses on the systematic evaluation of recent learning space designs in order to better understand the return on investment and to test the underlying design assumptions to help the universities in moving the field forward. The theoretical approach for this project utilises the Pedagogy, Space and Technology (PST) framework from the Next Generation Learning Spaces project as well as the 7 Principles of Learning Space Design from the Spaces for Knowledge Generation (SKG) Project. Role: Principle Investigator (together with Prof Norazah Nordin, UKM).",
