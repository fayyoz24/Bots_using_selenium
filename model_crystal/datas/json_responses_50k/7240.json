            "description": "Pipe Flow Expert\nLast December 2018, AWL\u2019s fluid department came to R&D with a simple problem. How to make sure that only the optimum amount of cooling water is provided to components used during operation in cells.\n\nWhich problem needed solving, and what\u2019s in it for the customer/AWL?\nOften our cooling water was reported insufficient for the welding process as a result we started over-designing components to compensate for potential insufficiencies in the future. PFE offers numerical solution to this problem by calculating exactly how much water is needed in which cooling circuits. \n\nWhat\u2019s in it for AWL\u2019s employees?\nAWL\u2019s fluid engineers can now sleep easy at night knowing the components they chose are based on exact facts and is less dependent on guesswork/experience. Result: Happier employees.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for AWL as a company?\n1.\tReduced costs for AWL by not having to over-design the system and hence not choosing expensive components where a smaller and cheaper would have sufficed. Result: Lower material costs\n2.\tBy limiting guesswork and trial & error approaches, AWL saves on valuable man-hours onsite as well as off-site.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for the customers?\n1.\tCustomers will get machines which are even more reliable in their welding processes.\n2.\tOptimal machine components will make sure lower spare-parts costs for the customers as well as lower operational costs by saving on extra energy costs.\nProject approach\nAt first, the idea was to develop our own calculation software. During market research, however, we found in Pipe Flow Expert (PFE) the perfect software catering to our needs. Thoroughly tested and studied by R&D, PFE is now handed-over to the Fluid department for use in regular projects.\n\nResult \n \nJust through an investment of less than a 1000 euro\u2019s per year, AWL can potentially save tens of thousands of euros on extra costs, have higher employee happiness index and more satisfied clients.",
