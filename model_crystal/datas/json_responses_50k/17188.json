Detecting these lymph nodes is usually performed by injection of a radioactive tracer, which is then followed with a gammaprobe. We aim to replace this method with a magnetic alternative, which uses superparamagnetic nanoparticles with a unique detection algorithm which negates the magnetic influence of the human body, which currently limits magnetic techniques for SLN mapping. Additional sensitivity is gained by combining our sensing technology with a miniature cryocooler from Kryoz, which decreases sensor noise due to added thermal stability and lower Johnson noise.\n\nIn this project, the University of Twente cooperates with two hospitals (MST Enschede and RUNMC Nijmegen) and three industry partners. \n\nMy responsibilities are to develop the sensing technology and hardware. In addition to this, I coordinate the work packages of the other partners and guarding the project's timeline and progress.",

I work with biomedical engineers, clinical technologists, surgeons and other professionals to develop this technology from the ground up and bring it to the clinic.\n\nThe use of these superparamagnetic nanoparticles and our detector allows replacement of the current radioisotope-based technique, which has many drawbacks, including radiation dose for patient and medical staff, high logistical burden for the clinic and limited availability.\n\nBy exploiting our knowledge of the behavior of these nanoparticles and bringing them to clinical practice, we aim to improve the quality and efficiency of existing medical procedures, from diagnostics to treatment in for example radiotherapy procedures. All this is carried out in tight communication with the end users to ensure efficient integration of our solutions in clinical practice.",
