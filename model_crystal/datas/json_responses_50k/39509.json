We are assisting with proposals, raising funds to produce films, biennial projects or catalogues while working in close alliance with international galleries and institutions. \nIn 2011 we launched the first international Curatorial Open Call where we dedicate a yearly exhibition to emerging curatorial practices. Other initiatives to engage the local public include a book club and the 'Kitchen Talks', a series of informal talks in the gallery kitchen, where we invite artists, art critics, curators and other cultural agents. NoguerasBlanchard opened its first space in Barcelona in June 2004 and this year has opened a second exhibition space in Madrid.",

The program is centered around questions of how art can contribute to our understanding of present-day social, political, and ecological issues. Our exhibition program is framed through intersectional ecological thinking, in which subjects related to nature, climate, ecology and the shared living environment, gender, feminism and decolonization, as well as the increasing influence of digital infrastructures and advanced-capitalist and neoliberal systems and governments intertwine with one another. We want to make these naturecultures and complexities tangible and accessible for our publics, and thereby endorse the essential importance of educational and discursive actions and events as an integral dimension of our programming. From the former bathhouse at the heart of the monumental Justus van Effen complex, A Tale of a Tub offers its space, infrastructure and resources to artists, curators and practitioners from different fields of inquiry to develop newly commissioned artistic productions, reflecting on complex societal issues and debates as to further strengthen and enrich our daily living and working practices, often based on long term-research and interdisciplinary dialogue.\n\nA Tale of a Tub was founded in 2014 by Nathanja van Dijk and Suzanne Wallinga and was directed in partnership with Fleur van Muiswinkel and Carolyn Drake Kandiyoti. From September 2019 onwards, A Tale of a Tub is directed by Julia Geerlings and Niekolaas Johannes Lekkerkerk.",
