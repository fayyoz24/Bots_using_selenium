    "summary": "Creative. Multi-Tasker. Results-Driven. Focused. These are just some of the words to describe my personality. \n\nCurrently, as a logistics representative, I am embracing the daily challenges of transportation while providing effective and innovative solutions for the customers I am working with. This is a dynamic role which fits perfectly with my energetic personality. \nPreviously working in the startup scene around the world has allowed me to wear many hats and granted me the opportunity to explore all aspects of the sales funnel, including but not limited to: Sales automation softwares, CRM systems, Lead gen. Being part of one of the world\u2019s leading tech blogs that delivers an international perspective on the latest news about Internet technology, business and culture provided a jumping board to work closely and help some of the largest tech brands reach their marketing goals.\nAdditionally, I am passionate about Supply Chain, Agile and Custom solutions, Sales Strategy, Negotiations and Innovative technologies. Colleagues know me as a highly dedicated person who is easily adaptable and has a firm handle on her time-management capabilities. If there is a deadline, nothing will come between me and my keyboard.\nWhen I am not in the office, I like to try new restaurants, play tennis, ski in the winter and hike in the summer and most of all, travel. My goal is to see as much of the world as possible.\n\nCan frequently be found sipping on a hot cup of joe. (: \n",
