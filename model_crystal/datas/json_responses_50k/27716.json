It is an international competition with participating teams from all over Europe with the goal for each team to build an innovative molecular biosensing system.\n\nAn important aspect in healthcare is to keep people healthy as long as possible and to enable them to also maintain a high-quality life. Currently a lot of has been done towards molecular biosensing. This means to be able to measure, for example, disease markers with predefined precision and a high reliability using small devices which are easy to use, cost effective, and versatile. It is important to go towards point-of-care systems where such devices will be used to monitor patients in a near-patient fashion. The main goal of the SensUs competition is to stimulate development of technology towards point-of-care systems from new concepts to working designs.\n2016 is the first rendition of the competition. This year also teams from the university of Leuven, Imperial College London, Uppsala University, and the technical University of Denmark will participate. \n\nThe finals will be held from the 8th of September through the 11th of September. During these days the team will reveal their device to the general public and it will also be tested in a hospital by a qualified jury. In 2017 and upcoming years more teams and universities can participate to upscale the competition and stimulate this important field of research even more.",

            "description": "The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation is dedicated to education and competition, advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of open community and collaboration. In 2012, iGEM spun out of MIT and became an independent nonprofit organization located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. The iGEM Foundation fosters scientific research and education through organizing and operating the iGEM Competition, the premier student synthetic biology competition. It also fosters scientific research and education by establishing and operating the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, a community collection of biological components.The organization promotes the advancement of science and education by developing an open community of students and practitioners in schools, laboratories, research institutes, and industry. \n:\nA fundamental problem in utilizing genetically modified bacteria is their limited ability to survive under non-natural conditions, such as the harsh conditions in industrial reactors and the immune system in the human body. We report a \u201cPlug-and-Play\u201d system allowing the introduction of chemical anchors on cell membranes, subsequently used to attach a functional coating. The anchors consist of azidophenylalanine, which couples covalently with molecules containing the strained alkyne DBCO in a so-called \"click\" reaction. We obtained proof of concept that our developed Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins (COMP) enable this fast and effective click reaction. We apply it to create a safe \u201cclicked-on\u201d coating allowing E.coli to be used in the human body for healthcare purposes. Furthermore, microfluidic devices have been designed, ensuring increased control over the click reaction and single cell coating. We believe our \u201cPlug-and-Play\u201d system is a versatile tool providing numerous possibilities for engineering bacteria on outer membranes.",
