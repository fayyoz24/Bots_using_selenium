    "summary": "My role as Exploration Manager Russia was the last chapter in the exciting 31 years with Shell. I joined the company as explorer in 1989 and spent half of my career in Exploration with side steps into Development, Commercial and HR. I have a truly diverse and global CV with many technical and senior managerial posts. I have had the privilege of working and living in many culturally diverse countries such as Myanmar, Russia, Syria, Norway and The Netherlands.\n\nI am passionate about the opportunities and challenges that the global energy industry faces, as we move into Energy Transition. With my deep and diverse experience of technical and senior roles with Shell (including HR), I have unique experience and skills to offer. I believe that, as the external environment grows more global and complex, elements like collaboration, flexibility and building relationships will become ever more important. I am often described as a real people person that can balance the delivery of business goals with staff motivation and development. I have a strong sense of delivering on promise which is probably best illustrated by the completion of a newly established Exploration JV in Russia (Esenin), shortly before my voluntary departure with Shell end 2020.\n\nThirty-one years in Shell has surely made its mark on me and although I am still a passionate geologist by origin, I have a broad interest and a wide variety of experiences and skills on offer!\n",
