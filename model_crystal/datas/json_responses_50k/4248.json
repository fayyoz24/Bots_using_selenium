    "summary": "Here are my personal skills. \n\n*Scalable mindset*\nCreating and working in business's that scales. Needing 1 more person each time you need to add X more clients is a failure in my book. \n\n*Taking action and getting things done*\nBeing able to focus 80% of your time on the 20% that really matters is a gift. Wasting time doing trivial tasks that adds no value - but takes up a 8 hour work day is easy - creating a work schedule for yourself to avoid this is harder...\n\n*Solving problems and critical mindset*\n5 years of university taught me that solving problems (or challenges as I call them) is critical to being succesful. How you solve those problems - usually under a time constraint - is what separate a good worker from a great worker. \n\nOther skills:\n- Online Advertising for e-commerce business's through AdWords\n- Relationship Management & Consultative sales.\n- Playing table foosball (challenges accepted) ;=)",
