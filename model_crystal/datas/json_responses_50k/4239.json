All these code changes were unit-tested and deployment to TST was done with CI/CD pipelines. \n\nThese new functionalities were shown to the business as a demo, so they gave feedback about the new functionalities.

I also did job interviews when new developers was joining the MDM team. \n\nI was closely working together with Developers/Testers, Business Analysts, Solution Architects, Support Team and I reported the progress of the feature requests to our stakeholders of Rituals. \n\nAs a PO, I was communicating to our stakeholders which and when the feature requests were developed and will go-live as I was the primary contact person for our stakeholders. \n\nWhen there were issues in the system and these could not be solved by our Development Team, these issues were escalated to our vendor. \n\nWith other Product Owners, I was collaborating to discuss the timings and impediments of feature requests. \n\nWhen new colleagues joined Rituals and they were going to work in STEP, I gave them a MDM-STEP introduction training. \n\nAs last, I was continually investigating how we could improve our way of working or our processes within the MDM team.",

I took this knowledge and experience with me during my first project at Philips Lighting (Signify). At Philips, the Agile / Scrum methodology was used. I also learned how to use STEP efficiently at Philips. Between the projects, I analyzed and worked on the IBM Watson tool to automate yearly reports. Train the AI model to learn how fraudulent based these reports were from companies. I took this knowledge and experience to my next project at Rituals Cosmetics Enterprise. At Rituals I have improved my Project Management skills and I have mainly improved my JavaScript skills, which helped me to write Business Rules efficiently so that complex challenges/exceptions we had at Rituals could be solved.",
