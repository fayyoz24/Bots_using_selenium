In a decentralize energy system, the production is unbundled from transmission and distribution and a larger number of entities, such as small companies and prosumers take part in these activities. This movement of horizontalization is directly connected to the decentralization and to some extent is also dependent on the implementation of information and communication technologies such as Smart Grid.",

While these may be great challenges, they can be turned into great opportunities with new technologies, innovative business models and coordinated policies. The solutions should target optimal energy and resource efficiency, ideally through the integration of new technologies (energy, mobility, ICT), development of new business models, and new methodologies o urban governance. The explicit goal should be to create a smart district where marked improvements in energy sustainability and liveabilican be demonstrated an plausibly executed. Project proposals are expected to have a 20 year timeline; starting in 2015 and reaching the desired objectives by 2035. ",

The replacement of synchronous generators with RES shrinks system inertia, which in turn weakness system damping in case of disturbances. In such systems, any disturbance may cause high-frequency deviation and instability problems. Synchronverters and Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) control represent the fundamental solution to tackle these challenges. The primary objectives of this work to handle the following tasks: \n\n\u2192Modeling of Synchronverter for RES and storage system\n\n\u2192Perform stability analysis considering different scenarios to test and validate the presented synchronverter and its control in transmission system",
