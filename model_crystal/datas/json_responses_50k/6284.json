These options improve the performance of their machines and thus add value to their customers. The typical sales price of an option is much lower than that of an entire system. Total yearly sales amounts to \u20ac100 million and is expected to increase. Especially in the current economic down turn more customers will choose for an update for an older machine then buy a very expensive new machine. Unlike system sales, order control for option sales is not in place. And since the instruction party for this thesis is the financial control division of ASML, this order control process was the topic of the thesis. And I succesfully implemented this process on a world wide scale.",
