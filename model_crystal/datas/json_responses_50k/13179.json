Finally, I wrote my thesis in this department on improving its approach against radicalization against right-wing extremism which was awarded with a 7.5.

After successfully completing their training, I obtained a participation certificate from NOC*NSF and Centrum Veilige Sport Nederland. In this volunteering role, I lend an ear to anyone who needs it and help them in choosing the next step that is right for them and their situation. This often involves sensitive cases ranging from bullying and discrimination to unwanted behavior. Moreover, I have an active responsibility in the general and specific prevention policy within the association to support coaches, committees, the board, and members. Next to the training from NOC*NSF, I followed several other courses (e.g. from the TU Delft) in preparation for this responsibility. I continue to develop my skills through regular intervision with other Confidential Contact Persons."
