    "summary": "Bj\u00f6rn is an expert in leadership, strategy and personal development in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world. Working independently or in partnership with business schools, leading consultancies and other master practitioners. He gets asked by some of the biggest and most well-known organisations in the world to help them challenge their thinking, evolve their assumptions and discern the true nature of a situation. By designing and delivering high-impact talks, large-scale meetings, leadership development programs and change interventions he helps individuals think differently about themselves and the world, thereby discovering more alternatives for action.\n\nBj\u00f6rn has an MBA from Columbia Business School and a Masters in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. He is currently doing his PhD at Rotterdam School of Management. \n\nTEDx Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6SXXcB3WgM\n\nPersonal website: http://www.atterstam.com/",
