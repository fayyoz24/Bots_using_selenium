The first session is that a lecturer gives a presentation, which includes the basic information about Hanze University and international business school. The second session is that all visitors are divided by groups and come up with a typical Dutch product and try to sell it abroad, including China, Russia, the US, France and Germany.\n\nThere were three students in the Hanze experience team. The main task for me is that firstly help lecturers to organize visitors. Especially during the break, we needed to make sure that they would not be lost in the Hanze University. Then during the presentation, I shared my experience of studying in Hanze and studying in Groningen. I think IBS is a good choice because I could improve my English level and make friends from all over the world. Moreover I guided visitors to finish and enjoy the assignments. The visitors were shy and I could provide some ideas.\n"

There were 5 presentations and all of students and their parents were welcomed to join in. The presentation showed the basic information of International business school, for example the class, the exchange program and the internship program.Open Middag is in the afternoon and only open for Dutch students. Whereas, as a non-Dutch student, I tried my best to help IBS and the prospective students.\nFor both activities I need to firstly do the set-up process. In other words, I need to decorate the whole IBS, including information desk, presentation room and the foyer, to attract visitors. Then in the Open Midday I introduce the International Business School and answer questions from visitors and their parents. In addition I handed out the flyers and booklet to students who are interested in IBS. Furthermore, I took part in the presentation and sharde my experience and my planning of IBS.  At the end of the day, I also need to clean up trash in order to welcome next weekdays.\n"
