In order to do so, I have examined municipalities in the Netherlands that are members to different types of TMCNs so as to find out 1) why they have decided to join (different types of) TMCNs, and 2) to what extent these (different types of) TMCNs are able to influence their member municipalities\u2019 local, vertical, and horizontal climate governance practices.",

To do so, they had the opportunity to consult company representatives and experts in various academic and occupational fields.The resulting solutions were then presented to the respective companies by each of the teams; one of the solutions was chosen by a jury representing the concerned company. Following this, each elected team improved and adjusted its solution under the guidance of company representatives. On 27 November, the five solutions to the business cases were presented to a jury consisting of the director of 'Het Groene Brein', the rector magnificus of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and the alderman responsible for sustainability in the City of Utrecht.\n\nMy team worked on the business case of Cofely GDF Suez, which aimed to think of a way in which energy use could be measured, monitored, and reduced on a personal level in the working environment. Our solution, the EnergyCoach, was chosen as the best by Cofely representatives - we did not manage to win the Challenge, unfortunately. Cofely will, however, investigate whether it is possible to actually implement our proposed solution.",
