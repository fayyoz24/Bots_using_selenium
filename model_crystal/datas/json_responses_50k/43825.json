            "description": "With a team consisting of 5 people we worked on the idea of Surprise Dinner for a weekend. The idea of Surprise Dinner is to give people an experience when they want to go out for dinner. Customers can book a dinner package through Surprise Dinner and will not know where it is they'll be eating. An hour before the dinner appointment the customer receives a text message telling them where to go and to await further orders. Then, 10 minutes before the dinner appointment, they will receive a final text message telling them where they will be eating. Once they arrive in the restaurant they will also receive a surprise menu.\n\nDuring this weekend I created the website, made a reservation/payment module and created a administration system which takes care of tasks such as assigning restaurants to customers, checking the reservation status, etc.\n\nFor this, we received the second price which consisted of, besides everlasting glory, an interview with Jamie Oliver magazine.\nhttp://surprisedinner.co",

The problem which the facility tried to tackle was that they could no longer give lectures due to the new forms of education. With this information we created an application which allowed the students to earn vouchers through doing quizzes about their current subjects. Through doing these quizzes we would identify their weak and strong subjects so that they could see which subjects they did not yet fully master. Combining these two features we created a way for the students to spend their earned vouchers on extra lectures from certain professors. Once enough students showed interest in a certain subject the professor would then be 'forced' to give that lecture to help his students. Also due to the amount of data we've collected we could show the professor on which questions the students were failing so he could adjust his lectures accordingly.\n\nSource: http://www.g2020groningen.nl/hackathon/",

EpicAuth is based on the idea that username and password authentication is a thing from the past and that to improve security and privacy a public/private key solution should be built. By leveraging the power of the Ethereum blockchain we managed to develop a protocol and a proof of concept within 48 hours.\nWhat EpicAuth does is authentication through verification. Let's say that you want to login to Twitter but Twitter needs a verified email address. You have however verified your email address with Gmail already. You are able to share this 'verification token' with other providers to prove your identity. This enables the user to choose where he stores his private information (local or on the blockchain) and who he shares it with. The user can thereafter revoke the right to their data so he is in control of what happens with it. \nIn essence EpicAuth can be used to provide identity/data verification and authentication through the blockchain. Imagine the government providing verification of a natural person, you could then, as a website, require your users to prove that they are indeed the person they claim to be without explicitly sharing their private data with the website.",

We came up with a way to gamify the throwing away of trash. We did this by creating an app which gives the user his own trash monster to take care of. When people encouter trash on the streets and throw it away they can scan a QR code attached to the bin to feed their monster. They get points for this and see the monster getting happier. The user can compare their score with other people around them and see what areas of the city are being cleaned up most and what areas are still dirty. Another team was working on creating an actual monster bin which will react when you throw away your trash by making eating noises. The motivation for this project was to give incentives for throwing away trash in a fun and engaging way.",

All of this had to be done with the use of technology (smartphone apps, assistive technology, etc.). For the old people, not having to rely on help of other people is a huge step towards freedom in their own home.\n\nWe (as a group of 5 students) followed 2 PhD courses on usability and accessibility. One of them was held during a 3 day course at the University of Abertay in Dundee, Scotland. The other course was held during a 5 day programme at the University of Adger in Grimstad, Norway. During these courses we were taught how to optimally design and develop applications for those who are physically disabled. Think somewhere along the lines of being blind, having Parkinson's disease, etc.\n\nIn the end we developed a platform, running on the Raspberry Pi, which could be easily placed in any home. The idea of this platform was that it was easy to develop applications for it, that it could be easily connected to outside hardware such as a pulse monitor, and that it could be controlled by a single click/tap by the user.",
