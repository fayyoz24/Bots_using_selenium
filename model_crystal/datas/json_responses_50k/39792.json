    "summary": "I've been developing software since I was a little youngling. Having started with quick basic, turbo pascal I worked my way up through yearly iterations of new software languages, patterns and concepts eventually ending up in the SAP stack (2004 onward) with a heavy 'side' investment in Microsoft .NET. Both of which I use daily and have incorporated both professionally as well as privately (Yes I used to have a local SAP Mini install when that was still a thing)\n\nCountless hobby programming projects and a broad interest in technology as well as a general interest in machines have given me an uncanny ability to dissect complex problems into manageable bytes (pun intended) as well as a capability to turn customer requirements into actual practical and usable solutions.\n\nI've played and worked with hundreds of different tools, patterns, models and have effectively turned my childhood programming hobby into my full time carreer.\n\nSome people may say I am a work-a-holic (often doing more than one project at a time) but I like to think of it as fun rather than work.\n\nAre you looking for an extremely (!) dedicated SAP Technical consultant or just an excellent all-round developer then you have come to the right place. I hold myself to an exacting standard and will happily tap away on my keyboard during evenings or weekends to provide not only what is required but also what is desired. \n\nOver-delivery is the name of the game. \n\nP.s. in these confusing times I'd like to point out that I am a very capable and communicative remote worker providing consistent updates and progress. Happy to operate for any Dutch, English or German speaking company anywhere in the world. Teach me another language and I'll add that too ;)\n",
