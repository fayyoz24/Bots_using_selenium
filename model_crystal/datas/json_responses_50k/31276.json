    "summary": "Hi, I'm Maja! \n\nThanks for checking out my LinkedIn profile! I am curious what brought you here? \n\n\u2192 Do you want to expand business into the German-speaking market? I have experience with that. \n\n\u2192 Do you want to grow your business the smart way? I can show you how. \n\n\u2192 Are you looking for killer copy that converts prospects to paying customers? I know the formulas to do just that. \n\nThrough clever copywriting and growth hacking techniques, I have learned to use some shortcuts to growth. \n\nBUT!...\n\n....There might be shortcuts to growth, but there are no shortcuts to success. I am here to work hard (... or better\u2026 work smart?) for the success of your business. \n\n\nPlease don't hesitate and get in touch. \n\n\nMore about me: \n\nAfter graduating from high school in Germany I took 3,5 years to live the dream and travel Asia, New Zealand, and Australia. Unfortunately, I lost my heart in East and South-East Asia, and I am striving for a career that allows me to connect both worlds: My home and my home-to-be: Taiwan.   \n\nI am an enthusiastic and aspiring professional; curious to learn, passionate about growth and creating the perfect customer experience. \n\nPlease refer to my experience for more details and qualifications - or better: talk to me directly. Looking forward!!",
