We are committed to the development of the Ethiopian poultry sector and are convinced that this could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship. The Holland Africa Poultry Partners use a practical approach to the Ethiopian poultry sector, in which sharing knowledge and expertise is of key importance. \n\n* Dutch Dairy Development Partners- Kenia & Uganda\n\nDuring my time travelling and working in (East) Africa I saw a clear renewed focus on agriculture in Africa. The agriculture sector has become more evident in policy and development agendas across the continent. Investments are made and the sector is flourishing in many areas.\n\nWorking and living for over 5 years in the agricultural sector in Ethiopia I realize that big changes can be made by putting more effort in the efficiency and quality of the production of agricultural goods. It is here where my passions are linked together; the agricultural sector, Dutch businesses and Africa. \n\nWith a background in Animal Science, family bonds to the poultry and dairy sector and working for years in Ethiopia to link Dutch businesses to the Ethiopian sector I joined the NABC team in 2013. At NABC I am  responsible for the organization's agrarian programs and projects, which are executed in collaboration with other agri team members. NABC is pioneering in combing trade and development through these multi- stakeholders sector specific programs. Through these activities, NABC contributes to strengthening long- term business relations between the Netherlands and Africa, both to the benefit of African economies as well as our own country.",
