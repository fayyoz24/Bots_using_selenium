    "summary": "I am a leader, innovator and agent for change. I coach teams to overcome complex issues in rapidly growing and changing businesses, particularly those that require significant restructuring or growth. I am an all-rounder with a natural ability to create and lead diverse and high performing teams through a low-ego servant leadership approach. I have a knack for getting the big picture and strategy right, and then quickly overcoming the key hurdles needed to implement real change on the ground.\n\nMy experience spans blue chip and mid-sized (\u20ac100m-\u20ac70bn) companies in energy, utilities, strategy, operations, commercial, IT and trading. I drive results through empowerment, continuous improvement and measuring results (financials, customers, staff, and so forth).\n\nAs a Swedish and New Zealand citizen with 25+ years successful experience in six countries, I have a truly global mindset and cultural awareness. This, in combination with my ability to develop people and successful teams, has been a key success factor in operationalising strategy and delivering positive business outcomes.\n\nKey skills: leadership, digital transformation, strategy design, change management, stakeholder management, project management, innovation, regulation, crisis management, risk management.",
