I was a contact point of my colleagues when they need me to update new information or add tools to the site. In order to introduce and elaborate the function of the intranet site, I provided training for colleagues in the Netherlands, Singapore and Hong Kong. Also, I worked with a graphic designer to create banners for the homepage, managed image library of the company to make sure all the photos fit the brand visibility, and took care of the publisher\u2019s list to update their role and tasks when working on the site. After the site was launched, I created a survey on SurveyMonkey, conducted a focus group to investigate user experience and then came up with an advisory plan that helped BCD Travel to achieve their goals.",
