    "summary": "Over 20 years of working experience in the energy sector. My passion is delivering technical innovative challenging projects. In such an environment I am in my comfort zone and able to deliver added value. \n    \nWithin a world that is in transition to a sustainable energy future my mission is to contribute by connecting the conventional and the renewable offshore energy sector.  In the next decades we need both conventional and renewable energy and I \u2019m convinced that we can achieve a sustainable energy supply by working together. To make a successful energy transition, sharing knowledge and experience between the conventional and renewable sector is a key issue.  \n\nBackground: have fulfilled several key positions within Energy companies, DCS/ESD vendors and Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) companies by leading multi-disciplinary teams that engineer, procure, construct and commission energy related projects. My solid technical background coupled with leadership skills have made it possible to deliver projects that were classified by management as \u2018critical for business\u2019 on time and within budget.",

Its core business is exploring for and producing oil and gas, both on land and offshore.\n\nFor the offshore facilities a dedicated department called ONEmods is recently formed to process modifications that are primary focused on lifetime extension of platforms. Modifications follow the, by Shell developed, Opportunity Realization Process (ORP).\n \nIn my current role I\u2019m heading a multi-discipline team of process, mechanical/piping, instrumentation, PACO, electrical, rotation and technical safety engineers. As a team we execute the front end development phase (Assess/Select and Define) for modifications at Dutch offshore platforms. During Assess phase we investigate the opportunity and/or define the root cause of a problem. During Select we develop numerous options, and by evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each option the preferred solution it selected. This solution is developed in further detail (maturing the scope) during Define. Each change proposal is technically evaluated and approved by the Technical Authorities within NAM. The decision review board takes the Final Investment Decision (FID) and, if go-ahead is received the job is handed to the engineering contractor for the Execute phase. \n\nDue to the attitude developed in the team we were able to adress the root cause of the problem. By addressing the root cause and not the symptoms we saved the company hundreds of thousands of euros.\n\nOver the last 12 months we processed 60+ modifications and delivered solid technical and commercial viable change requests. Some examples of the executed front end engineering projects are:\n\u2022\tMEG loading (including O2 stripping) and unloading for offshore platform\n\u2022\tRejuvenation of K7A Platform power supply (solar \u2013 diesel generator concept)\n\u2022\tEmission reduction for Gas Treatment centre",

The scope of this project included the complete rejuvenation of a gas treatment center.  Given the age of the pneumatic control and safeguarding equipment (30 years) it was desired to replace it with a state of the art electronic control  & safeguarding system. The scope furthermore included replacement of all transmitters, switches, control and safeguarding valves,  power supply (new transformer), MCC, marshalling cabinets, DCS/ESD cabinets, burner management system (water bath heater and flare), instrument air distribution, cable tracing, junction boxes and instrument houses. Basically the whole installation, expect for piping and vessels, should completely be renewed. The additional challenge was that the construction phase should be carried out during the sixth annual inspection stop which was only 9 months away. \nI started the job and in a very short timeframe we were able to set up a dedicated team comprising Litecad and Emmtec engineers.  By strict management of the timeline, the engineering deliverables, DSC/ESD tendering, procurement, Factory Acceptance Testing, Site Acceptance testing, Commissioning, and startup of the plant we were able to deliver the project safe and according plan. As a team we succeeded due to our excellent technical skills, our capability to focus on the critical items and our mentality to deliver.",

These standards apply to the internal and external security of production control and safeguarding systems.
