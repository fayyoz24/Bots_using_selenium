The competition revolves around the way we learn. It is about 'the development of creative solutions around learning and teaching in the digital and globalised world.' Students are divided among several different groups, which all differ in topic. Each group eventually presents their creative solution in Berlin to the mentors and other students that have participated in the competition.\n\nThe idea that we had come up with was the \"Study Buddy\", which had earned us the second place prize. It was an app that matches a student to a buddy based on their biography. By creating a prototype we were able to bring the concept to life and immerse the audience in our idea.",

The bricks had already been made, our task was to carry the bricks to where the house would be built and create the basis of the house. During the trip we did not only work on building houses, but interacted with the locals and entertained them and ourselves by playing soccer with everyone involved.  \n\nhttp://www.habitat.org/where-we-build/ghana "
