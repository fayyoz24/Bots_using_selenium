I have gained experience through different roles and industries. I left big mature corporate companies to work in a fully remote (anywhere in the world-currently in Italy) tech startup and couldn\u2019t be happier with this new chapter. I am helping to shape our FP&A processes from the very scratch.\nI have great experience with Excel and ERP systems, including SAP, One Stream, BPC and BW. Also, I have experience working with Power BI, Tableau and datawarehouse. \nI hold 3 citizenships (Dutch, Italian and Brazilian).\nI speak fluently English, Portuguese and Italian. I have a B2 in Spanish and Dutch.",
