The team also participates in the annual Dutch Championships and the Solar1 Cup in Monaco. \n\n- Worked in the hydrodynamics team to improve the performance of hydrofoils in-order to reduce the drag for the required control-ability and required performance under water\n\n- Further, worked on design and assembly of a structure to mount an extra solar panel to obtain the required power\n\n- It was a nice team experience, a good platform to learn about group decision making and also to apply the acquired knowledge to practice",
