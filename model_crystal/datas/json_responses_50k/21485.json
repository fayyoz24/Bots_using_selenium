                    "description": "Thrips are a major pest in many crop species worldwide. Controlling thrips is getting increasingly more difficult due to their improved resistance to pesticides. Pesticides that are still effective against thrips form large risks for other important insect populations such as bees, and are banned from use. This underlines the importance of finding natural resistance factors conferring successful defense against thrips in both commercial and wild varieties. \nThe genus Capsicum, which includes the commercial sweet pepper and chili pepper, is severely affected by thrips. As a consequence of thrips infection, these plants suffer from morphological deformations such as leaf curling and increased infection with viruses that are transmitted by the thrips, resulting in overall yield losses. Among cultivated Capsicum accessions there is a wide range of resistance, however, wild varieties have not been included and can form novel sources of resistance factors.  \nIn this project we strive to reveal novel sustainable metabolites that have antixenotic or antibiotic effects on different thrips species and confer resistance against thrips in the Capscium\ngermplasm. To achieve this aim, we will explore natural resistance in both cultivated and wild Capsicum varieties, in different ontogenetic stages and relate this to plant metabolites that are\nresponsible for these differences. \nThe project is funded by STW and part of the Green defence Against Pests (GAP) program (http://www.stw.nl/nl/programmas/green-defence-against-pests-gap). This program focusses on developing sustainable, environmentally-friendly crop protection agents in collaboration with researchers form five Dutch universities (the UvA, Wageningen University, Utrecht University, Leiden University and Radboud University Nijmegen) and ten agriculture sector companies. The GAP program is one of the five 'Perspective Programs' that received funding from the STW technology foundation and business investors.",
