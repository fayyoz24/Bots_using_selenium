    "summary": "Hi, I am Lorenzo \ud83d\udc4b\nBrand crafter from the depth of my heart and breath of my mind.\n\nI get fired up from brands and products that challenge the status quo and excitement from campaigns that touch people\u2019s hearts and minds. Making a positive impact on someone\u2019s life is what gets me out of bed energized and inspired every morning.\n\nI have had the privilege of working with some of the world's biggest brands and delivering moments of joy to kids throughout Europe. I led the full product development process of tasty yet permissible ice creams specifically designed for Kids #ResponsiblyMadeForKids \u2013 underpinned by strict nutritional standards & a responsible communication plan for the entire Wall's Kids range \ud83d\udc76. The effort was highly valuable, not just for me in terms of learning curve, but also for society and the brand's sales.\n\nWhile working on Dove, I contributed at reshaping beauty standards in the haircare category by leading Global innovations and communication campaigns. I launched a new haircare regime of natural shampoo, conditioners & treatment formats covering the top 4 haircare needs while offering new claims and usage applications. This brought significant increase in brand\u2019s penetration and helped regions gain additional listings and expand brand\u2019s facings at customers.\n\nI love brands. You, too?\nLet\u2019s talk!\nLorenzo",
