    "summary": "Klaas Jan Kliphuis was born and raised in The Netherlands, where he was introduced to photography by his father, who gave him his first camera when he was only 8 years old. Since earning his degree at The Academy of Modern Arts at St.Joost in Breda and having assisted several photographers, he started his own business in 2001. Demand for his work hasn't stopped since. His versatile and creative approach to photography, as well as his unique eye for detail and love for fashion have led to beautifully lit images, both moving and still. Klaas is very involved and always works closely together with the client and the team to get the best possible results.\n\nThroughout his career he never stopped learning himself new things. Wanting to control every single detail of his work, Klaas has developed high level skills in lighting, post-production, motion capture, directing and editing. In his most recent personal project Klaas moves away from fashion, takes up his analogue camera and documents youth and street life in the multicultural parts of his home town Rotterdam. Again something new to him and out of his comfort zone.",
