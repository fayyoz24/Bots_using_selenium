    "summary": "Looking for new opportunities!\n\nPlanned a travel gap year after my graduation which was cut short due to COVID-19. However, this did lead to my current position in the public sector. \n\nBusiness Development Manager at China Business Center Netherlands. \nThis position focuses on business development of innovative business models between China and Europe. CBCN is a business developer that mainly works through franchising and works together with our extensive network of high-level business leaders.\n\nGraduate of the Asian Studies master program at Leiden University. My specialization track is: Politics, Economy, and Society of Asia. \n\nFormer student Chinese Language and Business Management at Zuyd University in Maastricht, the Netherlands. In the second year of my bachelor I choose an international business specialization, which is focused on marketing, law, and doing business abroad. For me it was the perfect combination between the Chinese language (Mandarin) and Business management. \n\nFrom August 2015 till January 2016 I studied an intensive language course at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics in Dalian, China. This study stay abroad improved my language skills and cultural understanding. \n\nContact:\n(+31) 06 38314600 \njantimnobel@gmail.com\nWechat: t13091996",
