At these times put Hydra Storage excess energy into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then stored, to be reconverted at times of energy shortage in energy. In addition, the generated hydrogen can be used for the refueling of hydrogen vehicles. Hydra Storage delivers a modular, easy to install and transport system. This allows decentralized hydrogen can be produced without high investments in infrastructure. Hydrogen is clean, to store a long and has a high energy density. In short, hydrogen is the future!\n\nSelected as Top 8 Finalists during the challenge.",

The main achievements of Attica Toll way concerning guaranteed travel times and smooth traffic flow conditions are important results in the development of toll roads in Greece because the project has changed public attitudes towards paying tolls. created the perception that PPPs are a good thing and confirmed that the user pays principle is socially fair. Providing an effective mechanism to measure continuously the level of service protecting the value of the toll paid by users, as well as to estimate the consequences of any action or decision to the value of the road. Also aiding the decision making process by giving it both forecasting assistance as well as monitoring capabilities. Setting a high standard of service level for itself and all the motorways in Greece. Furthermore, Attica tollway is probably the best proof that can demonstrate the success of this action. Despite the increase of daily traffic, the quality of customer service, high safety level and the innovations brought by the company are highly appreciated by the customers. With the continuous process improvement and technology innovation, Attica Toll way will be able to bring benefit to the more vehicle user, with greater value added experience.",
