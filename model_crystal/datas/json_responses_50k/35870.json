Typical examples of interventions are Government-to-Government cooperation (G2G), International cooperation between knowledge institutions (K2K), matchmaking (missions)  for local entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nFormer positions within RVO.nl:\n-Development and monitoring of international cooperation projects (Government-to-Government / G2G) with Chinese government organizations. The G2G programme aims to contribute to an improved business climate and enhanced opportunities for trade and investment for both countries. Moreover, in 2011 a large number of projects were designed to contributed to environmental protection.\n\n-Developing and monitoring G2G projects in pre-accession countries such as Macedonia, Bulgaria and Romania. Project themes included :police cooperation, public finance, land ownership, environmental protection, health and horticulture.  \n\n-Netherlands Constituency Support Facility.
