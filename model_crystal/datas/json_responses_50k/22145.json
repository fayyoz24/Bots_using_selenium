    "summary": "As Co-owner of Color Technology Consultancy, I develop together with Erik van Biemen and our team members new innovative products for the color technology market. High End, low cost products like our Novel VMAS light booth. The only light booth specially designed for pearl and metallic colors.\n\nIn my former life:\n\nAs an innovative manager with 30 year plus experience in color technology I was responsible for the development of a substantial amount of new game changing color tools.  Tools that became world standards and that opened new solutions for the automotive markets like in 2007 the BYK-mac multi angle instrument and the novel Automatchic Vision in 2015. Both developed together with our partner BYK-Gardner.\n\nLeading teams to deliver tools, services and products in color technology is my main asset next to my domain knowledge. Constructing daring but feasible technology roadmaps and product pipelines with clear deliverables is the way to make new solutions possible that were not available yet.  \t\n\nCharacterization\n- Passionate to create new color technology solutions \n- People manager valuing all levels of craftsmanship and science\n- International recognized expert in color technology including research and attached IT\n- Project manager for complex projects\n- Long-term thinker delivering short, mid and long-term solutions \n- Strategist strong in developing technology roadmaps based on mission and vision statements. \n\nMost important technology development:\n\nProject leader of the Eureka project leading to the BYK-mac gonio spectrophotometer, the world standard for multi angle color and effect measurement. \n\nLink to the Eureka site: http://www.eurekanetwork.org/project/-/id/3037 \nLink to an article in the economist: http://www.economist.com/node/12673142",
