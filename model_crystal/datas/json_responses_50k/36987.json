    "summary": "My insistent curiosity made me a biochemical researcher. My endless enthusiasm led me to communicate science and medical knowledge to experts and general public. My real passion pushed me to work for granting a medical research and development more focused on the needs of patients.  \n\nIn my current position, I contribute to design and implement programs for integrating the patient\u2019s perspective into industry processes (e.g. drug development, alliance building, program & product co-creation and awareness campaigns).\n\nFor many years I collaborated with medical affair professionals to develop overarching medical affairs strategies, including scientific communications plans and productive interactions with medical experts and patient advocates. \n\nMy expertise includes:\n\u2022\tPreparation of information on medicines in plain English targeted to patients and the general public, as well as information targeted to more specialized audiences including healthcare professionals\n\u2022\tDevelopment of talking points to be used by medicines regulatory authorities across Europe in order to respond to public queries and concerns related to medicines \n\u2022\tWriting reports with strategic insights for business partners, translating complex medical information into key messages and identifying the scientific exchange needs of the relevant stakeholders \n\u2022\tCreation and execution of clinical and scientific content for educational/sponsored medical events in live and/or virtual settings, satellite symposia, and advisory boards, with main focus on oncology and haemato-oncology\n\u2022\tPreparation of post-meeting materials such as advisory board executive summaries, international conference coverage synopses, and newsletters for sponsors, physicians, and/or patients.\n\u2022\tReview of investigator\u2019s proposals for clinical studies in close collaboration with sponsors\n\nIn my work I can always count on the friendly and productive relationship with KOLs and patient\u2019 advocates established in the past years. Together we have successfully concluded different activities for international sponsors and patient\u2019 advocacy groups.\n\nMy strong organizational and time management skills allow me to meet deadlines and achieve expectations of all assigned projects on time, on-budget, and with high quality/compliant results that lead to customer satisfaction.\n\nMy colleagues know my positive attitude and ability in creating a joyful and collaborative working environment. \n\nDuring my free-time, I love  working as a volunteer in poverty alleviation activities and assistance to people with disabilities.",
