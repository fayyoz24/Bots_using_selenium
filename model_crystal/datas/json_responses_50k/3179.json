What kind of multi-actor, stakeholder participation and social learning processes are needed to achieve sustainability transformations in the civil engineering domain? And how to design and integrate such processes? These questions are central in my research and education at the University of Twente. I enjoy collaborating with practitioners and combining insights from public administration, environmental studies, transition studies and related fields to make a difference In Twente and Overijssel as well as beyond.",
