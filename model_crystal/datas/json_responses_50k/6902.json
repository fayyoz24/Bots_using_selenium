    "summary": "In 2011, Marc Andreessen famously wrote a Wall Street Journal essay declaring that \u201csoftware is eating the world.\u201d Today, our lives are changing because of software innovation. All industries such as Retail, Automotive, Travel, Transport, Media, Logistics\u2026 have been taken by storm by new innovative concepts and disruptive forces.\nIn this digital era, innovative leaders more than ever understand that software innovation needs to be a fundamental base of the company\u2019s DNA and culture. \n\nSoftware development teams need to build innovative, secure and reliable software and ship faster than the competition. For many organizations, the Technology has never been so complex with a hybrid of old and new systems. They also compete fiercely for talented programmers and for retaining them.\nIn consequence, they need to change their culture, adopt new methods such as Innersource, and implement best-of-breed DevOps toolchain to meet new timelines and business goals.\n\nGitHub offers a powerful development platform to help build reliable software faster, and the knowledge and expertise to help you along the way.\nMore than 70,000 businesses securely develop software on GitHub embracing a culture of collaboration and transparency which we\u2019ve championed for the last 10 years within the GitHub community and its 28 Million developers worldwide.\n\nI am passionate with my team in meeting with companies who are facing those challenges and helping them in their journey.\n\nIt is with a great sense of responsibility that I\u2019m striving to deliver my best work everyday.\n\nWith our expanded network of users and technology partners that grows exponentially every day, the impact on the innovation that we see in our daily life will only have our imagination as the limit",
