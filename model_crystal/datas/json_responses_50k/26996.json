    "summary": "I'm a research engineer who is passionate about implementing novel medical imaging techniques in clinical applications. I have experience in medical image acquisition, reconstruction, post-processing and machine learning and an affinity with curating medical biomarkers and using machine learning tools for regression and classification.\n\nMy post-doctoral research focuses on using multi-modal MRI techniques for differentially diagnosing movement disorders, using iron-sensitive MRI, neuromelanin MRI, morphological features on T1-weighted images and diffusion-weighted MRI for assessing white-matter integrity in the brain. \n\nI'm a principal investigator on a clinical study investigating the benefit of quantitative MRI for diagnosing parkinsonisms. This project is funded by a personal grant from Parkinson NL.\n\nI like to deliver results beyond academic papers, with code and tools made publicly available.\n\nMy PhD in was MRI physics, focused on rapid MR image acquisition using Simultaneous Multi-Slice MRI. This Accelerated MRI by acquiring data from multiple slices. I designed tailored waveforms using digital filter design and constrained optimization which incorporate physical hardware limitations. This way, novel imaging techniques can be used without the need to upgrade hardware, using merely a 'software'-solution.\n\nI trained as an electrical and electronic engineer at Imperial College London, with emphasis on signal processing and digital filtering.",

Shorter scans can also reduce image artefacts due to body motion either caused by breathing or patient motion.\n\nThe technique I work on to accelerate MRI acquisition is known as multiband imaging, which accelerates the acquisition of volumetric MRI data by acquiring multiple slices simultaneously.\n\nAn essential part of this imaging methods is to transmit multiband radio-frequency (RF) pulses, which are short pulses transmitted from RF antennas within the MRI system into the patients body. Multiband RF pulses are special because they act on multiple slices simultaneously.\n\nThe more slices the better as it relates to the acceleration of your scan time. However high acceleration leads to either:\n1) Pulses which are too long in duration, take too long to transmit and lead to signal loss.\n2) Pulses with require too much power, which cannot be transmitted using modern hardware. \n\nFinding the perfect balance between these two is main topic of my PhD.",
