Furthermore, I worked on the Groningen earthquake dossier looking at the dynamic external landscape and how Shell as part of the Gasgebouw can support the winddown of the Groningen gas field. \nIn addition, I worked on various offshore wind announcements, such as the 100% acquisition of Shell NoordzeeWind, the Netherlands' first offshore wind farm and Shell's participation in and eventual winning of the offshore wind tender for Hollandse Kust (noord). Closely collaborating with our partners, we managed to take further steps in the energy transition and demonstrate our commitment to the Netherlands.",
