Our team of product management, R&D and Consumer Research (CMI) worked on this product since more than 2 years. It is based on the validated insight that people who like to watch the movie at home don't like the \" black bars\" above and below the movie screen. Why not see the entire picture as the director shot it? This television was another innovation by Philips filling an unmet need of millions of movie lovers who watch movies at home. The link attached shows the viral online campaign \"Carrousel\" which made the television popular across entire Europe within weeks. ",
