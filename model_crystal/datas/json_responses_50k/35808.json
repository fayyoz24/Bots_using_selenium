I've always been interested in connecting with others on a deeper level, understanding how they choose to live their lives, seeing the way they love, what they value in their work, where they find happiness and learn from their experiences. After so many years I'm still as excited to observe life unfolding and photograph that in a way that\u2019s personal and meaningful to those who choose me to tell their stories through images.",
