    "summary": "I\u2019m a proactive and direct service delivery manager. I have a structured way of working; I value a good overview of the situation and proper planning. I set goals and work hard to get there and involve others to do so. \n\nAfter my studies in Business administration, I developed my skills via a wide range of PMO roles with end clients such as PostNL, KLM and EPO with a focus on financial management, planning and resource management). As a service management for Logius I was mostly involved in setting the service agreements, creating and controlling SLA\u2019s, reporting and resourcing. In my delivery manager roles for ASICS and KLM my problem-solving attitude helped me to get the right resources at the right projects. Besides being delivery manager for these clients I also run a center of excellence for test automation, this shows my flexibility and ability to manage diverse stakeholders. \n\nIn my free time I like to go on long walks with my dog and to spend time with my friends and family.",
