    "summary": "In the semiconductor (ASML) and automotive industry (VDO Mannesmann, Siemens, TomTom) I build up a lot of experience as PM, PL, TL and Scrum master. Due to my background as software engineer, I am best to be described as foreman. With respect to content I know what is going on and what the complexity of an assignment will be. I can perfectly validate alternatives, aim on efficiency and manage targeted. With a team I am able to start and finish projects (including the deployment and acceptance). My skills in reporting, planning and communication make it possible to steer where necessary together with the customer. I know what is going on in the team (also on personal level) and how to motivate the team for longer time. Last years I have done projects in the test automation (test frameworks, test runners, simulators) in Python. In the past projects were mainly in GPS/sensor positioning (TUDelft). I am an enthusiastic and flexible PL who goes for results (pit-bull type). I aspire to work as PL/PM/SM in innovative projects with lots of puzzles and challenges. Theoretical knowledge was acquired with courses, like \u201cprofessional leadership\u201d, \u201cscrum master\u201d and \"Prince2\". Practical knowledge and experience was build up over the years while working as Foreman, PL/PM and scrum master. In the context of test automation I passed ISTQB foundation.\nI am author and publisher of the iPhone/Android app: ClickCard* (App is not available anymore).\nHobbies are scuba diving, walking (with the dogs), jogging and travelling.",

Each architect had to install tools on their machine before going to the customer, which had to be maintained. Further each architects did the code analysis in a different way. This project formalizes static code analysis at customer code by creating a virtual machine with tooling (Understand, CPD, Cpplint). As product owner I organized meetings to collect the requirements from the stakeholders and to discuss the implementation of the Virtual Machine. I maintained the backlog, prioritized the tasks and created the planning. Organized team meetings to brainstorm about the way to go. As scrum master I was leader of the scrum sessions, organized planning- and retrospective-meetings. Reported the progress to the managers and stakeholders. The team was a very young team which needed a lot of steering. Therefore, I helped with environment setup and python scripting. Further the team members (5-6 persons) were just temporary working on the project, which made documentation more important than normal. We were able to deliver the Virtual Machine with tooling according to the time planning",

Further ASML needed test tooling to facilitate and simplify testing. Parts of the tooling was needed for CICD. In this function in test automation I had several roles. As PL/TL/PO/Scrum master I leaded 1 or 2 teams of 7 persons in total. Further I was software engineer/architect in test automation. As team we created/maintained the Twist, multiple Test runner/convertors and a Test Runner tool (called TestStreet). With the test framework ASML was able to create automated test cases. The test framework contained 1 million lines of code and with the adapted external libraries even 4 million. I was the product owner of Twist and maintained the backlog. As team we were constantly looking opportunities to improve, facilitate and simplify testing. As Project lead I steered the brainstorm session to come to better results. Examples of the test runner/convertors that we created are the parallel running of test (to speed up testing) and tooling for test conversion to make testcases suitable for different product. Test Runner tool TestStreet that we invented and created, runs automated tests in the build pipeline of the LithoInsight and Yieldstar division of ASML. Of this product I was also the product owner. TestStreet setups automatically the test equipment, installs the build, selects and installs the correct version of the test framework. Further it queues the tests, runs the tests and reports the test results (green/red). It takes care that the limited test equipment is used in the most efficient way. The team was judged as very valuable to ASML,  leading to highest possible score in the evaluation. Team budget was up to 1 Million Euro per year.",
