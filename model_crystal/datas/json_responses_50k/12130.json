The transparent and neutral remuneration system uses a set of criteria for grading that is based on relevant work experience. The set-up corresponds to the recommendations from studies conducted by the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights (CRM).\n* Draft a report on social safety and labor market discrimination in response to the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment.\n* Co-develop the Cross-Cultural Competences training that gives insight in the surplus value of diversity in projects and teams.\n* Initiate the Active Bystander training that helps to react adequately when witnessing unacceptable behavior. The session offers four tactics and four techniques to deal with poor behavior. In a follow-up session, colleagues can practice intervening in a problematic situation.\n* Arrange a temporary paid position for scholars who suffer from grave threats to their lives, liberty and well-being in their homeland.
