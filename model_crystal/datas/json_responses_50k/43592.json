I acted as the treasurer of the organization. 2017 marked the national parliamentary elections that GroenLinks won with a major victory. We had our own campaign with the goal of getting the youth in the Netherlands out to vote.\n\nThis year also marked the largest increase in members of our organisation, and thus our financial income. I had to lead the transition to more financially prosperous times.\n\nWith my expertise in IT I also helped DWARS getting up to date with state of the art practices, improving our workflow. Something else I'm especially proud of is organising two days for the US Green Party candidate Jill Stein. We lead her through NGO's in the Netherlands, and organised a large lecture for politically engaged youth.",
