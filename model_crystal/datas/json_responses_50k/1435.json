The project group was linked to the Dutch United Nations Student Association (DUNSA) Groningen. The aim of the conference was to organize an interactive and informative conference on humanitarian action in natural disaster situations. My project group was able to gather all the major names in the field of humanitarian action which has made the day into a success. You can find a description of the day below. \n\n\nAid Conference: After Immense Disaster \n28 november 2011\n\n\nWho is responsible for providing emergency aid? When is aid called emergency aid and when does one speak of development aid? Who is responsible for the preparation of countries for natural disasters? These are some of the questions that will be adressed during the conference organized by the Student Association for International Relations (SIB). \n\nWith a wonderful list of speakers like Cees Breederveld (CEO of the Red Cross), Leonie Barnes, Joost Herman and Thea Hilhorst, but also representatives of Cordaid, Oxfam Novib and the Red Cross we can look forward to an interesting day. \n\nThe conference will be held in English; both Dutch and Foreign participants are welcome. There is no entrance fee and we will serve a delicious lunch. We hope to welcome you on our conference.",
