    "summary": "I am a seasoned life sciences veteran with 20+ years of experience in building and leading large complex global life sciences localization operations on both the buyer and supplier side, laser-focusing on pharmaceutical and clinical organizations. Especially now, in times of a pandemic, global clinical trials are  gaining tremendous momentum. Being ready and prepared to support sponsors in their commitment to provide new treatments, is what drives me. \n\nDuring my leadership roles, I successfully built and consolidated profitable life sciences business units while maintaining a healthy P&L. Continuously calculating risks and thinking out-of-the-box have helped me in that respect to meet pharma clients' targets.\n\nIn parallel, I have been organizing and moderating subject matter expert Life Sciences Business Round Tables (2005-2018) as well as co-hosting subject matter conferences, e.g. the Medical device and Pharmaceutical Labeling Conference. With these events, I fuel my in-depth knowledge of market trends and developments in the life sciences industry space and offer training opportunities to my team.\n\nIn addition, I served President and Executive Board Member of the European Language Industry association from 2016 till 2021.",

As part of this role, we validate clinical trial and pharmacovigilance materials, in order to advice  and provide meaningful research data to our pharma clients. On the other hand, I consult the business development group in their sales strategy, provide background information about pharma related trends in this highly regulated market and participate in client calls.\n\nWith my many years of leadership experience on both the client and commercials side, it is my responsibility to outline the strategic direction of our Life Sciences business Unit at CQ fluency and reach the next level by developing USPs and optimizing efficiencies on all fronts. In our group, we aim to successfully collaborate with cross functional teams in order to optimize delivery, meet client SLAs and actively drive revenue growth and profit, while meeting our bold strategic company goals. My hybrid role enables me to work very closely with and influence the business development group to successfully drive forward clinical and pharma revenue opportunities for new life sciences customers. \n\nMy 13 years of organizing and moderating the life sciences business round table have enabled me to build a very strong network, share my strong in-depth clinical, pharmaceutical and medical device industry knowledge, identify life sciences opportunities for growth, and anticipate the many  regulatory changes in the highly dynamic life sciences industry.",
