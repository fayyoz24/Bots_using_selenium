    "summary": "I'm Ilja, an ambitious and enthusiastic young professional with 1.5 years experience in public affairs at Dutch and European level. I love the dynamics that characterize (international) politics and policy making. During my interdisciplinary and international studies I have developed good analytical skills. I always look at issues from different perspectives to be able to form a complete and nuanced picture. My curiosity makes me want to get to the bottom of something. Colleagues have given feedback that I absorb information quickly, ask relevant questions, and have an eye for detail. \n\nGiven my recent research into the effectiveness of the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) clause in the EU's trade agreements, I would love to explore further topics concerning (the spreading of norms via) international trade. In my free time I am currently taking part in the Young Fair Trade Advocates Academy of the Fair Trade Advocacy Office where I am learning about sustainable and fair EU trade policies. Thus, I am very open towards opportunities in international trade and/or fair trade.",
