This was an eye-opening experience into how a developing country manages with the struggles of drought and a difficult climate."

We were able to see the current work being done to construct a new hospital building with a trauma centre, emergency ward, and maternity block.\nI was able to spend time talking with current patients and successfully found areas in need of funding and support to help improve the quality of life of them and their loved ones.\nOne of the most interesting things while at the hospital was learning from the Doctor heading up the cutting-edge mycobacterial research lab about the treatment of leprosy reactions, drug resistance, and breakthrough healing methods."
