            "description": "During my Dance industry minor studies at Fontys University, I have had the pleasure to work on an assignment for a special client, in that case, being IMS Ibiza. Over several weeks, I had to research, brainstorm and create a new concept for the IMS Ibiza conference edition 2020. With different requirements, at hand, the newly developed concept demanded to be produced uniquely, hopefully, distinguished from regular panel formats, and covering a topic that has not yet been discussed. The stimulation behind providing this assignment occurred where the client seeks content development and possible inspiration from uprising professionals in the industry and a fresh perspective on ongoing matters within the branch.\n\nThe assignment was presented in a competition format to the whole class and distributed between four groups of three to four students each, where only one group would be the winner and be able to work at the conference and potentially realise the designed concept. Alongside the concept creation itself, a full report had to be written, explaining each step of the way and defending the choices that were made. After careful considerations and pitching to the client, I am happy to share that my group won with the following topic:\n\n\"HOW EVOKING A GLOBAL CODE OF CONDUCT CAN TACKLE THE CORE CHALLENGES IN THE DANCE MUSIC INDUSTRY\"",

In turn, it also led to having  various internal clients within the music and arts industry and such label and publication mananagemnt to Tribal Music Group.\n\nInitially, the lockdown conditions meant that I had to digitize my approach to events, artist promotion, programming, production, and marketing.
