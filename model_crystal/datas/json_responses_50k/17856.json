Responsible policy, management and design of innovation is a task I am motivated to fulfill in my professional future. My motivation is to build bridges in order to sustainably shape our interaction with technology in a creative and communicative environment. In order to do that transnationally, I am dedicated to improving the four languages i am currently speaking next to my mother tongue (French, Italian, Dutch and English).\n\nMy prior experience focuses on health services and public health, as well as education and science communication in the public sector. \nBesides my professional interests, I am acting or educating myself on social justice issues, focusing on gender inequality. Otherwise, you will find me outside, looking for the next scenery for analogue photographyor going for a run.",
