    "summary": "I have completed my studies and gained a few years of experience in the field of human rights. The topics I am especially passionate about and focus on are business and human rights; refugee, migrant and minority rights; peace and conflict studies; and human rights education. While the professional experience I have acquired mainly concentrates on those areas, it encompasses a spectrum of organization types spanning from NGOs, non-profits to intergovernmental/multilateral organizations. \nDue to having visited and lived in multiple countries, I enjoy contributing to the promotion of human rights as part of an international and multicultural work environment. My geographical areas of focus are mainly (West) Africa and Central and South America.\nI find human rights very fascinating since it features and combines a lot of multidisciplinary angles as well as relates to a variety of other study/work fields, which in turn allows me to constantly challenge and \ndevelop myself in this field.",
