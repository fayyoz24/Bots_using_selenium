This usually happens twice a year (one when the weather in warmer and one when there is the cold white stuff on the ground).  The multi colored one means 3 - 6 nights.  The Maid will usually hire an Apprentice Maid.  This happens more frequently and at various times of the year.  Then there is a dark blue one.  This means The Maid is leaving for 2-3 nights. If there is white stuff on the ground, she will hire an Apprentice Maid.  If there is no white stuff, Older Maid will stop by to meet my needs.  Older Maid is nice and comes by even when The Maid is not here, but that's something else.  She smells kind of like The Maid, but different, too.  \nIf you need suitcase psychic abilities, I am available.",
