    "summary": "I am an IT professional with over 15 years of work experience, primarily focused on IT Infrastructure as a Service. Having sat on both the customer and supplier side of the table in roles ranging from consultant/architect to project manager allows me to view a project and its aspects from multiple perspectives. \n\nMy primary goal in a project is to empower the team members to work efficiently, meet project deadlines, and ensure a smooth transition of any type of project. I aim to achieve this by ensuring the foundation and framework of a project are as clear as possible, while also ensuring the project can pivot when necessary.\n\nI am a certified TOGAF 9.1 architect and Solution Matter Expert on a multitude of Pure Storage & Dell EMC products. I am currently working on my PRINCE2 certification, with the goal to continue training towards Agile/SAFe certifications.",
