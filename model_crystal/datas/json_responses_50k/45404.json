The experiments I designed mostly included cell culture, siRNA transfection and flow cytometry but I also had to use other techniques in parallel such as immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, epifluorescence microscopy, RT-qPCR and live cell imaging. During my stay I also had to prepare samples for mass spectrometry analysis with the highest cleanliness.\n\nThis internship made me grow a lot as a junior scientist as I had to design my own experiments, handle many samples in parallel and operate complex instruments on my own. Even though I faced some technical issues during my internship, I managed to troubleshoot them efficiently.",

This double approach allowed to me work with several mammalian cell lines (Cos, HEK293), transfect them using different transfecting agents, perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments and become more independant in image analysis (epifluorescent microscopy and ImageJ).\n2) Delta opioid receptor (DOR) recycling in wild-type and KO-GASP mice. The experimental procedure consisted of daily intraperitoneal injections, brain extraction, membrane preparation and radiolabeling of DOR. \n\nThis internship gave me a lot of very valuable experience as I had the chance to practice different cellular and molecular biology research methods, I also got a better insight into in vivo experimentation.
