    "summary": "Is change fun? Definitely! Organisational change has many aspects. It is varied, challenging, unpredictable and enervating. It is never ending. Change in itself may not be fun to many people in an organisation but I believe bringing about and managing change is rewarding. Developing a clear new direction, redesigning the organisation, implementing change strategies, and facilitating the dialogue about the change makes for an interesting and dynamic profession. \n\nIn my 27 years of working with(in) international corporates I have found many gratifying moments in changing organisations. Feeling a sense of euphoria when achieving results together and pride when clients appreciate the change. I love the humour that can be found when people start to experiment with other behaviour as well as the spirit in a team when you shape the change together. The energy boost you get being exposed to a powerful source of inspiration is exhilarating.\n\nI enjoy working as a spider in the web, with quick creative thinking and focus on the desired state. Offering a pragmatic approach, I believe a solution is always achievable, regardless of the complexity or resistance met along the way. Using out-of-the-box ideas combined with solid proven standards, along with direct and open communication, we will be able to achieve the most effective change and transformational journey together. \n\nContact details:\nTel.: +31 (0)6 230779951\nE-mail: amelievanheijningen@gmail.com\n \n\nSAP related:\nIndependent senior consultant for SAP R/3 Sales & Distribution (SD) who has worked extensively in the analysis, design, construction, implementation and improvement of SAP ERP systems in complex international environments combined with project management and Coaching.\nEnthusiastic, energetic, pragmatic and customer oriented person who likes working in a team.
