    "summary": "A wise person once said: \u201dIf something is important enough you should try. Even if the probable outcome is failure.\u201d\n\nDedication, team spirit and ambition are my greatest strengths!\n\nI am a South African who has been living in Europe since 2015 (Austria Dec 2015-March 2018, and Netherlands March 2018-present).\n\nI am a conscientious person who works extremely hard and pays special attention to detail.  I am flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances, quick to pick up new skills and eager to work with others. I am very enthusiastic and love working with people that have a positive energy.\n\nI set high standards for quality and quantity, and I consistently aim at achieving project goals to perfection.  I have shown that I\u2019m able to make prompt, clear decisions, which may involve tough choices or considered risks.\n\nI excel in a high-pressured environment, keeping to schedules and commitments.  I have extensive experience in corporate environments and service industries. This gave me the varied skills needed and the ability to work with the demands of different clients and stakeholders.\n\nI believe that building a strong and diverse team brings structure and culture with a positive and exciting energy to the workforce. I can establish good relationships with people from all ages and walks of life, and relate well to people at all levels.  A positive attitude with the willingness to learn are the key ingredients to succeeding in life.\n\nI am in the process of completing 3 courses to up-skill in BI Analytics and Data Analytics:\n- Qlik Sense Analytics Development\n- Complete SQL Bootcamp 2021\n- Complete Python Bootcamp 2021\n\nI am in the process of completing a study course in full-stack web development.
