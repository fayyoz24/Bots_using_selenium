    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Mark, thanks for stopping by.  My work life is two-fold; I teach at the Hanze University (www.hanze.nl) in Groningen, The Netherlands and I work as an NGO volunteer  for PUM (www.pum.nl) in the areas of hospitality management and tourism.\n\nWhat I enjoy most about teaching is the student contact.  Whether it\u2019s lecturing, coaching or (graduation) project supervision I get energized talking to and with students about various management subjects.\n\nI\u2019ve taught in Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, South Africa, Ukraine and The Netherlands (home base for me).  I\u2019m a lucky guy who gets to do what he loves and travel.\n\nIn my NGO life, I\u2019ve had the opportunity of travelling to various parts of the world and working  with  small and medium size hospitality organizations to refine their service offering and marketing strategy.  I really enjoy working with professionals that have a passion for their work. The experience I gain helps me in my capacity as a lecturer enormously.\n\nMy goal is to combine my work as a lecturer (read: educator) and NGO activities.  I\u2019d like to leverage my higher education experience (20 years) with hospitality and tourism management (20 years) and volunteerism (2 years).\n\nLots of information below.  Don\u2019t see enough, contact me, always willing to provide more.",
