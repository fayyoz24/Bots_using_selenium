I went through major relevant Underwriters Laboratories standards for the V2G chargers in the US. Unlike Europe, the standardization of chargers is not a mandatory requirement in the US. \nFormulated the Bill of materials during the projects and updated it with the course of improvements in the prototypes. \nMade standard procedures for the development of new products with respect to standardization right from the concept phase to the market proceedings. \nContributed to the development of the prototypes as a team member and developed standard pre-test conducted on the prototypes.",

The battery capacity was limited to 50kWh as the charging infrastructure is not optimized in the sub-continent.  The parameters were designed taking the feasibility of the EV in the mind.",

To make the vehicle lightweight a dual chain sprocket transmission was used. \nA 100W polycrystalline solar panel was used as the car's roof along with a 24V 100Ah battery pack placed alongside the driver to maintain the Centre of Gravity. \nThe solar car had a maximum speed of 40 kmph with a driver plus kerb load of 200 kg.  The motor earlier used was rated 2 kW BLDC motor which was later replaced by PMDC motor of same specifications. The total cost of fabrication of the vehicle was \u20b980,000 (around US$ 1000).\nAs the vice-captain, I was responsible for the timely execution of the project and creating a communication bridge among different departments. I was also responsible for the electrical and electronic department where we as a team fabricated an in-house low-cost rear vehicle detection system and a speedometer.",
