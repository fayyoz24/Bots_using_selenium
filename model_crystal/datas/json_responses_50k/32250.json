    "summary": "I am Kay Karen Abeka and I am 28 years old. I grew up in Accra-Ghana where my interest in tourism management evolved. Furthermore, I had always been interested in geography and the desire to travel and study abroad. It therefore became easier for me to study and live in the Netherlands since my parents are Dutch. \nI graduated  with a bachelor degree of Tourism Management at NHTV, with specialization in International Tourism and Travel Industry (ITTI); and following my minor E-travel where I studied the modules; Online Marketing, Social Media Marketing, SEO audit, E-business audit, Websites and Systems, Customer Engagement Management and Project management.\nConsequently, I see myself working in a variety of industries and not only in the tourism sector. Due to my experiences from working in the Retail industry, I believe I can be a sales/marketing manager or customer support analyst as well.  Preferably,  I would like to work on a full time basis and even though I currently live in Rotterdam, I have no problem at all if I have to relocate to an apartment closer to my future work or commune by public transport.",
