It was my job to manage the team and their deliverables (mainly in Amersfoort) and to update the customer to discuss about results, priority and planning (ASML, Veldhoven).\n\nWhen I joined the project in April 2014, the customer was no longer satisfied with the team's output and the results delivered. It was my job to identify the key issues and to present and execute an improvement plan. As a result there have been some drastic changes with respect to the way of working and reporting and I've started with implementing Scrum. This has contributed directly in improving the team's motivation, improving the team's output and increasing the customer satisfaction.

During this period I've worked together with a colleague on creating and implementing an automated test environment for testing the latest DVB-T demodulator chip. This test environment not only includes controlling the chip and gathering/analyzing it's output but also control and (de-)activate the peripherals (i.e.g. digital and analog signal generators) required for test execution. The result was logged in an excel (.csv) file which could be used again as input for the next test.",
