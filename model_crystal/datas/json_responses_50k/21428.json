Using the model-based systems engineering approach and the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), the team came up with an innovatively designed eSupercharger driven by a switched reluctance motor (SRM) which has an integrated compressor by making double winded rotor slots for the SRM. To end different specifications for eSuperchargers such that they can be fitted on a range of engines a Quasi Static model was created. The eSupercharger designed proved to have a big advantage for a 0-100 km/h acceleration.\nThe university found our approach the most scientific and most innovative. ",
