    "summary": "With over 12+ years of extensive expertise spanning the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Fast-Moving Consumer Durables (FMCD), and athletic apparel sectors, I have cultivated a robust professional profile in the domains of supply chain management, merchandising, and sales forecasting. Throughout my career, I have collaboratively engaged with renowned industry leaders, including Asian Paints, Nestle, and Gulf Oil Lubricants, and presently hold a pivotal role at Nike, overseeing marketplace operations for Eastern European distributors.\n\nIn my capacity as a specialist in marketplace operations, my responsibilities encompass a comprehensive spectrum of tasks, encompassing analysis and management of order books, seamless coordination of order processing and delivery scheduling, and the meticulous tracking of revenue streams and forecasts on both weekly and seasonal cycles. Meanwhile, I'm also involved in improving operational processes and overseeing projects to enhance Nike's internal tools and systems. My strong commitment to excellent customer service, making supply chains work better, and boosting sales defines how I approach my work.\n\nComplementing my profound practical knowledge is a postgraduate diploma in management conferred by AIMA Delhi, a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and growth. My linguistic aptitude spans over English, Hindi, Kannada, and currently at beginner level in Dutch. Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm an ardent cricket enthusiast, embodying values of loyalty, commitment, and teamwork.",
