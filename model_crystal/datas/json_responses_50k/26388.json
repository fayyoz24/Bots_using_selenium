            "description": "Reducing emissions from shipping has increasingly become a challenge over the last years, both as a counter measure against global climate change and to protect local environments and population from waste, gas emissions and noise. This challenge has been documented both in policy papers, like the Europe 2020 initiative or the Transport White Paper, and in rules and regulations issued by IMO as well as by local authorities. Those legislations as well as emission taxes and an increasing public awareness on green shipping have led to the fact, that low emission ships and shipping has become a key competitive factor both for European shipbuilders (including equipment manufacturers and shipyards) and shipping companies.\n\nIn response to topic SST.2013.1-2 of the Sustainable Transport Work Programme 2013 the JOULES proposal aims to significantly reduce the gas emissions of European built ships, including CO2, SOx, NOx and particulate matters. JOULES follows an integrated and holistic approach, not only limited to integrating the components of the simulation of the energy grid, but through the consideration of other viable options for emission reduction.\n\nThe specific optimal solutions for emission reduction and energy efficiency highly depend on the transport or service task of ships, as well as on their operational profile. While a wide overview and holistic assessment of all available energy and emission saving technologies is necessary, industrial breakthrough can only be achieved if the available solutions are selected, adopted, integrated, assessed and finally demonstrated for realistic application cases. The binding element between technologies and applications are modelling and assessment methods and tools. Those are needed to predict the behaviour of complex energy grids, to manage the energy demand in operation and to assess the performance of optimized energy grids both in view of cost efficiency and environmental impact.",

            "description": "With the climate change coming to the forefront of society's perception, there is increasing pressure on all industries to reduce CO2 emissions through increased efficiency, and the maritime industry is no exception.\n\nThe objective of ULYSSES project is to demonstrate, through a combination of ultra slow speeds and complementary technologies, that the efficiency of the world fleet can be increased to a point where the following CO2 targets are met:\n\n       - Before 2020, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels,\n\n       - Beyond 2050, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to 1990 levels.\n\nULYSSES focuses on bulk carriers and tankers as these ship types produce 60% of the CO2 from ocean-going vessels. As bulk carriers and tankers are reasonably similar in design and operation, it is felt that investigating these ships will give the best value for money in terms of potential impact of the project. Additionally, it is more technically challenging to reduce the speed of these ship types as they are relatively slow speed already and therefore it is expected that directional stability and other seakeeping issues will arise. However, the results of the project will be directly transferable to other ship types.\n\nTo achieve these goals, it is expected that the target speeds will be:\n\n- Phase I \u2013 Existing vessel in 2020: ~10 knots,\n\n- Phase II \u2013 New vessel built in 2020: ~7.5 knots,\n\n- Phase III \u2013 New vessel built in 2050: ~5 knots.",
