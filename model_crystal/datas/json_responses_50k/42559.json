However, what has not been tested before is how distance influences the relationship between headquarters\u2019 innovation performance and subsidiaries innovation. Therefore, this study investigates: \u201cHow does subsidiaries innovation influence headquarters\u2019 innovation performance and how is this relationship moderated by distance?\u201d The types of distance that are included in this study are geographic, cultural, and knowledge distance. This study was tested in the semi-conductor industry, since patent data is used to see the innovation and patents are frequently used in this industry. \n\nThe results indicate that the general relationship: \u201cSubsidiaries innovation positively impacts headquarters\u2019 innovation performance\u201d is confirmed in all cases. However, the results for geographic and cultural distance show that these variables have no impact on the general relationship. The results of knowledge distance show, however, that it is not significant on the general relationship but it is significant on the dependent variable headquarters\u2019 innovation performance.\n\nRecommendations for future research are, firstly, to take into account more time since it takes a lot of time to get accurate data when using patent data. Secondly, only three control variables that consisted of limitations are included in this study and it is likely that other control variables have a different effect on the results. Thirdly, other types of distance (such as linguistic and political distance) can have an impact on the relationship between headquarters\u2019 innovation performance and subsidiaries innovation and should therefore also be tested. Finally, only one industry, the semi-conductor industry, is investigated in this study and it is likely that other industries that are for example less technology advanced show different results.",

Experience has been thoroughly investigated over the years, but these different types of experience were not investigated together which makes the knowledge scattered and not consolidated. The different types of experience that were taken into account in this thesis are experience with the specific entry mode, experience with host country/industry/similar investments, and experience of other companies. The theory that was used in this thesis was the theory of organizational learning, since companies can learn from their past behavior and they can use this experience in the new situation they are involved in.  \n\nThe result shows that only substantial experience with host country/industry/similar investments will lead to a switch from a Joint Venture to a Wholly Owned Subsidiary. The other two types of experience will not lead to a switch, but they stay with the particular entry mode when this mode was successful. What needs to be considered is that host country experience turned out to be one of the most important variables, since most studies that were examined during this thesis concluded that in the end much is related to host country experience. Managers should consider these types of experience, since the result has shown that these types of experience do have an impact on the choice between a Joint Venture and a Wholly Owned Subsidiary. ",
