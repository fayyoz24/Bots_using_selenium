    "summary": "I am a legal expert and practitioner in international investment law, commercial arbitration and Corporate Social Responsibility. \n\nCurrently, I am serving as a Director of Dispute Prevention of the Asia Pacific FDI Network (APFN), which is the most important organization in the region that focuses on researching foreign direct investment and facilitating cooperation among over 100 scholars and 50 institutions. \n\nCombining academic and practical experience, I am focusing on investment law, commercial arbitration and CSR. The output of my research includes a monograph, an edited volume and numerous peer-reviewed articles and reports. In my academic work, I have contributed to the issue of balancing the rights and obligations of host states and foreign investors in international investment law. My book \u201cThe Right of States to Regulate in International Investment Law: The Search for Balance between Public Interest and Fair and Equitable Treatment\u201d (https://law-store.wolterskluwer.com/s/product/right-of-investors-to-receive-fair-equitable-treatment-right-states-reg-publ-int/01t0f00000NY5cN, Wolters Kluwer, 2019) is an in-depth book, specifically helpful for practitioners, focusing on the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard in IIAs . \n\nI am also a consultant to international organisations. As a legal consultant to the investment team of UNCTAD, I have contributed to the World Investment Report 2019. I have extensive experience working on complex projects within the private sector on issues related to sustainability, environmental law and CSR. I consult UNECE on issues concerning trade and SMEs and I have also advised on Russian law in relation to the legal aspects of foreign direct investment. \n\nI am also a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb), which is the recognised global and trusted thought leader on ADR, operating in multiple jurisdictions.  Additionally, I am sitting as an arbitrator in international commercial disputes.  \n\nAs a speaker, I enjoy presenting my research at different international venues, such as the UNCTAD World Investment Forums (2018 and 2019). Over the years, I have initiated and organized numerous international conferences i.e. on COVID-19 and investment law (2020) and the ECT modernisation process (2021), meetings and panel sessions in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\nOpen for collaboration.

It covers the question whether international investment law restricts state sovereignty in an unacceptable way, in particular the freedom of host states to develop national policies and regulation for the improvement of the environment.\nThis book first analyzes the interaction between international investment law and the protection of the environment on the basis of concepts such as sustainable development, fair and equitable treatment, and international responsibility. Secondly, several chapters discuss challenges which are encountered in attempts to integrate environmental concerns in investment policies in specific sectors and regions (e.g. climate change, water pollution, renewable and nuclear energy, and the European Union region). And, thirdly, specific case studies illustrate the legal and policy tensions between investment law and environmental protection, namely Vattenfall\u2019s disputes with Germany, legal clashes between Chevron and Ecuador, and multinational mining companies\u2019 conflicts in Indonesia.\nThe contributions are written by international experts in this fiel and are of interest to valuable for policy makers and practitioners, who can use the insights provided as a guide in their work.",

The publication date is expected in the Summer/Fall 2014. ",

What are the consequences of that?\n \nFirstly, illegal logging  is a driving force behind deforestation, which accounts for about 20% of global greenhouse emissions. The reduction of  deforestation, by eliminating  illegal logging, is the easiest ways to reduce emissions.\n \nSecondly, illegal logging promotes corruption and destabilize the rule of law and good governance, specifically in developing producer\u2013countries. \n \nThirdly, according to the World Bank,  illegal logging  results in governments\u2019 revenue losses estimated as over 15 billion dollars every year in developing countries alone.  Fourthly,  businesses that operate \u201csustainable  timber policies\u201d, e.g. Ikea, are  often loosing parties because of an absence of a level of  playing field in the timber sector.  \n \nSo, what are the barriers that prevent the use and import of legal timber? What are the necessary measures to eliminate  the illegal logging?\n \nThis project analyses  the state of affairs concerning the use and import of illegal timber in the Netherlands and in the EU. The central role is devoted to legislation that aims to put an end to illegal logging. The new EU regulation  plays a central role. The focus of the analysis of the Regulation lies on the implementation procedure in the Netherlands. The organization of working conferences/workshops is planned in the framework of this project.",
