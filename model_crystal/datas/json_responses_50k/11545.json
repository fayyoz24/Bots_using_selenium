    "summary": "My name is Bart van Nieuwburg and I am Scrum Master (PSM2, SAFe5) and trainer. I love technology and my passion lies with working with people and teams.\n \nAs Scrum Master it gives me a lot of energy to help and coach teams. To help them to identify improvements and to help them removing their impediments. When I see a team grow from a group of individuals to a performing team that has fun together, it does not feel like going to work. \n\nAs trainer I love to teach the thing that I love: good teamwork that leads to delivering (software) products of higher quality, faster and with a lot of fun along the way. My choice of framework to reach for that is Scrum.\n\nBefore I became Scrum Master I have built web and app solutions that support scientific research in the social sciences. I started the Agile transformation of the IT department by applying the Scrum framework. This made a great improvement in consistency, quality, development time and fun.\n\nI like to read books and listen to podcasts to learn more about Agile and how people work together. I am SAFe5 certified and I have passed the PSMI & PSMII certification exam.",

The developers were situated in Tilburg and most stakeholders and testers were situated in the Max Planck Institute in Munich. This raised a communication barrier. My assignment was to improve communications and expectations between both parties. I saw the Scrum framework as a perfect fit. Together with the colleagues in Munich we figured out a way how Scrum could help us streamline the workflow of development and testing of the software. The backlog was maintained together and the sprint planning was communicated to the stakeholder. This helped in managing the expectations for all parties. The sprint planning made clear what was going to be finished after the next sprint. The transparency of a digital Scrum board helped the stakeholders to know what was being worked on at any given time.\n\nSHARE is the Study of Health Ageing and Retirement conducted in 29 countries in Europe. Interviewers  conduct around 1.5 hour long offline interviews at the home of the respondents. The data is synchronised and transferred from the interviewers laptop to a servers in the country. Afterwards the data is transferred to a central server and it is checked. Finally the data is disemminated to scientists all around the world. \nAlmost all software that is needed to conduct this project is developed by the programmers of CentERdata.",

I taught the Scrum Framework and Agile mindset to customers and colleagues in our internal and external organization. I trained and helped Product Owners in how to translate the wishes of the stakeholders into user stories that are ready to be developed. I coached Product Owners on how to maintain a product backlog, maximizing value. I organized code reviews for the developers so that they learned from each other's good and bad practices. \n\nOver the years the IT department had created a lot of software in many different programming languages and styles. There was a lot of legacy software that was being maintained. The Scrum team has re-written most of the software into a 'family of applications' called Data CTRL. We used re-usable modules to achieve sustainable maintenance. We implemented DevOps practices using GitLab to streamline the workflow. We continuously test the software against the OWASP top 10 security risks. \n\nWhile doing this we had to deal with the day-to-day ad-hoc work. To be able to meet the sprint goal while dealing with requests and interruptions, together with the team I implemented the Scrum pattern 'Illegitimus non interruptus'. \n\nIn a short amount of time we have re-developed a large amount of software programs that our customers use daily in conducting their surveys. Some examples:\n\nFile Share - transferring files securely between parties. \nDigital Vault - Encrypted storing of data files for long term storage. \nSurveyCTRL - SaaS solution for researchers to conduct their surveys over a large group of respondents. \nMass Mailer - A program to send e-mails to a large amount of receivers.\nRepositoryCTRL - a data warehouse based on the DDI3 standard to search over large amounts of survey data.
