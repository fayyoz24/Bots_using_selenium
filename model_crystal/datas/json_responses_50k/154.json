I believe that to succeed in any field, precise and detailed communication is essential. I have worked in teaching, research and development, communications, and project management across a variety of industries: from education to marketing I describe I like to think of myself as an \u201call-rounder\u201d. I am a go-to person for complex ideas and creative/innovative solutions. My passions represent a cross-cultural vector. My work emphasizes the importance of people, places, resistances, and of seeking out new ways to think things through. I can switch lenses and points of inquiry quickly and nimbly, and I love to be challenged by the work that I do.",
