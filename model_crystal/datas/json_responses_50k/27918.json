    "summary": "My name is Tung Thanh Phan. I am working as a PhD candidate at Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Antwerp. My research focuses on international entrepreneurship, which is constituted by two aspects: the internationalization of entrepreneurial firms, and the cross-national comparison of entrepreneurial activities. \n\nOriginated from Vietnam, I received a full-ride scholarship from University of Twente for the Master study in business, entrepreneurship, and innovation. With my vigorous effort, I achieved my Cum Laude graduation in July 2019.\n\nAs working on my PhD research and dissertation, I have learnt various beneficial skills. Amongst those, the skill that I value the most is the ability to work independently to an extreme degree \u2013 sharpened by the process of coming up with research ideas, directing and organizing my own research, motivating and looking after myself to ensure desirable outcomes. My ability to think critically \u2013 both to myself and others \u2013 have also been articulated. Of course, whilst writing research and dissertation, the ability to read painstakingly and elaborate my ideas clearly via academic language has been thoroughly trained.",
