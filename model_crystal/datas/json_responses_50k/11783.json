    "summary": "\u201cThe three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are, first, hard work; second, stick-to-itiveness; third, common sense.\u201d\n\nNot my words (a quote by Thomas Edison) but a philosophy that closely reflects who I am and how I approach most challenges. I believe putting in the work, trusting the process and keeping things simple are often the key to achieve most goals.\n\nI've applied this thinking in multiple roles as a digital marketer specialized in marketing for digital products. Along the way, I've helped companies achieve their B2B as well as B2C objectives and streamlining their marketing funnel.\n\nWith a strong background in performance marketing and a keen interest in web data analytics, I specialize in optimizing user acquisition journeys through multiple digital touchpoints. This enables me to think like the customer and develop strategies that are laser focused on their needs and behavior.",

The consultancy project was aimed at identifying the key barriers companies, operating in the Port of Rotterdam, are facing in implementing energy efficient measures. Based on the findings, we worked towards providing concrete recommendations to AmCham and Deltalinqs to help these companies overcome these barriers.\n\nKey aspects of the project included detailed company and data analysis and required extensive problem solving and project management capabilities. Since it was a qualitative research, our recommendations were focused on identifying the barriers in the decision-making process and offer actionable recommendations to overcome these barriers.\n\nProject Management | Strategy Consulting | Process Optimization | Problem Solving",
