    "summary": "I am a senior marketing professional and business intelligence analyst with 8+ years of experience in an international environment, specializing in niche product promotion. My passion and professional expertise are digital marketing and analytics. I have experience with digital campaigns (A-Z), data analysis and visualisation (PowerBI | Excel), marketing automation (eMarketeer, Zapier), social media advertising, digital analytics (Google Analytics), CRM (Super Office, Microsoft Dynamics), and email marketing just to name a few. \n\nI have a growth marketing mindset, and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and tools and trying them out in experiments. When I don't work, you can find me with a good book, walking with my dogs or something a bit more random like learning SQL via an app on my phone (which is what I\u2019m busy with at the moment). \n\nI wrote my Master's thesis on machine learning applications in marketing and advertising. I specifically focused on what machine learning applications can help design and manage the increasingly complex customer journey. I'm always happy to chat about that :) \n\nI\u2019m dynamic, flexible and always eager to learn. \n\nTwo things I love: travelling and meeting new people\nTwo things I believe in: digital is the future, and the future is digital\n\nKeywords: marketing | communications| strategy | digital analytics | business analytics | data-driven decision making | innovation | lean thinking | artificial intelligence applications | machine learning applications | data",
