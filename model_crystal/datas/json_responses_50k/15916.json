With the projects now under development, the lifetime of the field is prepared for production towards 2050.\nThe Ekofisk Complex comprises all installations which are connected with bridges on the central Ekofisk field. As of 2011, this includes seven platforms plus bridge supports. In 2013/2014, a new accommodation and field center platform, Ekofisk 2/4 L, is planned to start operation at the Ekofisk Complex. In addition, a new wellhead platform, Ekofisk 2/4 Z, and a new seabed unit for water injection (Ekofisk 2/4 VB) are planned.",
