    "summary": "During my study Tourism Management at Stenden University I've learned to work together with students from all over the world. Therefore this study was entirely English-taught. \nThe study was based on a strategic management level and included subjects as management, marketing, business economics and languages (English, French and Spanish).\nIn 2006 I graduated and got the \"Bachelor of Business Administration\" degree.\n\nAfter my study I was receptionist at a hostel for six months. I made bookings, answered the telephone (in Dutch, German and English), responded to inquiries from the guests and provided information about the hostel and the environment. It was my job to give the guests a first good impression of the organisation.\n\nBecause the work at the hostel was seasonal and because I wanted to develop myself, I found another job in another field. As management assistant at Weduw Joustra (a Dutch liquor producer, liquor store and museum) I could develop myself in many ways. \nBecause the company was quite small, I got insight in all aspects of the conduct of business. I was responsible for the creditors and debtors, excise duty administration, processing of orders and customer relations. Occasionally I did guided tours through the company. \n\nIn October 2009 I made a journey through Australia and New Zealand for six months. This was a great experience and it gave me the opportunity to think about my future.\n\nAt the moment I work for Bloemsma Aluminiumbouw in Makkum. At this company high quality aluminium hulls for superyachts are constructed. Many traditional sailing yachts, including J-class yachts are built at our yard. For the new founded racing F-class we have recently finished the first yacht, called \"Firefly\". \n\nI can describe myself as reliable, accurate and creative. My Dutch is excellent and my English-skills are good. Besides, I'm upgrading my German at the moment (by means of a home course) and my Spanish (by means of a course at school).\n\nSpecialties: Tourism, writing, languages, administration.",
