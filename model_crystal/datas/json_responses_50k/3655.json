    "summary": "I hold a Master of Science in Environmental Policy and Society and have a diploma in Economics. I have 15+ years of relevant experience in strategy, policy and consultancy. Before starting my own company in June 2015 I worked as senior advisor on EU research and innovation policy at the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Before joining the Ministry I worked as proposal and project manager in the space department of public research and technology organisation TNO, as consultant on the development of the coastal zone in Bulgaria and as space technology consultant for a small privately owned company.  This experience has allowed me to develop four complementary services for public and private sector organisations in a range of domains. \n\nPersonal interest: access to finance for business, including crowdfunding for entrepreneurs in developed and developing countries such as KIva.org and MyC4.com.",

The objective is to inform future European research and innovation policy and programmes. The project looks at a range of sectors, such as construction, transport, ICT and energy. The Extremely Useful Company was contracted to write the report for the sector environment, which deals with the application of nanotechnologies for and potential impact of nanomaterials in the environment. It describes the landscape of EU policy and programmes in support of nanotechnology for and in the environment, as well as policy and programmes in all member states and internationally. It provides data about funding provided in framework programmes 6 and 7, publications, patents filed, an estimate of the current market for environmental nanotechnology products and forecast for market growth.

Sfeerbeheer took a different approach to the standard conference organisation by developing a unique, purpose-built transparent floating pavilion on the pond in the centre of The Hague as its hub (follow the Flickr link for photos). The pavilion was adjacent to the seat of Government and walking distance to iconic locations for parallel sessions such as Soci\u00ebteit de Witte and Johan de Witthuis. \n\nIn addition to a particular focus on the instruments launched under Horizon 2020 (InnovFin), also addressed were the interactions between InnovFin, COSME, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), as well as with instruments at national and local level. The event included sessions on alternative finance, such as crowdfunding. \n\nTo increase the impact and usefulness for visitors, we organised the conference to take place in conjunction with TEDxBinnenhof: Ideas from Europe, so that the different communities could mix and meet during the evening reception and walking dinner. To add value, we co-developed the programme in partnership with the CrowdfundingHub, Dutch Incubation Association, InvestHorizon, Eureka InnoVest and Enterprise Europe Network. With the latter, together with Holland Fintech, we organised the first EEN FintechMatch brokerage event. More than 100 speakers and 400 participants participated in the 24 plenary and parallel sessions.",
