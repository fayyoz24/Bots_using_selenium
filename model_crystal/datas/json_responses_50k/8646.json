Bayes Forecast is a consulting boutique 100% focused in advanced data analysis (founded in 1991, this company is really a pioneer in advanced analytics), mainly in the time series forecasting and bayesian methods.\n\nMy work was mostly for the Telco industry, specifically in creating systems for weekly, monthly and yearly demand forecasting. It worth to note that in those years were not available tools for doing those procedures efficiently, thus we used our own functional programming language (www.tol-project.org) and we also created our own methods for distributed computing. In 2003 we already created systems for automating the estimation and predictions of several thousand time series efficiently, with a very high level of precision, in a distributed fashion. We were the designer and creators of the whole system for the market leader in the Telco industry in Spain, and one of the largest Telco companies worldwide.\n\nMy time was distributed mainly in researching, programming, as well in managing technically a group of four professionals.",
