    "summary": "Since early childhood, I have been amazed by the world of aviation. So it didn't come as a surprise when I started studying BSc Aviation Logistics. I was and still am driven to understand what comes with realizing the operation from the perspective of all players, and get an insight into the high number of trade-offs that constantly need to be made.\n\nMy enthusiasm, perseverance, and curiosity combined with coachability are my fundamental qualities. These enable me to strive for excellence, and continuously develop my personal and professional skills.",
