    "summary": "Entrepreneur | Founder | Technology | Science | Innovation | Team | Lets make it happen! \n\nI am curious, eager to learn and have strong analytical skills. With my enthusiastic personality and a fairly competitive mentality I have the drive to perform at top level. As a true entrepreneur with a background in academia, my ambition is to transfer scientific knowledge and technology into business. I am always open to discuss collaborations or potential business opportunities.\n\nIn my work I bring together research and development, business development and sales. I have an eye for the value proposition and solving problems for clients. With excellent communication skills and due to my work experience at the university, start-ups and scale-ups, I learned to flourish in multidisciplinary and interactive environments. I prefer to work in, and lead, a team to put everyone in his and her strength, optimizing the interaction between the different building blocks of a business.  \n\nContact:\n\nTag me @bernobucker or reach out to me by email via berno@attentionarchitects.com | b.bucker@ixa.nl",

Through Pavlovian and instrumental learning strategies we can assess which stimuli are predictive of or associated with reward, so that visual selective attention is biased towards them. The idea put forward in my thesis is that the activity level across the attentional priority map reflects the interplay between stimulus-driven and  goal-driven processing, which can be modulated by the learned significance or reward value that stimuli have acquired over time through experience.\n\nApplication:\nMy academic work is directly relevant and related to the field of marketing. \n\nReference:\nBucker, B.
