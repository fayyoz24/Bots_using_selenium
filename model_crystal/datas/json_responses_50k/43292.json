    "summary": "Guiding changemakers to reconnect with their true selves by offering transformational programs, workshops, and inspirational talks.\n\u00a0\nI strive for a healthy planet inhabited by people living a fulfilled life. I believe this can be created by becoming aware of our true nature.\n\nWhen we reconnect with who we truly are, we automatically make sustainable choices, co-create the most beautiful\u00a0models like a Circle Economy, Blockchain and True Cost. Without being connected we will not be able to make the necessary sustainable choices.\n\nAs\u00a0many of us are living in a rat race and because 97% of our behaviour and choices is coming from our subconscious it is difficult to achieve personal leadership. With practice we can become aware of our subconscious patterns, concepts and believe systems and start to transform these for our benefit.\n\u00a0\nComing from an economical background I love to use my beta mind to create lasting solutions, whilst at the same time during my travels I learned to live from the heart. By living with shamans, receiving wisdom teachings, honouring our mother earth, the moon, the plants, the birds and all that is. I believe the change has to be made within the organisations by guiding the individuals within the organisation.\n\u00a0\nThis is what inspires me - guiding individuals back to their hearts to live a meaningful and inspired life so we can create innovative solutions for a beautiful\u00a0healthy\u00a0planet.\n\u00a0\nI do this by:\nOne-on-one sessions // healing trauma, fear and anxiety and working with what is blocking you from living from the heart - www.alixevanogtrop.com \nOffering workshops and programs for living and working in flow\nFounding a platform to accelerate changemakers launch conscious businesses - Changebeings \n\nWe have to be the change you want to see in the world,\n\u00a0\nLet's be the change together!",
