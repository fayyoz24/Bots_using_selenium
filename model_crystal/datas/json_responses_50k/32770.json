    "summary": "As an electrical engineer, I have always been fascinated by the intricate workings of the world and especially the technology part of it.  However, my love for storytelling has led me to explore photography as a means of capturing and sharing the stories around me. I specialise in landscape photography using my camera as a tool to capture the world around me and tell compelling stories through images.\n\nBeyond my technical expertise, my passion for photography has taught me the importance of creativity, precision, and attention to detail. In addition to my photography work, I also maintain a blog where I share my work and the story behind the captures from my perspective.\n\nAs an electrical engineer and photographer, I bring a unique perspective to my work, always striving to find innovative solutions and tell compelling stories. Whether I'm behind the camera or trying to solve complex problems, I'm always pushing the boundaries of what's possible, finding new ways to communicate and always up for a new challenge in uncharted territories. \n\nSo if you're interested in discussing photography, engineering, or anything in between, I'm always ready to have a conversation.",
