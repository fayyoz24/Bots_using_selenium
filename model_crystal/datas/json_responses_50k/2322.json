At the end of the week, I was selected to work at Babble-City, a cocktail bar and late bar near Liverpool Street (part of the City of London, the financial district of the UK capital) with a wide cocktails menu\n- I worked behind the bar in the Christmas period, the busiest period of the year, and learned a lot about serving, making cocktails and basic drinks\n- My customers were mostly British Businessmen and women\n- After one year I was promoted to Bar Supervisor \n- As Bar Supervisor, I had to train people, teach them bar service and cocktails making and everything else regarding bars (pouring beers in the correct way, taking orders, relating to guests, dealing with complaints). I was working with a radio system which kept me in contact with the other Supervisors, Managers and Security Team. I had to make sure the night was as smooth as possible, dealing with complaints, monitoring intoxicated people, supporting my bar team\n- For about 3 years, I have worked alongside my studies to pay my bills \n- I have worked in different venues: Babble-City, Babble-Mayfair, Tiger Tiger London, and Sway Bar\n- I enjoyed working with an international team and the responsibilities that came with the Supervisor role which meant working closely to the Management team",
