    "summary": "I moved to the Netherlands in 2008 from Scotland following my wife here to live in ''Zuid Holland''. After Studying and doing my masters at the UVA I have had several jobs within the Supply chain industry. In these roles I have had a lot of luck to be involved in diverse and different Supply chains, working in areas from clothing and textile to food stuffs and Production printing to industrial solutions. In essence during the last several years I have grown through a number of roles and a few companies as I build up my understanding of SC and broaden my knowledge in best practices while gaining experience as I go. In my current role I'm working within a matrix org managing a global team in EMEA and AP which is an excellent learning curve on managing teams remotely and communications impact on our ability to perform effectively.  .",
