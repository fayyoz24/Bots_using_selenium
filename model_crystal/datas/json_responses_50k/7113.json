    "summary": "After successfully pursuing a bachelor\u2019s in business administration at Nyenrode Business University and an MSc in Strategic Management at RSM, I aim to make my mark in a Dutch organization with a global footprint. In my pursuit, I found a challenge at CM.com where I am currently working as a Business Analyst in the sales operations team. Our goal; improving CM.com's customer experience by making our sales teams more efficient and effective. \n\nDuring my studies, I developed a genuine interest in strategy and commerce, and consider myself an analytical and pragmatic thinker. I have also further developed an interest in data analysis and sales enablement, which are contexts that I find challenges in during my daily job. Competitive team environments are what drive me, both on the work floor and on the field hockey pitch.",
