    "summary": "I enjoy creating quality web apps! Products that we are proud to show off.\n\nLeading the front-end team allows me to emphasise good software architecture while coaching. The software has long-term durability and everyone is comfortable with the code.  \n\nMy default tech stack: \nReactJS, NextJS, Redux, CSS Modules, and PWA\n\nEdTech? Yes please!\nI have a soft spot for EdTech. Job openings in that area are highly favoured. Especially if it has links with my own personal app, mytoori.com It\u2019s an added value if the business has a valuable contribution to society in some way. \n\nMytoori.com - My spare time project\nIt uses NextJS, Redux and a NodeJS backend (Mongoose and MongoDB). \nIt's hosted on heroku, netlify.com and Vercel. The front-end code for mytoori.com is publicly available on https://bitbucket.org/gpersaud/\n\nLearning\nFront-end tech moves fast. I try to stay up to date with podcasts, youtube videos and lectures. \n\n\u2014 \nDear recruiters\nIf you\u2019re looking to reach out, here\u2019s how we can be efficient. \n\nI\u2019m interested in a lead front-end role for a small team. ReactJS is. Sharing the tech stack right away helps the conversation. Ideally it\u2019s in Amsterdam or fully remote. If you can share the full role description even better. I\u2019m also quite interested in the industry.\n\nI really like startups but I do want to know the runway and the overall size. \n\nThanks. \nGiwan",

Through the use of technology we are able to ensure that the reader does not miss any detail of the story. \n\nThe dual langage eBooks are available for iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch. These devices fully support the EPUB3 standard we are using. \n\nThe rest of the development consisted mainly of combining XML data, XSL, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Put together they allow for a powerful eBook to emerge that brings both reading benefits as well as language learning benefits to the reader. \nSupporting activities consisted of creating an online web store where the books can be stored and sold. Website design, book cover design and EPUB eBook formatting also played a crucial role. \n\nOngoing activities are, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and (web) marketing.",
