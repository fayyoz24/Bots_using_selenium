Landal is expanding rapidly looking at a healthy future with an ambition to welcome more guests in even more parks.\n\nCHALLENGE\nThe expansion of Landal resonates in the underlaying IT landscape. The rapid growth is demanding more robust systems and stricter processes. One of the pillars of their business is the experience a guest has during the stay. Although centrally stored, it is not easy to find or reuse an asset. Data quality is not yet forced upon the asset, so lots of obsolete assets are still carried around.\n\nSOLUTION\nWe implemented the Sitecore Digital Asset Management system. Assets are now stored according to a pre-set classification and driven by business rules and workflows. A new asset can therefore no longer be missed. All assets will at least have a minimum amount of data with them and all of them are guarded by a digital rights module.\n",

Although their softwarestack is self developed and a bit outdated they are still frontrunners in the market. However to keep pall position, Wehkamp has decided to redevelop it all and only to look at best of breed. They have decided to implement inRiver PIM for product data maintenance.\n\nCHALLENGE\nWehkamp has a rapid changing product portfolio. They are known (and feared) always to be the first company launching new products, way before competitors can or do. They also heavily action and moment driven. If it rains today, there could be a promotion on umbrella's. A quick turn around (hours and minutes, rather than days) is vital. This is demanding for systems, staff and processes.\nOur job ticket was to deliver on par with the old system and not build any customization.\n\nSOLUTION\nWe have untied the existing system and replaced it with a standard inRiver PIM. To do so we had to record all user stories and classify them. If they didn't belong to PIM, they where moved to other functional area's in the infra structure. If they did belong to PIM, stories where refined so they woud fit within standards.\nFrom a very early start the users have been engaged in the process and each two weeks, results have been shared to get instant feedback. We created ambassadors and key users to make a kickstart launch.\n\nRESULTS\nWehkamp has a swift and lightweight PIM solution that maximizes their need for agility. It locks down product data quality by pre-defined processes and serves all outbound channels. It has given a better separation of duties and clear organization of rolls and rights.",

We created a data model with a parent child relation, where standard product data was stored on parent level. We granulated the data as much as possible, where a sellable end product existed out of the grape, a clam shell and a label.\n\nRESULTS\nLevarht created themselves a flexible system.

The turn over of 750 mil euro makes B&S one of the largest player in the field.\n\nCHALLENGE\nFood comes with legislation, especially in Europe. There is not only a high demand for traceability, but all label information should be available in their systems, serving ordering platforms and websites. When a soup suddenly contains traces of nuts, buyers will need to be informed right away.\nChallenges where in the correct initial registration and keeping it up to date during the products life span.\n\nSOLUTION\nWe used standardization like GS1 to lower the barrier and to simplify data exchange. We build the datamodel on top of the standard and used the GS1 connector to exchange data. Due to the vast amount of products, data brokers where used to onboard raw data taken from product labels and boxes.\n\nRESULTS\nA PIM system with workflows to serve internal and external processes. Running on delta exports to Gs1 and  guarding newly born products via a supplier portal. \nB&S has chosen to implement a high data quality standard, where native Informatica data quality tooling has been used.",

We drafted the ideal organization with a quality council, members and rolls to lay a proper quality management foundation and will stop the quality from leaking away in future. Last but not least we implemented the STEP DQ tool to measure, report and initiate quality improvement.\n\nRESULTS\nQuality is been looked after on a daily basis.

It is not always easy to be part of a larger town, where decisions are made from a far distance. Libel are the local eyes and ears of the city council, so voices are heard.\n\nWe organize the erection of a large christmas tree in our town square and the welcoming of our Dutch version of father christmas who arrives a little earlier. We run a theater and support local sport clubs with investments towards the city council."
