The companies get the chance to see the students in action with real-life cases in teams compiled of students whom they have never worked with. These take place during the prior Inhousedays of our partners or during the event's final days. The winning team is crowned by the title of \"Biggest Marketing Talent 2015\"\u200b. The edition of 2015 was held in Maastricht at the Amr\u00e2th Grand Hotel De L'empereur.\n\nMy main tasks as External Affairs Commissioner were the acquisition and attendance of participating companies, and the maintenance of the company contact database. Companies of our edition included Google, FrieslandCampina, Nestl\u00e9, DSM and many more.",
