    "summary": "Billy holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Statistics from the Florida State University. He has been supporting clinical development, medical affairs, and real-world research in various leadership roles in the pharmaceutical industry for over 15 years.  For a significant portion of his career he has provided statistical support for clinical trial design, analysis, and reporting for phase 1 through phase 4 trials and studies with expertise on advanced statistical issues such as sample size and power estimation for non-standard designs, development of appropriate statistical tests for unique clinical endpoints, and design of adaptive clinical trials.   His statistical design toolbox includes Monte Carlo simulation, application of distribution theory, and experience using cutting-edge Bayesian design software and group-sequential design software.   In the most recent years he has supported real-world evidence studies covering safety outcomes research, comparative effectiveness research, health economics, and commercial analytics.\nThroughout his career he has supported clinical and real-world research in the areas of cardiology, oncology, urology, infectious disease, nephrology, neurology, and dermatology. Billy\u2019s broad experience across geographic regions, pharmaceutical company divisions, and therapeutics enables him to rapidly understand his customer\u2019s objectives, needs, and challenges and to then engage in a solutions-oriented dialogue with his clients.",
