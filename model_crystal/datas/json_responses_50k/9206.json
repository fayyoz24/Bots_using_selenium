    "summary": "Enthusiasm-fuelled world citizen with a Master\u2019s Degree in Intercultural Communication from Utrecht University, 3 year's experience as an Agile Coach and 250h of Yin  Yoga & Philosophy Teacher Training from The Fat Yogis.\n\nCurrently on the slowest world tour ever, from the UK to France and back via Spain, Chile and now, the Netherlands. Next? Portugal, France and Spain, to learn about permaculture, building sustainably and living in community. All the while, helping teams to improve their work processes through guidance, facilitation and empowerment!\n\nI am fascinated by how we as humans can live happy, healthy and cooperative lives in line with our values and in touch with the complexity of our entire being. I consistently find happiness in helping others to reflect, practicing my own introspection, learning and growing, with a positive attitude towards life in general.",
