During this year I joined the magazine editorial  and web management team of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres Hispanohablantes de Hong Kong. I helped on developing the blog for the website and wrote articles of interest for the printed magazine. \nI believe meeting other cultures is a nice and enriching experience one can have."
