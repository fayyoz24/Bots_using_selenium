    "summary": "Currently, and with deep interest, I follow the study program International Business and Management at the The Hague University of Applied Science, in the international city of peace. Over the last two years I was able to master various subjects, as  Accounting, Finance, Logistics, HRM, Marketing or Law. I absolved my minor in Business in Asia, and as I was fascinated by the matter I wish my future career to go in this direction. \n\nOut of this interest I will absolve my exchange semester in Taipei in 2015, trying to learn more about the subject and see how things work locally. \n\nBeside that, I had the chance to absolve four internships in different industries and fields of business. That includes the Hirschvogel Automotive Group, the P.H. Glatfelter Company and the Hilit Corporation. During these internships I gained deep insights in many areas, as legal affairs, customer service, project- and event managment, process analysis and improvement, organizing, data handling and casual administration work.  \n\nMy mother tongue is German and I am fluent in English and French. I would describe myself as ambitious person with fast apprehension skills, humor and the ability to think creatively. \n",

There, the central customer service responsible for the maretplaces Germany, Austria and Swizerland ist located. Beside suppoting a team of 30 customer service agents in the daily work, I gained insides in the workflow management for our stuff and could spend time with the quality management. Also, I was able to work for the seller support of Amazon who is taking care of all the vendors that sell through the platform. That task gave me another great view inside the processes that make Amazon such a successful and customer centric organisation. Finally, I want to mention that I felt very well and motivated throughout the whole time, which I trace back to a great company culture and great colleagues. Shout out to y'all.",
