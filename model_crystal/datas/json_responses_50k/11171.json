    "summary": "Dr. Jacqueline J. Schenk is a developmental psychologist, holding a PhD in Developmental Psychology (Behaviour Analysis). In her position as an Associate Professor in Developmental Psychology and  Special Educational Psychology (Orthopedagogy) at Erasmus University Rotterdam (The Netherlands), she designs and delivers courses and supervises research projects in Developmental as well as and in Clinical Child and Youth Psychology, both at bachelor and master level. In addition, her research activities focus on the study of typical and atypical behaviour and cognitive development in infancy and early childhood, both in longitudinal research (Generation R Study, Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam) and in laboratory and applied studies.\n Before working at Erasmus University (in 2002), she worked at the Tizard Centre, University of Kent at Canterbury, where she conducted research and taught master students in the domain of learning disabilities, in addition to delivering  consultancy work for services and individuals with learning disabilities and the courts. From that moment onwards, her interest in detecting and removing barriers to inclusive education has only grown and her dedication to promote activities in terms of research and dissemination of research findings to youth health care professionals, educators, parents, and youth has only increased. To improve the educational and professional care climate for youth in the city of Rotterdam, Jacqueline Schenk was co-director of the newly established academic course on Pedagogical Sciences at Erasmus University (bachelor and master course).  \nHer current research activities involve:\n(1) Inclusive education practices in the Netherlands and consequences for learning, behaviour, and development of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders, children with Down syndrome and children who are labelled highly gifted and talented;\n (2) A large research project (Schenk principal investigator, funded by the Dutch government) on diversity in the population of people who have autism characteristics (but are not necessarily diagnosed as such, a research project in collaboration with a large consortium in which both academic and professional experts on autism are participating;\n (3) Fundamental research on the concept of creativity in populations of diverse intellectual or academic functioning;\n(4) Applied studies on increasing clinical skills in professionals in youth health care and education that are carried out within the realms of two academic-professional collaborations. \n",
