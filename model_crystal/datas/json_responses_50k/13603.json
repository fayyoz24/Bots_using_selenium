    "summary": "Strengths Finder Top 5 Results 2018: Positivity, Adaptability, Woo, Responsibility, Activator\n\nPersonality type: ENFP-A, Campaigner\n\nWorking in a creative job makes me happy because I get energy out of creating and connecting with people. As of January 2017 I decided to set up my own interior styling studio called Styleloket (www.styleloket.nl). Running my own business has taught me so much already and I cannot wait to see where we\u2019ll go.\n\nKeywords that describe my personality are: enthusiastic, caring, inquisitive, disciplined and passionate. I have a good eye for detail, am a hard worker and a true team player. On a more personal note, I enjoy running events, wine-tasting and food-pairing events and jumping on a surfboard every now and then! \n\nOriginally, my expertise lies in the product creation process of apparel. Having a background in product development has taught me a lot about many aspects, to name a few: materials, construction of apparel, tech packs, pricing, sourcing, production and fitsessions. Because I have visited several factories in Asia & Europe, my insight into the production of apparel has grown. \n\nAs a product developer you work together with all fields of product creation; design, sourcing, marketing and product data management. It is unbelievable how much work is involved in creating a collection before it is in store. Being part of this phase, together with the diversity the work involved, always gave me a lot of energy.",
