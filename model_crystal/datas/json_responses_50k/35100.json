    "summary": "My diverse experience and skill sets allow me to adapt to different environments and situations quickly and efficiently. I`m an electrical engineer with an MBA and certifications in project management. \n\nMy experience is regionally and scope varied. Main focus has been on project development for tank storage, onshore fabrication, and offshore construction (pipelines & heavy-lift). This is diversified with general management-business development in the medical implant field, and management consulting in the SME arena. I`ve experienced almost every type of organisation and structure in one form or another: multinational, family owned, start-up, SME, matrix, line, project, to name just a few. Yet I thrive best within a multinational corporate environment.\nWorking with multicultural teams and people of varying education levels are core to my tried and tested abilities. My expertise delves into corporate affairs such as negotiation, client relationship development, commercial and/or engineering discovery sessions, interface management, and change management. Coupled with refined presentation and speaking skills I\u2019m able to bring across points and concepts succinctly.",
