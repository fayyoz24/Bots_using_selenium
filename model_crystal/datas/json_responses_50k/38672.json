    "summary": "\"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life thinking its stupid\" (Albert Einstein)\n\nAs an officer of the Royal Netherlands Navy, I held many different positions in the past 35 years of active service. Most challenging and interesting one is the job of an intelligence officer as to date.\n\nFifteen years ago, I took notice of the intelligence community by switching my traditional navy career, serving on the high seas, by applying my first intelligence specialist course in the United Kingdom and, as a result, conducting more landbase operations. \n\nMy specialties are in the field of interacting with all kinds of people, have a genuine interest in other cultures, leadership and policy development, education and organizing/managing challenging projects and events. Emphasis is my experience in worldwide military theaters ranging from friendly to (semi) hostile environments.\n\nIn the summer of 2019 is my planned retirement.",

This exercise is called Steadfast Indicator and is directed by SHAPE and executed at the HUMINT Centre of Excellence (HCOE) in Oradea, Romania. About 20 countries participated in this exercise. Contributions consist of providing students, support and exercice control. My role was an observer trainer's one with the ultimate goal to raise the knowledge and understanding of Human Intelligence of international students to a higher level. A task which I filled with pleasure and which gave me the honor of best Observer Trainer of the exercise. Something to be proud of..",

The military observers carry out fortnightly inspections in the Area of Limitation (AOL) to verify that both sides adhere to the limitations on troop levels and military equipment within 10, 20 and 25 km zones from the AOS as prescribed by the 1974 Disengagement Agreement.

My first field was the responsibility for having the lead in giving the right direction of annual events, conferences and symposia in the conference centre of the Naval Barracks. Eye-catching was surely the first edition of the Amsterdam City Swim. A fundraiser for the serious muscle disease ALS. The naval barracks functioned as the logistics and hospitality hub in a prominent role. The military support of that event was under my leadership.\n\nIn addition, I was the liaison officer of the naval barracks. In that position I established and maintained external contacts varying in wide range. These include the city counsel, Amsterdam police, security services, authorities of Port of Amsterdam, IJmuiden pilot service, logistics suppliers, embassies and consulates. I received a high French decoration as part of my outstanding performance and relationship with the French embassy. Very honored to receive such a reward",

E.g. before attending the courses the candidates must succeed a one day long psychological assessment and a three days period of practical tests. During the Contact Handlers Course, training skills they are taught in are communication techniques, non verbal communication, behavior symptoms analyses, working with interpreters, planning operations, anti and counter surveillance, written reports and much, much more. \n\nI also supported other training facilities at the Defense Intelligence Institute, particularly by acting as guest lecturer or by showing up as role player.
