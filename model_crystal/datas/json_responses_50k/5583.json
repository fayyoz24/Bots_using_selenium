    "summary": "Hello and thank you for your interest in my profile! \n\nMy name is Julia and I am a Rotterdam-based strategic UX and service designer. Both - because I believe in the power of customer-journey-based design and a holistic view on even the tiniest project to create sustainable, digital services.\n\nI love design, from admiring the details of an app interaction to complaining about digital madness and finding inconsistencies in services. Daily observations help me to design concepts that are consistent, human-centered and inspiring. My honest, open personality and co-creation techniques help me to create \"draagvlak\" for an idea within an organization. \n\nHaving spent the last years advocating for more user research within design projects, my new challenge is to implement the voice of the Customer into our goverment\u2019s services. Exceptional design cannot happen solitary behind a screen and a survey performed last month does not uncover you\u2019re user's deeper needs and desires. \n\nI also like to give workshops, write blog posts and persuade others of the power of human-centered design because I believe that it should be a team\u2019s mindset and not a step in a project.\n\nIn short - I like and do:\n\n\u2714 project planning regarding UX research & design methodologies \n\u2714 contextual research & user testing - involving users before, during and after designing\n\u2714 co-creatie - getting other people excited\n\u2714 user centered design - putting the user's needs first in research, strategy and design\n\u2714 transforming research results into screen concepts in Sketch, Axure or Figma \n\u2714 workshops & presenting with motivation & enthousiasm",
