    "summary": "Hi! Welcome to my LinkedIn profile.\n\nI believe that technology is the great enabler of the 21st century. While technology is making rapid changes and is evolving quickly people aren't always keeping up. I want to help human beings understand what ICT solutions can bring them for benefits.\n\nCurrently I am employed as an Power Platform engineer at PwC. I am convinced low code and no code platforms will play an integral part in the technology industry in the future. I create Powerapps, Power Automate flows and PowerBI reports to increase business value for different internal departments. Leveraging Dataverse as a data backbone to create scalable and secure environments I build custom enterprise Solutions.\n\nMy ambition is to enable companies to leverage the Power Platform by implementing the Power Platform in a professional and sustainable way using ALM practices, data management and security best practices.\n\nMy current home base is Amsterdam (the Netherlands) but in the past I have had the privilege to call Adelaide (South-Australia), Langkawi (Malaysia) and New York City (United States of America) my home for a while.\n\nOver the years I have developed a range of strengths that have helped me bring the best to the different companies I have worked at. Being optimistic, open-minded, energetic and enthusiastic has helped many team members I have worked with feel comfortable in their work environment. My determinism and persuasiveness has, coupled with my leadership capabilities, helped many companies reach their strategic goals.\n\nMy love for the hospitality industry has not fizzled out. I still enjoy cooking as a hobby and will always carry this passion with me. Nowadays I implement the lessons I have learned about customer relationships and hospitality in my daily responsibilities.\n\nShould you have any questions with regard to enquiries or my profile, please do not hesitate to contact me!\n\nKind regards,\n\nFelix Verduin",
