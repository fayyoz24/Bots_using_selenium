    "summary": "After four interesting years, I finished my BSc at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. During these four years, I worked on various business cases, followed an Intercultural and multidisciplinary consultancy project on how to set up a business incubator in Zimbabwe, and successfully executed research for PixelX as part of my bachelor thesis. \n\nMy skillset lies in the fields of (business-) strategy, team management, concepting and branding. My ideal job is to work with a combination of these multiple interests. In any way possible.\n\nWhat am I like in person? I have a proactive, energetic and enthusiastic personality. I often go for a run through the local forest, or you can find me there mountain biking. In addition, I am always in for a good conversation about architecture, building styles and everything related to this. \n\nThat's enough about me (for now). I'd love to hear more about you. \nLet's connect and share our stories. Feel free to reach out via the message function on LinkedIn.",
