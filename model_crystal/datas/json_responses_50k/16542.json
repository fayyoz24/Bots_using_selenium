    "summary": "Hi there, my name is Hugo van den Bosch.\n\nIn the past years I have worked in Master Data as an Analyst, which was good fun and very educational. But honestly, I would like to shake up my career and try something new.\nYou see, in my life I have always enjoyed writing. Stories, articles, manuals, product descriptions, reviews or even a simple anecdote with a good joke, I have had fun creating them. But as a hobby, I just could not find much time or (which is more painful) purpose for my writings. So I did not sit down and write as much as I wanted or could have.\n\nSo I mustered up my courage and want to take this risk by putting myself out there as a writer and potential content creator. I am eager to learn more, to develop my skills and give my inner artist a chance.\n\nThat said, I don't want my past experience to go to waste!\nAfter Unilever and Royal IHC, and currently at Alstom, I have learned so much. I know how to dive in data and how to improve data quality and data governance. I know a thing or two about data migration. Excel has become one of my favorite tools and I even have experience in writing macro's in Visual Basic. Many of these skills are self-taught or were taught by colleagues on-the-fly.\nCan you believe my original education was Communication & Marketing?!\n\nI sincerely believe there is a perfect job for me out there which combines these two worlds. A position in which I can write to my heart's content. But in which I can also write a smart Macro to change a tedious chore into a simple press of a button. Or in which I can use data analyses to distill the strongest or weakest parts of a website. I'm no stranger to SEO and I enjoy creating things. In the past I have worked with Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Premiere and InDesign and in general I quickly learn how to use new software too. So as you can see my knowledge and experience is pretty broad. I'm sure there are many more examples in which I would be a valuable asset.\n\nIdeally I would like to be an editor, content creator, staff writer, marketing manager, or something similar.\nI would describe myself as loyal and reliable, I like helping others and I don\u2019t give up easily.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like to connect:\nhugowillem@gmail.com",
