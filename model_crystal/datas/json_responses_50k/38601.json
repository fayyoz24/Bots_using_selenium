The goal of the Project was to research and analyse legislation on Arms (Weapons) Control in Mali, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Ghana with a view to assessing the juridical foundations of the West Africa Moratorium on Small Arms (light weapons). The Project provided the juridical foundations for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Declaration of a Moratorium on the Importation, Exportation and Manufacture of Light Weapons in West Africa (31 October 1998). The Moratorium culminated in the ECOWAS Convention [Treaty] on Small Arms and Light Weapons, their Ammunition and other Related Matters 2006.",
