It was to analyse the behaviour of Carbon fibre and Glass fibre laminated composite under the fatigue test rig. This experiment plays an essential role in estimating the laminate's life, which in turn helps the user to evaluate the life and fatigue strength of the laminate for further mathematical purposes.\n\nManufactured a frame to hold an electric motor with a drive belt and pulleys that spin a crank attached through linear bearings. As the motor turns the crank, the bed holding the composite laminate will move up and down just like the piston in a cylinder of IC engine. A round face hits the laminate for a quarter of the cycle. The attached load cell logs the force's values on an Arduino board and a proximity sensor attached to the motor. The values obtained are used to plot the S/N curve of the laminate, and then the fatigue life is calculated.",
