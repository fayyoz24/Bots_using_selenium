    "summary": "Laura is currently working as a PhD Candidate at KU Leuven. Her research focuses on both structural (DWI, white & gray matter volumes and microstructure) and functional (rs-fMRI, tb-fMRI) brain changes, i.e. neuroplasticity, following training. Moreover, with her FWO aspirant fellowship she will be able to investigate if and how these neuroplasticity processes can be facilitated or boosted by sleep (measured with EEG) in healthy young adults and traumatic brain injury patients. \n\nLaura has a strong background in neuroscience and is experienced in neuroimaging (DTI) in Parkinson's Disease patients experiencing verbal fluency decline following deep brain stimulation, neurophysiology (EEG) in critically ill children experiencing clinical and/or subclinical seizures and the effect of blue-light blocking glasses on sleep quality (PSQI) and quantitiy (SQS) in adolescents (high school students). She is interested in unraveling the mysteries of the human brain, both in health and disease/pathology, i.e. neurological and neuropsychiatric/neuropsychological populations. \n\nLaura is eager to learn and has (inter)national research experiences in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience), Toronto, Canada (SickKids Hospital for Sick Children) and has moved to Belgium (Leuven) to expand her neuroscientific knowlegde substantially.",

Previous studies have identified electrographic seizures in up to 46% of patients and status epilepticus in up to 23% of patients. The majority of electrographic seizures are subclinical, meaning they lack observable clinical manifestations and therefore require continuous electroencephalography (cEEG). Resources are often scarce, so these will be allocated to patients at greatest risk for seizures. Insight into the neurophysiological basis of clinical and subclinical seizures would inform our understanding of their relative severity and potential to cause lasting brain injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that greater pathological synchronization of distributed brain networks occurs in seizures with clinical manifestations compared to subclinical seizures by means of graph theory. The graph measures clustering coefficient (measure of segregation) and global efficiency (measure of integration) were calculated and compared between groups.  \n\n\u2022 Department of Neurosciences & Mental Health (Research Institute) and Division of Neurology (Hospital)\n\u2022  Daily supervisor: Ben Dunkley, PhD\n\u2022 Assessor: Cecil Hahn, MD, MPH\n\u2022  Report: \"Functional brain network alterations underlying clinical and subclinical seizures in critcally ill neonates and children\" \n\u2022 Grade 8.5/10 including 9 for report\n\u2022  \u201cBrain Network Properties of Clinical versus Subclinical Seizures Among Critically Ill Children\u201d has been pusblished in Clinical Neurophysiology",

This may cause an increase in delta and theta power in the frontotemporal regions, reflecting postictal disorientation. In turn, this cortical excitability can lead to disruption of a prior LTP, reflecting retrograde amnesia. Although the model is not yet a perfect representation of the reality, only capturing some aspects of the bigger picture, it can be used to further investigate the missing links and additional factors to be involved in the neurobiological mechanism underlying postictal disorientation in order to gain more insights in possible solutions and medication for patients to prevent them from getting retrograde amnesia following electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n\u2022 Supervisor: Esm\u00e9e Verwijk, PhD\n\u2022 Grade: 8.5/10",

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment option for late-stage motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, the treatment itself can induce non-motor symptoms, e.g. cognitive or psychiatric side-effects. To collect fused images of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Tractography and DBS electrodes, pre\u2010DBS DTI scans and post\u2010DBS CT scans were combined. These fused images were subsequently used to analyze the relationship between white matter tract damage and verbal fluency decline. We were the first who were able to quantify the potential white matter tract damage following electrode implantation by means of our custom-made algorithm/Matlab script. \n\n\u2022  Department Neurology & Clinical Neurophysiology \n\u2022 Daily supervisors: Lennard Boon (VUmc), MD; Wouter Potters, PhD\n\u2022 Assessor: Fleur van Rootselaar, MD, PhD\n\u2022  Report: \u201cWhite matter microlesion volume in relation to verbal fluency decline following electrode implantation in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients\" \n\u2022  Grade: 8.5/10",
