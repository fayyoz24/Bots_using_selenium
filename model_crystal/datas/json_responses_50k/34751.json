    "summary": "Young, dynamic, curious and independent girl in her twenties, currently a student of the French-Irish track of the Cesem programme at Neoma Business School. \n\nHaving started my university career at the University of Paris Dauphine in the Bachelor and Science of Organizations program after obtaining an Economic ans Social Baccalaureate, I realized that this course did not suit me for various reasons. I therefore decided to go to a business school and in particular to a double international degree that would allow me to develop my language skills and maintain my attraction to foreign countries.  \n\nMoreover, during this course I had the chance to discover the associative world, both in Dauphine and Neoma, which helped me enormously and I found myself completely involved in certain associations such as Cheer Up (help for young cancer patients) or the Neoma's Musical. \nBeing in business school also allows me to discover the world of business because the Cesem program includes 2 long-term internships (6 months each) which is, in my opinion, very enriching and offers a real simulation to adapt more easily to the working world when we leave school.  \n\nBeing by nature curious, adventurous and full of desire, I invest myself to the maximum in my courses and in all the projects I undertake, whether during my university career or in my daily life. \n",
