    "summary": "I like working in an environment where there is a healthy dose of challenges and opportunities. Moreover, I find it important for my environment, my team, and myself to develop and to improve. I emphasize team work, constructive cooperation, and openness. Some reasons why I like Agile Scrum and a coaching management style.\n\nCommitted and accountable, with great drive and perseverance to achieving results. My critical attitude and analytical skills make me keen on projects to improve product and process, but making sure that quality, stakeholder / customer, and cost are fundamental.\n\nBroad and versatile experience with various disciplines and management roles in software engineering has given me a comprehensive understanding that enables me to work well with different department and handle seemingly divergent interests. As site leader, accountable for all operations at the site including facility management and local IT management. Extensive experience with Agile Scrum and software development with distributed teams.\n\nIt is very motivating to work in a high-tech, innovative environment where I can contribute with my skills and expertise.",
