Here, I am part of the Software Metrology Department, which provides the software solutions that realize the metrology system functions, producing sub-nm measurement and control accuracy.\n\nFrom December 2013 until May 2015 I was member of the Metrology Sustaining team. During this period my daily tasks involved picking up investigations on AIR issues (TWINSCAN XT-NXT machine models related) done by the software architects of the team and follow the complete patch delivery process to implement the solution to the bug and deliver the new targets to the machine in the field that has reported the error.\n\nFrom May 2015 I am part of the Metro Architecture and Tests team. There, I am working in the design of a C++ object oriented library to replace the already existing library that creates and manages the test log files that each TWINSCAN machine generates after executing a calibration test. The main objective of this design is to avoid unnecessary dependencies with a design that ensures the minimum effort of implementation and maintenance. This new library has C,C++, Matlab and Python clients. At November 2015, I am just at the end of the initial phase of this project, and during this first period I have prepared a proposal for the software design and a planning of the different implementation phases with time estimations. I am currently reviewing this proposal with all the stakeholders that will be affected by the introduction of the new library.\n\nDuring this time working for ASML I have improved my skills in writing software engineering related documentation as well as my ability to discuss software designs with other engineers and to identify in this huge company who may have the knowledge that I need in each moment.\u200b",
