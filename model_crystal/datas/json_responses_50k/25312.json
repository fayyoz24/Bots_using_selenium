This traineeship is unique, for it is competency-based; it is open to candidates who are ambitious, possess analytical and communicative skills and who do not necessarily have an IT background, but have completed a university or applied university degree.\n\nDuring this 2 year programme I am offered in-depth specialist training for the first two months, subsequently leading to a challenging position with one of Calco\u2019s client companies for the remaining 22 months. The first month of training consists of acquiring general IT knowledge. During the second month I will follow a specialisation course, which could be (but is not limited to) any of the following: information analyst, programmer, tester or junior project manager. After successfully completing all modules I am ready to put theory into practice at one of Calco\u2019s prestigious client companies, which operate in a number of sectors such as banking and insurance, health care and industry. During these 22 months at a client company I will receive continuous coaching from my designated Calco field manager.\n\nAfter successfully completing the entire trajectory I will be given the chance to fully transfer to the client company, making the Calco MasterClass the ideal kick start to my career.",
