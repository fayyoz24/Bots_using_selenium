    "summary": "Hello! I\u2019m an architecture writer and content editor based near Amsterdam. I help change-making (landscape) architects and urban designers strengthen their brand and online presence by creating awesome content that aligns with their philosophy and positions them as thought leaders in their fields. \n\nI am endlessly curious about makes people and companies tick, and always keen to explore the intersections between wellbeing, nature, people and cities. I especially love geeking out on cycling, biodiversity, urban agriculture and environmental psychology. I\u2019ve enjoyed experiencing the architecture profession from many angles over the last almost 20 years \u2013 first as a graduate architect, then as an architecture journalist and in communications and now as a writer and teacher, which all helps me see different perspectives of the built and natural environment. \n\nAs I\u2019m a big fan of facts and figures, here are some about me: \n6 cities: I was born in Kuala Lumpur, grew up in Sydney, lived in Melbourne, Stockholm, London and Amsterdam. \n3 architecture schools: I studied architecture at the University of New South Wales and the Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, and now tutor at the Amsterdam Academy of Architecture. \n27 minutes: is the average time it takes me to cycle 10km on an electric cargo bike for the school run. \n\nIn my spare time, you\u2019ll find me in the kitchen baking something sweet, pottering around in the veggie garden, hiking in the forest or slurping ramen in a no-nonsense hole-in-the wall ramen joint. \n\nIf I can help you tell your awesome story to the world, let\u2019s connect!",
