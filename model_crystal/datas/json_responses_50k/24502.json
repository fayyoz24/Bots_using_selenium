    "summary": "Throughout my career, I have actively engaged in various technical consultancy projects, successfully solving complex environmental and business problems. My core competency lies in developing contextual strategic solutions, that are informed by data-driven tools and techniques. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse entities, including startups, holding companies, banks, multilateral funding agencies, NGOs, CSR programs, and governmental agencies. This exposure, combined with the leadership program offered by TU Delft X!LEAD traineeship, has developed me into a well-rounded professional with a strong sense of organizational strategy and business acumen\n\nDuring the past year, I have dedicated myself to identifying my core strengths and values, with the guidance of \"Rookie Minds\". This process has helped me to craft a mission statement for my professional life, which now reads: \n\n\"My goal is to enable teams and organizations to drive innovation, optimize their value proposition, and have a positive impact while maintaining flexibility. I wish to leverage my analytical mindset, learning agility, and complex problem solving skills to help businesses make well informed decisions. In doing so, I aim to continuously grow, catalyse meaningful change, and inspire others along the way.\"",

But as cities in India and several developing countries are growing at exponential rates, government agencies are struggling to provide safe sanitation in their cities. On the other hand, due to increasing water stress, recreational needs and biodiversity protection in an urban fabric, urban water bodies are deemed worthy of conservation. Owing to a wide range of socio-political, technical and institutional factors which can impact sanitation service delivery in a development context, there is a need for a paradigm shift as to how sanitation planning is to be carried out. Citywide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS) is a new approach towards urban planning that is being developed with elements of the SDGs. The objective of this research was to systemically understand urban sanitation in the city of Bengaluru (India) and how it relates to urban waterbody health. Having understood the system adequately, the aim of the thesis was to answer the research question, \u201cCan citywide inclusive sanitation as a planning approach, aid in the betterment of urban waterbodies?\u201d",
