    "summary": "My passion lies in designing innovations which positively impact people and society! I love to inspire and find connections between people, business and technology in my work; Innovating between these three pillars is part of my DNA. \n\nI've always been an Outsider. I am a creative person, born into an entrepreneurial family, formally qualified as an industrial designer with Master degree of Business Administration in Innovation Management. Being an Outsider has become my strength.  With my creativity and interdisciplinary skills, I think and dare to go out of the box. Over the past years, I am trained to uncover innovative insights and work towards meaningful results with a well thought through process.\n\nOver the past decade, I have enjoyed working in various positions at Vodafone and Philips, where I experienced the implementation and management of innovations within products, services and programs. Although these projects touched many different disciplines, I always kept the 'human' element at the heart of my work. Whether it is a patient, user, customer or employee, I love to innovate for and with people. I believe together we can make a difference! \n\nYou never innovate alone. I go through this Outsider Inn process together with my client, team and other stakeholders. I also find strength in complementing my own skills with team members from my personal, trusted network. Together we can not only combine our strengths and expertise, but also build a human-centric mindset within your organization.\n\nI work with a clear approach based on \u2018Design Thinking\u2019 methodology; a creative and iterative process in which the human comes first. An Outside Inn approach. This includes, among other things: Design research, stakeholder mapping, customer journey mapping, service design, co-creation sessions and UX/Usability research etc. \n\nCurious how I can help you to do, coach or learn customer-centric thinking and innovation? \nDon't hesitate to get in touch or take a look at www.outsiderinn.nl and discover the power of an Outsider.",
