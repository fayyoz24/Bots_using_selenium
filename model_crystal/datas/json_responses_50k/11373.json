Parts of the Rotterdam are is located up to 6 meters below sea level in a country of which 25% of the total country is below sea level and 50% is prone to flooding. Due to climate changes such as rising sea levels, extreme draughts and heavier rain falls, as well as social changes, such as the rise of mega delta cities with closely concentrated economic interests and high population density, Water Management in the twenty first century needs a new kind of professional, with new knowledge and skills. We need Water Managers who can answer the question \u201cHow\nto make Delta cities Climate proof?\u201d. About 9 million Dutch inhabitants live below sea level and most of the economic value in the Netherlands is earned below sea level.\nPolders and dike rings are essential to protect the country against flooding. The course (Urban) Water Management is about teaching students how to live in a delta city and how to manage urban water. In this bachelor course students learn everything about Delta technology (water quality, water quantity, water safety, ecology, hydrology, hydraulics and modeling), but also about Delta design (water engineering, spatial organisation and urban planning) and Delta management (environment management, policy and laws, economy, risk management, asset management).\n\nRick works as a lecturer, but is also project manager and is manager international linkages. In this position he was able to work together with a number of partners in flood prone and sinking cities, such as Jakarta, Semarang and Manila. Rick loves to initiate new projects and work with international partners and share international best practices.",
