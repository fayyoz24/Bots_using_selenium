    "summary": "I am an energetic and passionate person and I\u2019ve been told that I am charismatic. I believe in enabling and empowering young people to reach their highest potential. Giving positive encouragement and appropriate coaching & mentoring are my strengths. I believe in investing in young talents. As the FastTrack coordinator of a university, I enjoy realizing my dreams and goals with young people, seeing them seize opportunities and excel because someone believes in them and give them the room to realize their fullest potential. Further, I am involved in recruiting international students to our university. This has also been extended in my role as the Senior Honours Coordinator in the Institute of International Business, where we encourage, equip and empower our students to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to add value to themselves and others around them. I have also helped many organisations in their sourcing of talent and recruitment from the pool of talent in our university.\n\nLately, for the last 4 years, I've been involved in and passionate about impact investing. I have invested in companies and projects that not only give returns on investment but especially that are creating impact for the communities and the environment, especially in supply chain financing.\n\nNetworking is another of my strengths; I am always with people and continue to learn with and from others. With my students, I also encourage them to do the same \u2013 after all, we all live in a community and \u201cno man is an island\u201d. I\u2019ve lived in Malaysia, Singapore, the UK, Milan and now Amsterdam. I\u2019ve done business all over the world from the US, Europe and Asia; and continue to invest in interesting business opportunities especially in the new economy.\n\nI\u2019ve achieved the Million Dollar Table award while working in Singapore in the insurance sector. I graduated with cum laude for the MBA Programme at the University of Amsterdam. I\u2019ve recently also achieved the certification of being able to create honours programs for top talent in the university. I continue to extend my knowledge through other interesting executive programs.\n\nWhen I am motivated and passionate and start something, I am ambitious and driven to accomplish, progress and finish it well. I have been and will continue to be creative in cooperating with colleagues to be solution-oriented in all my endeavor. \n\nPASSION & ENTHUSIASM are part of who I am.",

I believe that young kids need to eat and eat well to stimulate and grow their brains to enable them to progress in their education and it is a human right to have food. I believe and hope that in the future, this will lead to poverty alleviation as well. No Hunger, No Poverty! Currently working with the Utrecht University of Applied Science Honours students, students from Int'l Schools of Amsterdam, Hilversum and Groningen on the Breakfast Club project."
