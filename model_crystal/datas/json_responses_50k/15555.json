    "summary": "I'm an engineer who enjoys working in multidisciplinary and multicultural environments. I'm passionate about finding new ways to improve the quality of life for others. This sometimes means improving the existing methods and other times finding disruptive ideas in the light of societal needs. I love to see the big picture in my work, while still being in touch with its details. This is why I keep a close eye on the trends in the world of medical devices/imaging. \n\nI enjoy expressing scientific research and ideas in simplified terms via writing and presentations, in an effort to make science and engineering more relatable for everyone. I believe in the importance of working within multidisciplinary teams, collaborating with various partners for the betterment of research and development of new ideas.\n\nAreas of interest: Medical imaging, medical devices, image guided therapy, radiotherapy\n\nTechnical skills: Tomographic image reconstruction algorithms, metal artifact reduction methods in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), positron emission tomography (PET) design and reconstruction, Matlab, Python\n\nI am on LinkedIn to make new connections, network and build lasting business relations.",
