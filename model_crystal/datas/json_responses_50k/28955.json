    "summary": "Founder and director of NUQAM Consultancy after retiring as Associate Professor Nuclear Science & Technology of the Delft University of Technology. \n\nNUQAM's consultants aim at 'Replacing an empty mind by an open one' by sharing their experience and tailored courses, workshops and directions for solutions. We have been working both with governmental agencies and private industry.\n\nPhD of the Delft University of Technology in nuclear analytical science. Research from 1970 to 2015 in research reactor utilization, INAA, gamma ray spectroscopy, QC/QA, other radiation detection, radiotracers and PAC. I designed  irradiation facilities for research reactors and sample changers for gamma-ray spectrometers.\n\nMore than 180 papers in internationally refereed scientific journals, and more than 40 contributions to book-parts and internet encyclopedia. RG score is (Dec 2021) 38.63\n\nIn the year 2002  co-recipient of the Brazilian Pr\u00eamio de Excel\u00eancia em Metrologia.\nAwarded in the year 2011 by the editorial and advisory board of the J. Radioanal.Nucl.Chem. with the George Hevesy Medal Award 2011 and in the year 2018 with the Ioannes Marcus Marci medal by the Czech Ioannes marcus Marci Spectroscopic Society. \n\nConsultant since 1987 to the IAEA on nuclear research reactor utilization, strategic planning, nuclear analytical techniques and quality management; and consultant to the CTBTO on nuclear spectoscopy and quality management.\nI brought my own laboratory for neutron activation analysis to accreditation in 1992, being the first of its kind in the world. I have been working as technical assessor for accreditation bodies in Netherlands, Belgium, Argentina and United Arabic Emirates.\n\nAuditer of quality management systems (ISO/IEC17025) in 16 countries in Europe, Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Africa. Director of over 80 training courses worldwide on quality management implementation, including on special request from the EU JRC's in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands, and by the National Metrology Institute in Thailand.\n\nVisiting professor at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil for the postgraduate program \u2018Metrologia\u2019, member of the Inorganic Analytical Working Group of the BIPM/CCQM. \n\nChair of the International Advisory Board of the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.",
