    "summary": "While it\u2019s said you \u201ccan\u2019t be all things to all people,\u201d I challenge that notion a bit - I\u2019m indeed a multidisciplinary creative professional in the truest sense. I consider myself a visual storyteller, having been a copywriter and voice talent for Los Angeles and mid-size radio markets, in business development, sales and marketing management with a print publishing firm, and an experienced on-camera / stage actor and dubbing artist (Netflix/Amazon original content). \n\nI\u2019m a member of both the U.S.\u2019s SAG-AFTRA (TV/Film/Radio) and AEA (equity stage) unions, have been a casting associate for theater productions and served on the Board of Directors for a reputable LA Theater. From these liaisons, I\u2019ve also delivered production stills for over 30 full-length shows.  \n\nAs a self-taught photographer and Nikon Professional Services provider, over the years I've become an LA and NY-agency referred headshot photographer, credentialed press/entertainment, lifestyle & events and commercial photographer. I've provided Creative Direction and photography most often for the lifestyle and entertainment industries, including for an internationally-known travel products company\u2019s 2023 new-product launch. I'm as comfortable with high-profile inquiries as I am memorializing final moments between pets and their families. If it's purposeful to you, every capture is personal to me. \n\nAt the heart of everything I do and ways I can be of service is gratitude \u2014 for the people I work alongside, the people for whom I work and those I\u2019ve been able to help navigate THEIR goals and dreams. If you think I can be of help to you, please reach out. \n\nI'm also a HUGE supporter of sustainability and animal advocacy. One of my life's all-time highlights is being rescued by my three dogs. ;) Animals teach us love, acceptance and to live in the moment. If I could make the world cruelty-free in every sense, I'd give up years of my life to see that to fruition. \n\nI\u2019m a strong believer that all things meaningful are rarely accomplished alone. My greatest mentor - my Dad - would always say \u201cLove your work, and you will work tirelessly.\u201d",
