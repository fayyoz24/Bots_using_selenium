    "summary": "I would love to hear your complaint concerning my employer or my performance.\nI also like being wrong, since it enables me to learn. And it requires pointing out that this isn't a snobbish statement. I'm only human.\n\nProfessionally, I believe higher echelons are convinced of acceptable loss, which I firmly object to although I recognise the necessity.\nDecisions need to be made and challenged. Learning needs to be acquired, which ranges from the lowliest representatives to the highest of powers in all aspect with due respect.\nAnd we can all be proven wrong. We're only human, so raise your voice and don't fret to fail, falter or admit fault.\n\nSince if you don't care a whole awful lot, it's never going to get better; it surely is not.",
