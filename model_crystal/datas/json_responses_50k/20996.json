    "summary": "I am only 20 but I have a lot of work experience. During my first year of \nuniversity, I volunteered at a children's hospital and helped young terminally ill \npatients learn different things and socialize. I prepared fascinating lessons both in \nonline and offline formats for children with serious physical and mental diseases \nindividually and in groups. I adhered to social distancing protocols, was vaccinated \nand wore a mask all the time, following the rules. In addition, I took part in a TED-talk Educational \ncommunity as a speaker and performed on a stage with my presentation. I quickly \nlearned new skills such as oratory, increasing attention, and semantic saturation and \napplied them to daily tasks, improving efficiency. After attending English sports \nsummer and winter camps for many years, I returned for my final year as a camper \nassistant with a great knowledge of English on a level C1. All this experience taught me one necessary thing: not be afraid of taking risks and getting out of my comfort zone. I started traveling alone when I was thirteen years old. During my university time, I worked as an English teacher at Private Language School. I worked with different ages and language knowledge levels and it does not scare me. \nRight now I am working as a volunteer at KiM Jugendland in Basel, where I organize events and activities for children, spend time with them, and help with projecting events and holidays. At the same time, I learn German and prepare to pass the CAE in English in order to prove my language skills. Moreover, I keep studying Korean language on my own that I learned in the university for 2 years.",
