This project make CARROUSEL EVALUATIONS open and accessible for teachers of other departments and universities by explaining the method by several media: in a short animation, in a documentary film and by a practical description. The strong point of the Carrousel evaluation is the ability to provide more feedback in DBL compared to a traditional evaluation setting. Here a student often gets a lot of feedback during the process of the project. Yet, at the evaluation of the project there is quite often a lack of efficient feedback. link to animation: http://youtu.be/vToRLFldmNo link to documentary film: http://youtu.be/c6xhuVtcUFE link to practical description: http://www.3tu.nl/cee/en/research-innovation/assessment-for-learning/assessment-for-learning-projects/moonenlink1-carousel-evaluation-description-and-explaination.pdf",
