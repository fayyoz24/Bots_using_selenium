The overall goal was to advance the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques for creating 3D cell scaffolds presenting guiding microfeatures, that mimic the natural tissue extra-cellular matrix architecture of anisotropic tissues. The influence of microfeatures on cell morphology was subsequently assessed in vitro. This novel fabrication approach offers a new method for producing highly functional, mechanically tunable biomimetic cell scaffolds for  in vitro tissue models and tissue engineering applications.",
