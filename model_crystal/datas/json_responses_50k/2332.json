    "summary": "I'm an engineer within the field of applied sciences and I'm looking for great research projects to aid with my skills. I find it hard to determine what I like, since there are so many kinds of jobs within applied sciences, they all are great and scientific significant, but I can only work at one... and I'm still looking for you!!\nEvery job, every activity stands of falls with a good team, even \"less exciting\" work can be \"more exciting\" with the right team and I can be the asset you are looking for!\n\nI'm the kind of person who has a high work ethic and will likely do somewhat to much than to less. At one hand it's because I don't know a \"no\", at the other hand, at the other hand, doing overtime is a good way to show commitment to the job.",
