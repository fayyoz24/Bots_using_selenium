The first part of my research was to determine the optimal batch size for the cutting of baler frames. For the second part I had to determine if it would be feasible to insource the cutting of frames for sliding belts, as this process was currently outsourced.\nI came to a conclusion by working through an S&OP process. I've translated long term demand into a rough cut capacity plan for the new equipment, and worked out several load profiles using the different batch sizes. The decision I made was based on a combination of these load profiles, compared with the most important perfomance objectives of the company.",
