    "summary": "My doctoral research centers around valuation, performance measurement and technology in healthcare. I view accounting as a socially embedded organizational practice. I am the project lead on a cost & performance measurement & dashboard project at a Dutch hospital whilst completing my PhD. \n\nMy dissertation is features both quantitative and qualitative interpretive work: \n\n\u2022 how & why actors deem care or tech such as artificial intelligence (AI) valuable \n\u2022 how such value can be calculated across the entire patient trajectory (eg. time-driven activity-based costing, process mining) \n\u2022 how & why those calculated numbers or metrics impact actors through e.g. dashboards\n\nDuring my PhD I earned three grants to fund my research, and co-authored a (successful) fourth grant application. I have presented my work at international conferences (Academy of Management, ISPOR Boston, EHMA Brussels) and national seminars. I completed an academic visit at the University of Melbourne spring 2023.\n\nI teach management accounting, economics and business modeling related courses in our Bachelor and Master degree programs. \n\nI also paint professionally.",
