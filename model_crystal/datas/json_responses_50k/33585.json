    "summary": "Welcome to my profile! \n\nMy passion is to help individuals grow and support them in their career progress. After obtaining my Bachelor of International Business degree with a specialization in Finance & Control, I stepped into the world of IT Recruitment. I discovered that I enjoy helping professionals get the most out of their careers. \nI have an entrepreneurial mindset and international mindset, having lived in Amsterdam, Dubai, Mumbai, and Lima. When I lived in South America, I noticed that there were no places for students to do their internships. When I had difficulties finding an internship myself, I decided to create InternshipCrew - a marketplace for students aiming for an international adventure. \n\nI joined Dell Technologies as Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist where I focus on growing the Sales team in Netherlands. Profiles that I source for are the following: Account Manager, Inside Sales Representative, Sales Professional. For more information related to sales positions please feel free to contact me at idriss.warsame@dell.com or +31623889821. \n  \nAlso, in my free time I work at IW Search, a recruitment agency with a focus on IT professionals. Profiles that I source are the following: AWS, Azure or GCP, DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist/Analyst, Software Engineer and Embedded Software Engineer, For more information, please feel free to contact me at idriss@iwsearch.nl \n\n\"It always seems impossible until it's done\" - Mr. Nelson Mandela.",
