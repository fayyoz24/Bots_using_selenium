Amongst these circumstances, those skills and competencies are highlighted as what makes students adapt to society's needs and the labour market. The young generation faces a fast-changing environment and unpredictable challenges, but at the same time, well-known life crises also appear during the teenage years. They need to make choices every day and make decisions that sometimes significantly influence their lives. Choosing a career path, future profession, or only a sport- or free time activity needs background knowledge and a kind of structured thinking that demands many skills, what we define as life-management skills.\nOur initiation aims to assist pupils through the support of schools, teachers, and parents to improve students' life management skills to achieve optimal results. We find it essential to focus on career choice as a critical factor and prepare students and parents for that difficult phase of life.\n\nProject goals are:\nHelping teachers to transform traditional teaching using more creat\u00edve and innovat\u00edve methods (e.g.project-based, inquiry-based, problem-based, work-based, flipped classroom methods);\nTeacher competencies to embrace the potential of Open Educational Resources (OERs) within the rapid development of short up-skilling training;\nFostering creativity and entrepreneurship in education and enhancing the continuing professional development of the teaching staff;\nStrengthening the ability of teachers to collaborate effectively, both inside and outside the school;\nEnhancing the responsibility of students for their learning performance and learning processes;\nDevelopment of 21st-century skills and key competencies of students;",

The core idea of the project is that consortium of colleges and working life partners develop pedagogical methods and content for the vocational upper secondary qualification in safety and security or uniformed services pending on the partner country). \nIn Finland, the content will be embedded into \u2018International Security Operations\u2019 module in Vocational Qualification in Safety and Security.\nThis will be achieved by further developing the already existing materials and international activities of the colleges that are part of the project consortium. The materials finished within the project\u2019s lifecycle were piloted by partners and tested by students and company staff in in-service-training. \nThe material was assessed by public authorities such as the Finnish Immigration Service and private security companies such as Securitas. Local and/or regional security companies also contributed to the project by helping to develop the contents of the modules or by sending their staff to the transnational meeting and/or staff training workshops. \n\n\n",

EBBEY is based on materials developed by Helicon college for their Green Engineering study, designed explicitly for Bio-Based Economy teaching. \n\nVocational colleges in the agricultural sector in Europe experience problems in delivering well-qualified workers to innovative companies in the Bio-Based Economy (BBE). In general, teachers do not have the specific training materials at hand directly related to the new BBE. Most VET colleges (EQF3-4) do not have the right and explicit educational materials that fit the BBE challenge.\n \nEBBEY involved end-users, teachers and students. The project on the European level provided support for the European objectives of a shared economic vision to create a solid competitive and innovative Europe.",
