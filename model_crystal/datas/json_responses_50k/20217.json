    "summary": "I am a Master's student studying Media Studies: Digital Cultures at Maastricht University.\n\nMy undergraduate degree was a Joint Honours Degree in History and Politics at the University of Dundee. During this, my main interest was Irish history, specifically 1900-1990. My dissertation was entitled \u201cWho was Michael Collins? An analysis of the letters between Michael Collins and Kitty Kiernan\u201d for which I achieved a 1st and won the DF MacDonald Prize. \n\nDuring my undergraduate degree, I also had the opportunity to work as a PR and Events Manager for the student-run magazine, The Magdalen, as well as writing a few articles. In addition, in my final year at university, I was voted Social Secretary for the University of Dundee Humanities Society which allowed me to plan events, promote the society and our activities and liaise with our sponsors. These positions greatly enhanced my organisation, communication, and leadership skills.\n\n\nTo gain work experience in media, I currently work at MyMaastricht as a Social Media Manager. In this role, I am responsible for creating and publishing content across all social media channels with a specific focus on Instagram and TikTok. As part of my role, I also give presentations informing new and potential students about life in Maastricht. I also work as a Social Media Assistant for the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. This position means that I create and publish content across their social media channels and oversee the course ambassadors. These roles have improved not only my public speaking skills but also made me fully internationally minded.\n\nIn my free time, I play viola in the Maastricht University orchestra. Also since moving to Maastricht, I've also developed a love for traveling and exploring new places.",
