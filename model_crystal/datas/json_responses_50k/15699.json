    "summary": "My mission is to accelerate the energy transition by improving the way people and companies work together. The Energy Transition poses challenges that no single team or company can solve alone. This will lead to an unprecedented need to innovate and collaborate. \n\nFor this, I bring Agile ways of working and Organization Relationship Systems Coaching to leadership and technical teams in the energy sector, as well as 20 years of proven track record of delivering complex projects in international settings, and a broad background in science.\n\nThis background allows me to coach with authority and I love to unleash the power of relationship to drive sustainable change and solve complex problems. I get energy from elevating others. \n\nThe continued experience that the best business results come from teams with high psychological safety that are fun places to work lies at the start of my coaching career. My coaching style inspires change by integrating various coaching techniques with a focus on achieving outcomes and results rooted in agile.\n\nI thrive at interfaces, technical-non technical, humanity-technology, or between various disciplines. The leaders I work with describe me as: boundaryless, empathetic, curious, efficient, servant, authentic, courageous, balanced, natural, respectful, honest, thought-provoking, and knowledgeable.\n\nI am currently completing ORSC certification and am trained in Positive Intelligence and Agile coaching. I hold certificates in Scrum, Agile Leaderhip, and Scrum@Scale.\n\nPersonal values of Humility, Sensitivity, Creativity, and Curiosity.",

Through efficient stakeholder engagement, exploration and the production asset agreed to step away from booking small polygons around wells towards de-risking the entire area with a limited number of exploration wells, followed by a series of appraisal wells. The project went from initiation to first well in 6 months, and now fills the entire sequence for one rig in 2014. Authored the well proposals for the exploration wells, operational well owner for the first 3 wells.\n",

Rather than individual prospects, three projects (6 prospects) were included in the 5 year business plan for 2016. Another 96 prospects were handed over to the production assets for fast-tracked development.\nThe second project highlighted 3 potential areas for growth in the Ara play, and delivered one project (3 prospects) for the 2016 business plan.\n\nThe developed method was successfully applied to the rest of the exploration portfolio, driving the change from individual prospects to projects, and is taken up as a standard in the exploration-maturation process. The new process allows for value-drive, cost-neutral exploration and leads to more stability in the drill cycle.",
