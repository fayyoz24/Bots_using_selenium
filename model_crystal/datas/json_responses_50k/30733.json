    "summary": "My name is Kim, a research master's graduate in Media, Art and Performance Studies at Utrecht University, and the current manager of the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Analysis. \n\nI am a dedicated reader of literature, with a particular passion for (political) philosophy, magic realism and postcolonial fiction. My other interests range from (expanded) cinema to poetry, and from (art) history to photography. At present, my research is broadly situated within the interdisciplinary field of cultural analysis, but I primarily engage with theories of de/post-coloniality, phenomenology and new materialism as intersecting conceptual lenses to explore cultural objects (e.g. theatre, literature, poetry, cinema).\n\nMy working style can be characterized as structured and well-organized: I am skilled at planning and organizing events, drafting and implementing (project-)timelines and keeping general overview of organizational matters. I am not afraid to take initiatives and I enjoy being able to funnel some of my creative energy into (work-related) projects, for instance when compiling creative or thematic programs and/or events. \n\nI would be glad to have a chat or discussion; do not hesitate to connect with me!",
