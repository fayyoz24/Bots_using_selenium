    "summary": "I am a curious person, open minded and I love learning new things. I am well organised, precise, honest and optimistic. I enjoy working on complex problems and feel satisfied when I see the bigger picture and translate this into simple design solutions. I am creative, I learn by doing and enjoy an iterative process. I am most happy when I can learn something new, dive into a new topic, and successfully translate my findings into design opportunities.\n \nI believe in design as a tool for social innovation. Our way of thinking and problem solving makes that we as designers can contribute to solving todays complex problems like social cohesion, climate change, future proof education, effective and trustworthy political system, healthcare and handeling advancing technological developments. Society is changing rapidly and we need not only to adapt but consciously decide where we are heading. \n\nMy designs connect people with the ultimate goal of learning something from each other and ourselves. Throughout my life, I experienced that there is something new to learn with everyone you meet. We often have a prejudice about people we don\u2019t know, but once you start the conversation you quickly discover there is much more common ground than you might expect. Let our diversity be an inspiration and an invitation to challenge and reflect upon ourselves and our behavior.\n\n",

The focus of the public debate is shifting towards differences between groups and people. Politicians exploit popular sentiment for their own success, they polarize in an attempt to give every group a voice. If our representatives keep repeating and emphasizing our differences, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The aim of this project is to counteract these developments by showing people commonalities beyond what they can see so they will recognize unity in diversity.\n\n'Wij Zijn' is a puzzle set that you can collect at your local supermarket during the Christmas season. Each puzzle shows a diverse group of people with the question: 'what do these people share?' By putting the puzzle pieces together the user discovers an unexpected and invisible commonality these people share. These commonalities range from trivial and fun statements to important social issues and come with a clear expectation or assumption that is counteracted by the group of people in the pictures. 'Wij Zijn' helps people to find commonalities within a diverse group of people and shifts the perspective from a focus on what divides us to a focus on what we share.",

Tafelen is for all families that want to do something different during dinner time, have a good conversation, get to know each other better or just have some family fun. The game play is immersive and fun and the family can customise and play the game to their own liking.\n\nThe game consists out of a playing board, a card set, eatable cards, eatable markers, and sticky magnets. The sticky magnets are attached to the cutlery and the person whose turn it is puts their cutlery on the playing board to spin and pick a category. There are four categories: question, finish the sentence, assignment, and game. The assignment and game categories are to be played with the complete family. The question and finish the sentence category should be answered by the one who got the card and asked to at least one other person in order to stimulate conversation. Each category has DIY cards which players can use to come up with their own suggestion, write them on the eatable cards and eat them afterwards.",

The focus was on the upper grades where students are more independent and work by themselves at times. They spend the entire year together with their teacher and therefore a good student-teacher relation is important for the students in order to perform. The aim of the design is to improve in class (non verbal) communication by offering the students a way to express themselves which shows the teacher what is going on and where their attention is needed.\n\nEach student has a pyramid to show the teacher what is going on: working together with a classmate, question to the teacher, finished the task or distracted. This allows the teacher to help students more efficiently and adapt the lessons to what is going on. The student turns the pyramid to the side that represents what is going on and the teacher can easily see from anywhere in the classroom how the students are feeling.\n \n",

As a spin-off from TU Delft we excel in bringing theoretical knowledge about consumer behaviour, needs, emotion and wellbeing into practice for our clients. \n\nWhat I love about my current role is that I get to help our clients understand their consumer better and translate these consumer needs into actionable insights. For example, I was project lead on a large international study (in four different countries) about local food habits for a big multinational. Another aspect that I love is bringing happiness and health to consumers, patients and employees. Since I started this job I have been developing Tinytask which finally launched last summer. Tinytask is a thirty-day program which helps people take small steps towards big growth. Our best selling program is happiness. \n\nMore info on tinytask.nl & emotion.studio",
