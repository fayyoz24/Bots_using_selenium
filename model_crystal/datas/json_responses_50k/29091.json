    "summary": "[Note: Many of the activities mentioned in this profile should be taken as equally applicable to my wife Mieke Groot, who has been participating in all and everything from the start.]\n\nMy original background was in physics and classics, which led to one thing and another. Our main subjects are rooted in a long tradition \u2013 see the History paragraph of the Experience section. At present we\u2019re mainly occupied with exploring and developing pure scientific and applicable knowledge and insights in the fields of vision as a behaviour, and of vision-based behaviour. The expertise gained is particularly useful in the visual ergonomics of road traffic, e.g. in the analysis of accepted traffic policies and specific traffic situations.\n\nAs of 2012 we\u2019re part of the co-operation Verkeer-Zien, with Max van Kelegom of VMC (cf. www.verkeerzien.nl). In this co-operation we\u2019re involved in the critical review of often shakily founded and sometimes even counterproductive habits of policy and design in road traffic. Regrettably such shortcomings are often shown by local, regional and national authorities, as well as by institutes, consultancies, and others claiming authority and competence. A case in point is how regional and bicycle traffic are treated \u2013 see Post 1.\nIn that context we try to offer rational alternatives, as by advising on actual traffic situations, mainly road sections. Such advice is based on our own independent on-site research. My personal interests are:\nempirical psychophysics of visual perception, empirical cognitive science of perception, theoretical\ncognitive science, visual foundations of traffic behaviour, empirical psychophysics of visual art,\nphilosophy of mind and consciousness...\n\nFor further information, see the paragraphs \u2018History\u2019 and \u2018Present\u2019 in the Experience section and the Posts on this profile.\n",

                    "description": "History\nOur activities started in the late 70\u2019s of the 20th century, when we were known as IWACC, a name we still may use to show our historical roots. At the time, the main part of our work involved visual research for traffic-related industries and public or government institutions. This ended in the late 80\u2019s, when for nearly 25 years I remained out of circulation by an intractable health problem. For those interested, details of that history can be found in the appendix of \u201cDrawbacks of the emphasis on conspicuousness for the natural coherence of the perceived traffic scene, revisited\u201d (the relevant PDF is accessible through http://www.verkeerzien.nl/drawbacks/index.html).\nIn the intervening period (1989\u20132012) I kept up with science by reading and comparing material from a growing and widening collection of fields. I followed a rather unusual course along widely separated connections: from Anaxagoras to Francis Crick, from Maupertuis to Feynman, from Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal to Bennet etc. On the practical side I gained a lot of hands-on experience with visual techniques and their apparent effects.\n(Apart from this, I joined my wife in translating books as a source of income. Visual art was something else, but that is a different subject altogether.)\n\nPresent\nSee the Summary section for an overview of our activities. Our website www.verkeerzien.nl offers a few examples, as e.g. the two parts of \u201cBabel or babble\u201d. However, much of the present work doesn\u2019t result in an official publication, and most of the work from the early period (see the History section of the Summary) that *has* been published was never digitized.",
