    "summary": "In 2006 I started my study Hotel Management at Deltion College in Zwolle, The Netherlands. During this four years I gained a lot knowledge of the several aspect within the Hospitality Industry. I did three internships where I got experience in all the different departments within hotels, like Housekeeping, Front Office, Banqueting and Food & Beverage. Beside this study I worked at several restaurants to get more work experience.\n\nIn 2010 I started at the a Bachelor Hotelmanagement at the University of Applied Siences, Saxion Apeldoorn, The Netherlands. In the first part of my second and third year I organised a food gathering for students and teachers of the Hospitality Business School and in the second part I went for seven months to London for my management internship as a F&B Supervisor at Thistle The Royal Trafalgar & Thistle Piccadilly.\n\nIn the third year I followed the semester \"Hospitality in International Events\" followed by a succesfull internship as trainee F&B Coordinator for Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam where I took responsibility for reservations, promotion and projects related to F&B outlets and operational assistence.\n\nAfter my internship I have been asked by the Assistent Executive Director i/c of Food & Beverage to stay within Sofitel Legend The Amsterdam as F&B Coordinator. In February 2014 I took the descision to take a new step in my career at a former bib-gourmand restaurant in Harderwijk and wedding location in Hulshorst.\n\nOn the first day of 2015 a new adventure started at three Michelin star restaurant De Leest. Here I improved my gastronomy skills on the highest level possible in the Netherlands. After 2,5 year I took another opportunity at Bilderberg where to develop new skills in the hotel-segment. \n\nI am straight forward and ambitious. I set high goals for my self and do not stop before I achieve my goals. I would like to meet people and love to connect people and work with people with different backgrounds.",
