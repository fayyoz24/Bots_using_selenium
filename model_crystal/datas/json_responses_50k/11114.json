            "description": "I was offered the opportunity to become my master programme's ambassador. This included representing, advocating, and helping prospective students in their decision to attend the Media and Creative Industries (MCI) master, as well as the Sociology of Culture & Media research master. As an international student, having been a part of the ESHCC faculty for 4+ years, I had the knowledge and positive experience to enlighten fellow students on the programmes and the university. My strong interpersonal skills made me an approachable and inviting representative."
