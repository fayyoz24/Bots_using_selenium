Increasing water risks have led to more attention on water-related threats. While demand for water has risen sharply in many regions of the world, as a result of population growth and economic expansion, climate change is expected to decrease water supply, alter the timing of water availability, and increase the severity of droughts and floods.\n\nThese growing pressures on water resources undermine water security and contribute to conflict, migration, health crises, and food and energy insecurity across the world.\n\nData on global water resources is essential for managing these growing risks and challenges. Global Water Watch, supported by Google.org and the Water, Peace, and Security Partnership, will provide free, globally accessible, near-real-time information on water. Deltares, World Resources Institute (WRI), and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are partnering to create the data platform, which will house information on over 70,000 global reservoirs and major river systems, derived using satellite data, machine learning, and cloud computing. This data will help decision-makers respond to extreme weather events, manage growing risks of climate change, make societies more climate resilient, and preserve and restore our vital ecosystems and the many services they provide.",

At the coastline, the model is forced by extreme water levels containing surge and tide from GTSMip6. The water level at the coastline is extended landwards to all areas that are hydrodynamically connected to the coast following a \u2018bathtub\u2019 like approach and calculates the flood depth as the difference between the water level and the topography. Unlike a simple \u2018bathtub\u2019 model, this model attenuates the water level over land with a maximum attenuation factor of 0.5\u2009m\u2009km-1. The attenuation factor simulates the dampening of the flood levels due to the roughness over land.\n\nIn its current version, the model does not account for varying roughness over land and permanent water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and it does not account for the compound effects of waves, rainfall, and river discharge on coastal flooding. It also does not include the mitigating effect of coastal flood protection. Flood extents must thus be interpreted as the area that is potentially exposed to flooding without coastal protection.",

Our partners also include several key, EC e-infrastructures such as G\u00c9ANT, the European GRID Initiative (EGI), the European Virtual Observatory (EURO-VO), and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), as well as world-class, European research infrastructures including the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC (JIV-ERIC) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT).

While developing the design of the ESDC, AENEAS will  leverage existing products, technologies, services, best practices and standards offered by European e-Infrastructures and integrated e-Infrastructures worldwide.

Earth Observation development will focus on exploitation of the new operational Sentinel sensor capability for ocean biogeochemistry, fisheries and aquaculture, high-resolution water quality and other applications. Existing autonomous in situ observation platforms, will be integrated through validation and synoptic scaling.\n\nOutcomes will be explicit new capabilities jointly servicing large operational and climate change projects. For OCIMS these will include sea state forecasts for maritime operations, oil spill and trajectory modeling, storm surge predictions, water quality and related products at bay scale resolution, and enhanced ocean biogeochemistry observations. For ESM these will include high resolution downscaling models for regional climate change scenario analyses, and predictive assessment of marine environmental trends such as Southern ocean ecology and carbon sequestration.",

Operation Phakisa focuses on unlocking the economic potential of South Africa\u2019s oceans.\n\nOCIMS will support a variety of oceans and coastal initiatives by providing information and decision support to key stakeholders for the day-to-day management of South Africa\u2019s oceans and coasts.\n\nThe OCIMS 2019/2020 project outcomes are:\n\n- Establish earth observation technology capacity for the South African Exclusive Economic Zone as well as the extended continental shelf;\n\n- Deliver an operational system;\n\n- Establish and implement the data and earth observation infrastructure.\n\nThe project outcomes will be achieved through the development of an Information Management System (IMS) that will integrate current and future oceans and coastal systems, information and expertise into a user-friendly and cost-effective IMS for the benefit of relevant stakeholders. In June 2015, the Council for Science and Industrial Research (CSIR) was nominated by DEA as a service provider to facilitate the implementation of the project and to co-develop OCIMS.",

            "description": "The objective of this project was to develop southern African capabilities in ocean modelling and data assimilation to support ocean environmental and climate research (by providing accurate regional simulations and reanalyses data) and operational oceanography (by providing a regional ocean prediction system).\nThe project focused on the development of a high-resolution ocean model of the southern African regional ocean, and the implementation of a data assimilation scheme. South Africa having only limited capacity in both, but in particular in ocean data assimilation, would benefit greatly from development of such expertise.\nThis project builds on and combines the work done on modelling the Agulhas system using a Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; Backeberg et al., 2009) and assimilating ocean measurements using the Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (Counillon and Bertino, 2008; 2009). In particular, it proposes that an ocean data assimilation system is implemented for the southern African regional ocean using HYCOM and the EnOI.\nThe project aimed to contribute to the development of operational oceanography in South Africa, benefitting marine environmental monitoring, safety and resources (including fisheries), extreme weather prediction as well as climate and seasonal forecasting activities. The research will generate new knowledge of real management and policy relevance, supporting the local fishery that in turn provides jobs and food and generates tourism. The ocean forecasting and reanalysis system will in the long run contribute toward better understanding and assessing potential changes in the functioning of the current due to seasonal-to-decadal variability and climate change. The system will play an important role in efforts to adapt to climate change throughout the region and to marine management decisions, and have broader relevance to understanding how climate change might affect the Meridional Overturning Circulation.",

Based on marine weather analyses and forecasts including wind, wave and surface current conditions, ship characteristics and cargo requirements, the best shipping route will be determined. The proposed approach will not exclusively consider adverse environmental conditions as the exclusive boundary condition; the philosophy is to identify the optimum balance between minimization of transit time and fuel consumption and reduction of emissions without placing the vessel at risk to damage or crew injury. The tools will be tested both in post-voyage analyses and real time operations for North Atlantic Ocean crossings, voyages from Europe through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Channel to the Far East (e.g. China, South Korea) and voyages around Southern Africa including porting in Cape Town.\n\nTOPVOYS is funded by the MarTERA partners Research Council of Norway (RCN), French Ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea (MEEM), South African Department of Science and Technology (DST) and co-funded by the European Union.",
