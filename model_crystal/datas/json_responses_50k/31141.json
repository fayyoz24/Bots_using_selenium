    "summary": "Currently leading global design efforts at Hall Spars and running in-house global Finite Element Analyses using proprietary North Technology Group tools. Highlights include carbon laminate optimisation of numerous custom spars and booms, Oceanfurl boom development and the design and engineering of the new sections. \n\nSome of the projects involved with include a Nautor Swan 115', a Baltic Yachts 117', Truly Classic 128' as well as smaller race boats (40-68') and the Olympic Nacra 17 mast. The role includes providing support to the projects both from behind a desk and on-site. Furthermore, support of the sales team, development of processes, development of the design tools are part of the daily routine.\n\nGraduated with a Master of Engineering (Hons) in Ship Science at the University of Southampton before joining Schickler Tagliapietra Yacht Engineering. Here design and engineering work with professional yacht racing and maintenance could be combined.",
