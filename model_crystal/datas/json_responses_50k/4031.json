Rather than spend a lot of money and have an external agency make a super fancy (creative bureau style) website which would still be difficult for me to manipulate, I re-designed myself the website on WordPress. \n\nWe choose a theme that made use of shortcodes and used this to help easily build the design we wanted. We later adapted the CSS and PHP to add to or removed certain stylistic elements we wanted to change. \n\nThe link in the \"Project URL\" shows the before and after of the re-design.",
