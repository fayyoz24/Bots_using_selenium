    "summary": "Yves works as senior lecturer at the Department of Human Geography, Planning and International Development Studies at the University of Amsterdam. He is trained in rural development sociology and social anthropology. He obtained his PhD at Wageningen University in 2013 and has conducted extensive anthropological fieldwork and action research in Sub-Saharan Africa since 2002. His research and teaching interests involve rural transformation processes, with a particular focus on land rights and food systems. He has studied land reform and public-private partnerships in various settings, with a focus on the brokering roles of powerful elites such as \u2018white\u2019 nature conservationists, value chain actors and traditional leaders as well as small-scale farmers striving for autonomous production. Taking a people-centered approach, he analyses how state- and private sector models are reworked locally through actors\u2019 organizing practices. In this process, authority, knowledge and sovereignty are contested at multiple sites and scale levels. Outcomes are represented in new territorial configurations and land rights, public authority and counter-veiling discourses such as \u2018inclusive growth\u2019 and \u2018food sovereignty\u2019. Recently, he has expanded his research to rural \u2013 urban linkages and cities in Africa and Southern Europe as sites of alternative food movements and collective place-making strategies aimed at reclaiming urban commons. Methodologically, he aims to contribute to the \u2018anthropology of brokerage\u2019 and making value chain collaborations more socially-just through action research that appreciates farmers\u2019 local knowledge. He enjoys teaching critical development theory and aims to contribute to developing practical approaches to decolonizing the university curriculum. He has taught and currently teaches a broad range of classes at Master's and Bachelor's levels, ranging from introductory courses in International Development Studies, in-depth theoretical courses to research methodologies and professional and academic skills. \nFor publication list see: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yves_Van_Leynseele",
