    "summary": "Having landed in a new continent and successfully created a completely new (and very different!) life and career path twice, I believe in our extraordinary ability to adapt, learn, grow and ultimately enjoy the mystery of our journey as it unfolds.\n\nI help clients let go of their negative feelings and limiting beliefs, move from impossible to possible with ease, and transform their careers and their lives.  My clients gain clarity and vision around what they truly desire in their lives, and start living this vision with harmony and joy.  They experience abundance in all areas of their lives \u2013 \u201cmoney coming in unexpectedly from all corners\u201d, \u201cin balance with my family\u201d, \u201cfeeling connected with myself and my feelings\u201d.\n\nI am trained in co-active coaching, emotional releasing, mindfulness and am a certified yoga teacher.  As a former senior management consultant, particle physicist and non-profit leader, and having lived in 6 different countries, I have had the wonderful opportunity to experience many different perspectives.  I love helping clients explore new, positive perspectives that are full of possibility and allow something new and fulfilling to emerge in their lives.\n\nContact me at samsami.fereshteh@gmail.com for a complementary coaching session to learn more.\n",
