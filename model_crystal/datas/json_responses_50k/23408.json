This is the first ad analysis tool with this level of detail that had been provided by any brewer to the Buyer at HEB. \n\u2022\tEstablished my commitment to the customer by designing a tool that cuts down the time HEB spends on retail pricing by utilizing look-up tables to evaluate which items need to be priced versus those that can be eliminated. The tool on average saves HEB 4-8 hours per week.\n\u2022\tDemonstrated bias for action by creating a \u201cNew Items at Risk Tracker\u201d for the MillerCoors distributor network. The purpose of this tracker is to identify new items that are likely to be cut from the next round of sets because they are not hitting the profit threshold. This helps the overall category by increasing volume sales, dollar sales, and profit for these items by expanding consumer awareness through displays and sampling around the brands and packages at risk.\n\u2022\tLed presentations at least twice a year for the MillerCoors distributor network which includes approximately 30 different distributors.
