    "summary": "With 20 years experience in the Digital industry, I am an Awesomologist\u2122 and a Digital Leader.\n\nI believe in an Agile mindset: fail fast/learn faster. I always support the idea of attempting something ambitious and if it fails, learning from it and adapting. Failure isn\u2019t a negative, it is a learning oppourtunity.\n\nI am a leader who believes that business objectives and ROIs are a priority, but they are not the only priority. I lead teams the way I want to be led: with common goals in mind, with common sense and with humanity. Team members are humans first, employees second. I am a coach and a cheerleader for any team I lead and believe that I must give the team the best chances to advance their skills and their career. When they succeed, we all do.\n\nI have an ability to bring people together, to foster a community, to create alignment and consensus to help everyone move forward together. I am a firm believer in building quality, real relationships to achieve business goals together.\n\nLove what you do and surround yourself with amazing people. It's unreal what you'll learn.",

He has a sharp eye for detail and design, knows his code, he's fast and can effectively juggle multiple tasks, and he's a creative troubleshooter. Besides his professional competence, Kevin has a great sense of humour - he's one of those people who helps bring an office together and who can cleverly defuse even the most stressful situations. In short, Kevin is a total team player, a real technical and design talent, and one of those people you really want backing you up when something hits the fan.\"\n- Ian Johnson, Senior Producer, CBCNews.ca",
