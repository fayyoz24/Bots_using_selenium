    "summary": "I recently graduated from TU Delft and Leiden University\u2019s MSc in Industrial Ecology program, where I learned to apply interdisciplinary and systemic approaches to analyze and optimize the environmental performance of products, processes, and systems.\n\nMy aptitude lies in Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and impact assessment techniques, which have not only equipped me with analytical prowess but also polished my presentation and communication abilities. I've put these skills to the test as a student consultant, working with a diverse array of clients. Additionally, my involvement in various social impact initiatives has further enriched my skill set.\n\nPreviously, I co-founded RevClime, a carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) based startup that aimed to make CO2 utilization profitable. We won the Shell Energy Transition Award and were finalists in the Cleantech Challenge Netherlands in 2022. Over the duration of the Master\u2019s program, I have developed a keen interest in decarbonization and climate finance. Through my professional experiences, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse stakeholders to foster innovation and impact.\n\nI am passionate about transforming carbon-intensive industries into sustainable sectors and meeting new people who share my vision. I\u2019m currently seeking a role where I can apply my skills and contribute to the transition towards a low-carbon and circular economy. Let\u2019s connect!",
