Now they focus on Technology and environment. \n\nI developed a high precision motor controlled pulltester. A device used to test the connection between the crystal and its housing of integrated circuit. I redesigned a PCB which controlled high precision sensors and actuators. I used optical encoders like \u201cNumerik Jena\u201d and designed the C code that controls the sensor.\n\nC \u2013 PCB development \u2013 Motor Control",
