    "summary": "Hello! My name is Max Broskij and I am a first-year Bachelor IT student at Hogeschool Zuyd in Heerlen. \n\nI want to pursue a career in Software Development. My most used programming languages are C# and Python in combination with data storage like SQL-Databases and Json. I enjoy working in a team using the SCRUM method or other methods but I am also able to solve problems independently. \n\nI am a social and disciplined student and I have been working as a freelance waiter and bartender for over 2 years in a lot of different places. At these locations I need to show high levels of independance. This translates over to my education where I do extra programming excersises and projects to increase my knowledge and skills.",

The people I work for expect me to perform excellent work and always have to rate my performance. I enjoy working this way and I meet a lot of interesting people and colleagues. \n\nI primarily work as a bartender or waiter where I am rated 4.9 out of 5.0 on 75+ shifts.
