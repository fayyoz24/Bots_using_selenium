    "summary": "\ud83d\udc65 Driven by connection and purpose, I love to link people to the communities and organisations where they can be part of meaningful change. Whether someone is a program manager at a large international development donor or a young activist, I am energised by finding the perfect project for them to contribute to, and the best way for them to get involved.\n\n\u2728 My area of expertise is getting to the bottom of people's interests and wishes, finding the sweet spot where interests overlap, and developing projects to achieve shared goals. I am known for being goal-oriented, strategic and organised. This allows me to always bring focus back to the core objectives. \n\nI also excel at planning and managing complex processes of change. My strength lies in empathy and my ability to put myself in the position of others. Understanding what a certain change will mean for them both practically and emotionally enables me to anticipate where, how and most importantly why people might resist change, and to adjust my approach accordingly.\n\nSome career highlights:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Recruited and led a team of 14 organisers and 400+ volunteers in a Get Out to Vote campaign for the 2022 municipal elections.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Built lasting relationships with top Dutch and international institutional donors resulting in >\u20ac3.5 million in funding and repeat funding from >80% of donors.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Facilitated the development and spearheaded the implementation of an internal communications strategy, improving the involvement and investment of 150+ employees.",
