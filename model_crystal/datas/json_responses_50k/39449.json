    "summary": "I am an HR Professional, a master's graduate in Work and Organizational Psychology,  and a lifelong enthusiast of organizational psychology and the business sector. \n\nI am currently working as People Coordinator at Worley Netherlands. As part of the People Team, I enjoy helping employees from different departments and being part of varying HR Projects in an international environment. \n \nMy practical internship at NielsenIQ, my bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s studies, gave me the opportunity to broaden my knowledge about personnel selection, improvement of performance, and how psychological factors affect people\u2019s behavior at work. I have followed lessons about statistics, data analysis, research methodology, and psychological assessment, and I learned to use statistical tools. In addition, courses about conflict management and interpersonal and intercultural communication grew my interest in interpersonal interaction. \n\nAs a member of many student and volunteer teams, I have also gained practical experience in social media and event management. In addition, by being a member and then head of these teams, I developed skills like team management, collaboration, and problem-solving. \n\nMoreover, I did many internships in Greece and abroad in multicultural environments. I am always happy to work in an international environment and broaden my horizon by interacting with other team members.",
