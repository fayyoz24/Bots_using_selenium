    "summary": "Being part of a growing tech company with 90 colleagues and 50+ open positions is mainly super cool. I love to work and get things done - thriving when its chaos and the challenges are big. Bringing structure within the company, building teams, building relationships not only with customers but also industry partners in different countries. The people I work with and what we achieve together give my life colour and make me proud!\n\nA nerd and a generalist: with backgrounds in law, finance and philosophy - I find myself to be interested in many different topics. At Fashion Cloud this helps working with technical as well as customer oriented colleagues. I've always been driven by results, motivated by achieving high standards (graduated cum laude). Working at an investment bank has developed my analytical skills. But most of all do I like to build and manage teams - being responsible for big projects. Fashion Cloud gave me the opportunity to experience the natural leader in me. My broad interests in soccer (and many more sports), art, nature and cultural activities make that I'm never bored. There is always something to do, or to initiate. \n\nMy dream would be to contribute to a world with more nature, more (different kind of) animals (dont wanna see only see pigeons in the end - no offence to all the pigeons;)) and a smaller human footprint. Joining the Greenpeace supervisory board, becoming vegetarian are some steps. Fashion Cloud is a climate neutral company and we're working hard to also make the fashion industry a better place. My believe is that we can change the world by taking these problems serious, not being afraid to take measures with consequences, but also allowing individual freedom of choice. As such I also believe we need leaders who are not only focussed on risk management, but have the vision and courage to make industry changing decisions. I really hope I develop into one of these leaders. ",
