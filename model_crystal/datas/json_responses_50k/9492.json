    "summary": "As a scientist, I have concentrated on studying the cytoskeleton that underlies so many of cellular processes- complex, dynamic and so beautiful to image. Throughout my studies I have increased focus on Optical and Electron imaging, with their appropriate data analysis. These days I am supporting both modalities for novel studies of biological materials from the nanoscale  and up to physiological relevance. \n\nBesides my scientific work, I  always seek opportunities to communicate science education and critical thinking, at different levels: \n\nfor Students- to understand the physical phenomena behind beautiful fluorescent image. Not be fooled by the beauty, rathe to derive valuable information from every pixel. \n\nfor Scientific Community - to increase awareness for the need in more diverse academic personal. Not only because we are aware of the inherent injustice of traditional mechanisms in academy, but mainly because in a world which overflows with information and increased competition, allowing for different approaches and views is the best way to keep the back straight under load and promote high quality research. \n\nfor General Public - to promote outreach and education. I believe that in the era where answers can be found anywhere and anytime, while the algorithm selecting these is still hidden- we are extremely vulnerable towards mis-information. Our psychology can have greater impact than what we would like to think. I grasp  our ability to critically digest information and conclude on action as a muscle that needs to be trained every day*, and it doesn't matter if you are a full professors or a high-school student. \n*Usually goes well with strengthening your empathic muscles. \n\nCommunity and Volunteering - I  never cease to be amazed by the sophisticated mechanisms in which nature balances responses to external cues. I love simplifying and communicating these complex process to school and kindergarten age children by designing fun experiments and activities. I believe that Curiosity and Inspiration do not require high education, and I worked to reach broader audiences both when I lived in Israel and here in the Netherlands as well .",

In this, we are not as rational as we would like to think, rather very prone to misinformation and cognitive bias. Especially nowadays, when the amount of information can be overwhelming, it is important to develop awareness and apply critical thinking to help distinguish facts from opinions.\nWe, as part of the Kavli institute of science delft, aim to bring the tools and approaches used in the scientific world to a more general context. By raising awareness to logical faults, emphasizing the need to place information in a broad context and considering complexities instead of over-simplification, we hope to contribute to conversational manner .\n\nDuring times of pandemic and accompanied restrictions, reaching highschool/primary schools is far from trivial. However, especially during these times, when overflow of information has implications for health and society, these tools we wish to provide are of need. We therefore start by approaching the teachers themselves, aiming to provide them with a working frame, constituting of clear guidelines and examples, to  be further implemented during class discussion. As a study case, I examine climate change denial, and demonstrate the logical faults and psychological biases that objectors use in such discussions. I emphasize that The strategy to manipulate conversation is not limited to climate change in any way, and  continue by demonstrating the toolset given on various questions that are relevant for everyday life: from Tik-Tok to Capitalism, Porn and gender issues.\n\nSee more at the Kavli site: https://kavli.tudelft.nl/education/"
