This project explores the benefits of social media marketing and customer engagement, while Two Forms of Social Media Marketing and Customer Engagement Cycle are adapted as the conceptual framework to support the study. \n\nMoreover, by sending the questionnaire to the potential customer (Chinese tourist) via email online, a total of 122 respondents answered the questions. Furthermore, the data have been analysed through SPSS, and the results indicate that social media marketing, regarding its form \u201cE-WOM\u201d, can significantly and positively predict all the four stages of customer engagement. Besides, another form which called \u201conline advertising\u201d is a significant predicting indicator of connection and interaction, but it is not significant in predicting satisfaction and advocacy. \n\nThe conclusion drawn from the results implies that China Light Festival needs to highlight the importance of social media marketing, and Chinese social media platform called \u201cWechat\u201d is necessary to be chosen to create an official account and be adequately used to engage Chinese tourists. Based on the findings and conclusion, practical recommendations are conducted to help China Light Festival implement the methods smoothly.",
