The use of water from rainwater harvesting ponds combined with efficient irrigation methods will have a positive impact on the environment. It will reduce pressure on other water resource and will increase people\u2019s self-reliance through increased food security and income generation. This combination has been piloted in 6 different villages in Nepal and has proven to be succesfull as families are able to repay the loan amount in less than 3 years.",

            "description": "The landscape in the Ketapang district of West Kalimantan, Indonesia is under severe pressure from the high density of concessions for palm oil, pulp and paper, mining, and logging. To provide a way forward, Aidenvironment is working with the Bumitama Gunajaya Agro (BGA) oil palm plantation company and IDH, the Sustainable Trade Initiative, on a project that combines wildlife protection with sustainable production. This 30 month project, which started at the end of 2016, is one of the flagship projects of the new Sustainable Landscapes cluster established at our office in Bogor in January 2017. The cluster, which consists of five consultants and three GIS staff, was set up to meet the growing demand for projects on a wide range of topics, such as corridor planning, land use planning, forest conservation and rehabilitation, smallholder development, High Carbon Stock and High Conservation Value Assessments, and waste and water management.",

Aidenvironment and HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation Nepal facilitated this training, which was focusing on improving access to WASH through local planning. The training was part of the Nepal WASH Alliance program 2016 and funded by the WASH Alliance International. As the agenda of the WASH Alliance International is focusing on acceleration of WASH, the facilitators also targeted non-Nepal WASH Alliance organizations to participate in this training, as acceleration can only come from collaboration between different sectors and stakeholders.",

Soil and water conservation measures were planned at catchment level, incorporating these measures effectively into the landscape. This included consultations with farmers, farmers cooperations, nature conservation organisations and municipalities as well as field assessments and modelling using LISEM. The project has led to the effective implementation of water buffers, grass strips, field measures like mulching, contour ploughing etc. which not only reduce runoff and erosion, but ensure farmers will have productive soils on the longer-term and municipalities have less costs for repair and reconstruction of damaged roads and houses. The combination of these different measures including the payment, management and maintenance by all actors, were strong points of these projects. Untill now over 400 water buffers have been implemented.",
