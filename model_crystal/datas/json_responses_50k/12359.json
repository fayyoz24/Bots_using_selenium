    "summary": "With over 15 years of experience in e-commerce, consulting and tech, I am passionate about building and improving businesses in this dynamic and competitive field as Executive or Advisor. I have a proven track record of leading and growing multiple businesses, from strategy development to execution, from incubation to integration, and from local to international expansion.\n\nAs an interim executive (CEO/COO/CPO) and advisor, I partner with clients who face complex and multi-faceted challenges, and help them achieve at least a 5-fold return on their investment. I leverage my expertise in e-commerce, retail, and fast-growing businesses, as well as my skills in process improvement, analytical thinking, and business development. I have contributed to scaling the Dutch/Belgium #1 e-commerce company, bol.com, from EUR 250 million to a multi-billion company.\nRecently, I was CEO a.i. of the PE-owned umbrella brand for professional powertools and paint e-stores in Europe, Fixami. \nI also dedicate part of my time and income to not-for-profit initiatives that align with my values and goals.",

The incubation period varied from a few months to multiple years. In all cases, we were responsible for the proposition, the business case (and P&L) and (IT) realization.\nExample businesses we led and created are: \n- Last-mile innovations and the introduction of Select (bol.com's answer to Amazon Prime)\n- Assessing and entering new market(s) (segments). Initially focused on adding new categories and later we launched into the French part of Belgium (Wallonia).  A complex venture, since this was the first non-Dutch region\n- Developing retail services for Market-Place Partners. The most prominent example is Logistics via bol.com and \"Verzenden via bol.com\" in which bol.com (partially) takes-over the last-mile, customer service, warehousing and fulfilment \n- Experimenting with new Tech & Trends (e.g. Voice and Visual Search)",

Often we were the first in the Netherlands and Flanders to offer a significant broad and deep assortment online in these categories. \n\nAs business development team we were responsible for assessing retail markets and launching in the interesting ones. To make this possible we led a multi-disciplinary project team that started small in the strategy phase, but grew to a team of over 60 colleagues in the implementation phase. In essence as business developer I was responsible for:\n- market assessment\n- consumer proposition\n- business case \n- project delivery\n\nAs a business developer in this period my projects include:\n- Entry into kitchen and house hold goods with ~12k products launched June 2012 (2017: >70k products)\n- Entry into DIY, Pets and Garden with ~60k products launched February 2013 (2017: >200k products)\n- Proposition relaunch of digital reading through a partnership of bol.com with Kobo launched September 2014 (a.o. this partnership added >2 million International ebooks & seamless buying and reading experience)\n- Incubation of an industry initiative LeesID for frictionless buying and reading of ebooks across retailers. Owner of the initiative is CPNB see LeesID.nu for more information.  Launched September 2014 \n\nDuring this period I promoted from medior to senior business developer and from senior to lead business developer.",
