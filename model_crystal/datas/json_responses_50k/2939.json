Spearheaded start to finish logistics including design creation for our poster, poster production, implemented a diversification marketing strategy to distribute our posters, delegated daily tasks, cultivated and motivated our team members, finalized our route, and shaped our day of program. Created our Facebook Page and drove engagement with our audience. Established new connections in the event industry. Crafted the master of ceremony speeches and pre-recorded my speech (was in quarantine). Succeeded in providing awareness to the plight in Ukraine with our Steun Oekraine solidarity walk where we had over 400 participants. We had Amersfoort's Mayor, Lucas Bolsius, present a speech and the Onze Lieve Vrouwetoren tower rang for us throughout the entire walk, which is the second time Amersfoort has given special permission for the bell ringing in over 30 years. Live streamed the event and sent thank you messages to our colleagues.",
