Along the way, I discovered a ton of research showing that across Europe, Canada and the US, less than 10% of all new fathers ever take parental leave. Why? Turns out many men fear of career repercussions, loss of income and uncertainty about how to manage at home. Plenty of others are simply unaware of the options available to them. \n\nSo, I started a project - Take The Time - to change all of that. My goal is to make it totally normal for professional fathers to take time away from work to care for their children. I want to create awareness, create community, and inspire men all over the world to change how we think about parental leave and fatherhood.\n\nPlease visit www.takethetime.net for more information about the movement, inspiring stories from fathers around the world, and for information about how to get involved.",
