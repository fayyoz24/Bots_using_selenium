The D4LS initiative aimed to improve learner outcomes and improve academic staff workloads through integration of curriculum priorities including inclusive learning environments, learner focus, experiential learning, blended delivery, increased formative assessment, sustainability, Maori knowledge and transferable skill development. I led the establishment of a cross-organisational team to run the D4LS initiative.
