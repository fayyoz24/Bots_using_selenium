    "summary": "I am an optimist and always eager to learn. My interests are very broad and I have good\ncommunication skills. Furthermore I am a team player and I like working with colleagues. After 4.5 years of working experience I am more sure of in what environment and on what kind of developments I want to work.\n\nDuring my time at AAE I learned how to find my way in an organisation and help improve it. What I learned about myself in these years, is that I enjoy service trips, mainly because of the various kinds of activities that are required. \n\nWhen working with a system, I am interested in working with mechanics, electrics as well\nas with software. At AAE I had the opportunity to gain experience in all these three area's. \n\nCurrently I am working at VDL ETG Technology & Development as a senior mechatronics design engineer and I am finding my way to be an allround system engineer and hopefully in future a system architect. \n\n",

One for the manufacturing of displays that we delivered to the US and one for demonstrating the maglev principle, which is currently on-going. For these two stages I was/am responsible for the design and integration of the motion control software for 6DoF standstill and up to 3DoF motion. This included all aspects of a high-performance control loop (SPG, Controllers (FB & FF), Decoupling, Balance Mass control, Actuator and Sensor interfacing) as well as integration of drives/IO modules, linear motors (1 and 3 phase) and non-linear motors. In addition, I designed and implemented non-real time functions, such as initialization, calibration and validation. After integration I learned how to perform an error budget analysis and model-based design/improvements. Currently I am industrialising and standardising the motion control platform and also integrating interferometry.\nIn this first year I experienced how to work in the world of ASML, working together with multi-disciplinary teams to improve the Wafer Handler in atmospheric as well as vacuum modules. I performed tests on ASML systems in house but also at ASML in Veldhoven. In parallel I worked together with contamination and tribology experts for the development of test setups for measuring contamination.",

The FMBS method provides a stability-based linear controller design method for bilateral teleoperation architectures. The method enables taking into account the nonlinear bilateral stability criteria that are generally used for bilateral teleoperation architectures, while using linear controller design techniques, as opposed to the often-used a-posteriori evaluation of stability. \nA stability mapping is used, involving linear approximation of unstable regions. This approximation uses a single, rectangular-shaped area. However, it is shown that multiple and nonconvex stable regions can be present, which results in significant conservatism. Accordingly, the single-region FMBS mapping algorithm is extended to multiple regions.\nA tool is implemented that assists a control engineer in optimising bilateral controllers using the FMBS\nmethod. This FMBS tool includes a loop-shaping feature and contains the extended discretisation and mapping methods. Using this tool, the FMBS result of a control design for a single DoF rotational setup is analysed. Finally, the FMBS method is practically validated using a teleoperated robot for minimally invasive surgery. Experiments show that if conventional control design methods fail in performance optimisation, using the FMBS method this limitation can be visualised and, if possible, a superior performance can be achieved.",

In this study, available complex state space models are reduced using various model reduction steps. After this model reduction different control techniques, namely Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control and L1-Adaptive control, are investigated using different examples and applied on the flexible wing aircraft.",
