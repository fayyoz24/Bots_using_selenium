    "summary": "It is becoming evident; we need alternative sources of energy to prevent the climate change getting worse. \nI always have been interested in creating and using energy. From efficiently using energy for walking robots (master thesis at TU Delft & intership at CMU-Robotics Institute), via improving energy usage at one of the biggest energy consumers in the Netherlands (Tata Steel IJmuiden), to a innovative company that can harness tidal- and river energy (Tocardo), it is my passion to get it much cleaner.\n\nAlong the way, I believe in proper education for everybody, because education will result in prosperity and control. I was grateful to teach students in a township in South Africa physics and math and turn their newly acquired knowledge into practical uses. As Madiba said: Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.",

One is the eV-Challenge (www.evchallenge.co.za), a provincial electrical tricycle race in Nelspruit. which we won both times! The other is a space balloon to send up in the sky as high as possible. Together with Yellobric (www.yellobric.com) we raced (launched the balloon) and learned a lot about radio-signal, gas-laws, the solar system, etc.",
