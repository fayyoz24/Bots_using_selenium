    "summary": "Problem solver with experience in project management, research, policy analysis, and fostering livelihoods in the migration/refugee and humanitarian space. I have worked and volunteered in humanitarian disaster relief and development programmes in Germany, France, and South Africa and have conducted research in crisis settings in Malawi as well as for leading academic institutions in the Netherlands. I combine my experience as a practitioner and as a researcher to understand societal issues holistically and intersectionally.\n\nI hold a Master's degree in Development Studies majoring in Governance of Migration and Diversity from the International Institute of Social Studies and specialising in Conflict and Peace Studies. Through my Bachelor's in European Politics and Society and a minor in Southern African studies, I have extensive knowledge on international relations in both the Global North and Global South. \n\nI am highly skilled in intercultural encounters due to various language skills and can navigate challenging environments that call for high cultural sensitivity and empathy for those experiencing crisis. Always eager to learn, driven and ready to solve problems because of my analytical nature. I am committed to bring about political and societal changes.",
