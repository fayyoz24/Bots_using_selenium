    "summary": "Passionate leader of science- and technology-based innovation with positive impact on society. \nCurrently active in roles for the  Netherlands Academy of Engineering, Quantum Delta NL, AI Ned, TNO Industry, and Innovation Fund North Holland. \nExtensive experience at Royal Philips as CTO (Jan 2016- Dec 2022) and Head of global Research (2010 - 2022), supporting the move of Philips to become a focused HealthTech company. Prior to this, leader of research in the area of lighting and microsystem technology for divisions of Royal Philips (now Signify and NXP), optical data storage, and semiconductor physics.    \nRed thread in my career has been dealing with digital disruption, in fields as diverse as video recording (BluRay disc system), lighting disruption by LED's and the Internet of Things, and healthcare transformation enabled by solutions leveraging cloud, data&AI, and SW defined systems. Some of the other breakthrough innovations I have been involved with include early work on EUV lithography (with ASM-L), fiber optic shape sensing for guiding minimally invasive therapy, and applying AI to medical imaging.\nI learned from successes and failures in corporate entrepreneurship, with some notable spin-outs or divestitures (e.g. Molecular Diagnostics to Biocartis, Innosign oncology pathway diagnostics, and Philips Photonics). I also drove a number of open innovation initiatives, such as helping create the Holst Center (partnership IMEC and TNO), and expanding the Eindhoven innovation ecosystem (e.g. e/MTIC, the Eindhoven MedTech Innovation Center).  \nI served in an advisory capacity on the  board of the Foundation for Physics of Matter (FOM), the Centre for Translational Molecular Medicine (CTMM), and the strategic advisory council for TNO Industry. Member of the Dutch Academy for Technology and Innovation (ACTI), and the \"Koninklijke Hollandse Maatschappij van Wetenschappen\". \nAs scientist recognized for early discoveries related to electronic transport phenomena in semiconductor nanostructures.",
