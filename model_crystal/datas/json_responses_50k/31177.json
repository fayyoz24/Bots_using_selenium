It\u2019s breathing deeply while doing poses named after animals and feelings. It\u2019s done in dimly lit rooms with candles and incense, followed by gluten-free cupcakes and kale smoothies. And if that\u2019s your mentality then you\u2019re not alone. But it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right.\n\nBOYS OF YOGA is an international project created in 2015 by M\u200b ichael James Wong,\u200b Global Yogi & Wellness Warrior. A Los Angeles native, now based in London, Wong\u2019s intention aims to smash the stereotypes and misconceptions of guys who yoga. \n\nThe uncelebrated minority, a crew that believes in the strength and flexibility that yoga offers both on and off the mat. A belief that yoga, much like surf, skate and snow sport cultures, creates a community of the like-minded, the deeper you go, the more it pulls you in. Michael found out that once men move past the stereotype, they realise yoga is good for everyone, the benefits are undeniable.\n\n\u201cSOME GUYS THINK THAT YOGA MAKES YOU LESS OF A MAN, THE TRUTH IS IT MAKES YOU A BETTER ONE\u2019 \u2013 MICHAEL JAMES WONG\n\nToday the crew has over 75+ global ambassadors (referred to as BOYS) spreading the word across communities in North America, ASIA, UK, Europe, Africa, Australia & New Zealand . Each and every guy in the crew is an inspiring teacher or influential yogi in the global community, or in their own little community somewhere in the world, all who have dedicated their lives to doing positive things in their own way.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to be representing an international movement which sends such an important message to the male population in this country. Boys of Yoga is supported by an incredibly talented and passionate brotherhood of guys who are redefining the meaning of yoga.\u201d - Ben Gould, Co-Founder Bondi Yoga House.",
