    "summary": "As an advocate for improving the 3P (People, Processes, Planet) initiatives, I anchor on my deep knowledge across these three sectors - Communication, Energy (Natural Resources Management as a major) and Sustainability. \nEqually, I take great pride in my technology management expertise as it solidifies the connection across my 3 skills. \n\nI am passionate about helping organisations (starting with the people in it) build an inclusive & equitable culture, where people communicate effectively without bias & apprehension. I do this, through the #CommunicatewithTA platform. Many great stories / feedback already \ud83d\ude09.\n\nAs a solution oriented person, I sit on a few organizational boards where I deploy my Strategic Communication & Sustainability competencies to deliver continuous value to the stake & shareholders.\n\nMy entrepreneurial foray in Cosmetics manufacturing is where I deploy my chemistry and certified knowledge of post-partum skin management to formulate natural, safe & effective skincare products for African and Afro-centric individuals. \n\nI contribute to thought leadership content across Strategic Communications, Energy, Sustainability and Entrepreneurship in leading publications and regularly participate in industry-specific conferences and seminars as a speaker, while my preference remains to moderate/facilitate. \n\nHappy to connect, and more - if any of my skillsets is a pain-point to you and/ or your organisation - feel free to pick my brain \u263a\ufe0f.",
