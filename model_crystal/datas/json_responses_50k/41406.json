    "summary": "I am a hardworking, enthusiastic and determined nutritionist whose ambition is to help people improve their health status by means of research and program management.\n\nI believe nutrition and wellbeing are inextricably connected to one another and that nutritional programs and research are necessary to combat any form of malnutrition from micronutrient deficiency to obesity. My educational background in Nutrition & Health (focused on Global Nutrition), together with my experience in low and middle income countries (internships & fellowships) mark my intrinsic motivation for working in an international setting. The experiences abroad are really important to me and I especially learned to work in multi-disciplinary teams and be flexible and independent. I can easily adapt to changing circumstances and I flourish in a challenging setting. \n\nIn my current position as a PhD student, in an ongoing prospective cohort study (EnCoRe), on lifestyle recommendations in colorectal cancer survivors I gained expertise and skills in both project management as well as data-analyses. Personally I would describe myself as a quick and energetic learner equipped with good organizational skills. Moreover, I am a strong strategic and analytical thinker, a person with a can-do attitude and presenter. \n\nAfter my PhD I am ready for the next step in (global) nutrition. The excitement it gives when contributing to something of added value, is one of the main reasons why I would like to further pursue my career in (global) nutrition preferably in an international organisation. I would like to communicate research results and engage with stakeholders from policy, research, civil society and private sector to achieve evidence-based development outcomes.\n\nOf course, I am willing to further elaborated on my interests and competences. Please feel free to contact me via marlou-floor@hotmail.com.\n\nSpecialties: Scientific skills: lifestyle, nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and body composition. Strong research skills (epidemiology, statistics and monitoring & evaluation) and experience in project management.\n",
