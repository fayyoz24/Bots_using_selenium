    "summary": "Innolation, the title of Remco van Riet's first book is published in Q4 2022. \n\n\u270d\ufe0f\ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\udcda Book writer \u27a1\ufe0f Innolation: Your journey is your destination\n \ud83d\uddff \u26e9\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4c Avid traveller, having visited over 75 countries\n\ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfa5 Featured artist on maybe the only recorded song in the world that include Dutch, English, Spanish, and Swahili lyrics\n\nInnolation = Innovation + Revelation\n\nInnovation = the introduction of new things, ideas, ways of doing something\ud83d\udca1\nRevelation = an enlightening surprise\u2728\n\nTogether they mean to reach an enlightened surprise by introducing new ways of doing something and experimenting with new ideas. Innolation is about being curious and open, not only to yourself, but to the people around you and the world at large.\n\nIt is about enjoying the process, not only the results. Simply embracing life\u2019s journey as your destination.\n\nRemco van Riet has experimented all his life with building new habits and seeing every experience as a complementary lesson for self-reflection. He incorporates various sources of inspiration into his daily life. And through following his own journey at an early age, he often chooses the unusual path, leading to a life full of surprises.\n\nGreatly inspired by traveling the world, he stays constantly open to new cultures, ideas, and life lessons. His unbounded curiosity is at the root of this all.\n\nWith a Master\u2019s degree in Innovation Management from Erasmus University Rotterdam and with over ten years of working experience (in both start-ups and corporates) within this field, he strongly believes that innovation within companies is no different than personal innovation because it is people that drive change. \n\nHe argues that innovation principles can not only help companies improve but that they can actually guide every individual to live a fulfilling life as long as you enjoy the process and embrace your journey. It is the reason that he has also coached many students on how to follow their own journey at the start of their career.\n\nCombining his innovation experience on both a personal and business level with a natural curiosity for change and a strong interest in other topics such as history, philosophy, and psychology, he makes a brand-new connection between innovation and revelation, redefined as Innolation. Innolation is a way of living where experimentation leads to a life full of surprises.\n\nMany roads may lead you to a destination, but life is not about reaching a specific destination. Following your own path and deciding how to travel are both part of an adventure called the journey of life.\n\nEnjoy traveling!",

There are no secrets on how to do this best and without one-size-fits-all solutions we have to find our own way. While we have to embrace this challenge, we also want to enjoy life, but we often get stuck in a vicious circle. We live in automatic pilot mode from the moment our Monday morning alarm goes off. Either craving for the weekend, or we continue the rat race, the endless chase of achieving more and barely catching anything. We wanted to enjoy our journey, but we got lost, and now we wonder how we ended up here.\n\nGetting back on track takes time and life has its obstacles. To find your way back, you have to start somewhere. If you want to take a shortcut and only believe in life hacks, this book is not for you. Change is difficult but doable. This book is your personal travel guide, your compass to help you navigate life. \n\n\u2018The guide makes difficult life concepts easy to understand, and change very actionable!\u2019 - Kemi Adegbokiki\n\n\u2018The book is fun and insightful! With my thoughts all over the place, the book is the perfect guide for my own self-reflection\u2019 - Camiel Geryszewski\n\n\u2018Innolation has made me fall in love with the process\u2019 - Christopher Paine\n\nThis book contains 8 key concepts for inspiration, 24 key lessons to take in, and 40 questions that make you reflect and come into action. Just like the Lonely Planet, this guide shows you different routes, but you still decide how and where you want to travel. With Innolation you start your own journey of continuous self-discovery. It is about enjoying this process, not only the results. Simply embracing life\u2019s journey as your destination. \n\nWill you travel to follow your own journey?",

Together with four other students I was responsible for the entire project and therefore we worked closely together all throughout the project. In the end we visited Acer, ASML, Delta Electronics, HTC, KPMG and various non-profit organizations.\n\n\"Every year a group of enthusiastic Master Management of Innovation students will travel across the globe to expand their vision and visit innovative companies. The mission of this International Innovation Project (IIP) is to develop relationships and to facilitate knowledge exchange among Master Management of Innovation students and the international business community. We aim to enrich the content and practical value of the Master Management of Innovation by organizing the IIP. Furthermore we will create an optimal balance between business, social activities and the cultural experience students will have.''",
