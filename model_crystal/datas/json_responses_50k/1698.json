    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic individual with a multicultural background. I am originally from Cluj Napoca, Romania, where I grew up to be an active volunteer, who enjoys working with people and being part of a team. I received my bachelor\u2019s degree in media technology from Aalborg University in Denmark, followed by my master\u2019s degree in Industrial Design from TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\nI am passionate about designing for health, especially using patient-centered design. Because of this, I graduated with a specialization in Medical Design (or Medisign). My master\u2019s thesis focused on engaging patients in their health and my bachelor\u2019s thesis focused on a Brain-Computer Interface developed for rehabilitation purposes.",
