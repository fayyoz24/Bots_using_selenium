    "summary": "Hi there,\n\nI'm Chee-Han /Tea'hahn/ and I'm a freelance film editor with almost 15 years of editing experience. I focus on cutting short format content such as TV commercials, short documentaries, fashion films and other content for social media. I also have experience with long formats like TV-shows for Fox' 24Kitchen and for Hulu TV where I've edited Fashion & beauty TV series. I'm proud to have worked for award-winning companies like Whitehouse Post, Passion London and Wieden+Kennedy on global high end brands such as Apple, Coca-Cola, Adidas and Playstation.\n\nBesides my passion for editing I also like to engage with topics and themes related to cultural diversity and inclusion. I do this by giving talks and lectures on Editing, representation & inclusion. I love sharing my knowledge as an Editor and show examples of how to establish and contribute to a more inclusive  process. \n\nAs a media maker I also focus on a more diverse and inclusive representation of gender and ethnicity. In 2019 my partner Reza and I wrote a children's book called \"Where Is My Noodle Soup?!?\". It's a culturally inclusive children's book and the very first Dutch children's book featuring an Asian Dutch main character. Our book has been extremely well received and our publisher ROSE Stories did a fifth printing within only 1,5 years. And in 2021 I received a Silver Lamp at the Dutch Creativity Awards in the category Society - Diversity, inclusion & equity for my awareness project The Invisible Ones with the video #ISpyWithMyLittleEye that went viral during the corona pandemic. \n\nFinally, as a public speaker I like to talk about and discuss topics such as (mis)representation in the media where I like to put advertising in the center of attention as that's the field where I have gained most of my experiences and insights from. The difference between authentic and sincere diversity and just a symbolic gesture is the team behind the campaigns. Diversity in the work environment is a must. If you want to hear more of my thoughts I'm happy to drop by for a presentation.",

Multiple productions I have worked on have been rewarded with international advertising and media awards such as Cannes Lions, Epica, The One, Prix Europe and more. Besides editing I also do supervision work. I oversee the workload and manage junior and assistant editors. \n\nSince 2022 I've been actively looking and hiring female editors of colour. I mentor them and guide them in the high end post production industry as I believe the industry need more balance.\n\nApple, Coca Cola, Adidas, Asics, Tommy, Calvin Klein, BMW, NIKE, W+K, 72andSunny, TBWA, Halal, New Amsterdam, 24Kitchen, Whitehouse London and Passion Raw are just a few names of companies and brands I've worked for.

We give public talks about stereotypes in media from a commercial or academic point of view. And we also act as consultants on film and TV projects. \n\nOur very first project started with a children's book \"Where is my noodle soup?!?\". An inclusive book for 3 to 6 years old with the very first Asian Dutch main character that's not represented in a stereotypical way. With this book we counter stereotyping and food shaming by showing kids and parents how wonderful it is to share and taste new food from different cultures. The book has been received extremely well by the public. Our second book \"Fried rice with everything and anything!!!\" has been received equally as warm. \n\nBesides children's book we also like to speak out through story telling. We've created and produced the awareness video \"I spy with my little eye\" to stop discrimination towards Asian Dutch minorities. The video went viral and has been awarded with a Silver Lamp at the Dutch Creativity Awards (ADCN).\n\n For more information about our work and services please visit our website www.bongkarmetwongkar.nl",
