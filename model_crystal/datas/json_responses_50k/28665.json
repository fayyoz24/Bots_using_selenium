    "summary": "I am a Sandwich Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Hydrology and Quantitative Water Management (HWM) at Wageningen University and at the Research Institute of Meteorology and Water Resources (FUNCEME, Brazil). \n\nIn my thesis, I deepen the understanding of what is behind the evolution of drought events through a multidisciplinary approach. Specifically, I aim to analyze the role of the dynamics of human interactions in the intensification and propagation of drought and its impacts through socio-hydrological model simulations.\n\nMy background is mainly related to civil engineer, remote sensing, drought monitoring, and impact assessment.
