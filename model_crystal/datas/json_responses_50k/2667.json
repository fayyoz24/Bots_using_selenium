            "description": "I was a bi-monthly contributor to my university\u2019s magazine where I wrote pieces that often involved interviewing people at the university, either for entertainment or education purposes. The pieces I wrote include a humorous piece on what Latin American students\u2019 experience is like at my university, highlighting certain stereotypes that others believe about their cultures, a list of students\u2019 favourite songs, to show the readers a small array of international music, and another piece on the \u2018Movember\u2019 movement. I researched and wrote on what the movement is about, and different issues that pertain to the health of people of the male sex, as well as some ways for male readers to take care of their bodies and emotional health, for which I interviewed a participant of the movement at my university. In collaboration with two friends, we also wrote three movie reviews."
