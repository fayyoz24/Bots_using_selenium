            "description": "As a high school graduation project, I built the ECU software of a quadcopter as well as the computer side software to remotely control it via a Joystick.\nThe quadcopter was developed in C/C++ running on an STM32F4 Discovery. It made use of PID controllers as well as a Kalman filter to process the user inputs and sensor readings from accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.\nThrough this project, I learned sensors data processing as well as gotten familiar with developing in a resource-limited environment.",
