    "summary": "Since I remember, I have always been naturally curious. For me, playing with toys it has always been to take a screwdriver and disassemble them, in order to understand how they are constituted and how they work.\n\nRelated to my family business, since very early I had contact with customers and dealing with people. Saturdays were maintenance days of equipment. Unconsciously, I developed skills such as negotiation and problem solving.\n\nSeeing that I always liked to know a little about everything, the choice was obvious - Mechanical engineering.  \n\n\n\u201cFailure is an option. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.\u201d - Elon Musk",
