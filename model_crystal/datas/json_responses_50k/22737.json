Their love story is very unique and inspiring. With the Atlantic Ocean between them, Aga (Mexico) and David (The Netherlands) met and fell in love in The Netherlands during Agra\u2019s holiday. Since they met, their love grew and became stronger despite the thousands of kilometers between them. In situations like this, the Ocean is not the only wall standing in between two people in love because bureaucracy adds another thick layer. With the support of family, friends and some paper work, finally, Agra and David got married in Mexico and it did not take long until this wonderful couple could happily start a family under the same roof in The Netherlands.\n Due to various circumstances, they did not have a \u201ctypical\u201d wedding with all beautifully arranged nor some good photos to capture this special day. This is when we become part of their story. For us it was a great pleasure to realize this project out of which some wonderful wedding photojournalists portrait photos were produced. As we reached the ending of the photo session, we spontaneously decided to add a family photo book that included portrait and group photos capturing some family\u2019s happy moments. Finally a wonderful family photo album is ready to be proudly shared with Agra\u2019s family thousands of kilometers away. This is why this project was split in two photo albums: family and wedding.\n\nWe would like to thank Agra and David for sharing their story, their smiles, their happiness and for their trust in having us to create lots of wonderful and joyful photos to celebrate their love.\n\nKeep love in your heart.

Their passion is contagious, their skills and knowledge about music is outstanding. They truly live and feel every single note filled with 30+ years\u2019 experience on their shoulders.\n\nThat day my wife and I packed the camera, lenses and some basic gear and drove to Bram\u2019s house. We did not know what to expect because we never met Bram and Tanja before nor we had any knowledge on the working area such as light conditions, size, etc.\n\nSince our arrival, the joy started! Bram and Tanja were amazing friendly. When Bram found out that my wife was Cuban, music started. From that point on it was simply a fantastic photo sessions. There were music instruments and parts, machinery and tools all over. Bram showed us some very interesting techniques as he moved on with his work. Meanwhile Tanja was showcasing all sort flutes, trumpets and saxophones. We went on for two wonderful hours, filled with lots of stories, sounds, salsa music and a joyful ambience. We got along so well that we ended up having dinner at a great Italian restaurant nearby.\n\nWe truly loved this photo session. Bram and Tanja are two wonderful, joyful and special people we all should learn from. A clear example that age is not a limitation to pursue our dreams and keep our passion alive. Age is just a number and part of our journey called life.\n",

Adriana and Jeroen are a wonderful couple that got married some years but unfortunately, they did not have a proper photo shooting. So only some pictures taken by friends and some other low quality ones. This story really soften our hearts and we were very happy to bring some memories back and create a portfolio to celebrate their love.\n\nOur first idea was to make the photo shooting session outdoor. There are many beautiful spots around here including castles, park, lakes and a big forest but the weather was not on our side at the day of the shooting. Since short term rescheduling was not possible, we took the challenge to make the pictures at their place. Space was limited, lighting somewhat challenging but we were all up for it. The make-up and hairstyle of the bride started around 9:30 AM and around 11:30 the bride was all shiny and ready. The groom came in to see her beautiful wife! There where our journey started. It was a very enjoyable session. We had some laughs a nice lunch break and most of all we ended up with lots of great shoots.\n\nOften we believe that to make great pictures you are bound to a top location, with top gear and top models. In reality all you need is creativity and simply make the best of the situation. Thanks to Adriana and Jeroen for this wonderful session. Now you finally have some pictures of your wedding to be proud of.\n",

While talking about photography we thought about shooting some studio portrait pictures highlighting his face, his beard in some kind of cool, serious and mysterious look. All in black ad white.\n\nFor having being his first experience as model, BJ did a very good job and we pulled some nice pictures out of the shooting session. We did not use any complex lighting nor make-up or special clothes. It is in the simplicity and spontaneity of the pictures that lye their charm.\n",

I was interest in having a dark skinned model because I love the contrast between skin and eyes. When I look at the pictures of other photographers, I am always impressed with the beauty of their shoots of for example afro American models. There is always something special in these pictures.\n Clarity is a dear friend of my wife and while talking over a nice cup of tea we propose to have her modelling for a studio photo session. She is a kind of shy but my wife and I knew that we could make some beautiful pictures of her especially if playing with contrasting colors such as white, red and yellow.\n We used only one or two soft boxes with either a dark grey or white background. The make-up was beautifully made by Beamiris. She went for a mild make-up to not overwhelm her face. Rather the make-up was meant to make her eyes popping a bit more.\n\nThe various poses were spontaneous and again non-professional models turned out to be great producing great shoots. We really enjoy this session and we will forward to more.\n",

We started from a simple idea and as we went through the photo shooting the focus slowly changed. We focused on the eyes, playing with the background color that came from the reflection of the red color of the Noemi. She is not a professional model but yet some very good shoots came out. I really enjoyed doing this project. It was fun, relaxed and fulfilled what Noemi wanted. She was proud of her pictures and in the end model's happiness is what makes my job beautiful and rewarding. \n",

Beamiris and I were at home that day and decided to go to the park in the city center and try some natural and spontaneous shoots taking advantage of the sunny day. I must say that it was a wonderful idea. It was very quiet in the park, just a few people walking around, some other reading newspapers and one other photographer enjoy the day.\n\nWe walked around enjoy the warm sunshine and taking people anytime we found a nice spot. Back home we looked at the pictures and we were quite happy the outcome. Some of the shoots were barely retouched, whereas I changed the mood and colors of some others. Moral of the story, it is not always needed to make the most complex and advanced planning to end up with some nice photos. \n",
