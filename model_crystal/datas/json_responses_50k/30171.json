    "summary": "With 7+ years of experience in research and development, I have come a long way with my technical know how and management skills.\n\nStarting with basic research in a Japanese organisation, it taught me attention to detail and how to break complex ideas into basic physics and workable concepts. Failure is also a learning and one of the key achievement in the field of basic research. Quality was always the most needed deliverables. \n\nIn my current role of product development, the learnings have been from initiation of project until industrialisation phase and expands further to the market performance. I am currently working with development of new technologies, implementation, complexity reduction, standardisation, change management and design-2-cost. \nMy experience here is not only technical but I am also getting trained by the company for management roles. Currently I do project planning, resource management and KPIs tracking for the team. I also make all operational level decisions for the team and define priorities to achieve the team KPIs.\nI am very well trained on key competencies like negotiation skills, conflict management, team building and coaching/training. I have also completed certifications on Project Management and Six Sigma (Scrum and agile in pipeline).",
