My continued education and curiosity spans into the fields of psychology, nutrition, and metaphysics. I am passionate about fostering strong and meaningful relationships through our ability to be authentic, communicate clearly, live in line with our truth, and prioritize wellbeing in a way that honors the totality of our human existence-- on all physical, mental, and spiritual levels. I am here to learn and teach and my priority is to make those around me feel heard and understood while respecting my own boundaries and energy capacity. If you are interested in collaborating on wellness work/projects/content in a similar vein, please do not hesitate to reach out!
