    "summary": "In 2012, I graduated with honors from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I obtained a bachelor's degree in law. Subsequently, I pursued two master's degrees, specializing in European Law from the University of Athens in 2013, and European tax law from Leiden University in 2015.\n\nAfter five years of research, I successfully defended my doctoral thesis titled \"Suggestions for Improvement in the Taxation of Cross-Border Inheritances and Donations\" at Leiden University in June 2021.\n\nCurrently, I am employed as a tax lawyer at PwC NL's Tax Knowledge Centre, where I primarily focus on European and international tax law. Additionally, I hold the position of assistant professor and academic coordinator at the University of Amsterdam, specializing in the same fields.\n\nFinally, I am involved with monitoring and reporting on Greek tax legislation at the IBFD.",
