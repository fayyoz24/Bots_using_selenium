We launched the team in 2017 and together we achieved major successes in the first year. We won some of the biggest marathons in the world, including the London marathon, New York marathon and the World Championships. We have reached millions of people via social media and made a connection between the athletes and their fans.\n\nI work on the marketing strategy, and I am responsible for the content planning and content creation for social media and the NN Running Team website.\n\nEvent management:\nI am supporting the elite athlete coordination of several world class road races and track meetings, during e.g. the Amsterdam, Hamburg and Mumbai marathon. I work closely together with the local marathon organizations and support an attractive elite field with some of the best athletes in the world. Besides inviting the athlete, I take care of them during the race weekend, their logistics and the press conference. \n\nI have been the press chief for the IAAF Diamond League for two editions of the meeting, where I was the main contact for the international journalists. I organized the press conferences in Shanghai, handled the media requests before and during the meeting and I was responsible for the website and social media content. \n\nAthletes Representative:\nMy role in athletes management includes supporting international athletes by taking care of their competition and career planning. This involves negotiating with race organizes, taking care of medical support for the athletes, and securing sponsorship deals. I am also responsible for their (social) media training.",
