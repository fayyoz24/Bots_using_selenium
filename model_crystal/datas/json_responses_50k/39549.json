    "summary": "For my bachelor's degree, I studied physics and specialized in environmental physics. Through my studies in this domain, I was introduced to how the earth's system functions and was intrigued by the fact that all the subsystems are connected, interact, and maintain their balance. \nI further developed my education with a master's degree in Climate Studies, in which I followed a more social science approach to environmental problems. I understood the social, economic, and political background of dealing with climate change and environmental degradation.\nI strongly believe that most of the world\u2019s big challenges can be tackled through behavioral change of people. Undoubtedly this important step needs to be combined with an institutional change in the industry, economic model, and other similar sectors. However, when people\u2019s perceptions change such transitions will be facilitated easier and more efficiently. Sustainability, resilience, and unity with nature rather than an anthropocentric point of view should be embraced and supported through new practices, transformation measures, and social norms. \nOverall, it is my ambition to contribute to these changes, adaptation, and mitigation of environmental problems practically and efficiently through knowledge, research, and action.",
