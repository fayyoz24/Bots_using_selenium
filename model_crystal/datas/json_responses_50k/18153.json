In only a few short weeks I was able to create a national publicity campaign.  I arranged press coverage leading up to the event as well as a press breakfast where Het Financieele Dagblad interviewed and filmed Mr. Prahalad and Mr. Siebesma (CEO of DSM International).  Over 25 newspapers and radio media persons were present on this day including ANP, NRC, Volkskrant, Elsevier, Telegraph, Financieele Dagblad, Business News Radio the local Limburgs Dagblad and many others.  \n\nThis media event was the most successful in their fifty-year history.  We received over 13 articles in various papers including two in the Financieel Dagblad (one front page with photo) and a \u00be page article with large color photo in the NRC. Many reporters said they had never seen anything like this press conference before.  A full account of all newspaper articles is available.",
