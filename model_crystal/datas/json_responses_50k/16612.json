    "summary": "Freek Teunen is an AR and VR expert, based in Rotterdam the Netherlands. He studied Creative Technology BSc at the University of Twente, where he had his first VR experience in 2015. AR and VR technologies provide a unique experience compared to regular media. He decided to pursue his passion for it and learn how VR and AR can be applied to solve business problems.\n\nIn 2017, Freek helped launch the world's first social VR experience at the renowned theme park Efteling to make an existing family attraction accessible for disabled visitors. This got international attention.\n\nSince 2018, Freek decided to collaborate with students to bring a virtual playground to hospitals using the Gear VR headset. This social virtual playground (called PlaygroundVR) was launched in 10 hospitals worldwide until it was discontinued in 2023. \n\nCurrently, Freek is making AR tours accessible to anyone with Wintor AR Tours and has written a book about the business opportunities of virtual reality and augmented reality, which can be purchased at www.freekteunen.com.\n\nThose who wish to contact Freek can do so via LinkedIn or by calling +31 6 23 29 24 31",
