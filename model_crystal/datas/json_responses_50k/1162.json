    "summary": "Hello! I am Milan Herrewijn. I am a third-year student at Hanze International Business School. I've just completed a minor in EU Political Affairs and Business Lobbying in Brussels, at EPHEC University. I already knew from a young age that I wanted to study International Business, my passion for marketing and sales also started during my youth. Currently looking for an internship in Marketing/Sales for fall of 2023.\n\nI have always taken a liking to public speaking and interacting with people. Varying from having been an active member of the debate club, giving the graduation speech at high school, to currently being a class representative at Hanze UAS. These experiences have improved my communication and speaking skills drastically. \n\n5+ years of experience in the fast-food/restaurant business as an all-around employee. I grew up servicing people and preparing food for customers during my high school time. At 17, I traveled to Cambridge UK, and worked at Five Guys for 6 months. During this time I was professionally trained in Customer Service, Food safety, and Work safety. \n\nPracticing the Art of Kyokushin Karate (Martial Arts, 10+ years) has been a big part of my growing up. Having a massive influence on my skills, learning a great deal about being Independent, and the importance of Teamwork. Traveling to Japan and through Europe to compete in World Championships and European Championships taught me a great deal about Discipline and Independence.",
