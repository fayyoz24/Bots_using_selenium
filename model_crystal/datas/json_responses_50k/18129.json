We think it is. As a first step in sept-nov 2014 we are using a pilot version of Deep Dialogue in random teams. In these pilots we experience that people using this structured method get in touch with their emotions and creativity more easily. \u2028\u2028We expect to produce the first beta-version of Deep Dialogue in jan-feb 2015, in co-creation with launching customers. We will found a social enterprise, that will work with customers in the corporate world and at the same time reach out to a broad young international audience, in order to stimulate Deep Dialogue among young innovators. \u2028",
