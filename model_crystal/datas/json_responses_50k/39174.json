    "summary": "I am a Business and Media Master's graduate. Born in Madrid in 2001, I grew up in Shanghai where I completed primary school and later finished the International Baccalaureate in Munich. In the Netherlands I have achieved a bachelor\u2019s in Communication and Information Studies in Groningen and most recently, I have completed my Master in Rotterdam.\n\nWith my university studies I have gained knowledge in many areas of internal and external communications, from interpersonal to business to media communications and strategies in addition to the marketing fundamentals. Furthermore, I have experience in conducting research and consulting projects from which I have developed problem-solving, analytical and critical thinking skills.\n\nHaving accomplished my academic career in such an international environment I am open-minded and adaptable to change which have enabled me to work with people from any culture and background. I approach tasks with preparation and determination to meet the targets. I am eager to learn, enthusiastic and motivated, always open to suggestions, and ways to evolve.",
