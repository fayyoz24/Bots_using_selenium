    "summary": "\u2022   I love people-watching. \n\nGrowing up in a vibrant and populous harbor city in China, it has always been interesting to me observing how people with diverse backgrounds interact with each other. With a curiosity for understanding people\u2019s minds and behaviour, I went to Canada to study psychology in college and then further pursued two psychology masters\u2019 degrees in the Netherlands. My academic background built a foundation for my multicultural perspective, analytical mindset, and research competence.  \n\n\u2022   I love solving problems. \n\nThe thrill of connecting the dots through data analysis to solve business problems drives me to pursue a career that involves research and analysis. Experiences in conducting consumer behavior and market research both for Philips and a start-up made me become proficient in utilizing quantitative and qualitative research methods to translate data into actionable business insights. \n\n\u2022   I love helping people. \n\nAfter one year of training, I am now volunteering for a mental health support line weekly to help people cope with adversity.",
