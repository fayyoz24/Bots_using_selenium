The obvious aim is to provide marketing leads, giving the sales team a head start in their engagement with customers. For this historical fleet data are used and predictive indicators for each ship owner. Indicators range from the number of vessels owned and type of vessel to even global economic indicators like crude oil indices. These indicators are used to train the AI-model and help them automatically predict who might be planning to invest in vessels. The accuracy is quite amazing compared to contacting ship owners based on the experience of Sales people. When a Sales representative would contact ship owners based on his knowledge of the market, he/she would find about 10% of all the opportunities around in the market. By using our machine-learning model this number goes up to 75%.\nSuch advanced analysis is only possible through the use of AI, with the model taking only about 3 minutes to prepare a list of potential investors. The new model is piloted and now in use. With this model Sales representatives now identify opportunities much earlier than before and therefore they sit on the decision table with the customer sooner and are able to advice the customers on the technical specification better. Also W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 has the ability to identify more opportunities than before was possible, driving sales results up.",
