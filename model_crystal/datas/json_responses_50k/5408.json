    "summary": "I am an International Business and Management alumni. Having studied at some highly regarded universities in Australia (Sydney), the United States (San Antonio) and the Netherlands, I have been lucky to experience a lot of different environments and people. I continue to apply these great life experiences to my career and daily life. \n\nI value a problem solving mindset and understand the importance of decision making. My core belief is that you should be willing to put more into something than you are expecting to retrieve. I believe that good intentions create value for everyone involved.\n\nCurrently working in digital marketing & marketplace consultancy. With almost 3 years of work experience in E-Commerce and Marketplaces, I am working together with Amazin to help some of the country's greatest retailer brands to achieve success on marketplaces.",
