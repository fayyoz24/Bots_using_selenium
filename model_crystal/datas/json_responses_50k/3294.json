IBM, Dell, Infosys, Ricoh, Verizon, Splunk, Umbrio).\n\nI replaced all print, fax, scan and copy devices in all offices and replaced these with a centrally managed printing solution, including follow-me printing. This allowed ABN AMRO to increase the mobility of it's employees and automate business processes.\n\nVia the BRICH program, I moved the mobility of all the ABN AMRO employees to the next level. We replaced desktops with laptops; setup and rolled out a large scale WIFI network; defined and rolled out a new workplace concept; enabled the use of bring your own  devices; changed the support model from IBM from a desktop oriented model to a mobility service oriented model. The application landscape was also updated to match this new concept.\n\nIn the datacentre domain I was responsible for managing a portfolio of IBM and Verizon managed projects.\n\nCurrently I am responsible for managing a program to implement Splunk into the entire ABN AMRO organization. This included the technical- and organizational parts, such as setting up an infrastructure based on Hadoop and heading up a DevOps team, which is responsible for the entire Splunk platform, for both Change and Run. The change part of the team interacts with the business in defining the value cases which are at the basis of any source which  is connected to Splunk. The first value cases are currently defined and the savings are beyond expectations. IT in control is one of the large epics, which gives us full insight in everything that is running inside & outside the datacenters. With this intel, we were able to easily reshuffle equipment between datacenters, ensuring an optimized datacenter.\n\nThe last two years I was also heavily involved in improving the project management profession within ABN AMRO. Due to my training experience, I was asked to participate in this improvement program.",
