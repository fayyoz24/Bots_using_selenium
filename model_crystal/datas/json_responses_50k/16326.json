I was granted expressed permissions in accessing and obtaining the LFS data from the U.K. DATA SERVICE archive, for the purposes of such secondary analysis. In this mode, I relied upon SPSS (statistical software) for data manipulation and processing: cross-tabulations, chi-squared tests and constructing a (binary) logistic regression model. I have shown how multi-generational households and concealed households overlap; therefore ought to transcend economic factors tied to residential arrangements, like cultural values.",

I had introduced a competitive aspect to help, in some light, account for the sustainability of the environment. The outfits worn (and designed) by the models strictly had to be using recyclable material, and were later set aside for recycling purposes and/or sent directly to the Missions. The audience were to donate entirely at their discretion following a deposit of \u00a35 to secure their seat. ",
