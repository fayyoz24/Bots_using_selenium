    "summary": "I am a responsible, precise and practical team player and I am interested in managerial roles in technical documentation.\n\nI started my professional development by studying chemistry at the University of Oulu in 1989 where I specialised in functional polymers used as catalyst supports. I continued my career as a scientist and I moved to Glasgow in Scotland to study for a PhD. During my PhD I did research in the field of polymer-supported oxidation catalyst at the University of Strathclyde. \n\nAfter completing the degree in 1999 I worked as a post-doctoral research fellow in Glasgow and in 2001 I moved to Reading and worked at Johnson Matthey Technology centre in the field of refining of precious metals. \nWhilst on parental leave I moved with my family to Finland in 2006 and enjoyed looking after my family for a few years.\n\nDuring 2011 I completed an employment course in the field of Bioenergy at JAMK in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and started a new career in metal industry at Arterm Oy. I was responsible for internal project management of their bio heating projects and I also worked as Project Factory Manager and Project Controller for these projects. I enjoyed the dynamic and changing work but due to a decline in the business I moved on in 2016. \nI enrolled in Doctors into Business F.E.C -course at Aalto EE in Helsinki and whilst on the course worked at \u00c4\u00e4nekosken Energia Oy. My work involved documentation mainly for water supply chain.\n\nDuring 2018 I completed a 50-day Ty\u00f6el\u00e4m\u00e4n moniosaaja- (Multitalent of working life-) course which included 30 days of practical work. For the practical work I joined Etteplan Finland Oy\u2019s Technical Documentation group in Vaajakoski. The work involved creating user manuals in HyperDoc Content Management System (CMS) using Simplified Technical English (STE) as controlled documentation language.\n\nI am currently working as a Documentation Specialist for Etteplan Finland Oy in Vaajakoski. I enjoy working with different customers and the writing of user manuals for the machines and equipment they manufacture.  My work also involves illustrating of the manuals with the help of CATIA Composer and Adobe Illustrator. \n\nContact me by email at salla.bernardis@gmail.com",
