    "summary": "dr. Tao Feng is an associate professor in urban planning and data-driven mobility in the built environment. His research interests include modelling the choice preference of people in urban environment, dynamic models, behaviour change and data-driven technology in transportation. He has been working on various topics linked with travel demand forecasting, traffic network analysis, transport air quality analysis, and choice of housing and work. In contribution to big data and travel surveys, he has developed various algorithms to efficiently transform GPS data into an approximation of activity-travel diaries and generate rich information for geographical analysis. His recent works include also human mobility pattern analysis using big data, application of machine learning algorithms in mobility analysis, emerging mobility alternatives and shared mobility options. He supervises PhDs and master students, works on EU funded projects in smart cities, mobility and energy, and being involved in teaching of master and bachelor courses. He is an associate editor of Asia Transport Studies, co-chair of WTC branch and serves constantly as an ad hoc reviewer for many journals and conferences in transportation, planning, energy and machine learning.\n",
