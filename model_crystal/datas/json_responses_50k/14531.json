    "summary": "Professional painter and illustrator specialized in portraits.\n\nMost of the time, I work with acrylics (every now and then I switch to oil paint) on canvas, using different techniques with brushes and palette knifes.\nI started developing an interest in painting portraits during my education at the Willem de Kooning academy (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) due to the great Renaissance painters (Michelangelo) and the Dutch Golden Age painters (Rembrandt), to name a few.\n\nAfter graduation in 2010, I started working freelance using my first names, Anne Julia, making portraits on commission and exhibit free work -sometimes together with my father Willem van den Belt, and my brother Wick van den Belt (guess it's in the genes...).\n\nAside from painting with actual paint, I also make portraits using digital techniques. The big difference between analog and digital work is of course the 'feeling' of paint, which could never be equaled. But with digital artwork you could go on endlessly and make changes all along the way.\nThat's the reason I would never choose either one of those techniques.\n\nI also paint 'live' at weddings. I start by making pictures of the couple and their surroundings and then go right to work. Before the action starts, I create a nice corner where I can get to work, but also serves as a space for guests to come see what I'm doing - the best part of the job of course and also the most exciting for me.\nAfter a few hours of painting I go back to my atelier to continue and finish the painting in a week or two. Then the newly weds have a unique memory of their wedding day.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why people want me to make a portrait of them or their friends and loved ones. It's a special gift of course, and it's an everlasting memory of a person in that moment. \nIf you're looking for a portrait as a gift to someone, or to keep for yourself, don't hesitate to contact me.",

She got her Bachelor's degree in the Illustration Department of the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in 2010.\n\nWith her artwork she's not only triggering interaction with the beholder, but also creating an image that, on its own, is simply interesting to look at - a painting should also be appealing for people who don't know the story behind it (yet).\n\nBesides illustrations Anne Julia also makes (portrait) paintings. Without too much fuss she tries to create striking resemblance. The radiating charisma of the painting is not only created by the techniques or the use of color, but also in reflecting the character of the portraitee.\n\nIf you are interested in an illustration or a painting (commissioned) by Anne Julia, please contact her.",
