The device's performance was tested using Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), Laser Diffraction, Next Generation Impactor (NGI), Invitro Nasal Cast as well as UV\u2013visible spectrophotometry. MATLAB was used for image analysis of the Nasal Cast. Additionally, CFD Simulations were performed using Ansys in order to understand the dynamics and the flow profile of the medication particles as they flow into the device's nasal adapter.",
