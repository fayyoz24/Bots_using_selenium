            "description": "The rise of national populism and far-right parties in Europe poses a big threat to all forms of solidarity, especially solidarity between members of various ethnic-cultural groups. European democracies should therefore identify the conditions that can encourage and promote solidarity in diversity, taking into account the social inequalities and unequal positions of power between various groups.\nThe training and research program will focus on paradigms of social change, studying how scientific insights on solidarity in diversity can be applied in different policy contexts and organisations.\n\nSoLiDi ESR7: Solidarity in diversity within youth work. Towards an ethnography-based public pedagogy:\n\nThe aim of this project is to analyze which characteristics determine pedagogical interventions that strengthen vocational education within youth work. We shift from an instrumental or labor market perspective on vocational education in schools to a sociomaterial approach to vocational education within youth work. The challenge of the research project is to explore, both empirically and conceptually, how youth work establishes a specific educational ecology of materials, commitments and meanings. This project also makes a shift from an individual perspective on emancipation to a focus on emancipation as a sociomaterial practice in which the equal ability of a skilled engagement of all is verified. The empirical analysis will focus on two selected case studies within youth work organizations and more in particular on youth work cases where young people meet who are struggling to connect to a regular school curriculum. We hypothesize that youth work organizations enhance very different skilled engagements (e.g. in relation to social media, culture and art, etc.) and which will have an influence on the establishment of a specific educational ecology of vocational education within youth work.",
