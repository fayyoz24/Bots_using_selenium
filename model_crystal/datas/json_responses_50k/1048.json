Starting as a voluntary ambulance service during the First- and Second World War, helping all wounded regardless of political orientation, it developed into the world's second biggest voluntary organization of today. AFS is an international, voluntary, non-governmental, non-profit organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world. The high school program, its core activity, aims at students between 15-18 years old. Participants stay with host families and enroll in the local high school, allowing them to experience the country and its culture from the inside out, while learning the language. The idea behind this is that it creates a deeper intercultural understanding.\n\nMy activities were on a voluntarily basis and consisted of, among others:\n- Having a helicopter view of the local operations, consisting of hundreds of volunteers,\n- Overseeing the activities of the Dutch AFS office, consisting of +/- 5 paid staff members,\n- Being the ears for all volunteers in local chapters, and following up on their concerns, \n- Regular meetings with the board and with the national director and international parties,\n- Representing the organization during meetings with stakeholders\n- Overseeing the disastrous consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic\n- Researching the possibilities of economic survival during this pandemic\n- Leading (negotiations of) the complex merger between AFS Netherlands and AFS Belgium Flanders into the direction of success & economic- and organizational stability.",

The consequences (having to immediately return all students from abroad, cancel all programs, etc.) were disastrous for us as a volunteer-based organization. After considering several options with the survival of AFS in the Netherlands as absolute goal, our branch started orientating conversations with AFS Belgium Flanders. This lead to serious negotiations, maintaining mutual gain while executing the shared AFS-values. \n\nDuring the process of the merger, a transition period of one year, I simultaneously served in both the boards of AFS Netherlands and AFS Belgium Flanders, to advocate the interests of the Dutch organisation and its volunteers in the Belgian context. The process was complex, but the merger became a mutual success and thus a victory for the AFS values in both countries: help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.",
