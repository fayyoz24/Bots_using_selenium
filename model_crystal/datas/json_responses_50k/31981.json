The SBB brings together senior secondary vocational education (mbo education) and the organised labour market. Colo, the association of 17 centres of expertise, has transferred to this organisation.  \n\nVocational education and the labour market have traditionally shared close ties. Almost 70 educational institutions (regional training centres, agricultural training centres and vocational schools) and private providers of education together with more than 223,000 accredited work placement companies train students in senior secondary vocational education for a successful career. Employers require well-trained professionals. The demand for personnel and the requirements imposed by the labour market on these professionals are constantly in a state of flux. In addition, pre-senior secondary vocational education (vmbo), senior secondary vocational education (mbo) and higher professional education (hbo) must tie in closely with one another. The SBB responds to these requirements, and offers education and the labour market a platform for advising the Minister with sound and balanced information.\n\nSBB is responsible for cross-regional and cross-sector management and harmonisation of themes relating to the compatibility between vocational education and industry.",
