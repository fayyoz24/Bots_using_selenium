    "summary": "Education:\nBA degree in Dance and Choreography at HKA/Arnhem (1998), now ArtEZ \n\nDasArts-Master of Theatre Amsterdam (2007) \n\nAside of these two educations I have extensively worked as free-lance choreographer and assistant director for several dance and theatre productions in The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. In 2004 I began making my own pieces, developing a versatile practice to create works that questioned through different formats the involvement of the spectator at each piece, the performer\u2019s presence on stage or the representation of time in nonlinear ways.\nIn some cases these pieces were made to be seen in a theatre, in other cases they were short video works or self contained set ups proposing a particular circumstance for the spectators to watch, listen and be part of it.",
