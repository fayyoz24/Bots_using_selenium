    "summary": "Sam is a Philadelphia native that made her way to NYC for University. When there, she quickly fell in to the music industry and began to work for one of the largest producers of music festivals world wise. Sam held the Account Manager role here, touring the world for 8 months of the year following the sun, managing her global client and local clients in each market the festival entered into. \n\nDuring the summers, the team was based in Amsterdam and very quickly Sam fell in love with the city. Determined to live there, Sam left her job in NYC and moved to Amsterdam giving herself 6 months to figure it all out. She then took her Account Management skills and applied them to the advertising world, working freelance for the best agencies in the world. She led global creative campaigns and consumer experience for brands such as Airbnb, Samsung, Ray-Ban, Corona, adidas, Bud Light and Montblanc. Most recently doing the Ray-Ban & Meta launch of their \"Stories\" Spectacles. \n\n\nOn the side of this, Sam has launched two passion projects, one of which became her full-time focus.\n\n & the Table is a dinner series she started 5 years ago when she moved to Amsterdam, wanting to meet the ambitious women in the city she was about to call home, she invited them over for dinner and all 5 women came not knowing each other. Post Covid, Sam decide to start these dinners again and put a name to it (& the Table). Since July 2022, she's starting to bring in additional official hosts so more dinners could take place. A few short months later, Sam has 50+ hosts in 9 countries in Europe and the USA. \n\nNow, & the Table has launched into a full dining experience platform for women to attend dinners of this nature all over the world. \n\nSam's always open for a chat or a quick hello!  \n\nwww.SamanthaDanieleWolfson.com // www.and-the-table.com",
