I was eager to share my professional experiences and learn from my colleagues during this enriching experience.\n\nAt ISL, I was responsible for preparing and delivering lessons to two groups of grade 7 students and one group of grade 6 students. I conducted these teaching sessions under the supervision of my mentor teacher and the respective subject teachers of each class.\n\nIn addition to my role as a student teacher, I also conducted a field research project with a primary focus on investigating the alignment of the study of History with current affairs. The outcomes of this research demonstrated the potential benefits of integrating contemporary issues into the curriculum, particularly within the context of international education. The topic of the research was motivated by my preferred teaching style, which aims to engage students by connecting historical content to their personal lives and fostering citizenship awareness \u2014 a crucial aspect when educating global citizens.\n\nThroughout the internship, I actively participated in various extracurricular activities. These included a field trip to Trier, Germany, participating in a basketball game between students and teachers, and attending a diversity awareness training conducted by ISL students.\n\nThis successful internship marked the culmination of four years of dedicated effort and continuous learning, ultimately shaping me into an international educator.\n\nSkills developed during this internship:\n\n- Full-time teacher for three different classes.\n- Implemented several differentiation approaches, on instruction, process and product.\n- Fostered critical thinking skills among students through a variety of activities and facilitated discussions. \n- Engaged actively in extracurricular activities",

It allowed me to appreciate the distinctions between these two age groups, particularly in terms of student maturity and the pedagogical approach required, given that the older students were preparing for the IGCSE exams.\n\nThroughout the two-month internship period, I actively engaged in lesson planning and delivery, all while benefiting from the guidance of my mentor teacher and the Key Stage 10 teacher. I also had the opportunity to implement effective pedagogical methods, such as the use of visuals to enhance students' comprehension of key concepts, particularly in the context of differentiated instruction. Over the course of the internship, I had the privilege of teaching four distinct groups, comprising two Key Stage 8 classes and two Key Stage 10 classes.\n\nAdditionally, this experience provided me with insights into managing diverse class sizes. The Key Stage 8 groups consisted of 9 students each, whereas the Key Stage 10 classes were larger, with slightly more than 20 students in each.\n\nSkills I developed during this internship:\n\n- Active planning of lessons tailored for both middle and high school students (with focus on preparing the latter group for the IGCSE exams).\n- I successfully taught four different classes of both middle and high school.\n- Engagement in extracurricular activities, including chaperoning a field trip.",

While I gained insights from a range of educators, my primary focus was on History and Geography, aligning with my field of expertise.\n\nThroughout this teaching practice, I progressively took on more responsibilities, including independently planning and delivering complete lessons, all under the guidance and supervision of my mentor teacher. \n\nThis hands-on experience allowed me to develop a diverse set of skills, including:\n\n- Understanding the dynamics of an international school environment in Istanbul. \n- Crafting and executing lesson plans tailored to engage students effectively. \n- Implementing active learning strategies to foster a student-centered approach to education.\n- Cultivating an awareness of teacher dynamics to promote a respectful and inclusive classroom environment.",
