    "summary": "I am currently a third-year International Business Administration student at Rotterdam School of Management. I will follow the Master in Finance & Investments in the upcoming academic year. I have a passion for numbers, so everything to do with finance, accounting, investment banking, statistics and data science is of special interest to me. Dedicated, passionate and motivated to grasp new opportunities. I always strive to learn and develop new skills. My academic background includes spreadsheet modelling, finance, statistics, and accounting. I followed the Performance Analysts major, focusing on Accounting and Finance. In my bachelor thesis, I analyzed the impact on stock returns of the addition and deletion of stocks to a PAB index. Furthermore, I constantly aim to acquire new coding and programming knowledge in multiple platforms. I have followed a 6-months internship in KPMG Luxembourg, in which I joined the Financial Services Tax department. Currently, I am working part-time as a Study Hero at Slim Academy.",
