    "summary": "I have over 15 years of experience working in the European and American pharmaceutical industry, predominantly in clinical research and data management.   I have also worked several years in Australia for  a non- governmental organization specializing in biodiversity conservation.  In addition, I have an MBA from the University of South Australia (Australia), a Masters of Environmental Studies from the University of Adelaide (Australia), and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Notre Dame (USA). \n\nThroughout my educational and professional experience, I have been interested in work that improves the well-being of people and the planet.  I enjoy working collaboratively in teams, while continuously learning/improving.  One of my biggest strengths lies in understanding what motivates individuals and trying to create conditions/develop products which will foster mutual benefit.  The other characteristic skills I possess are innovative thinking, problem solving, making business processes more efficient, and tracking/organizing/documenting well.  \n\nDue to an internal restructuring within GSK, my current contract will end in October 2022.  Ideally, I would like to find a new 24 to 32 hour a week opportunity focusing on Clinical Trial Management or Performance Management within the BioPharma industry.  I would also be highly interested in positions involved with social responsibility, sustainability and biodiversity conservation.",
