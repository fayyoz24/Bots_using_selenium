The project is split into 4 different focus-categories: Power Supply, Power Amplifier, Filters, and the Loudspeaker. We measured the characteristics of a 3-way loudspeaker system, as well as analyzed and building our own power supply and power amplifier. Additionally we designed speaker filters and the bass extension. With given specifications, we must make design choices for each part of the system, verifying the choices made with analytical calculations and numerical simulations.",
