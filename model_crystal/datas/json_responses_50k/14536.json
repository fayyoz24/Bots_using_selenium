    "summary": "Hi there, thanks for visiting my profile! Let me tell you a bit about me \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude04\n\nFirst of all, I'm passionate about multiculturalism, diversity and learning new languages.\n\nBesides work, I always try to learn something new by taking courses, searching quick content to stay updated  and sometimes just watching Netflix too. \n\nAs I always try to be active, at the moment I'm also offering CV & cover letter renovation and interview preparation training for jobseekers. I spend my free hours helping others to pursue their dream job, while I deep dive into the interviewing process with every candidate-to-be.\n\nIf there's anything that I could help you with, please feel free to reach out and we can arrange a virtual coffee \u2615",

After a short period,  I was glad to accept a permanent offer after becoming one of they key members of my team with outstanding KPI and performance results. My passion for CX and enthusiasm for learning led me to become a person of contact when it comes to procedures and their application for difficult or unusual scenarios. Almost a year after, I was happy to be promoted to a senior role where my responsibilities were extended to Spanish and Portuguese clients and required me to get involved with other departments. I also became a member of the onboarding team for our new hires by providing trainings on the internal processes and the company's culture. Nowadays, my routine consists in mediating complex conflicts with high value sales, building strong relationships with the clients, being a  liaison point across different departments and stakeholders, overseeing KPIs and performance metrics and helping the management level with quality control across the team.",

I was responsible for developing and translating all the documentation (Eng/Spa/Port) as well as searching for and deploying a new management system to connect remote teams through the organization at a global level.\nWith my team's help, I've been able to design the Candidate Journey process from the beginning, including the whole onboarding method and build an efficient candidate pool and employee database. Once we were able to build a structured environment to understand the organization's data, I became more involved in assisting a few teams with their 'people needs'. I started working very closely with the team leads and hiring managers to help them with interviews, recruiting new specialized volunteers, internal communication and problem mediation, and onboarding of their new hires.",
