    "summary": "A curious learner who continuously tries out different ways of doing things while seeking to apply new ideas.\n\nMy diverse and multicultural background makes me a versatile and quickly adaptable person able to work in multiple subjects and environments.\n\nI have experience in leadership roles where groups need to be coached to accomplish a goal, through an openminded and empathic behavior to listen and understand all viewpoints. My capacity to synthesize information and see the key points of a situation allows me to elaborate strategies and make decisions to guide teams.\n\nUsed to work in transformation programs. Used to working in waterfall-structured projects, I\u2019ve introduced Agile methods in different projects, both as a coach and as a project leader, within diverse environments to increase efficiency and motivation. I have also experience in introducing digital tools in teams such as Virtual Reality, Remote Assistance, or Microsoft environments. \n\nI love communication. I speak fluently Spanish, English, and French. I am used to speaking in on-site crowded conferences, remote ones, or 1-1 discussions, giving feedback (positives or correctives), and persuading or coaching others. Process Communication is a tool I use regularly to adapt the way I communicate. I am used to driving brainstorming sessions, including retrospectives.\n\nInitiative and creativity help me to unblock a huge number of situations in my life. Commitment and rigorousness allow me to keep the right path at the appropriate pace to carry out the mission in which I am enrolled. And my emotional intelligence allows me to be aware of my emotions to create and maintain the best relations with people. \n\nEntrepreneurship is in my veins. I created and launched a networking event held at my home University, to create and maintain links between former and current students, while promoting ideas and inspiring people. I recently launched a podcast called \"The Future is Here and Now\" where I talk to people about the sense of work. I also coach teams to become more efficient. \n\nA sports lover, regular tennis and padel player. Insatiable reader, I combine novels with personal development articles, cultural differences books, or no matter an interesting topic. Getting lost in Nature during disconnecting hiking is an activity I practice in family. And when I travel, I always look for being in touch with people to know as much as possible about the local culture.\n\nDo you need help with your teams to improve their way of working? Contact me and tell me what are you struggling with!",

On that occasion students and other interested people could exchange during a 1 day face-to-face event. I also participated as a speaker introducing my early career in Industry, after having worked in Research, and introduce Renault Spain and its sites. \n\nOn March 2020 the 2nd face-to-face meeting had to be delayed due to Coronavirus Pandemic. Then, a remote event took place with 1-hour talks, starting on the beginning of November, and ending at the end of December. I also had the pleasure to give the first talk where I could explain the Production Engineering brach to the attendees and introduce the electric motor assembly Process inside Groupe Renault.\n\nOn May 2022 I'll participate as a speaker.",
