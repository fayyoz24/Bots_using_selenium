    "summary": "Hello, I'm Francine! A technology-driven change enthusiast with experience in managing change for large-scale transformations for various Fortune Global 500 companies.\n\nIn the last four years, working as a consultant, I've been able to apply change management methodologies in different company sectors, engaging and building strong relationships with various stakeholders, from frontline to C-level. I am also responsible for performing organisational change impacts assessments and designing, planning and monitoring communications and training plans according to the unique needs of each change initiative. \n\nMy academic background in engineering has created solid problem-solving, critical thinking and analytical skills, which I love to apply in a business setting to find improvement opportunities and measure the progress and effectiveness of change management activities.\n\nWhen I am not driving changes in digital projects, I enjoy practising yoga and watching lots of football!\nPlease reach out if you want to chat or discuss any of those themes. Happy to help!\nfrancine.baroni@gmail.com",
