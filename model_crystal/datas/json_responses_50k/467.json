Yet, its effects on the population and the ecosystem have not been as publicised or announced by respective municipal governments and media outlets, as other climate change problems. However, according to the relevant scientific literature, an associative and non-causality correlation between indoor and outdoor artificial light at night (light pollution) and numerous diseases and health conditions (many of them caused by sleeping disorders), have been spotted. The city of Barcelona, considered as being one of Europe's top smart cities and tech and innovation powerhouses, is also affected by these problems. Its citizens and natural ecosystem have seemingly been undergoing (based on the existing technological and scientific research papers) a set of poorly-addressed and insufficient street lighting policy measures which are continually endangering their health and optimal well-being. In this dissertation, we review the negative effects of light pollution at night for humankind's health, the ecosystem, and the kinds of smart street lighting measures, like Narrow-band amber LEDs, that are available for cities like Barcelona, and which can revert the light pollution environmental crisis.\n",

However, there is still no standardized form to define this sustainable tourism leisure practice, (spotted all over the world under various forms). Consequently, a thorough literature analysis and an investigation of the main astrotourism definitions provided by the most relevant authors has been developed, prompting the creation of a unified definition of the term astrotourism, as well as one for the two other key concepts: astrotourist, and astrodestination (fundamental to understanding the meaning of this tourism practice). Thanks to an elaborate analysis of the present situation through a list of case studies, key information on existing astrotourism destination has been spotted. Concluding in the generation of a list of recommendations for tourism agents to develop and optimize an astroproduct or astrodestination, whilst following tourism sustainable goals as a core asset.",
