    "summary": "I have lived and worked in many different countries which has helped me to grow as a person and improve my overall ability to interact and connect with many people from all kinds of backgrounds.\nI am bilingual as I have grown up learning English and Turkish as my mother tongues.   \nFor over four years I have worked in a fast changing fast food environment and have had to interact with people of many backgrounds from all over Turkey. This has helped me to grow as a person and be more adaptive. I have been able to be present in both the hiring and marketing aspects as well as being physically in the kitchen with the employees and making the food itself.\nIn addition I have worked as a Teachers assistant which has allowed me to interact with a variety of younger minds. In this environment I have learned how to deal with pressure. My job included but was not limited to organizing schedules, tasks, programs, and events and perform presentations that reached many people and allocate necessary tasks to colleagues and or students to make sure everything worked smoothly in a highly motivated manner.",
