    "summary": "Dr. Nick Degens is an expert in the field of interactive creative digital technology and is professor of User-Centered Design as part of the research group Digital Transformation (Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen). \n\nHis background lies primarily in the integration of technology, user-centered design, user psychology, design research, and artificial intelligence. This mainly in the context of international and interdisciplinary applied research projects in which he works together with the ICT sector, SMEs from the Creative Industry, and public organisations and governments. \n\nThe ambition of his work so far has been to systematically understand how interactive creative technology can be used to achieve long-term positive behaviour change. He does so from three research perspectives: 1) Embedding real-time adaptivity and personalisation (AI techniques) in technology to better match the knowledge and capabilities of end-users, 2) the practical application of innovative technology, such as VR/AR and Internet of Things, to help deal with societal challenges, and 3) understanding how technology should be implemented in the life and work of people to ensure that it is useful and relevant (digital literacy).\n\nAn important drive for his work is to have a long-term positive impact on society (through education, business and research). To do so, it is crucial to closely work together with companies, practice, education, and research to ensure that developed technology not only works, but also has a chance to succeed and survive in the real world. As such, the underlying business model or philosophy is an important starting point for any project.\n\nA selection of recent PPS projects: VRAMBO (Raak Publiek), focusing on the development of VR scenarios to help prepare ambulance personnel for complex situations, Sovatass (Raak Publiek), focusing on the development of a behaviour change support system to help support children with ASS in social interactions with their peers. His work has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, AI & Society, and Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, and in international peer-reviewed conferences.",

On the one hand, I had to create believable and engaging intercultural training scenarios  for young adults and, on the other hand, I had to operationalise cultural theories to create synthetic cultures for intelligent agents. Both the scenarios and the synthetic cultures were then integrated into a innovative educational game, featuring user interaction with a Kinect and 'smart' characters, that aimed to increase cultural awareness and understanding. \n\nOther parts of my position involved organising scientific workshops, giving presentations at international conferences, writing journal articles, working on other (European) projects, supervising students, helping with courses, and writing a Ph.D. thesis.",
