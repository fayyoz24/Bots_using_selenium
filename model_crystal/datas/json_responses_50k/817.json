    "summary": "My university\u2019s motto is \u201cImprove your world\u201d. We students have decided to adopt this maxim to improve our lives by standing up for the environment and its inhabitants. My personal way of doing such is through polymers and chemistry! \n\nI am a motivated international student (US/Italian citizen) from Florence, Italy, and an aspiring polymer technology scientist currently conducting my PhD studies at Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Jan van Hest. My area of interest is developing sustainable and biomedical materials using biotechnology and polymer chemistry; in the future, I plan to pursue employment in the research & development world. To move my aspirations forward, I have participated in an MSc program specifically specialized in the study of biomaterials, sustainable and natural polymers, and in the interface between polymer and biological science. \n\nSeeking opportunities to help improve the world we live in and contribute to reducing the ever-growing problems associated with plastics.
