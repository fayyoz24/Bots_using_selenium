The company expanded from its original Rent and Resale proposition to include PGs and Hostels, Serviced Apartments, Land, Plot Projects, and New Projects. The data captured by the In-house Data Collection Team allows their Data Sciences Lab to provide users with unique information including child-friendliness index, quality of life, and others. The design teams create high-quality renderings of the properties under construction, including 3D isometric views. Along with other features like 360 degree Aerial views of sites, Housing.com helps users make informed decisions. My role is to drive the Expansion of HOUSING  in Non Metro locations : marketing , sales , distribution , franchising , content , and  strategy .",
