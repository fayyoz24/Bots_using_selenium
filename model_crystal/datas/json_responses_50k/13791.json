This demands high quality. The datawarehouse is model-driven and next to that datawarehouse automation is used. The DevOps-teams delivered the datawarehouse platform within 6 months, working via the Agile/Scrum-method.\nThis is achieved in a highly complex environment because of migrating source- and targetsystems in parallel. Furthermore, there was a tremendous time-pressure and a lot of focus of stakeholders on our results because of interdependencies.\n\n- Committed team members and a strong team, working via High Performing Team-principles. Above average engagement score. Achieved by providing personal attention, building trust, focus on effective use of qualities and by empowering the team in solving issues.\n\n- Tight partnership with vendors which results in maximum cooperation with regard to developing and maintaining services.",
