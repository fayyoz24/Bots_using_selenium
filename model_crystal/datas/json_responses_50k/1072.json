    "summary": "My name is Wenjie Zhang. After graduating from bachelor in China at 2007, I planned to continue for a master course in a different country. To collect sufficient fund, I worked for two years in a local company (Enke shipping service) where I did custom service and administrative affairs. In 2009, I moved to Japan, and spent two years in Saitama language school for improving my Japanese. In 2011 I passed the entrance exam for master course at Kansai University where I was major in accounting. \n\nDuring the master course, I also built up my own online shop in Taobao.com (Chinese version of Amazon) and worked as a freelance retailer. This became my full-time job after I received the master degree.\n\nIn October 2014, I moved to Utrecht with my husband as he got a working contract in the Netherlands. We went back to Japan in June 2017 when his job changed again. In 2018 I started to work for a research institute (RIKEN) where I became an assistant in a chemical laboratory. This job ended in June this year as we came back to the Netherlands.\n\nMy last job is to work with scientists coming to Japan from different countries. To help the new hires, I took the initiative to communicate with different departments of the institute as well as with external companies. I got used to run multi- tasks and served as a hub to the team. I enjoy working and communicating with people from different backgrounds.",
