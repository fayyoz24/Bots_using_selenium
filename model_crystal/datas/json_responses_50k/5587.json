I devised a sales transformation system with robust KPIs and encouraged visits to processing plants to see first-hand how indicators were being met. I also introduced Salesforce and led a lean manufacturing process as well as dramatically increased the domestic market share of our construction products. \n\nIn May 2019, British Steel was placed into an insolvency process, putting 4,000 jobs in the UK at risk and the Government's Official Receiver took control of company. I was requested by EY, the Special Manager appointed by the Official Receiver, to take on acting CEO role and lead the trade sale negotiations. I liaised extensively with the UK Government, most notably Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and supported negotiations by making sales presentations to potential buyers.
