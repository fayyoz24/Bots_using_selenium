    "summary": "I see myself as an enthusiastic person with a wide range of knowledge. I have always worked in a technical job at the intersection between development and marketing. I like to come up with solutions that benefit customers and my company in the long term, while guarding profitability. I like to cooperate with my colleagues and share information. I typically shine when solving issues with a team. I have experience with ERP systems, international standards and regulations, R&D departments in three continents, global production and global trade. \n\nIn ALLDSP I have found a small dedicated team. It is a relatively young, dynamic and enthusiastic company. Because of the size of AllDSP, the line management function will often cross into other functions. I am also involved in setting up and expanding a new quality system. Key account management and strategic product management are also part of the deal. \n\nMember of the AES since 2004. Committee member as treasurer since 2013. I still design and build loudspeakers under the umbrella of my own company. Since November 2016 my name is on a patent for work that I did at Bosch. Specialties: audio engineering, loudspeaker design, mastering engineer, consultant on noise control and practical acoustics. Since 2016 I am named on a patent on a way to mass produce loudspeakers with a printing process.",

The Biopack facility was an incubator with three centrifuges, a cooler, and a freezer. Designed for small biological samples like mammalian cell and tissue cultures, small plants or insects. The microgravity condition in spaceflight is unique for studying cells and tissues in the lowest possible mechanical stress environment. On board an orbiting spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle, or ISS, biological samples in the Biopack could be exposed to gravity levels ranging from microgravity up to 2G. \n\nThe cabin fan assembly was part of the life support system on the automated transfer vehicle to ensure air is refreshed in the microgravity environment.",
