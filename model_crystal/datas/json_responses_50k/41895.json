    "summary": "Whether I am working with groups or individuals, as a communicator and facilitator I am always seeking for ways to empower people to become aware of their own strenghts, energy and possibilities. To play and experiment with it through games and activities and all the while enjoying the ride.  Universal wholeness to me is a true source of inspiration and is present on every level of being. \n\nWhen working with groups, I am good at making the participants feel welcome, included, engaged and invited to share the best of them with the group. Whether it is hosting meaningful conversations, solving conflict (problems) or working together as a team towards a common goal, I keep track of the reason that called for \u2018the meeting\u2019 to begin with and give feedback when necessary.\n\nTo summarize me? When you get me on board, I bring positive energy, empathy, a constructive teamplayer who, when part of an inspired team of people working for a good cause, is motivated and inspired to bring my best, use my skills and share my knowledge. I have broad experience in personal development, working with people, outdoor activities, non formal education and intercultural communication. I am a sincere, joyful, easy going and proactive multitasker who has a sound judgement, a problem solving attitude, who observes well and has an eye for detail.\n\nIf you know of or happen to run a project or organization who keeps busy with matters of the heart, green sustainability, peoples empowerment or peaceful conflict resolution, I would be keen to hear more!\n",
