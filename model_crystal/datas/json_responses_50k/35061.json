    "summary": "- Completed a master in finance and in strategy and strategy and organization\n- Pursued these courses due to my passion for M&A / Investment banking as I thought they would give me a solid foundation\n- Internships at three very different companies\n- An M&A boutique where I learned a lot of new aspects of M&A by performing my first financial and commercial due diligence of a company\n- My second internship I worked on larger deals but also conversed more with different types of people such as traders, fund managers, and portfolio managers which created a great dynamic on the work floor\n- My third internship was at a Dutch Investment bank where I was on the Tech & FinTech sector team which has always interested me most (together with energy).\n\nI compared my three internships and realized I learned the most at the M&A boutique. I spoke with several companies and chose to work at a company with 6 partners and 2 associates where I am currently the only analyst. The partners all have different backgrounds, a vast network, and a drive to grow the company which is great to be a part of. I believe responsibility, high deal flow, and client interaction early on will teach you the most.\n\nDue to my mothers work at Shell, as a child I have lived in countries all across the world, such as the US, Australia, Malaysia, and Oman. I was raised bi-lingual and have always been a confident and social individual.",
