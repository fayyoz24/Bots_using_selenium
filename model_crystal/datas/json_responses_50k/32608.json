This plot is further compared with the average heart rate, pressure data and respective differences illustrated for every heart-beat. \n\nThe physician can easily diagnose the issue with a simple setup, avoiding complex tests during emergencies at remote rural locations. The cost-effectiveness makes it more affordable.",
