After the market analysis of the food industry in general, we decided to start with a qualitative analysis through 24 interviews between in-depth interviews and focus groups. Thanks to that, we discovered that the brand has a positive brand image characterized by strong familiarity, Italianness and long-standing tradition. Star\u2019s main strength is the familiar dimension, while the main weakness is a certain lack of contemporariness. For this reason, we moved on with a quantitative analysis through a survey sent to 187 Italian people from 18 to 70 years old and we found out that the brand Star is only associated with the \u201cstock cube\u201d. In these terms, we proposed some new strategies in order to become a modern and updated brand with new slogan \u201cStar insieme a voi\u201d and a new woman on the packaging of the product. ",

In particular, our focus was to analyze the aspect of the sneakers Nike from sport to fashion accessory. After an overview of the footwear market in general with the analysis of different competitors including Adidas, Puma, New Balance, Converse, Asics, Reebok, we decided to move on with a internal analysis of the brand Nike. We started with a qualitative analysis (in-depth interviews, focus group, participant observation and netnography), followed by a quantitative analysis thanks to a survey sent to 241 people from 18 to 35 years old. The data were analysed with the following analysis: univariate and bivariate analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis, linear regression, positioning and quadrant analysis. To summarize, nowadays consumers are used to give greater importance to design and color rather than comfort, indeed, in these recent years sneakers are used outside the gym during the free time with family or friends. We decided to illustrate some strategic implications to the company, useful to improve the future brand strategies. ",

First of all, thanks to a focus group of 8 people we had two potential ideas but just one was taken in consideration. Our idea was to create a digital platform with the aim of facilitating the relationship between consumers and Italian biological farmers, matching the increasing need of a more sane, genuine and sustainable alimentation. It is also possible to adopt an animal or a plant using its products and monitoring its growth. We analysed the external biological market with all trends and distinctive characteristics. Then we decided to analyse all data from the online channel with a focus on the e-commerce in the alimentary industry. At this point of the project, we presented the marketing mix with points of strength, weakness, opportunity and threat of our idea, called \u201cThe Happy Farm\u201d. At the end, there was a detailed description of the strategy with the support of quantitative analysis for the next 3 years. ",

The design of the Village on the Expo Site takes its cue from many of the structures found in the countries in which the organization operates. Inside the Village, through interactive, digital and analogue installations offering sensorial experiences, visitors can learn about the impact of malnutrition on many children, and also about correct food practices and the crucial role played by the mother, in her close, intimate relationship with the baby and child, in ensuring adequate nutrition and care and educating him or her about proper nutritional practices. \n\nAt the beginning of the pathway, the visitor is invited to become the twin of one of the children who benefit from the organizations\u2019 interventions, through an installation called the birth machine.\nOnce the visitor has been assigned his twin, the visitor is presented with a birth bracelet, and begins a journey through the five environments of the village, where he discovers the story of the child with whom he has been matched and experiences some of his or her daily challenges. In this way he can try to imagine how his life would have been had he been born elsewhere in the world and think about what he can do personally to change the life of that child. Be the Change is indeed a \"call to action\" taking place in the Village!"
