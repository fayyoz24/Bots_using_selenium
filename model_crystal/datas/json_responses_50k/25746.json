    "summary": "My pursuit of a master's degree in Finance and Investments at RSM, a top-ranked business school, builds upon my participation in the rigorous HEC Paris program in Mergers and Acquisitions. This program expanded my knowledge of finance, and now, through RSM's curriculum covering corporate finance, portfolio management, and financial modeling, I am further advancing my expertise in the field.\n\nAs a Business Analyst Intern with Picnic Technologies, I was responsible for carrying out range analyses and offer assessments to aid management in negotiating with suppliers, increasing gross margins and driving up average delivery rates for a variety of products. Additionally, I consistently employed SQL to extract valuable insights from data warehouses and model them using Excel to create reports for the management team.\n\nIn my previous role as a Junior-Acquirer at Real-Estate Aureum, I managed a pipeline of potential real estate targets by creating tailored purchase proposals for owners, which led to actionable transaction processes ultimately resulting in purchases. These experiences have developed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling me to analyze complex data and make informed decisions under pressure.\n\nMy leadership experience as the Vice-President of the Student Council has strengthened my communication skills and taught me how to work with diverse groups of people to achieve a common goal. Furthermore, I founded Fatima International, a service group focused on economic development in Ethiopia and Kenya, which honed my project management skills and taught me the importance of working towards a meaningful cause.\n\nIn addition to my professional and leadership experience, I possess technical skills such as Microsoft Office, RStudio, SQL, and Tableau. My interests in various sports and membership in a student fraternity have also taught me the value of socializing, teamwork, discipline, and hard work. These skills and experiences have equipped me with a unique set of abilities that can be leveraged to excel in a dynamic and challenging environment.",
