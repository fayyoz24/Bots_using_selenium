    "summary": "I am undeniably passionate about improving the lives of people around me; a passion that extends to all areas of social injustice, vulnerability and empowerment. \n\nSo why the focus on marketing? I believe that when somebody can see, experience, and understand something such as poverty, disaster, displacement or disability; it is in their nature to proactively care for it. Once we empathise with a cause, we become connected to it and this engagement is what produces movements of social change, influxes of generosity, and the beginnings of solutions to global issues. \n\nI\u2019m also passionate about business, but more importantly, business for good. I believe that we can leverage business excellence and commercial success to create lasting social change. \n\nMost recently, I have returned to New Zealand to embark on the journey to becoming a counsellor. I am thrilled to be learning more about the extraordinary breadth of human experience and how we can become happier, healthier, and more connected.",

It was an incredible experience to work with the wonderful team that pulled off the mammoth task of reusing an entire house to demonstrate the waste that has come out of the Christchurch post-quake rebuild. The items auctioned were some of the 398 stunning objects made from the material of the home by designers and creatives from all over New Zealand and further afield, including the team at Kilmarnock."
