    "summary": "Kia ora, I\u2019m Danni. A dynamic and socially-conscious person, I\u2019m driven by my passion for connection; with people, with self, and with our environment. I truly believe that this connection can hold the key to a better future for all - and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d like to help create. \n\nWhile my background is not exactly traditional, and notably influenced by my love of travel, I\u2019ve gained some incredibly valuable and versatile experience along the way. My skills lie in the areas of Content Writing, Digital Marketing and Community Management, but it\u2019s when I get to combine all of my creative and organisational powers that I\u2019m happiest! I believe community and connectivity are the new consumerism, and I love using my skills to help drive this cultural shift. \n\nAs a native-English speaker with a natural affinity for writing, I\u2019ve always enjoyed creating engaging content and copy. From social media content and newsletters to website copy and product pages, I\u2019ve got you covered. I\u2019m a resourceful, proactive team member with the ability to stay cool under pressure, and the flexibility to help out wherever is needed to achieve a common goal. Having worked with some hugely inspiring organisations in both the charity and sustainability sectors, I can honestly say that I\u2019m at my best when part of a team that aligns with my values and, like me, is motivated by creating positive change in the world.\n\nOriginally from Aotearoa, New Zealand, I\u2019m proud to be indigenous M\u0101ori. Centring diversity, equity and inclusion in our world is of integral importance to me, and I find working somewhere that reflects these values equally important. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in harnessing the power of community to create positive change and more connectivity within your business, get in touch. I\u2019d love to help you communicate this to your audience, or simply connect with like-minded people!",
