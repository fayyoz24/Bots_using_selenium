With growing inventions in electronic equipment the pattern of sales, adoption, storage and end-of-life management (disposal and recycling) also changes. Recycling of this e-waste can be a valuable source for secondary materials if handled properly. If not, they can be a source for hazardous substances like toxins and carcinogens increasing danger to communities involved in recycling. The project deals with the analyzing the e-waste recycling from a \u201cResponsible Innovation(RI)\u201d perspective. The RI framework of Constructive Technology Assessment(CTA) was applied. The CTA framework is supported by foresight of future impacts, technology assessment, scenario development and more importantly stakeholder involvement starting from the design phase of innovation process which play an important role to understand the recycling innovations.",

It reflects primarily on the practices of sex-selective abortions through access to pre-natal sex determination, cultural preference for sons, and dowry system practiced in India. A System Dynamics model is used to simulate the extent of gender imbalance across the population structure (grouped in 2-gender cohorts) and its consequences for the marriage market. Model behavior for the base case scenario is explored and compared to the results under two potential policies for overcoming the gender gap: a strict ban of pre-natal sex determination and allowances for families with daughters.",

In our case, two specific topics have been developed which are the impact of technological devices (digital ones) in Insomnia as well as what factors of technology influence the frequency of online shopping. The framework of this work consists of applied statistics mainly with the usage of Descriptive Statistics, correlation analysis of variables and linear regression model construction. The literature referred to apply the used techniques is a reader of Statistical Modeling by (Heijnen, 2013/2014).",

The theoretical framework of the study comprises the use of the cultural dimensions defined by Hofstede and Trompenaar, the marketing strategies, and the business model adopted by Domino\u2019s Pizza in China. The study compares the cultures and marketing strategies between USA and China and clearly draws hypotheses of the main failure of Domino\u2019s in China. The conclusion drawn from the study is that, there is surely an influence of the cultural differences of both cultures on the failure of Domino\u2019s in China.",

However, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructures and the Environment had already invested about \u20ac7b in the whole project. The aim of the paper was to apply the principles of policy analysis to this complex situation, which gathered a large number of stakeholders with very diverse interests. Therefore, potential alternatives were analyzed and compared to get out of the deadlock.\n",
