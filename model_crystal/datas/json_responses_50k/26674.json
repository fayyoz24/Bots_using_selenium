Then, the root-causes were identifed and thirty countermeasures were proposed to adress them.\nBecause of the limited time scale, it was then needed to prioritize them, based on their expected benefits and efforts, both in terms of time and costs.\nFinally, the results obtained have been monitored, to check the effectiveness of the different countermeasures. They proved to be very efficient, as the targets were slightly overachieved.",
