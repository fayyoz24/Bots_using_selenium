Teaching includes giving lectures in front of big groups (400+) as well as interactive seminars (10-30) and supervising students writing their LL.M. theses. RESEARCH: As a member of the research programme \"Rethinking the Rule of Law in an Era of Globalisation, Privatisation and Multiculturalisation\", I conduct research and publish primarily related to the rule of law in the context of post-conflict settings, state-building and international territorial administration, with an emphasis on the rule of law, human rights and accountability. The research focussed on the engagement of international institutions (e.g. UN, EU, OSCE,..) in the administration of territories, the applicable legal frameworks (at the international, regional and domestic level) as well as the mechanisms and procedures available to address issues such as the overall accountability gap, immunities and the intermingle of various institutions exercising public powers and affecting individuals. MANAGEMENT: Management tasks include the coordination of LL.M. courses, revision of the curriculum and other management-related tasks.",
