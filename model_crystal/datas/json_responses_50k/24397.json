    "summary": "I have spent 7 productive years at the Laboratory of atomic collisions in solids, Ioffe Institute, St Petersburg, Russia. During this time I gained experience in conducting research, published numerous papers in peer-reviewed journals as part of a small goal-oriented team, and spoke at various international conferences. In 2022 I received a two-year grant as a project leader which allowed me to gain experience in project management. Unfortunately my relocation caused a hiatus in my academic career. \n\nI can describe myself as a diligent, detail-oriented, and thorough person who is open to new opportunities and ready for new challenges. I believe that these qualities along with my solid education and previous work experience can make me a valuable addition in any field.",
