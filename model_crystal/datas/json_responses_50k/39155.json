    "summary": "Until April 30th 2021 I worked at MUFG Bank in Amsterdam as a KYC corporate analyst. I performed due diligence and risk assessment for new clients and periodical reviews of KYC records for existing clients. \n\nBefore I moved to The Netherlands, I worked as a financial analyst for a specialty chemical company in Japan for ten years. I was involved in preparing the annual budgets, the monthly financial reports, and financial analysis for Japan and overseas, to support the senior management decision making process. \n\nI married a Dutch woman, which is why I live in The Netherlands now. Because of this and my time studying in the United States, I am used to adapting to international environments.",
