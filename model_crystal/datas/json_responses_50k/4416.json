Although Mr. Loosen had no experience in winemaking, before taking over the winery he had studied at various famous wineries around the world and realized that soil, climate and grapes were essential to make good wine. He then rebuilt the winery with his faithful comrade Bernhard Schug and took it to a new level. Using the old, ungrafted vines planted at the winery, they have produced a more nuanced and fresh white wine than ever before. In order to make great wine, Mr. Roussen reduced the acreage, farmed only with organic fertilizers, and minimized disturbances to the wine during the winemaking process.\n\n\u3000\u3000Only Riesling grapes are planted in the vineyards of Chateau Roussen, which have plots in famous vineyards such as the Corona in Mosel. At harvest time, the vineyards are inspected daily to determine the timing of the harvesting of the grapes in the different vineyards. After the harvest, the grapes from the different vineyards are vinified separately. As a result, the quality of the single-vineyard wines is high. Among the estate's plots, the Sundial (Sonnenuhr) is known for its elegant and complex wines. The thin, blue slate soils give the wines a minerality, and their fresh acidity and white peach and lemon aromas blend together in a well-balanced wine. The Sundial is best known for its late-picked wines, and Parker rated its 2004 vintage 90 points.",
