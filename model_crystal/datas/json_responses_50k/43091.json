    "summary": "I am an engineer and business owner passionate about improving and developing the Aquaculture sector. In particular, I'm specialised in Aquaculture Technology and RAS. The mix of disciplines from biology, technology and business, and the fast development of the sector creates a very exciting environment to work in and contribute.\n\nMy background growing up on a dairy farm and my technical and practical mindset helps me to translate academic ideas into practical solutions, and optimise technology and processes related to production. Ideally I spend my days 50/50 in the office and in the workshop or on site. I'm always looking to research/learn new techniques, tools and skills to keep improving and perfecting my work.\n\nIn over 8 years working in the field of Aquaculture, I've designed and built over 40 RAS systems in all configurations and sizes, and seen a great many more. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to develop a deep level of understanding on a technical level, but also on an operational and business level. I very much enjoy applying all of that to any Design/Engineering work, Consultancy and Due Diligence. The last years, the journey of starting, running and developing my business provides a whole new set of exciting challenges.\n",
