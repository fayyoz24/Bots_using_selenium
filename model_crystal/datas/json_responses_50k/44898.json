    "summary": "Energy is essential for human progress and I want to contribute to the challenge of cutting off CO2 emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels. To contribute to this challenge, I focussed my education on the energy sector, from technologies to economic and societal effects. I am specialized in biomass, hydrogen and fuel cell systems, but my interest goes beyond energy, and I am concerned about the sustainability of the agriculture, industry and transport sectors, from resources availability to waste management.\n\nIn the past years, I have\n\n- Defined and implemented research questions;\n- Carried out modelling and experiments on sustainable energy systems;\n- Collected, analysed, synthesised data and presented results; \n- Led multicultural teams and coordinated multidisciplinary projects;\n- Defined projects objectives and implementation steps;\n- Monitored project budget and progress;\n- Managed the communication with projects partners and stakeholders.\n\nI am results-oriented, proactive and I have an organized and analytical approach, alongside strong  communication skills. During the past years, I realized I perform best in environments where I can cooperate, motivate, and connect people, and where I can successfully organize and follow projects from the beginning to the on-schedule and on-budget completion. I get excited by transforming obstacles into opportunities and I am energized by making team projects successful.\n\nI want to use my technical background next to my interpersonal skills and creativity to set-up and deliver projects to accelerate society transition towards a more sustainable future.",

            "description": "Micro-scale CHP systems are presently mainly based on fossil fuels. Examples therefore are natural gas and heating oil fired applications based on block heating works, Stirling engines and steam expansion machines. Attempts to couple these technologies with biomass combustion processes have so far not led to marketable products. Moreover, the electric efficiencies of such applications would be rather low (typically 8 to 14% related to the biomass input power).\n\nAn alternative option to combustion based CHP technologies are gasification based micro-scale CHP technologies. Such systems have already been introduced into the market. They are usually based on downdraft or multi-stage gasification systems coupled with gas cleaning systems and gas engines. They exhibit higher electric efficiencies (~ 25%) but limited overall efficiencies (65-75%) due to intermediate gas cooling steps. Other disadvantages are the high fuel quality requirements (usually only high-quality wood chips with low moisture contents and well defined particle sizes can be utilised), high efforts for gas cleaning as well as rather complex process schemes.\n\nTo overcome these problems and to develop a highly efficient and fuel-flexible micro-scale biomass CHP technology a new approach has been chosen within this project.",

The machine used is an\nOn-Site Electrolytic Chlorinator (OSEC) converting a mixture of water and table salt into sodium\nhypochlorite. This is obtained by electrolysis. The solution can be used to purify water that can\nthen be used for drinking, farming and cleaning; chlorine kills bacteria and viruses and makes\nwater safe for drinking. In addition, the device will be fitted with two probes, one for electricity\nconsumption and one for flow rate, to enable constant monitoring; the probes will be connected\nto the GSM network in order to enable long distance monitoring.\nThe community currently purchases the disinfectant from external suppliers. Through this project\nthe cooperative will be able to cost-effectively produce the disinfectant autonomously, at a lower\ncost than the purchase price and eco-friendly. In October 2011 an on-the-spot investigation was\nperformed, during which the daily consumption of chlorine of the cooperative was monitored. It\nwas then possible to determine the annual amount of sodium hypochlorite solution required and\nthe saving obtained by installing the chlorinator system.\nIt was then decided that the cooperative will pay back 25% of the chlorinator cost in a two years\nperiod  time.  After  this  period,  it  was  agreed  that  any  further  savings  will  be  used  to  finance\neducational  projects  in  the  community  itself.  The  project  was  accomplished  thanks  to  the\ncooperation between CIRPS, Amka Onlus and the cooperative of Nuevo Horizonte.",
