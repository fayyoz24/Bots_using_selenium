The study, discussion\nand development of the new methods revolved around the four steps of the\nmodeling cycle, from the alignment, pre-processing and calibration of batch data to\nthe monitoring of batches trajectories. Special attention was given to the problem\nof the batch synchronization, and its effect on the modeling from different aspects:\nsynchronization quality, changes in the correlation structure, capture of the process\ndynamics, parameters stability and accuracy to detect abnormal situations.\nApart from the underlying research activities (e.g. publication in international scientific journals, presentations to international conferences and research stays in prestigious\nresearch centers), I was also involved in statistical consultancy for REPSOL\nYPF and GAMESA, developing R&D project proposals, which were submitted to\nthe Ministry of Science and Technology (MCYT), arranging annual\nreports related to research activities from Spanish R&D projects for governmental\nauthorities, giving assistance in preparing material for academic lectures, and organizing\ntwo international conferences in Multivariate Image Analysis.",
