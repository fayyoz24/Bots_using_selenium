    "summary": "I am the Founder & CEO of YourKitchen, a real estate platform which allows quick service restaurants to launch new locations with less risk and more reward. At YourKitchen, we are democratising access to restaurant growth and creating communities of exceptional food brands. Our infrastructure as a service solution is the first in The Netherlands and includes notable partners in hospitality and real estate.\n\nIn addition to that, I am the first ever captain of the first ever Saudi National Ski and Snowboarding team. I am competing along 5 other athletes to qualify for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. I compete under the individual snowboard cross event category regulated by FIS international skiing federation. I have been featured on the WSJ, The Olympic press room, The National, and Arab News. \n\nPrior to YourKitchen, I was the Vice President of European Transformations at McKinsey & Company. During my work as a turnaround management consultant, I focused on good-to-great transformations for large established corporations. I led teams of clients & consultants to develop and execute turnaround strategies which delivered an average CFO Audited net EBITDA improvement of 20%+ and in excess of USD 700Mn. I started my career as a generalist Business Analyst in the Dubai office where I did a number of public sector, banking, and real estate consulting projects. After 2 years in the Dubai office, I began a global rotation with McKinsey's fast growing Recovery and Transformation Practice. I worked on projects based in New York City, Paris, London, Chicago, and Shanghai. I was promoted to Associate and then transferred to the Amsterdam Office where I spent two years leading a good to great transformation for a large lighting client. I was promoted to Vice President November 2019 in the Amsterdam Office. Working at McKinsey for 5 years,taught me important skills in analytics, strategy, management, and finance. Furthermore, working in various regions taught me how to collaborate with a international group of individuals.   \n\nPrior to McKinsey, I ran Shopster, a Blackstone backed Venture startup focused on combining online and brick and mortar retail experience. In 2015, I decided to halt operations and accept my full time offer at McKinsey. I believed the technology was too early in the adoption curve and I would benefit from learning the fundamentals of business at McKinsey.",
