To achieve this goal, PREMANUS will provide middleware which combines product information and product services within one service oriented architecture. Moreover, the middleware will compute KPIs based on product usage data and make recommendations to its users regarding the viability (in terms of profitability, scope, and time) of remanufacturing a product.
