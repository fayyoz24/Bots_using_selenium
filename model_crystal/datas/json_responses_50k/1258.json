    "summary": "Ifigenia is an architect and urban planner. She teaches at the master of Architecture and at the master Energy for Society at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, the Netherlands. She also conducts senior research at the spatial transformations research group of the Research Center for Built Environment NoorderRuimte at the same university.\n\nIn 2016, she defended her PhD research thesis at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Her PhD research focused on the development of a dynamic urban/transportation policy analysis model and has been disseminated to various international conferences and peer-reviewed scientific journals. In 2016, she won the Pyke Johnson Award, issued by the USA Transportation Research Board, for the best paper in the area of planning and environment. She had conducted two scientific research missions in Technion University, Israel and UPC, Spain. \nAfter her PhD, she worked in Athens, at the non-profit organization DAFNI Network of Sustainable Greek Islands, on the design of sustainable mobility plans and other urban scale projects. \nSince 2018, she has been teaching at the Hanze University. She has been nominated as the \"Teacher of the Year\" for the Institute of Future Environments by her colleagues and students for the academic year 2019-2020.\nSince 2019, she has been conducting senior research at the Noorderruimte Research Center for the Built Environment (sustainability research group), Hanze University. Research projects: Future Vision of Groningen Province and Horizon2020 Making Cities Project, focusing on the generation of Positive Energy Districts.\n\nSpecialties (general): spatial transitions, architectural design, urban design, spatial planning, regional strategies, research by design, healthy urbanism, smart cities, futures literacy, transition design, co-creation and participatory design techniques.\n\nSpecilities (specific): climate adaptation, energy transition, energy landscapes, island and coastal protection landscapes, sustainable mobility, street design, cultural heritage, architectural composition, restoration and re-use.",
