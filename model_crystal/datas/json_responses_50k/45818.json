Which is the dream to participate in the most prestigious motorsport race, called the 24 hours of Le Mans. \n\nDaring the impossible we endeavoured on the team\u2019s first milestones towards success. Firstly creating the fasters working prototype electric formula race car, called the IM/e, and with it breaking various motorsport records. And secondly creating a foundation for a professional motorsport team consisting out of voluntary students driven by extraordinary passion and discipline. \n\nDuring my year I focussed on governing the financial aspects of a small scale race team. Making sure to keep a neutral cash flow while coping with the quick dynamics of a motorsport environment. Establishing a system that helped the lead engineers achieve their goals rather than brake the project.  \n\nNext to my financial and legal focus I divided my time to maintaining a good relationship with 80+ sponsors and partners. Also taking part in the acquisition of new partners and bringing in adequate financial aid to sustain the project. In this position I acquired many new skills concerning negotiating, networking, entrepreneurship and presenting. \n\nA part from the corporate achievements I also bonded with the most disciplined, loyal and hardworking friends I could\u2019ve ever asked for. Reaching our goals together by believing in what we did, gave me more energy than I could ever dream of and made the last day the hardest and saddest moment of my career. I cherish the memories more than the achievements and I am grateful for this whole experience.",

Making sure I orientate myself on what form of teaching suits me best and reflecting on that. Working together with supervisors that have 10+ years of experience in the field of educating.
