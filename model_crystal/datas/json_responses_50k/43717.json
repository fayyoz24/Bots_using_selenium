Used computer vision to automatically analyse an external interface of the device.\n\nThis allowed to further reduce budget requirements on this constrained project since test were running without me being at client location.\n\nAdditionally, I have coached the team on the use of SCRUM to manage tasks more efficiently and on use of SVN for reliable versioning of their software.\n\nVerify and validate system requirements of a healthcare product.\nCreate a test plan, test strategy and execute tests on a device.\nBuild test HW and SW setup.\nUse BDD and extensive test automation on system level- including computer vision to monitor external interface of the device.",

Client wanted to develop system to support his team. I have shown him a much cheaper and complete solution to the problem.\n\nI have pointed him towards ongoing efforts within his own organisation to create what he basically needed. In the end all that had to be done was to hold a meeting of key stakeholders within the organisation to make them aware of the arising synergy opportunity.\n\nI have elicited system requirements and proposed the architecture for an information management system using existing subsystems already known to the organisation. It saved the client the time and serious costs by convincing him not to develop a new system from the scratch. \n\nAdditionally, from the experience within other organisations, I did advise on process improvements by utilization of Agile methodology to greatly improve internal communications of the teams and coordination of their work.",
