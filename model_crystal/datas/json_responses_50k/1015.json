    "summary": "Growing up in South Africa, I have been exposed to a lot of complex challenges - and an incredible amount of entrepreneurial gusto. With this background, I am passionate about solving complex problems with innovative solutions that create an impact. I have a dynamic and versatile academic background, having attained 3 degrees ranging from LLB (law) to accounting and finance, which has equipped me to view problems through an analytical and comprehensive lens. \n\nI am currently part of ABN Amro's Corporate Banking traineeship in the financing solutions track. This gives me the opportunity to learn a vast range of skills through rotating through various departments within Financing Solutions - from corporate lending to private equity. As a South African working in Amsterdam, I get to experience the culture of the bank and gain significant international experience. I have the privilege of serving on one of the committees for Young ABN Amro, where I get to network and create value for the young employees within the bank. \n\nI'm deeply passionate about social impact and entrepreneurship - and have a firm belief that service to humanity is fundamental. In pursuit of this, I\u2019ve founded the Future Women\u2019s Workshop as well as the Human Rights Youth Conference, set up the Stellenbosch Chapter of Amnesty, launched a social entrepreneurship business with AFD, attended a summer school in Germany and travelled to the United Nations in Geneva and New York. I have also been awarded the Rectors Award for Social Impact in recognition of the work that I have done. \n\nIn my free time, I can be found rolling fresh pasta, running with my friends, updating my FPL team and finding the best coffee spots around.",
