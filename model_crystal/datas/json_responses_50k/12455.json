Since 2000, the Studs has been located on the grounds of the University of Groningen and the Hanze Hogeschool. During this time, I\u2019ve learned valuable lessons about the importance of organization, communication, and teamwork.  As the Match Secretary, I was responsible for organizing and scheduling all of the club\u2019s matches. This involved communicating with both the players and the opposing teams to ensure that all matches were played according to the rules and regulations of the KNHB. I quickly learned the importance of clear communication, as it was essential for ensuring that all of the matches ran smoothly. As a member of the Board, I assisted others with their tasks, and we organised activities together. This gave me the opportunity to develop my problem-solving skills and learn how to work effectively in a team environment. I also gained an understanding of the importance of clear communication, as successful team collaboration is dependent upon it. Overall, my experience as a Match Secretary and Board Member of G.S.H.C Forward was an invaluable one. Through it, I gained a better understanding of the importance of effective communication, organization, and teamwork, which have helped me in my studies and personal life",
