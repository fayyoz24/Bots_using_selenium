    "summary": "I have founded Jinke van Dam Consultancy in 2010. I am a highly experienced and motivated consultant with more than 20+ years of international experience in sustainable value chains and land use for all kinds of biomass end-uses (fuel, heat, power, materials, food and feed). \n\nThe global sustainability challenges of today (climate change, degradation, food security) are complex and ask for integrated solutions.  There is no single solution and action is needed from all sectors involved (e.g. agriculture, forestry, finance or governance). \n\nMy educational background and working experience in both the agricultural and forestry sector, and in the biobased economy, make me highly effective to understand and connect these worlds and to develop sustainable strategies and innovative solutions.\n\nI have strong analytical skills and profound knowledge in sustainable land uses and their governance, landscape approaches, impact assessments, certification systems and commodities.
