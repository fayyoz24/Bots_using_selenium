    "summary": "Ever since I was a young Child (pun intended), I had the desire to become a teacher. I cannot come up with a defining moment, in which I chose to pursue my interest, but after figuring out Aircraft Engineering was not my thing I found myself to have  the talent of making physics fun for not just myself, but for my students as well.\n\nAs a teacher, I am very passionate and accommodating to students with different social, emotional and educational needs. I feel extremely lucky to have found a field that I am so enthusiastic about, and I enjoy helping my students to reach their full potential. \n\nDuring my 6 years as a physics teacher, I have had the mind-blowing realisation that some students might find the subject a little uninteresting! To tackle this, I have adopted an innovative way of teaching. My students have greatly enjoyed projects such as building their own thermos, egg landers and water rockets. By having a more hands-on learning experience, my students have developed core skills such as critical thinking and research, which are essential for 21st-century students. \n\nEven though physics is my main passion , I also have experience and interest in teaching automation and robotics.\n\nMy adaptive personality and enthusiasm have led to me participating in multiple activities in the school community, one of my favourites being an exchange program with 6 schools from different countries.\n\n\nphysics \u2013 chemistry \u2013 passionate \u2013 innovative \u2013 accommodating \u2013 bilingual (English & Dutch) \u2013 patient",
