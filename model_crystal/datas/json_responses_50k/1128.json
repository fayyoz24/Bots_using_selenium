    "summary": "I am currently a first-year graduate student Electrical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology, specializing in Electromechanics and Power Electronics. I am taking courses on design of electric machines (rotary, linear, and planar), power electronics for high-precision applications, FEM (FEA) for electromagnetic devices, advanced actuator design, and control of electric machines and power electronics.\n\nI have done many education-related tasks besides my studies in order to improve the level of education within our department and the university as a whole. This includes a full-time board year at our study association, where I was later on tasked with the transtition to online education and examination. Through quick analysis and communication, we managed to have a smooth transition for both students and teachers. During that year, I have learned to communicate quickly, work in a team, and have meetings effectively. \n\nBesides my academic skills and the skills I mentioned above, I like thoroughly analyzing problems, keeping an overview, and working in a structured manner.",

During the study tour we will guide a group of 30 students and two employees from the Department of Electrical Engineering during a four-week foreign experience. We will visit companies and universities in Japan to show the participating students different fields in Electrical Engineering and how working and studying in the Netherlands differs from their local culture. For the current study tour to Japan (summer 2023) I am responsible for excursions in Japan and maintaining the contacts with universities in Japan. The first study tour to China (summer 2020) was canceled due to the Covid pandemic. Here I was responsible for publications and promotions.",
