    "summary": "As senior health policy officer I believe that sustainable development starts with accessible and affordable healthcare and gender equality. Contributing to the implementation of rights-based practices across diverse healthcare systems makes me feel fulfilled in my carrier. Without addressing inequity of public health and discrimination it is impossible to achieve equality, to empower vulnerable people to make own choices about their life, and to build up resilient communities. I am extremely happy to work on these issues at the Permanent Representation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Geneva contributing to the development of rights-based, equitable and resilient healthcare systems across the globe.",
