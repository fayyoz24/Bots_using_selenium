It had to be based on Collis successful ETDL script engine. The aim was to give a clear overview on the tests and to manage the test process from the definition phase to the execution phase. It had to cover the ISTQB/TestGoal steps in the test process. \n\nI was in charge of defining the product, designing the product (incl. the architecture) and building the product (in an iterative manner). I have been the project manager to develop the basic platform for all these test tools: Collis Test Manager. The product is now stable and \u2018off-the-shelve\u2019. I also participated in the design, documentation and coding activities.\n\nThe product (Collis Test Manager) is now at a stage where it is being used in major test projects and certification tools, e.g. to test and certify the components of the e-Ticketing infrastructure at the Road & Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai, it is also used for the test environment of VDV (German e-Ticketing host systems, terminals and card/SAM), it is used for the test suites of C-TAP (Equens), MasterCard M-Chip4, NFC, LTA (eTicketing & Road Pricing Singapore), Global Platform and SIMAlliance.",

For instance all tickets that are booked through KLM.com are processed by Global Collect (in name of KLM). Global Collect had grown rapidly. They had no test department and test procedures and test tools in place. Because of the growth they needed advice in how to organize testing within their operations and developments teams.\n\nI analyzed the processes that they had (for change &amp; release management) and made an advice on how to give testing a place in there. On how to improve the test process, such that new releases could be released without too high risks. In this advice I also took into account the organization and the test tooling.",

Apart from the driving license document itself, many more things had to change. In the past each \u2018gemeentehuis\u2019 (city hall) could print a driving license themselves. However, because of increased security requirements the Driving licenses had to be printed centrally (at Sagem / SDU Identification in Haarlem). All city halls could connect to a central system (of RDW) to request for new or replacement driving licenses. RDW then did link to Sagem/SDU, to CBR, to GBA and many others. \n\nFor the NRD project (New Rijbewijs Document - Dutch driver\u2019s license) I was the Test Manager to test all components between the various vendors, parties and suppliers (RDW, CBR, 5 suppliers of \u2018city hall\u2019 software, Sagem/SDU). I was responsible for test strategy, performance and all test activities during the whole project, reporting directly to the Project Manager (Albert de Vries). \n\nThe result of this project: Everything went on time and within budget!
