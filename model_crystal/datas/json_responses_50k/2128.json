    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my profile. My name is Bas Nuijten and I am currently working as Director Consulting at Finch & Beak, part of SLR Consulting, in Rotterdam, the-Netherlands. \n\nFinch & Beak is the offspring of Between-us: a boutique consultancy that has worked since 1997 on developing sustainability as a mainstream practice. Today, our rapidly shifting society and its global challenges call for change with no time to waste. Finch & Beak vividly supports companies in speeding up their business evolution, as adaptability is key for surviving and thriving in these times of major systemic change.\n\nOver the last 8+ years, I have gained experience, through numerous consultancy projects in the field of Materiality Assessments, Sustainability Strategy Development, and ESG Benchmarking support. I have been working with companies from various industries such as Chemicals, Building and Construction Products, Professional Services, Insurance, and Household Durables and Products. As of January 2022, I am responsible for Finch & Beak\u2019s consulting operations, overseeing our locations in Rotterdam and Barcelona, a team of 15 consultants.\n\nPrior experience consists of internship assignments and research projects in the USA and Barcelona which were conducted as part my studies in International Management and International Business. I completed the Master of Science program International Management at Tilburg University from which I graduated with distinction. Prior to that, I obtained a double bachelor degree from Avans School of International Studies in Breda and Western Carolina University in North-Carolina, USA. During my career at Finch & Beak, I complemented my educational background by successfully completing the Building on Talent (BoT) course, especially designed for emerging leaders, at IMD Business School in Lausanne.\n\nThank you again for visiting my profile and if you would like to get in touch, you can reach me by phone or email.\n\nBas Nuijten",

In 1997, we launched our business as a boutique consultancy that worked on bringing sustainability into the mainstream. During this 20 year period, we have serviced over 100 corporate clients throughout Europe, trained more than 5000 executives and worked with top level business schools from around the globe.\n\nOver the years we have learned how to reduce the toll that companies\u2019 business activities take on society while helping them to create top- and bottom-line value. We have become experts in finding ways to help organisations do well by doing good \u2013 or at least by doing better. And we have focused on making sure that our clients avoid getting stuck in the \u2018reporting trap\u2019.\n\nToday, our rapidly shifting society and its sustainability challenges mean that things have to change and that we have no time to waste. It is essential for businesses to be adaptable if they are to survive and thrive in these turbulent times. Finch & Beak uniquely focuses on helping its clients to speed up the process of business evolution. We deliver clear and concise services aimed at building business cases and turning them more quickly and effectively into value for both the company and society.\n\nThe origin of our name \u2013 Finch & Beak \u2013 is an allusion to Darwin\u2019s discovery that the reason why different finch species survived and evolved on the various Galapagos Islands was because their beaks adapted to cope with the local food varieties.",
