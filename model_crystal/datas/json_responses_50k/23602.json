    "summary": "Interested in the interaction between health, well-being and performance, I aspire to create a healthier workplace. Having balanced administrative responsibilities and creating an inclusive environment, I believe my experience can be a great addition to a team.  Below are key skills that I will bring with me*.  \n\n\u2022Employee management and training:  As a vocational specialist I was responsible for teaching the necessary employment skills and work culture to help and empower individuals to be successful in their career. In collaboration with the individual I developed personal and team goals, following up with data to assess progress and derive solutions. Doing this  evoked change by advocating for diversity in the workplace.\n\n\u2022Records maintenance: As a vocational specialist: discretion, organization and attention to detail are essential. I properly updated, managed and handled sensitive client records; including but not limited to legal documents, personal information and performance progress reviews. I also collected and entered payroll information into the workforce administration system. \n\n\u2022Communication: I am known for my energy, positive attitude and kindness towards others. I understand clients on an individual level and motivate them to succeed in their job. I am able to use my communication skills to dissolve disagreements between clients. As a vocational specialist I balanced maintaining a positive vendor contract and meeting my clients needs, requiring dynamic communication between multiple agencies and departments. \n\nIn my spare time I enjoy connecting others by organizing and hosting events for internationals in Utrecht. \n\nI believe my experience in working with individuals with disabilities and recent HR administration has provided me with valuable skills necessary to be successful.  I am eager to combine my previous experience with my value for helping others to continue to grow and learn. \n\n*I have a valid permanent residence permit for the Netherlands",
