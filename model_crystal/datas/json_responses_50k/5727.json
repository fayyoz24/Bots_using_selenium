We aimed to achieve this by bringing nootropics to the masses \u2013 through food products sold online. \n\nFor our first product, Raise \u2013 the Bar, we completed product development with the help of a food scientist and tested the market through landing pages and advertisements for different target audiences. We also completed branding and packaging design. Following our tests, we found that there was not enough demand for the product. High MOQs also demanded an upfront investment we were not willing to do given the low initial demand for the product. As a result we decided to terminate the project afterwards. \n\nLearnings:\n\n\u2022 First, build an online presence and become a go-to expert on the subject through content. Use insights to build a product, instead of the other way around. \n\u2022 When engaging in food, especially functional foods, sift through both national and international regulations, guidelines and laws before initiating innovation.",
