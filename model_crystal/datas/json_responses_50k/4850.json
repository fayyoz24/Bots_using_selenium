    "summary": "Rotterdam Business School / IB constantly fine-tunes its programs in line with developments in Industry and Trade by exchanging information about the process. The goal of the placement is identical for any study program, namely an optimal training experience for both the student and the company. To follow \u201ceducation outside the school\u201d requires a good organization, in which your cooperation is essential. The internship constitutes a practice \u2018test of competence\u2019; a preparation for the graduation program, during which the student will complete a test of competence in which he or she demonstrates that he or she is able to act in the manner required of a competent professional at the start of his or her career in a professional context. The student will engage in practical activities in order to attain the Program Learning Outcomes expected of him or her as a professional at the start of his career\n\nStudents learn to apply the rules of international trade: the legal aspects of doing global business, including options for resolving international business disputes, tackling pitfalls such as international licensing of intellectual property and dealing with the complexities of working with multiple cultures.\n\nRotterdam University of Applied Sciences offers a range of international study programmes at undergraduate (Bachelor) and postgraduate (Master) levels. We also offer special preparation programmes for Bachelor and Master Programmes, as well as accelerated programmes, exchange programmes for students from partner universities, summer courses and tailor-made business courses. \n\nAll programmes listed are taught in English.",
