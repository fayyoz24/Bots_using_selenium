After several rounds of elections he was chosen to represent the Netherlands at the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2011. The election campaign, based on a guerilla marketing strategy, convinced about 10'000 youngsters to vote. As Campaign Advisor I was involved in the preparation of the campaign strategy, gave background to current political issues related to development, and prepared media and debate trainings.\n\nThe UN Youth Representative forms the bridge between Dutch youngsters and the UN in New York. He speaks at events in the Netherlands, talks with youngsters about their opinions and meets with businessmen, politicians and people from the development sector. He gets to give a speech at the UN GA and lobbies on youth topics at different international conferences.",
