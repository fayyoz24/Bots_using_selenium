    "summary": "- Social Entrepreneur | Published Journalist | Networker | Tennis Coach | Experienced Public Speaker\n- Experience working for (impact) start-ups and scale-ups in international expansion, marketing, business development, community management. \n- Former top 10 national tennis player and Division 1 college tennis player in the United States\n\nCurrently taking a step back to look ahead. Quit my fulltime job as Head of International Growth at MOYU to explore my career interests, grow my business, build my network and grow personally and professionally. And work in a caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam here and there, which has been my dream since I was young!\n\nThe type of guy who'd pursue 100 different business ideas if only he had the time for them. Common denominator of these ideas: creating lasting social impact, connecting people and communities, personal and professional growth, sports. \n\nMy focus project at this moment is my business Het Leesweekend: an offline weekend retreat to slow down, relax, recharge and reflect. During Het Leesweekend, people take a welcome break from technology and their rushed and action-packed lives to finally take the time to read a book and have me-time. \n\nFrom when I was 8-22 years old it was my dream to become a professional tennis player, and did everything possible to accomplish that. Although I turned out I wasn't good enough, this time ingrained in me a can-do mentality, persistence, dealing with set-backs, time-management skills, and an endless drive to accomplish goals that might seem impossible at first. \n\nHit me up for a coffee, I'm always down to meet new people and hear your story.",
