But why would anyone need to risk catching Covid-19 or drive down \u201ctreacherous roads\u201d when Supermac\u2019s can deliver straight to your door instead?\n\nWith a blend of humour and heroic imagery in a simple and novel story, we hoped to create a timely Christmas campaign for Supermac\u2019s which would break through the noise of other traditional Christmas advertisements. Take a look at our campaign\u2019s video format linked below.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make unnecessary journeys, let Supermac\u2019s come to you.\u201d\n\nOur group was one of two groups who were picked to go on and present our campaign to the PR & marketing team at Supermacs where we were then selected as the overall winners.",
