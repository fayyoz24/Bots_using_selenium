    "summary": "I am a experienced LEAN practitioner driven by a passion for continuous improvement and the improvement-culture. Structured and organized, with excellent written, oral and interpersonal communication skills from the top to the bottom of the organization. Successful in building LEAN cultures and completing improvement projects, as well as coaching leadership to succeed better results by applying LEAN tools in daily operations.\n\nBeyond CI, I have experience in turn around projects. The tools are the same but the way of approaching success is slightly different. Processes are designed in ways that sometimes obstruct a good leader to do a good job. I have experience in supporting the leadership through coaching good practices while simultaneously understand the behavior of the process and thus understand process design. This has led me to good turn around results in an acceptable timeframe.\n\nStrongest skills is being able to read processes like a book with tools such as Value Stream Mapping (current and future state) towards a vision/challenge to create meaningful projects that have impact on the shop floor in line with the set vision/challenge.",
