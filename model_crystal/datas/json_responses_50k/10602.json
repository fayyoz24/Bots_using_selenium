I found human performance so fascinating. Being able to run a marathon in under 3 hours, snatching 120kg at a weight of 60kg, dribbling past 5/6 players and then chipping the goalkeeper or throwing a devastating punch to knock out your opponent. \n\nBut human performance is not all just about sports. It\u2019s seeing a person complete their first pull up, their first box jump, losing their first kg, gaining that first kg or returning to training after a long injury. All of us at some stage in our life starts from nothing to something to everything. Being part of someone\u2019s journey and seeing that development is truly rewarding. There is many reasons why I love my job as a performance coach/personal trainer, but that has to be at the top. Seeing someone putting consistent effort into improving themselves is something I thrive off.  \n\nI have been fortunate to work with various athlete\u2019s during my six years in professional sport, some completing at the highest level possible (E.g UFC, English Football League - EFL, Glory, PGA, SSE Airtricity and may more). From working with some of the wolds best I have had to learn quick to provide excellent results so I consider myself to have a deep understanding of human anatomy and exercise physiology. \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy conducting research related to my field striving to constantly enhance my own knowledge in the industry. I enjoy keeping up to date the latest sports science, movement and strength and conditioning academic articles so I can apply theory to practice \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nFeel free to contact me if you need my advice or if you have questions:\n\u2709 jdperformance10@gmail.com\n\u260e +353 86 232 0013",
