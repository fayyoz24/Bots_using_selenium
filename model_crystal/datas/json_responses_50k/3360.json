Most artists are dependent on managers. \n\nThere are too few possibilities for upcoming and existing artists. \nNot only artists in music, film and other entertainment, but also writers, painters, photographers, sportsman, designers and many more. \nMobile applications are the future and this will grow faster every year. \nMost providers have to make a lot as not all content can be uploaded in normal ways - with big server parks needing to be maintained and kept operational. \n\nWe have an existing worldwide network and we only have to implement this app in Vi-Core. \nUploading all content is possible in original produced quality. \nStreaming without compromise. \n\nOur plan consists of the following: \n1. Create app for use on mobiles and tablets for all existing operating systems. \n2. Create Marketplace inside the app. \n3. Create connection plugins to all existing social networks. \n4. Give artists the opportunity to reach their audience. \n5. Give the audience the opportunity to connect with artists. \n6. Offer the possibility to download interesting work from preferred artists. \n7. Offer artists the opportunity to profit from downloads. \n8. Offer the audience the opportunity to share, like, dislike, comment, and flag. \n9. Profit remains only for the artists with rights to display their content.",
