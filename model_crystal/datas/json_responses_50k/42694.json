The most recent project I worked on was my master thesis, which involves development and implementation of a steering system controller for a Smart steerable dolly to enhance its low-speed maneuverability and high-speed stability, of a Long heavy Vehicle (LHV). I have strong curiosity and fascination towards automotive dynamics and control. \n",
