    "summary": "As a highly skilled marketing and events coordinator with 10 years of experience across various industries, I am seeking to transition my skills and expertise to a career in project management. With a proven track record of success in developing, executing, and managing events, and developing communication strategies, I am confident that I can contribute to the marketing communication campaigns and drive results through creative and innovative approaches to increase product adoption.\n\nMy most recent role as a Marketing Coordinator at Coloplast allowed me to develop my project management skills by managing all Coloplast South Africa events, working with international marketing teams to manage marketing collateral for the region, assisting representatives with all queries, and designing marketing material. In this role, I led the digital team in migrating the Coloplast South Africa website from an old format to a new one, launched campaigns that increased customer reach by 20%, increased conversion rate by 40%, and captured 1300 new leads on digital platforms. I also developed event strategies and worked with third-party vendors to provide better quality events while making a 23% saving.\n\nIn my previous roles, I successfully managed projects and events for Genop Healthcare and the British High Commission, UK Trade and Investment, where I managed events from inception to completion, created and managed guest lists, identified potential service providers, and managed marketing collateral. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of company products driven by business and customer support for B2C application and have experience in the tender process to government and private organizations.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Commerce Honours degree in Marketing/Marketing Management from the Management College of Southern Africa (MANCOSA) and a B Com University degree in Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services from the University of KwaZulu-Natal. I have also completed certifications in The Fundamentals of Digital Marketing and Google Analytics for Beginners from Google Digital Garage and Google Analytics Academy, respectively.\n\nWith my expertise in event management, marketing, event planning, marketing management, research, project planning, business strategy, coordinating events, market research, customer service, marketing communications planning, brand awareness, marketing communications, CRM, and project management, I am confident that I can contribute to your team's success in any project.",
