    "summary": "I have been developing and researching innovative solutions in the legal space for more than a decade. I have argued cases for clients as a practicing lawyer; started and headed a think-tank on legal and political reforms; developed a pioneering comic book series for children that simplify laws; consulted elected representatives on drafting of laws and most recently, led a community of stakeholders working towards legal innovation worldwide. \n\nInterested in problem-solving along with being optimistic about the power of technology and creative thinking, I cherish opportunities to interact on the potential of law to be futuristic and innovative. I believe strongly that communities and collaboration can make systemic change possible!",
