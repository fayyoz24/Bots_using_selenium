    "summary": "I am an engineer, driven with a goal of accomplishing something new day-by-day in an urge to improve myself and surroundings. I did my master thesis at the Technical University of Eindhoven in Mechanical Department, with a specialization in thermal energy storage, to explore sustainable energy solutions for the currently faced climate-change problems. I hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Mechanical Engineering, which provided me ample exposure to a wide range of technical courses and aided me to develop a robust foundation towards application-oriented studies.\nI am involved in a couple of voluntary projects, owing to my liking. One of them, being an active CommUnity member and Team Builder at Benelux InnoEnergy CommUnity. I also serves as a facilitator during CommUnity meetings and has managed to successfully organize five CommUnity events in the academic year. I am deeply inspired by traveling, which allowed me to meet people from diverse cultures and traditions. I am always passionate to work on new projects that incorporate multi-cultural teams and knowledge sharing.\n",

Due to the high cost of electricity storage, capacity for its storage is very small compared to the amount of electricity produced. Therefore, electricity production rate has to match consumption rate at all times. Demand response energy auditing part was done by listing the consumer segments of Denmark by their suitability to DR. For economic analysis, estimation of economically feasible flexible demand was found out along with the savings and electricity consumption needed to justify the cost of implementing DR in Denmark.",
