    "summary": "International Housing is a company that helps students and expats to easily find and rent properties. \n\nWe launched in London (2016), where we are now able to help people with \u00b1100 short-stay properties, and about \u00b12.500 long-stay properties.\nNext to London, International Housing is operating in Barcelona, Rotterdam and Cambridge. (More cities following in 2018). Most of our revenue, is generated by our operations in the UK real estate market. However, we currently monitor great success generated by our activities in other countries. This provides a nicely spread income from our portfolio.\n\nInternational Housing collaborates closely with professional organizations and companies to source tenants, and our real-estate availability. Hence, we are able to target extremely large groups all at once, with our properties. But this also means, we are able to connect the lengths of tenancy, which will lead to a very high occupancy rate of the properties. \n\nWe have perfectly adopted to the demands of landlords, no matter the number of properties a landlord owns. Landlords work, and monitor the status and rent process from their personal online dashboard. Once a property is uploaded by a landlord, the dashboard is used to rent the property, monitor the status and all features in regards to the tenant(s) and the check-out dates. \n\nOne of the reasons for our success is because I-housing adds value by being very cost efficient and cost reductive towards landlords. While at the same time offer good service and assistance to tenant users. The platforms empowers a landlord, and provides total control over their own property. But allows tenants all over the world to simply, efficiently and effectively rent a property. \n\nRead more on: https://www.i-housing.com/about-us \n\nor get started!\n\nLandlords: \thttps://www.i-housing.com/register/landlord \nTenants: \thttps://www.i-housing.com/register/tenant",
