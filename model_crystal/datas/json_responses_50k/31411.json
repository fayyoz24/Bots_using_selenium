    "summary": "\"Working together on vibrant and resilient landscapes. Landscapes that evolve and landscapes that transform without losing intrinsic values and their natural basis. Landscapes that breath quality because they are loved and useful. Landscapes that reflect society and its needs. Landscapes that connect.\"\n\nIn more than 20 years of experience as a landscape architect, I have worked on a broad variety of assignments, in numerous areas and themes, in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\nConsidering that almost all societal challenges come together in the same spatial context, the landscape, my focus is on creating enabling environments at different scales together with all involved. That is why I specialized in creating enabling environments that offer opportunities and bring together the challenges, at different scales and always togther with all stakeholders.\n\nI work on rooted and nature based solutions, climate adaptation and risk reduction, sustainable and resilient food systems and migration. Always from and with a spatial perspective.  \n\nThe heart of my approach is to connect, to innovate and to inspire.  By bringing people, knowledge, needs and desires together. Creating common understanding, building bridges and visualizing envisioned futures, via clear storylines and appealing visualisation.\n\nWith an open attitute, humor and passion. Creativity, flexibility, promptness and thoroughness, are words that characterise me well. I also bring in a strong sense for political and social relations, new developments and phenomena. I value direct actions and follow-up; hands-on by nature. From vision to implementation.\n\nA shared, inspiring, activating story with a powerful spatial perspective, in which the natural system and the societal challenges come together and long term ambitions are connected to short term action perspectives; that will make the difference!\n\nAs such, we work together on a healthy, sustainable and resilient living environment, now and in the future!\n\nRegistered landscape architect (SBA Netherlands)\nMember of NVTL (Dutch Association of Landscape Architects)\n\nCountry experience:\nNetherlands, Belgium, Croatia, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Egypt, Swaziland, Mozambique, South Africa, Latvia, Bangladesh, Argentina, Uganda",

In this project we will\u2018collectively paint (co-creating) Europe\u2019s future food picture\u2019, in which the process of painting is perhaps more important than the \u2018final\u2019 painting itself . It is a process where people bring in knowledge and wishes to develop a future that THEY would like to live in. We depart from the belief that nature and ecosystem health is crucial for food systems and demands the need for nature-based solutions. From there we propose to paint Europe\u2019s food future 2100 on the following three core values: just, healthy and diverse. The painting will be done with the next generation and experts from Wageningen University & Research and aims to set the agenda to really rethink our food system.",

Since the publication the vision has been further propagated and to developed to action perspectives and regional and local visions based on the ideas, beliefs and principles of NL2120.    \n\nWith NBS Boost, we  are going to build further together on the results and insight gained and expand, enhance and enrich the integrated insights and knowledge required for a transition to a nature based future, for the Netherlands and beyond.

The extent of undernutrition and access to healthy food depends on links to rural areas. Working with local actors, we will develop strategic interventions and practical solutions aimed at improving food security and improving the sustainability of rural-urban connections in food systems. \nIdentifying effective interventions requires a broad understanding of all of the components of the food system, and of the socio-economic, natural and spatial context of the food system. More than anything, it calls for a contextual understanding of the complex interactions between food system actors. \n\nThis research will build on the \u2018rural-urban food system approach\u2019 with co-creation methods used to develop systemic, social and technical innovations. The outcomes of the system and possible interventions will be evaluated in terms of food security, and using socio-economic, environmental and climate indicators.\n\nMore info: https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-funded-by-the-ministry-of-lnv/expertisegebieden/kennisonline/food-nutrition-security-for-low-income-groups-in-rural-urban-food-systems-1.htm",

This requires not just a shared recognition of the urgency of nature-positive food systems, but also agreement on what the pathways to such systems will be, and the tools and solutions needed.\n\nThe transition to a nature-positive food system calls for a paradigm shift and will depend on the social and spatial context the system operates in, and on coming to an agreement about the type of action to be taken. We believe that the most successful nature-positive food systems are those that are supported by an integrated approach and by collaboration. \n\nIn this project we will develop a further understanding of nature positive food systems, a methodology and building blocks to help reveal existing knowledge while also generating complementary knowledge to help us arrive at more transparent and sustainable decisions regarding nature-positive food systems.\n\nMore info: https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-funded-by-the-ministry-of-lnv/expertisegebieden/kennisonline/nature-positive-food-systems-1.htm",

            "description": "There is a growing consensus that conservation efforts alone are not enough to achieve healthy nature; nature must be integrated into sectoral planning from the outset, rather than mitigating potential negative effects afterwards. This concept of 'nature-inclusiveness' emphasizes the integration of nature considerations into cross-sectoral planning processes, policies, standards, and regulations. Nature-inclusiveness needs to be embedded not only at the institutional level but also in the informal culture and processes of government offices. This project aims to strengthen nature by mainstreaming it in sectoral perspectives and building upon small local bottom-up initiatives. Participatory methodologies are used to understand how these initiatives can be strengthened and connected to ongoing policy dialogues, allowing the 'seeds of change' to grow and propagate.\n\nMore info: https://research.wur.nl/en/projects/32-social-ecological-transformation-for-bottom-up-integrated-appr",

The Nexus Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem plays an important central role within. \n\nSteden over de hele wereld worden steeds groter en in logistieke en bestuurlijke zin complexer. Om iedereen voldoende en gezond voedsel te kunnen bieden is een robuust en duurzaam voedselsysteem nodig.\n\nBinnen dit project werken diverse kennisinstituten samen om passende benaderingen, methoden en bovenal strategische interventies en oplossingen te ontwikkelen samen met relevante stakeholders. Doel is om beter inzicht in en daarmee beter grip op stedelijke voedselsystemen te krijgen, met bijzondere aandacht voor de invloed van migratie op voedselzekerheid, om te komen tot duurzame, veerkrachtige stedelijke voedselsystemen. De Nexus Water-Voedsel-Energie-Ecosysteem speelt daarbij een belangrijke rol.",

In these domains I bring in a clear conceptual, strategic and operational spatial perspective. Working on common understanding, integrative strategies and practical solutions based on the values of creativity, co-creation and spatial planning \n\nConsider, almost all societal challenges come together in the same spatial context, our landscape. It\u2019s our responsibility to make it work in the most optimal and qualitative way. \n\nWe provide and apply different design methods and tools in the different projects and research programs of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR). Offering a creative and integrative view and using the power of visualization and participation, from concept development to spatial strategies and implementation. Enhancing science for impact. We bring in practical and strategic experience gained in national and international projects in consultancy and executive government. The integrative view and spatial focus of the landscape architect, combined with the excellent knowledge, expertise and networks at WENR adds true value to each project. We enjoy tackling (spatial) challenges together with partners and stakeholders, discovering the most suitable approaches and innovative solutions. Consider this as an invitation.\n \nWageningen Environmental Research contributes by qualified and independent research to the realisation of a high quality and sustainable green living environment. It offers a combination of practical, innovative and interdisciplinary scientific research across many disciplines related to the green world around us and the sustainable use of our living environment.",

After decades of hard work the track is now used as a local pedestrian route, a regional cycling route, and the whole area partly as a city park. The natural surroundings of the railway track, the nature reserves, and cultural historical landscapes of the so-called \u2018slagen\u2019 landscape and the Moerputten, are open for hikers, bird watchers and other visitors. An interesting and important link has been created between cultural historical values, the values of the natural world, of recreation, and local and regional slow traffic. \n\n2013\n\n\u201cThe Jury greatly appreciated the many aspects of this project as a combination of private and public initiatives in the fields of planning, infrastructure, nature conservation and heritage. The most eye catching part of the track is \u2018the Moerputten\u2019. Overall, not only have five historic bridges been conserved and put into excellent (but reversible) new uses \u2013 paths for both cyclists and pedestrians, offering an overview of the symbiosis of landscape, bridge and nature reserve - but also a strong and sustainable contribution has been made to the living environment of both people and nature.\u201d (from jury report, EuropaNostra Award 2013)"
