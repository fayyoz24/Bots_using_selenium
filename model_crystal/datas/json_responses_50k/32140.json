Pursuing social goals within a strict framework of national laws and regulations, together with local government, tenants and other stakeholders isn't easy. Being accountable to society is a different game.\n- When done right, auditing is crucial in every organisation. \n- It is possible multiplying impact by leading a small team of like-minded professionals",

Designing and building a home, together with great people, gave lots of instant satisfaction. \n\nMemories which stand out:\n- Never give up \n- Unconditional family ties\n- Pragmatism & empiricism is highly underestimated in our current school systems\n- Take it day by day, and don\u2019t stress too much about things you can't control\n- Global sustainable goals aren't too far away (almost CO2 emmision free, still figuring out how to compensate for holidays)"
