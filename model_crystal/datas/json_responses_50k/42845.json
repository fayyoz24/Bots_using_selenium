    "summary": "Urbanization, digitalization and sustainability require a different approach of urban mobility. My passion is to connect and inspire people to make urban mobility more sustainable, more efficient and future-proof. \n\nAt Royal HaskoningDHV, we have specialised in combining our knowledge of mobility and infrastructure with our understanding of policy making and strategy development. This is how we help our clients with their next step in the mobility transition.\n\nAs Associate Director Mobility Hubs, I am managing a team of experts specialized in defining, developing and designing a wide variety of mobility hubs. Additionally, I focus on expanding our team and developing new advisory services, products and collaborations. \n\nAs a consultant sustainable mobility, I focus on strategy development, creating policy frameworks and advisory services regarding mobility hubs, shared mobility and cycling. \n\nOver the past few years, I gained precious experience by co-founding a student consultancy, chairing the board of Young RHDHV, working on several continents, and speaking during university guest lectures and international conferences.",

In cities, the pressure on public space is increasing, while at the same time suburban areas become less accessible. These problems can be solved if we travel the first or last part of our journey with a small, sustainable, or demand-driven means of transport. Mobility hubs are those places where you can easily change means of transport; from airports to stations and from park-and-rides to shared mobility hubs. \n\nAt Royal HaskoningDHV, we advise on the development of mobility hubs. We write visions, work on potency studies, make designs and we advise on the connection to roads, tracks, cycle paths and public transport. In addition, we ensure that hubs are attractive, meet the desires of the users, fit into the environment and are affordable and feasible. \n\nAs part of the management team of the Mobility Hubs team, I focus on the growth of our team and the development of new advisory services and products.",
