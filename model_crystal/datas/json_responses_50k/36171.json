    "summary": "I am an International Human Rights Lawyer and currently pursuing a new Posgraduate Degree in Governance, Management, and Public Leadership in the Inter-American System at the Organization of American States (OAS). I was Research Assistant at the European Centre for Populism Studies (ECPS), where I conducted research on populism and political law, focused mainly on Latin American and European politics. I finished my Master of Laws (LLM) in Public International Law with a Human Rights specialization at Utrecht University and a Postgraduate course in the Right to Health from Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina. My core competencies include public law, legal project management, governance and human rights.\n\nPreviously, I worked as a Legal Project Officer at the National Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners (INSSJP), where I planned and supervised the implementation of public health policy projects, coordinated the preparation of progress reports, and drafted responses to audits from various authorities. I also led meetings and negotiations with other medical institutions in Argentina, and drafted contracts, terms and conditions, and internal legislation. Before that, I gained experience as an Administrative Lawyer and a Paralegal, where I prepared cases for trial, drafted legal paperwork, researched and gathered evidence, provided legal advice, and mediated disputes. I am passionate about applying my research and public law skills to contribute to the advancement of human rights and democracy in the region and beyond. I bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I speak English, Spanish, both fluently, elementary Italian and basic French. I have also published an article on digital law.",
