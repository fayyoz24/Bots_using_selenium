    "summary": "Are we alone in the Universe or is life on another planet possible? Almost everyone has wondered about this question when looking up at the stars. In my research I try to answer this question by studying planets outside our Solar System. Using numerical models, I investigate their atmospheres in order to find out which physical and chemical processes are taking place there.\n\nIn 2021 I obtained my PhD from KU Leuven under the supervision of prof. Leen Decin and dr. Ludmila Carone. In my thesis, I studied the climate and chemistry of irradiated exoplanets. I discovered that these planets can exhibit atmospheres with different chemical compositions, depending on the global wind system and dynamical mixing in the atmosphere. Today, I am doing interdisciplinary research at the University of Amsterdam, studying biomarkers in exoplanets.\n\nI love conveying my passion for astronomy to the general public. As such, I have been a co-organiser of the Flemish Astronomy Olympiad, and I have given several lectures and workshops, for example at public observatories. \n\nIf you have further questions, or you would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to contact me.",
