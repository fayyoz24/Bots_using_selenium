The platform also makes it possible to order clothes creation without taking classes. What is unique is that each member of the HelpMeSew community has a profile that can be consulted before booking a course. This start-up project was developed during our \"Theory of Innovation and Entrepreneurship\" class. The concept is based on customization, slow consumption and human interactions.",
