    "summary": "I have a master in Financial Controlling and performed various Financial Controller roles in Philips from 1991 till 2014. I have controlling experience in factories, sales organizations and at corporate level. Besides Financial Controller roles, I have set up shared Finance services in cooperation with Infosys, implemented SAP in sales organizations and set up a Joint Venture in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 2014, I joint Philips global Supply Chain Leadership, first as Financial Controller and in 2018 I transitioned from Finance into Supply Chain Management. As Supply Chain leader for Patient Monitoring I have set up a weekly S&OE process with our main Market North America. In 2019, I became S&OP leader for Business Unit Hospital Patient Monitoring. There I established a monthly S&OP cycle across HPM (2Bn+ euro). Establishing this process was key to manoeuvre through the Covid crisis (demand hike) in 2020 and the E-components crisis (supply constraints) in 2021-2022. Forecast accuracy since mid 2021 consistently above 70%, peaking above 90% in certain months. \n\nI have been active in national, regional and global roles. I have worked in The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, Middle East and USA.",
