Together with a storyteller, I asked the participants to share their stories related to experiencing the world through their senses. We asked \"What is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?\" \"What is the worst thing you have ever seen?\" enz. The stories were shared and recorded. Then we invited each participant to squeeze their emotions from these experiences into clay sculpted forms of eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. The resulting forms and stories became an exhibition. The participants also bonded quickly through the sharing of these formative life experiences. Exhibition name \"Kunst der Zintuigen\" with partners Ijburg College 2 and Meijboom.",

The course culminated with a large exhibition throughout the school interior (new exhibit design around the central staircase), plus another exhibition of juried works in the photography archive in the centre of Amsterdam (Maria Austria Institute, located in the City Archive). One goal of the course was to create a pilot program with the archive to be taught in other schools. Another core goal was to raise awareness of the children's neighbourhood where the streets are named for photographers.",

The working title for my artwork is 'An Immigration'. \n\nConceptually my project was sparked by my own experience in 2011 of attending an \u2018inburgeringscursus\u2019, the intensive, required Dutch language course together with other immigrants from around the globe, including a Coptic Christian priest from Egypt, a mother from Israel, and a physicist from Iraq. Over the course of a year and a half in these weekly lessons, we shared our diverse stories of relocating, of leaving home and about tensions, sacrifices, and dreams. The experience sparked my desire to create a body of work that explores the emotional and psychological impact of immigration. \n\nMy research lead me to Enkhuizen where I discovered my own family\u2019s traces in Holland and became immediately fascinated by 17th century boats. The sails intuitively became my focus because I sensed they symbolized possibilities and challenges inherent in migrating to a foreign land. I was able to study the 17th century art of sail-making with an expert at the Zuiderzee Museum. The experience was deeply effecting. Beyond learning the traditional techniques, I absorbed and observed the materials in their context and realized that the boats became like human bodies in my imagination. I saw them as \u2018embodied\u2019 materials. The wooden frames and structures became bones. The tanned sails seemed like shed skins. The sails became more than remnants of cross-sea\nvoyages but also appeared as traces of movement and emotions that reflected their owner. In this context, I was able to realize how much the ideas of fragility, time, and displacement were combined within the conceptual trajectory of my project about immigration. \n\nFor more information, please visit my blog at www.juliamandle.com",
