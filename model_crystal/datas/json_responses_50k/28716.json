We were especially satisfied to see their responsibilities being executed autonomously, efficiently and reliably. Even in hectic situations, we could trust Maarten van der Laars to take care of their duties and our volunteers with a positive attitude. We are grateful for the inclusive and uplifting team dynamic Maarten van der Laars succeeded in creating. No wonder our attendees praised the event and the customer service. We would be delighted to collaborate with Maarten van der Laars in the future and wish to recommend them for taking on additional responsibilities.\n\nSlush is a student-driven, not-for-profit movement with the mission to create and help the next generation of groundbreaking entrepreneurs. Our event, which started out as a local gathering of Nordic entrepreneurs, has grown in just a few short years to thousands of attendees. In 2022, Slush brought together the world's leading founders, investors, executives, and media for a curated gathering of 13,000\nattendees. The event would simply not happen without our 1,500 enthusiastic volunteers.\""
