    "summary": "Finding your passion and strongest personality traits can be quite difficult. Also for me. However, sometimes all you need is a moment of realization.\n\nDuring my life so far, I have met a lot of people. Why? Because I love to network. I love to talk. I love to organize social events. I love to communicate. And you know what? I am good at it. \n\nA lot of people I have met so far, both personally and professionally, told me that my energy is something I should embrace, something I should use. It took me a while before realizing that it's not something everyone has. On the contrary, it is quite rare. \n\nRight now, I am working for the International Office at Tio University as an International Relations, Admissions and Events Officer. With this job, I am travelling all over the world, hosting presentations, organising and attending exclusive events, recruiting international students and so much more. In the mean time, I am teaching both Vinyasa and Yoga Nidra at various spots in Amsterdam and other places. Besides that, I am constantly improving my Spanish and Portuguese language skills and simply enjoying life to the fullest in many different ways. \n\nI want to see, learn, experience and grow so much more as a person. Every day is a blessing and I am very aware of how lucky I am to live the life I am living today. \n\nHopefully we will meet as well. \n\nHave a good one, Lot.",
