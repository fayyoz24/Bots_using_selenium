    "summary": "As thinking partner to leaders of leaders who want to grow to a higher level of functioning, be more influential, and flourish we co-create meaningful conversations that lead to change and transformation, integrating brain, heart, and gut consciousnesses.\n\nWith over three decades of experience in international banking and business, combined with an extensive knowledge of psychology of high performance, mindfulness, neuroscience, and spirituality, I am specializing in empowering my clients with the necessary skills and attitudes to be agile leaders, able to effectively tackle leadership paradoxes of this century, while living a life full of health and joy. My passion to help people flourish fueled me to make a career shift from executive international banking to build my coaching and training business in 2009, one of the most rewarding decisions of my life. \n\nI understand the challenges of my clients, having experienced the pressure of executive life first-hand. I help my clients have more impact without compromising their mental and physical health. With a strong academic, cultural, business and personal development background, I create unique perspectives and transformative experiences for my clients, enabling them to create more impact and peace of mind in their lives. \n\nMy clients take their growth seriously and I create a safe, empathic, and no-messing around space for you to talk and work through your dilemmas, behaviours and other issues that limit your leadership potential, especially during times of uncertainty and rapid change. I help you connect with inner resources and elevate your resourcefulness to create sustainable change. \nYou create clarity on your way forward and take inspired action. You will develop better relationships with stakeholders and obtain positive results from interactions, especially where emotions run high.\n\nFurthermore, I understand the importance of nutrition and lifestyle in optimizing the quality of life, as I myself have faced health challenges. I have become a certified health coach as well, aiming to help myself, my family, and my clients lead healthy, joyful lives, flourishing in their personal and professional leadership.\n\nMe: Multilingual. An Integrative approach to coaching. Use cognitive&body intelligence. Strong academic, business and transformational coaching background. Walk my talk, get results. Support causes aiming to empower women&children. Daily meditator.\n\nIf you want to connect to explore a potential cooperation please email me at catalina.flore@fitforthetop.eu.\nThank you.",
