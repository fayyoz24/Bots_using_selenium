    "summary": "I believe in well designed cross-media and multimedia campaigns based on creative, simple ideas as a huge part of brand communication. These digital times evolve with great speed which makes it harder for our creative minds to compete with conceptual opportunities. My vision on these opportunities can make a real difference in brand development and will help to improve consumers brand loyalty.\n\nWith my background on both the theoretical as practical side of online marketing and social media I understand the change brand communication is making and the importance of underlying ideas and channel structure.\n\nSpecialties: Online Marketing, Social Media and Brand Development.",
