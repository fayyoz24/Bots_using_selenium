    "summary": "I am a Visual Artist specialized in 3D & Motion Design with an untraditional path. I have a science and master degree in Landscape Architecture that is reflected in my personal work and endeavours. I always had too many passions, living them intensely and feeling that choosing one would be too boring for a lifetime.\n\nFrom Portugal, Hyper Island alumni and based in Amterdam, I've been working with brands like Adidas, joined tech collectives like Zesbaans, worked on light performances for Falco Benz during Amsterdam Dance Event and other clients combining branding guidelines with motion. In the future I want to collaborate with teams exploring Virtual Reality for mental health. I balance my work life with hobbies that don't require a screen, such as embroidery and crochet, crafts I learned at a young age. I'm prototyping for the next products after having successfully developed the first products.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with an \"unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder - with traits of ADD and autism spectrum disorder (ASS)\" I can better understand my mind and find my mission. Normality is overrated and that's the biggest problem in this world is lack of empathy and respect for one another. She's an advocate for inclusion based on neurotypes and I'm taking action on demystifying normality.\n\nAreas of expertise:\n- Concept Development, Motion Design, Animation, Interior Design, Product Design Visualisation, Brand Strategy, Project Management, Production, Client Management, Social Media Strategy. \n- 3D Product Visualisation, 3D Cloth Simulation, 3D Modelling, 3D Sculpting, 3D Illustration, 3D Concept Development, Texturing, UV Mapping, Projection Mapping, Octane Rendering, Animation, Video Editing, Sound FX, 3D Printing.\n\nSoftware:\nClo3D, Blender, Octane, After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere and Illustrator.",
