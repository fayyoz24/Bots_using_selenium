    "summary": "Chemical engineering researcher with 4+ years experience of working in RD&I organization for supporting various businesses in process technology-related challenges with my modelling and experimentation skills. Expertise in developing CO2 neutral-sustainable processes and equipment, leading to enhanced energy and eco-efficiency. Extensive experience in the design and development of (multiphase) reactors and associated processes by applying fundamentals of process intensification. I am a quick learner, persistent, a hard worker, and a team player. \n\nCurrently working as Researcher Process Technology at Nouryon and being a part of central expert's pool to support multiple business areas of Nouryon on a wide range of topics, including; \n\u2022  Process digitalization (IC4.0): Automated Data Reconciliation and MASC using VBA, Python, ACM software\n\u2022  Process and unit operation modelling and optimization: Developing custom process models in ACM, ASPEN+ \n\u2022  Development of new technologies and sustainable processes: Water electrolysis, Green chemicals \n\u2022  Kinetic/catalytic studies: Building experimental set-up(s) and experimental investigation for a range of processes\n\u2022  Acting as a research project leader   \n\nDuring my PhD, I have developed a non-thermal (catalytic) plasma reactor for nitrogen oxides and ammonia production, which included designing and building a complete pilot-scale process followed by a thorough experimental investigation. \n\u2022  Published >12 research papers and 2 book chapters in highly rated journals. \n\u2022  This work paved the path to secure research grants to the tune of ~18 MEuro and to establish a plasma sub-group. \n\u2022  Moreover, successfully supervised: MSc Theses (02), BSc Thesis (01), and BSc project students (13).\n\nWhile working in my current role, as PDEng and PhD, I have developed innovative and energy-efficient processes and reactors, for example;\n\u2022  A Hybrid plunging jet stirred tank reactor for G-L/G-L-S systems, \n\u2022  Gas-solid reactor (continuous fluidized bed with pneumatic conveying) and \n\u2022  Gas-solid-plasma reactor (Gliding Arc and Dielectric Barrier Discharge reactor). \n\nI am looking for a new challenge to utilize my expertise and in-depth technical knowledge to develop CO2 neutral-sustainable chemical process technologies.

This project was a collaboration between 12 academic and industrial project partners from all over the Europe. \n\nFollowing are the highlights of the PhD work;\n\u2022 My PhD research work paved the path and helped to secure EU research grants to the tune of ~18 MEuro. The follow-up/next generation projects which received EU funding are Project AFRICA, PLASMAPONICS and SCOPE.\n\u2022 The containerized process plant and technology developed in this PhD research work would be useful for distributed fertilizer and fuel production.\n\u2022 Achieved the project goal of producing nitric oxide energy efficiently, which guided scaling-up of this process to demonstration unit at Evonik Industries AG, Germany. \n\u2022 Developed a novel methodology to combine catalysts with non-thermal plasma reactors to investigate and gain advantages from synergy between plasma and catalyst.\n\u2022 Planned, communicated and executed various project tasks by working with limited resources, multi-disciplinary and multi-national team.\n\u2022 Designed, built and tested a pilot scale plasma-catalyst assisted nitrogen fixation processes for nitric oxide and ammonia production at atmospheric pressure.\n\nA digital copy of my PhD thesis can be found here: https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/plasma-catalyst-assisted-nitrogen-fixation-reactor-development-fo",
