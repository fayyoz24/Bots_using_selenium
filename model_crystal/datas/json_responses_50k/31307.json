    "summary": "In early 2022, I moved to Amsterdam after working as a clinical psychologist in New Zealand for five years. I am using this opportunity to explore the world of organisational psychology, with a special focus on risk culture, team dynamics, change management and helping the financial sector prioritise their most critical asset - their people. \n\nI graduated from University of Otago with a PhD (awarded with exceptional status) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology, supported by scholarships from the University of Otago, Royal Society Te Ap\u0101rangi and the New Zealand College of Clinical Psychologists. I have been registered with the New Zealand Psychologists' Board since 2016. \n\nI have extensive experience experience in the design and facilitation of behavioural change interventions, mental health, trauma Ax and Tx within an ACC setting, criminal psychology (including assessments for the NZPB and Courts), diagnostics, and research (including international publications and conferences). I have a special interest in criminal psychology and rehabilitation, motivational interventions and managing resistance to behavioural change.",
