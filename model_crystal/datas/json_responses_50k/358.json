    "summary": "My name is Hidde-Jurre, I found my roots in The Netherlands. I am a diversified professional, with strong interpersonal skills and capable of combining this with data analysis. Helping me to navigate throughout different international environments. I have experience with the development of new concepts and improving existing ones in the hospitality industry. Furthermore, I worked on the development of a  restaurant concept (successfully opened). Furthermore I gained experience in data analysis and portfolio management whilst working in the category management department for the largest wine importer in The Netherlands. This acquaintance with wine import triggered my interest in the wine industry even more. Hence I decided to follow an MBA in Wine & Spirits at the Burgundy School of Business, Dijon. Upon completion of the MBA, I started as Key Account Manager at Delta Wines.",
