    "summary": "Ph.D. (2008) and MSc in Mechanical Engineering from Ghent University (Belgium)\nPh.D. examined heat transfer and fluid flow in compact heat exchangers (air conditioning application). During my PhD I designed and performed experiments in wind and water tunnels for heat transfer, pressure drop and flow field visualization. Using these unique experimental campaigns, the thermohydraulic behaviour was studied of a novel fin geometry supported with 3D CFD simulation. \n\nAcademic experience:\nPost doctoral researcher at UGent (2009) and TU Delft (2009-2011).\n- guided thesis projects at UGent, TU Delft and Shell on a range of topics\n- teachers assistant for \"Thermal Systems\" (4 yrs) and Thermodynamics (1 yr) at UGent\n- performed experiments / industrial support on heat transfer and multiphase flow: heat exchanger design, heat transfer in metal foam, natural circulation with supercritical fluids, multiphase flow splitting\n- Published 50+ journal articles (1000+ citations) and 40+ conference publications\n\nIndustrial experience (from 2012 on)\nJoined Shell 2/2012 as a Flow Assurance Engineer in Amsterdam, transitioned to Front End Pipelines engineer in 2016 and to LNG Regas team in 2018.\n- Pipesim, Unisim and OLGA simulation experience for oil /gas wells and pipeline system for assets and projects (Upstream / Integrated Gas). Supported pre-FEED activities as well as asset support (start-up)\n- Developed guidelines for low temperature simulations (Joule Thomson cooling - cold start-up, brittle fracture) - process safety\n- Active slug control system design + commissioning experience (offshore)\n- Coordinated R&D efforts on severe slugging, pipeline heat tracing, low temperature embrittlement and cryogenic pipelines.\n- Teaching experience in Shell Courses on Flow Assurance, Process and Pipelines\n\nSpecialties: heat transfer and (multiphase) fluid flow, experimental techniques, heat exchangers, nuclear thermohydraulics, oil & gas flow modelling, process engineering and flow assurance.
