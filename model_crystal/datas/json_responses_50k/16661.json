    "summary": "As a catalyst for positive change, I support companies and other organizations with their sustainability strategy. I really enjoy co-creating your focused sustainability strategy. And to engage employees, partners, and other stakeholders to collaborate for positive change. \n\nI strongly believe in the power of sustainability as an enabler for better business. And in the power of business to drive change toward a more sustainable future. It's not about what you do with the money you make, it's all about how you make money. This belief is core to how I teach sustainability to both graduate students, board members, and finance professionals. \n\nCurious about how I could support you in the area of sustainability? Please reach out via LinkedIn or marjolein@changeincontext.com. Or check out my website at www.changeincontext.com.",
