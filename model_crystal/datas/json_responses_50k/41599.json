    "summary": "Graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration from Hotel Management School in Maastricht, I take the next step in hospitality.\n\nI am people oriented and hospitality is a passion for me. Making the guest feel at home, being an inspiration is what I strive for. I am a perfectionist and motivated person. My working experience as an intern at The Standard Spa, Miami Beach, FL, USA was the perfect start to my career in hospitality. As a supervisor in housekeeping, I got to work on my leadership skills, being at the head of a team of twenty, together with two managers. I had to work under time-pressure and quickly learn to communicate in Spanish. As a front desk agent, I was representative of the hotel and was responsible of providing the guests the best introduction to a great experience. Overall, this unique journey has given me insights into the organization and different management levels of a hotel.\n\nMoreover, my internship for Hilton The Netherlands cluster sales office has deepened my administrative and managerial skills. I have learned to work in a very fast-paced environment with a lot of responsibilities. As a sales coordinator trainee, I have learned to work with Excel to prepare key reports, corporate contracts, but also to work on long-term projects, necessary in today's competitive hospitality industry. This internship has provided me with a deeper understanding of key strategies and activities implemented at a cluster sales level.\n\nI am a team player, proactive, with high organizational skills and a great sense of personal responsibility. My flexibility and adaptability have proven in the past that I integrate rapidly in a new work environment. I have learned to take the lead and delegate tasks, while remaining a team player and respecting authority.",
