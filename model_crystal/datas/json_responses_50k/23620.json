    "summary": "When you look at your Profit and Loss Statement\u2026 do you think \u201cHow can I get more paying clients?!\u201d\n\nHi, I\u2019m a marketer and the founder of Tanu Agency. I\u2019m helping trainers, consultants and other entrepreneurs attracting customers on a more consistent basis.\n\nSome of my clients have a solid customer acquisition strategy but lack a proper execution, while others are founders who don\u2019t have time for every aspect of their business. I help them gain great clients consistently so they can focus on building and providing the best services.\n\n----------------------\nHow can I help you?\n\n\ud83d\ude1fYou\u2019re struggling to get enough clients to pay for your services/products. \n\ud83d\udc4c I can help you fast track the customer acquisition process. I will use a mix of Google Ads/ Facebook Ads that gets you new customers in no time.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Ads are emptying your wallet. I can review your current Google Ads/Facebook Ads settings and identify where it\u2019s going wrong. \n\ud83d\ude80Then, I will share some recommendations to get your cash flow positive ASAP. (hint: I\u2019m doing it for FREE).\n\n\ud83d\udcb8You get many visitors on your website, but no dollars (or euros, bitcoins, gold etc.). I can help you optimize your landing pages with content that converts. \n\ud83e\udd11A few tweaks here and there can get you back on track. For this, I\u2019m using Google Optimize.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f You get significant results, but you don\u2019t know why. There are many wizards out there, but digital marketing doesn\u2019t involve simple magic tricks. What works today, may not tomorrow. You can go from heaven to hell in a matter of days. \n\ud83e\uddd0 I can help you better understand the correlation between your customer acquisition investments and the results. For this, I\u2019m using a great free solution called Google Data Studio.\n\nGetting your business in front of the right people couldn't be more accessible. But you better know what you are doing. And that's exactly where I\u2019m building my expertise!\n\n------------------\nSend me a LinkedIn message and start a conversation.\nOr you can email me and say hi - hello@tanu.agency - Ask me how much I price my services and I will tell you at the second reply. \nBonus: a special surprise comes with the third reply \ud83d\ude09\n",
