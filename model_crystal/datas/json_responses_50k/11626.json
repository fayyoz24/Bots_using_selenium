    "summary": "I started my career as a product designer at Philips Corporate Design headquarters in Eindhoven, under the leading of Stefano Marzano, in the time when he implemented '' High-Design'' into the vision of the company. At this time Stefano gave us a gift, a new philosophy that emphasised the creation of solutions that fulfil genuine needs and that were of enduring value. An interdisciplinary approach that took advantage of technology, but with an ethical and human touch. High-Design was born under the belief that the spirit of the industrial revolution, based on the maximisation of quantity at all costs, had resulted - despite all its benefits- in the loss of the old cultural and essentially human values from our lives. The philosophy was to bring back the relationship between user and object, where we created objects to cherish and use with trust and affection. \n\nIn January 2019 I asked Remi van Oers to be my design partner. We now work together in the Klockgebouw, on the original Philips terrain, Strip-S, in Eindhoven. Here, these Philips High-Design values remain within the core of our thinking, where we as industrial designers, now more than ever see it as our duty to challenge mass consumption and the throwaway society.\n \nOver time, and only with time can you create a vision of how you think design and the future should be. Remi and I have spent a lot of time thinking about, and evaluating this. Much is defined by the results of our process. The result of this is something we have defined as '' Soft Minimalism''. Whereby we only create products for specific purposes where there is need, and where the product, stripped of all that is not needed to perform its task should be iconic in its own right. We put so much love and thought into this process, that we ensure the characteristics that are needed to warrant the products right to exist now and it's right to last over time. We work gladly together with clients and market leaders who feel and understand this, and who are driven by the values that we share. \n\nCurrently our main focus is electronic products, high-end furniture, interior design, architecture, branding and marketing. www.janeworthington.com \n\nNext to this core design business, I also have 15 years experience as a design lecturer. At the Design Academy Eindhoven, and currently at the Academy of Architecture in Maastricht. Here we have been asked to take the lead in implementing a new Associate Degree program into the department of Architecture this is due to start in Sept 2022 (see the video in the articles link).",
