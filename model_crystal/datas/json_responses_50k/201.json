He began working closely with the city of Amsterdam on Smart City projects in 2011 and in Living Labs since 2015 when he founded the IoT Living Lab with the CTO to prototype, test, and validate emerging sensor technology adding value to the city\u2019s digital infrastructure and improving public spaces. In 2016 he won the prestigious Open Data Institute (ODI) grant ODiNE for his work with end-user engagement in interactive environments. \n     \nIn late 2017 he co-founded CITIXL an international participatory platform for cities to share, test, and implement impactful innovations in Living Labs to accelerate social impact. He has exchanged solutions and experimented innovations with multiple cities globally and provides workshops, tours, presentations, and consultations, meeting regularly with private and public delegations from around the world. \n     \nA multi-award-winning, internationally recognised expert in IoT, Smart Cities, Living Labs, UX design, e-Culture, social innovation, and citizen engagement, he is currently writing a chapter as a contributing author for Framing Economies of the Future (Eds.

The project began with the mission to kick start the IoT Economy by providing  open IoT and M2M infrastructure in public spaces.  Projects like the Beacon Mile, BAMBEA and SParkS;  hackathons such as the Amsterdam Smart City event and the Museum Night Hackathons;  and challenges such as the IoT Olympics captured the imagination of the maker community and generated dozens of valuable community driven smart city prototypes.  The IoT Living Lab won the prestigious ODINE grant from the Open Data Institute (ODI) and eventually became incorporated in July of 2017. \n\nNow, as Founder and Director of the IoT Living Lab, Paul has started a new project with the CTO office City of Amsterdam  - The City Innovation Exchange Lab (CITIXL) to build a global living lab network to test, distribute and scale community driven Smart City projects.  The CITIXL, co-founded with Tapp.NL,  facilitates quick win collaborations with the City of Amsterdam and partners including Amsterdam Smart City, Amsterdam University of Applied Science (HvA), Data Labs, and leading Smart Cites to create positive social impact with citizens.
