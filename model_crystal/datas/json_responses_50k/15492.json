    "summary": "Saket Pande (B.Tech in Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, 2000; Ph.D. in Hydrology and Water Resource Management, Utah State University, 2005) is a hydrologist and a resource economist. He has advanced education in both Hydrology and Economics, and has expertise in the fundamentals of Hydrology, Applied Statistics, Economic Theory, and their intersections in real-world applications. Prior to joining TU Delft in 2010, Saket was a tenure-track researcher at SOW-VU (Stichting Onderzoek Wereldvoedsel-voorziening van de Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam), a Dutch think-tank that excels in international development studies.\n \nIn recent years Saket has been extensively researching on how fundamentals of applied probability can explain the issues underlying calibration uncertainty in water systems, especially in basin scale hydrology. He has shown that control on hydrologic model complexity can lead to robust prediction performance. He has also been studying the impacts of hydrologic uncertainty on economic systems. Using his advanced training in economics, Saket has also researched into temporal dynamics of individual decision-making as well as into the fundamentals of welfare economics.\n \nSaket has extensive experience in working in multidisciplinary teams on topics such as uncertainty implications of climate change on water availability, food production and human wellbeing in developing countries like Benin and Ethiopia. Saket\u2019s overarching aim is to use his diverse training to solve real-world problems that are interdisciplinary in nature.\n\nSpecialties: hydrological modeling, mathematical economics and econometrics",
