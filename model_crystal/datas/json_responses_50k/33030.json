My thesis is being supervised by an experienced LCA Specialist at TNO, and co-supervised by a PhD student at TU/e. As Brazil plans to establish a green hydrogen hub with increased capacity in Pecem port and export to the Netherlands to support industries such as steel before 2030, my thesis aims to evaluate the environmental impact of green hydrogen imports versus domestic production in the Netherlands. By examining the environmental implications of international green hydrogen trade, I aim to contribute to the development of sustainable energy systems and provide valuable insights to policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector. Through this project, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the life cycle assessment of green hydrogen and how it can be used to promote sustainable practices in the energy sector.",

Our focus was on creating a plan that would cater to greenhouse farmers as our target market, and we also analyzed the market size and value proposition. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in ideating and developing a viable business plan. Working collaboratively with my peers, I was able to learn valuable teamwork and communication skills that will be useful in any future roles where collaboration is required. Overall, this project allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a practical context, giving me a taste of what it's like to work on a real-world business venture.",
