            "description": "Inholland University of Applied Sciences became business partners with TEDxBinnenhof in 2015. A project team consisting of four students, including myself as the creative manager, organised the launch of the new offices of TEDxBinnenhof and organise a viewing party for Ideas From Europe 2016. The idea of Inholland X-Talks was born and we filmed around 50 students in Amsterdam and The Hague. I was also in charge of digital and social media marketing aspects of this project. The X-Talks had more than 10,000 views on Facebook in just five days which was a great success. The TEDxBinnenhof offices project included decorating, branding, and organising an opening event for the launch of the three offices. Visitors included entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, faculty and students. The final project was to organise the viewing party which consisted of a networking reception, masterclasses, workshops and announcing the winner of the X-Talks.\nThis was a very successful project that got the attention of the Dutch printed press (AD newspaper) and received the third place award for the WijInholland award out of more than 20 projects.\nDutch Press appearances are as below:\n1. http://www.emerce.nl/wire/student-beeld-tedxbinnenhof-2016 \n2. http://www.denhaagdirect.nl/studenten-inholland-den-haag-nemen-x-talks-op-in-volkswagen-busje/\n3. http://deposthoorn.nl/nieuws/x-talks-in-busje-bij-inholland-1.5779951 \n4. http://tedxbinnenhof.com/inholland-organises-viewing-events-in-the-hague-and-diemen/\n",
