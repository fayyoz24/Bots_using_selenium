    "summary": "Life has to be fun.\n\nI am raised in a culture of \"There is always a way to improve\" and \"If there is no news, then consider it good news.\u201d I have heared people say it. At first, I thought these were good sayings to live by. \nEventually, I had no idea what 'being good enough' really meant. My programming teachers said that my coding skills were not good enough. I believed them. I got motivated by the people who gave me bad energy. And this is the worst kind of motivation you can give to future generations. Results? Developing insecurities, imposter syndrome and never have joy in whatever I was doing.\n\nI re\u00efnvented myself. I found the love of my live (honestly, she found me), became a father of a beautiful son and found a home in Almere, The Netherlands. They are the main motivations for me to keep going. Work and career has more meaning than ever. And I feel good about it. I enjoy life and have much more fun in my work. I am keen to learn new technologies, skills and I started to love doing what I am doing in IT.\n\n\"If there is no news, then consider it good news?\".. That is not motivating. However, I learned to celebrate achievements. Small and big. And now I get motivated in the right way, instead of being not getting motivated at all\n\n\"There is always a way to improve?\" Every painting, song, photograph, design or solution will always have flaws. But at some point it is good enough. It's flaws is what makes every production perfect in it's own way! Including people...\n\nLife has to be fun. Cheers and enjoy :)",
