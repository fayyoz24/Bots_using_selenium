    "summary": "Since I was in middle school, my interest and curiosity in administrative structures and how it aides the government  and companies around the world inspired me to take up arts in college. I wanted to learn more about the theories that led organization behavior and how the employees involved carried out daily tasks, made decisions, understood risks and delegated responsibilities to employees.  This led me to opting for the master degree in Development Administration, Gandhigram, to learn about the theories in Public Administration, Political Science, Organizational behavior, Project Planning among others.\n\nThis background led me to be a data enumerator, trainer and project leader for teams across the country for various projects which connected me to a network of donors, grass root leaders, professors and research facilities at regional & national levels. My role helped me to coordinate tasks, handle difficult situations whilst helping the team and solving crisis at the location of data enumeration with excellent communication and a dependable team player.\nIn search of new challenges and to expand my knowledge, I pursued a Masters in development studies at International Institute of Social Studies (The Hague), majoring in Governance and Development Policy in 2019. \n\nMy enhanced work experience with project management, planning and communication skills will be a valuable addition to an organization which require professionals to handle and evaluate projects.",
