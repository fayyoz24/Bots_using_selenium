The posts were analyzed based on the frequency of posting and then categorized based on the number of posts done by the company and those done by the followers of the company. The number of comments on each post were then categorized based on the emotions i.e. appreciative posts, neutral, criticizing, etc. The remaining page statistics were analyzed in detail using Fanpage Karma to find out what interests the consumers and the topics most spoken about.\n\nThe posts were then analyzed to find out which kind of content generated maximum amount of replies (not likes, written replies) and counter replies to better understand the consumer sentiment. The report then summarized the findings to conclude which kind of posts generated maximum conversations and positive responses from the followers.\n",
