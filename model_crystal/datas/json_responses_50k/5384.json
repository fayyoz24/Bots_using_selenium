    "summary": "The world we live in excites me; the creator economy in Web3 allows for completely new ways of engagement between creators and fans. Web3 allows us to create infinite models versus the standard finite models we know from Web2. Web3 allows us to build micro-economies where many stakeholders are connected, versus the 1-1 models we know of in Web2. Developments around AI, blockchain, Solid and robotics are just a few of the innovation areas of my interest.\n\nBesides my professional career, I love exploring the world around us. I love nature, good food, cooking, travelling and meeting new people with a diversity of perspectives and opinions. I consider myself an ambivert as I love being at home with the cats and my partner and I am also happy to be on stage presenting for large audiences.\n\nI have co-developed and coordinated the world's first Web3-business-model course for the Creative Industries at University level. When I started the course back mid-2018, there were very few people talking about Web3, let alone building new business models using Web3 technologies. In this role, I have had the opportunity to 'always try to stay ahead of the curve'. When people were talking about crypto, I was talking about Web3, when the industry started to understand blockchain principles, I was explaining NFTs and the decentralised metaverse, and when creative companies started exploring x2e models, I trained students on how to think beyond that.\n\nI foresee that more and more companies in the creative industries and platform economies will start to understand that the power of Web3 lies in the ability to create infinite worlds, to create micro-economies. At the moment, too many businesses take-on an x2e approach, which in the end will not be sustainable. The thinking needs to shift from temporary projects to long lasting micro-economies, those who can build that, will exist in the future.",

When I started the course back mid-2018, there were very few people talking about Web3, let alone building new business models using Web3 technologies. In this role, I have had the opportunity to 'always try to stay ahead of the curve'. When people were talking about crypto, I was talking about Web3, when the industry started to understand blockchain principles, I was explaining NFTs and the decentralised metaverse, and when creative companies started exploring x2e models, I trained students on how to think beyond that.\n\nI foresee that more and more companies in the creative industries and platform economies will start to understand that the power of Web3 lies in the ability to create infinite worlds, to create micro-economies. At the moment, too many businesses take-on an x2e approach, which in the end will not be sustainable. The thinking needs to shift from temporary projects to long lasting micro-economies, those who can build that, will exist in the future. I have trained over 500 international Creative Business professionals to think strategically and in a way that fits the ultimate purpose of Web3.\n\nOther topics I teach include Growth Hacking, Marketing and Strategic Brand Building related courses.",

When we consider every single person to be an expert at something, then communities can be formed around knowledge-tasks (ex. a government that wants to poll political views), and new insight creation. Communities that create new insights together can then add that anonymised data to a Web3 data-trust, which in turn allows them to earn from past work done.\n\nThis enables a 'knowledge creator economy'.",

To put it simply, Web3 economies that want to include music in their projects depend on Copyright Delta for copyright cleared content. This is a clear win-win-win scenario where all benefit.\n\nSecond, we have built tools to do analytics and forensics for royalty statements. This allows us to, quite literally, find your missing money. This is unique in the music-streaming industry and gives value where it belongs.",

I have organised my own events and I have travelled to many different places in Europe, Brazil and beyond. I am grateful to this sport, as it taught me a many valuable life lessons and I am happy I managed to pass on my knowledge to others."
