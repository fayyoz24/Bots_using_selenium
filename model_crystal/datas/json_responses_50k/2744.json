They all answered two questions:\n\u2013 What do you hope will happen next?\n\u2013 What do you think will happen?\nEight years later, their answers are still just as moving and confrontational.\n\nIn March 2022, the photographer returned to Ukraine. His aim was to make another hundred portraits, this time of resistance fighters throughout Ukraine. Lhuisset: \"Some have taken up arms, others manufacture camouflage nets or Molotov cocktails, others help with logistics or care for the wounded. They are the Ukrainian civil resistance. They are people who have left their ordinary lives to fight.\n\nTheir faces are hidden for now. They must be protected because many of them will have to continue the fight clandestinely. One day their faces will be visible to all. Their portraits will be displayed on the day Ukraine regains its full sovereignty. The day the resistance won.\u201d\n\nAs in Maydan \u2013 Hundred Portraits, text and image are equally important. The questions the sitters answered remained the same as in 2014:\n\u2013 What would you like to see happening now?\n\u2013 What do you think will happen?",

            "description": "During the thirty year rule of Stalin millions of innocent citizens were imprisoned in the forced labour camps of the Gulag, exiled or excuted. Russia has never fully confronted this dark history.\n\nToday, Putin\u2019s regime glorifies the idea of a strong leader. Stalin is praised for leading the Soviet Union to victory over Nazi Germany. The fact that he was the architect of the Gulag is silenced or downplayed. According to a recent poll, 38 percent of the Russians think Stalin was the most outstanding person in history and almost half of the population believes that the repression was necessary to maintain order in the country. Even the victims of Stalin\u2019s 1924-1953 regime sometimes share this view on history.\n\nFor six months, photographer and journalist Hester den Boer travelled Siberia. She visited former Gulag campsites, interviewed victims of the Stalinist terror, met with historians- some under prosecution themselves \u2013 and talked to people who think Russia is in need of a strong leader like Stalin. In her project, she brings these opposing views together.\n\nSuppressed by the Saviour gives a unique and intimate insight into Russia\u2019s past and the current climate of growing repression. Den Boer approached her subject both textually and visually by means of a travelling exhibition, a nonfiction book and a web application made on the storytelling platform Slices. The trilingual app \u2013 in English, Dutch and Russian \u2013 serves to complement and expand on the journalistic content of the book, while making it accessible to the international and Russian community.",

For Palestinians, it marks the Nakba (\u2018catastrophe\u2019): more than 700.000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes. Today \u2013 exactly 70 years later \u2013 those 700.000 have exceeded six million. 48 Stories presents the personal stories of Palestinians who witnessed the events and shows where they live today.\n\n48 Stories sheds new light on the representation of the Palestinian diaspora. The project documents the memories and everyday lives of Palestinians, both 1948 survivors and their descendants. Many of them live in Gaza, the West Bank or Israel but the vast majority is spread around the world; they are based in (former) refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria or Jordan, have settled in countries like the US, Chile and the Netherlands. They have become shop owners, doctors, political activists or university professors. While they are scattered geographically, they share the hope of one day acquiring the right of return. However, being rooted in new homelands and without any sign of reconciliation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is unlikely that they will ever resettle.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, 7 photographers and filmmakers captured the experiences of Palestinians across the globe. 48 Stories shows a community whose members, although geographically and socioeconomically diverse, are all tied to the same country, landscape and history.",

He photographed them from the back, since the danger of recognition with frontal portraits would be too great. He did make them though, in the hope that someday, after the expulsion of the enemy, their faces can be shown.\n\nSUPPRESSED BY THE SAVIOUR (2019)\nco-curator | project lead | suppressedbythesaviour.net\n\nDuring the thirty-year rule of Joseph Stalin, millions of citizens were imprisoned in forced labour camps, exiled or executed. Russia has never fully confronted this dark history. With Suppressed By The Saviour, journalist and photographer Hester den Boer gives an intimate insight into Russia\u2019s past and the current climate of growing repression.\n\n48 STORIES (2018)\neditor | project lead | www.48stories.org\n\nFor Israelis, May 1948 marks the creation of the State of Israel. For Palestinians, it marks the Nakba (\u2018catastrophe\u2019): more than 700.000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes. Today \u2013 exactly 70 years later \u2013 those 700.000 have exceeded six million. 48 Stories presents the personal stories of Palestinians who witnessed the events and shows where they live today.",
