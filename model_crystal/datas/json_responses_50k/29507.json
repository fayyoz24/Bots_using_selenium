    "summary": "Hello! My name is Susan and my mission is to help scientists, academics, and business people say or write what they intend to.  Does it take too long to comprehend what you read or say what you wish with nuance and ease?\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve worked or studied extensively in English but you still have difficulties WRITING or SPEAKING fluently\u2026\n\nYou panic when a paper, article, or book draft is due and you need that all-important second eye\u2026\n\nOr you have an important presentation to make and you need to improve the script or your oral speaking skills...\n\nContact me here and I will help you.\n\nWRITING\n\nI have a lifetime\u2019s experience in publishing, academia, and film and television production.  Through STRUCTURING, PROOFREADING, EDITING, or POLISHING your texts, I can help make them more readable and interesting and teach you how to do it, too.\n\nI support academics, students, publishers, and creatives in improving the development, style, organization, clarity, and tone of their writing.  We can work together on writing of all types -- from academic --> to professional --> to creative.  Essays, doctoral and master\u2019s theses, screenplays, books, and articles are my forte.  Writing is much easier with the help of a 'second eye' -- someone who can assist you with proofreading, spelling, punctuation, grammar, and minor rewriting.\n\nENGLISH TRAINING\n\nImprove your English speaking with online conversation, listening, and grammar training. If you want to be more comfortable and precise when SPEAKING ENGLISH as a second language, I am the trainer for you. I have nearly 20 years of success in helping people to speak and communicate in English and I love nothing better than to see you become more confident and proficient.\n\nContact me now to receive a quote or sample of my editing / proofreading texts.\n\nFilm credits:  https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1075278/",
