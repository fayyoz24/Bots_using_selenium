Selected, built, developed, and led the corporate QA/QC team. The team consists of 4 QA experts and 14 QA/QC team members. \n\nDesigned and developed a tailor made QA/QC workflow application with supplier portals which connects SKU\u2019s and PO-lines to requirements lists and allows suppliers to submit their product safety compliance documentation for review. \n\nWorked closely with members of the Board and the Managing Directors of the retail brands to develop processes that rapidly increased the awareness of the need for regulatory compliance among internal and external stakeholders. Transformed the relation with market surveillance authorities from a decentralised authoritarian surveillance per retail brand to a cooperative surveillance on corporate level by continuously pursuing QA/QC-processes based on data, transparency, cooperation and frequent communication with all stakeholders.\n\nExtended the scope of the QA/QC activities from merely regulatory compliance to integrated product quality and the development of private label lines. Initiated participation in BSCI and ICTI for all retail brands. Increased the number of annually handled new SKU from approx. 9,000 to over 100,000 (2013 -2016) whilst decreasing the original staffing by more than 30%. On behalf of approx. 90 category managers the QA/QC team annually services more than 1,100 suppliers and manufacturers worldwide.\n\nThe scope included 9 retail brands (Bart Smit, Big Bazar, Blokker, Intertoys, Leen Bakker, Marskramer, ToysXL, Tuincentrum Overvecht en Xenos) and 2 wholesale brands (Elektroblok, Trend Center) operating in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.",
