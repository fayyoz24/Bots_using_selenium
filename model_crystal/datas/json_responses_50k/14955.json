    "summary": "I am currently working as a Programme Manager Information Security and Global T&T Programme Manager for Global BDS Cybersecurity. I have a strong background in financial and service improvement. I have managed the contract implementation for a new customer contract within Atos. I have implemented a financial restructuring and managed the performance improvement programme. I was one of the core members of the transition team to a new service delivery model for Atos Global IT.\n\nIn 2019 I was certified as a lean Six Sigma Black Belt. I am also a fully qualified teacher for secondary and follow-up education.\n\nI have worked in and have knowledge of the following industries: Telecom, Retail, Media (Print & Digital), Banking, Government, Non-Governmental Organisations, United Nations, Internal IT, Education (all levels), Health care, Day care & after school care. I have fulfilled several roles within Atos in my capacity as a business manager. \n\nI began my career as a training coordinator and project manager with the United Nations, first stationed in Africa, followed by postings in Asia. Upon my return to the Netherlands I made the transition to business as a project manager with Atos, after which I progressed to business manager.\n\nI have experience with coaching and the development of training. I have ample experience with working with people from different cultures and under diverse circumstances in various countries.\nI am people oriented and have a well-developed political sense.
