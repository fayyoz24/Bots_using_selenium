    "summary": "Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work. That captures my attitude towards how I enjoy working. Being it legal work or any other area of expertise I encounter. I always enjoy to challenge myself and my colleagues and to learn new insights of the interrelation of legal with the other business departments. That eagerness allows me to enhance the quality of my legal work and helps me understand the multidisciplinary playing field a legal professional encounters while working in an international organisation. I developed the ability to look beyond the typical legal and compliance aspects of my responsibilities and also take the operational, financial and commercial aspects into account. \n\nAs Legal Director I make sure we conduct our business in a safe, ethical and legally compliant manner whilst always have as objective to provide pragmatic solutions and create awareness. I don\u2019t just say \u2018no\u2019 or try to just fix a problem with a solution. I take a step back to identify the purpose of an activity, assess what part is non-compliant and work together with my colleagues and other officers to find a way to the required result and that\u2019s compliant with the legal framework we operate in as a company.\n\nI have experience working in IT, international construction, maritime industry and (asset) leasing. I\u2019m characterized having a strong sense of responsibility, entrepreneurship and hands on work mentality. During my career I have acquired skills in global legal matters, contracting, M&A, governance and compliance framework for the group\u2019s legal exposure. I\u2019m experienced in negotiating, drafting and reviewing various commercial contracts, managing external attorneys in court cases on various topics, organizing and advising on corporate (re)structuring. Always optimizing shareholders and corporate interest, working closely together with colleagues and external legal advisors. Familiar and accomplished working in teams, either with legal professionals as well as non-legal colleagues, but also working individually as a sole in-house legal counsel and managing teams of legal and non-legal professionals. \n\nKeywords: senior legal counsel \u2013 general counsel \u2013 head of legal \u2013 chief legal officer \u2013 legal director",

In my daily work I focus on standardizing and streamlining legal & compliance aspects in the business operations. This standardization creates the opportunity for myself to spend time on the important and more complicated subjects as well as empowers non-legal colleagues to feel comfortable handling the legal aspects of their work (mostly) independently. Ultimately, my goal is to maintain a legal and compliance department with work flows and procedures that minimize interruptions in the internal business processes and maximize an adequate mitigation of risks. I enjoy working in close corporation with my colleagues within Trifleet's offices and within our shareholder's group of companies. I regularly take part in multidisciplinary project teams where I aim to not only contribute with my legal and compliance expertise, but to also bring my strong sense of business acumen and analytics, my focus on pragmatism, and my favorite thing above anything else, to learn new skills and subject matter!\n\nSince July 2022 I\u2019m officially member of the Trifleet Management Team.
