These various services may be deployed either logically interconnected or separately. The core is always managing the Human Capital and the result of your organization. Human Capital does not appear on the balance sheet, but is an important asset in each organization. It\u2019s for that reason that many employers rely on the depth and width of a specialist agency such as Hoek Consultants. We take a different view, on the individual and organizations. We stand for results, thorough craftsmanship and real involvement with both client and candidate.  \n\nOur consistently high satisfaction ratings aren\u2019t solely the result of vision, professionalism, experience and applied procedures. They are also brought about by our high personal commitment and care. We invest, also once an assignment is completed. We are practice more than just due diligence in the way we handle clients and candidates. In the conversations we entertain with candidates, we pay attention to attitude, motivation, experience, education and specialism. We immediately recognize the (necessary) qualities present in candidates \u2013 or the lack thereof. We operate in an employment market that shows an increasing gap between supply and demand of people with a higher education. This is why the deployment of specialist in key and staff level goes way beyond merely matching supply and demand.\n\nAs Human Capital Specialist and Boardroom advisor we got three focus areas:\n\nChange Leaders: the right person in the right position \nLeading Change: guiding deep change processes \nChanging Change: develop new ways for leading change",
