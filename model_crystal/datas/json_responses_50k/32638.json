We actively facilitate frictionless transactions enabling highest value reuse opportunities for materials. This creates a transparent and reliable source of secondary- or excess materials, ranging from reinforced concrete blocks to orange peels. \n\nOur marketplace facilitates transactions across sectors and industries since this is where the innovative power of the circular economy is maximized. We facilitate the exchange of these materials with state of the art technologies, knowledge and services. This means matching materials with the help of AI, safely exchanging sensitive data via blockchain and spurring innovation around material reuse with our knowledge partners like AMS, EY and ABN AMRO. We are tapped into a global knowledge network of circular economy experts. Our goal is to reinstate waste for the valuable resource that it is. This enables companies to become more resource resilient, decrease their environmental footprint and improve their bottom line by turning their trash into cash.",
