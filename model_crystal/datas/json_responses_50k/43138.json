    "summary": "I have been a professional artist since 1996. I am  a painter working in oils on canvas and board.  I also make assemblage sculptures and installations using found objects in combination with welded steel, fiberglass resin and other materials.  More recently I have extended this to crafting musical instruments that are \"playable sculptures\".\n\nI was educated and trained as a scientist, a physicist and mathematician in a field requiring precision, clarity and hard facts. While I excelled in my studies, I felt dissatisfied and incomplete. I have always been creatively inclined and imaginative and have throughout my life found expression for this through drawing and making music.  While completing my PhD at the University of the Witwatersrand, I began exhibiting my work in local galleries, meeting with increasing recognition and success - by the time I finished my studies, I was clear that I wanted to pursue my art professionally.\n\nI have however maintained an interest in science and academia, and remain active as a freelance proof-reader and editor in a wide range of subjects, ranging from the hard sciences to social sciences, to music and related technology and, of course, art.\n\nAs an artist, I began making art as an exploration of the non-verbal world of the subconscious.  I allow myself to be guided by the medium and the painting process themselves to direct the subject matter of my painting, enabling me to \"get out of my own way\" and to use the process as a journey of discovery and self-therapy.  Fundamentally this is an approach influenced by the intentions espoused by the Surrealists, a way to explore the irrational, subconscious mind.   While the emotions and insights that feed this work are personal, through exhibiting my works I have found that they also resonate with others, and that many people find something of themselves in my paintings and assemblages.\n\nI like to use titles that add a further dimension to the artwork, to give them a spin or a certain flavour without being literal.  I often think of artworks as visual poems - with meanings implied by the juxtaposition and context of the image and the words. ",
