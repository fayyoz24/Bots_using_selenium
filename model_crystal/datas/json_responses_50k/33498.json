They are checked medically on a regular basis. Villa Ticca is a safe place for them. It allows them to grow up as happy, self-confident kids with empathy, intelligence and a sense of humor.\nMany of the children that grew up with Villa Tica still attend the centre (now being adolescent!) where they have their own space, and get a good lunch and assistance with their homework. \n"

            "description": "Nest\u2019s fellowship program seeks to deliver meaningful skill based mentorship to artisan entrepreneurs. The program is designed to bridge the skills and education gap between artisans in emerging economies and professionals with the power to transfer their knowledge to handworkers who need it most.\n\nDuring my fellowship for NEST I was matched to Manos del Peru, an Alpaca  knitwear brand dedicated to the preservation of the traditional weaving methods of the indigenous people of Peru, and devoted more generally to the empowerment of women. \nFirst, we assessed Manos del Peru strengths and reviewed their long-term objectives. The brand\u2019s main priority was to develop their export in the luxury segment and to align their brand profile to the international market. In the months that followed, I developed a tailored strategy plan addressing their targets. The plan covered a wide scope of subjects, ranging from market analysis and identifying high-potential markets to defining a wholesale and retail strategy. It also contained recommendations to strengthen Manos del Peru\u2019s brand identity, product propositions and a CSR review to enhance the positive impact of their brand.\nThe opportunity to contribute to the NEST fellowship program with Manos del Peru was a very enriching experience. It was great to be able to share and exchange knowledge and understand the history and culture of woven textiles in the community, which gave important context to our work together.\n"
