Dominique Ristori, Director-General of DG Energy at the European Commission wrote recently that \u201cE1st is not an advertising slogan but a fundamental principle\u201d. E1st is a powerful approach to energy policy that could save families and businesses billions of euros in energy costs annually, improve energy security, and accelerate progress toward Europe\u2019s goals for carbon reduction and a clean energy economy. Briefly described, the concept of E1st prioritizes investments in customer-side efficiency resources (including end-use and supply side energy efficiency and demand response) whenever they would cost less, or deliver more value, than investing in energy infrastructure, fuels, and supply alone. Although in the Energy Union Strategy energy efficiency has been recognised as a resource in its own right at the same level as generation capacity and the E1st as a guiding principle has been brought forward, still numerous barriers impede this principle to be streamlined and the benefits of energy efficiency to be adequately taken into account in financial and political planning and decision making. On the demand side, investments in efficient solutions are hindered by numerous market barriers to individual action; and on the supply side, industry traditions, business models and regulatory practices continue to favour energy infrastructure and sales over lower sales and energy saving technologies. Departing from the above, ENEFIRST will help making the E1st principle more concrete and operational, better understand its relevance for energy demand and supply and its broader impacts across sectors and markets.

            "description": "The EC Horizon 2020 SENSEI is a 36 months project coordinated by IEECP, focussing on the Energy Performance Contracting Models. The Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) model has been successful in attracting investments in energy efficiency, but mainly for single, large projects where:\n\uf0a7 The building owners offer a large portfolio of buildings;\n\uf0a7 Either the energy service company (ESCO) is large enough to secure a loan to finance the retrofit (for the case of a shared-savings agreement) or the building owners have the capacity to invest in their energy efficiency (for the case of a guaranteed-savings agreement).\nThis is the reason why EPC has been mainly successful in the so-called MUSH market (municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals).\nEnergy efficiency programs constitute an alternative path to scaling up the number of buildings that implement energy efficiency interventions. However, the typical approach to energy efficiency programs is based on rebates and incentives that are paid upfront and are based on a predicted result. Because energy efficiency is paid in advance, with little accountability as to results, there is a misalignment of incentives, a need to rely on deemed energy savings and, thus, on only a small number of predetermined energy efficiency measures, and a need for complex and costly regulations that hinder innovation.\nBy contrast, for energy efficiency to be attractive to investors, it must be associated with consistent returns and stable long-term cash flows. These cash flows would allow efficiency projects to be financed in the same way one would finance a power plant; power plants are financed based on the value of the energy they will produce, and not merely on the credit of the borrower. This means more opportunities for building owners to attract third party financing and to reduce upfront capital costs, and more opportunities for smaller companies and innovative collaborations to successfully compete in the market.",

The goal is to answer the questions:\nwhat are the most effective actions improving the efficiency in a particular process or industry sector? How to specifically\nimplement them? What are the most promising technologies? What is the efficiency improvement attainable with each\naction? How to measure, monitor and report the savings? What are the associated costs?\nEU-MERCI, with recommendation and specific dissemination actions, will also assist policy makers and public authorities in\nthe assessment of the effectiveness and transparency of the mechanisms, giving them also a picture of the technologies and\nefficiency improvements to incentive.\nLessons learned from countries with consolidated energy efficiency schemes in place will be transferred to countries less\nadvanced.\nThe outputs of EU-MERCI will be specifically validated for the agrifood industry at a pan-European level.\n",

The effort put into developing and implementing these policies is well documented in existing NEEAPs. Soon, emphasis will be put on finding out how effective they were to create new policies that allow meeting current and future energy savings targets. Unfortunately, several barriers limit policy evaluation. This results in a lack of quantitative data, and impedes evidence-based analysis required to distinguish effective from ineffective policies. \n\nEPATEE aims at tackling this problem by raising the capacity of policymakers and implementers to assist Members States to fulfil their obligation under energy related Directives. The project will provide them both with tools and with practical knowledge to make effective impact evaluation an integral part of the policy cycle. EPATEE makes use of existing evaluation experiences in a range of instruments, such as energy efficiency obligation schemes, regulations, financial incentives and voluntary agreements. Lessons learnt from other EU initiatives and good practices in how to successfully evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of such energy efficiency policies will provide the basis for the development of guidelines and good practice evaluation tools. A set of 20 to 30 tools enabling state-of-the-art evaluation will be developed and integrated into a smart online toolbox, which interactively assists users in picking the most relevant tool for their specific need.\n\nThis guidance material provides the basis for the most important aspect of EPATEE: target-oriented experience sharing and capacity building. Findings will be discussed together with policymakers through peer-learning workshops, webinars, direct consulting, and other means of communication and dissemination. All activities will strive at realizing synergies with other EU projects such as ODYSEEE-MURE, ENSPOL, MultEE and the CA EED.",
