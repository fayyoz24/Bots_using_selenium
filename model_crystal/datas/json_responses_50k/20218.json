    "summary": "Branding, events and marketing expert, I believe in having a true partnership with my clients and colleagues, working together to help bring brands and events to life.\n\nAfter earning my master\u2019s in International Tourism, I spent the first decade of my career at WorldHotels creating and marketing noteworthy events around the globe for some of the most iconic independent hotels of the world. Later I transitioned to QUO, using my brand development expertise and experience to fuel cause growth strategy. I diligently worked with clients, developed partnerships and pitched new business. Following my dream for contributing to the personal and professional growth of students and youth to positively impact our global community, I collaborated with WYSE Travel Confederation to support their brand and marketing activities. Thinking from the perspective of the stakeholders, be the client or the event attendee, I am working as an event and marketing consultant. I am collaborating with companies who can benefit from my intercultural skills and in-depth knowledge of the international event organization, marketing project management and brand culture development.\n\nSpecialties: Hotel, hospitality, negotiation, project and event management, sales and marketing activities, corporate production, networking.
