    "summary": "I believe we're made to move. I'm an exercise scientist with over a decade of experience working as a Strength & Conditioning Coach and a Rehabilitative Exercise Specialist. I use my expertise to help athletes improve their performance, and prevent, manage, and recover from injuries. I'm currently contracted to work with TeamNL (Dutch Olympic Team) teams, and work privately with a variety of team sport, endurance, and performing arts athletes in the Netherlands and across the globe. In addition this, I work privately with a range of rehabilitation clients, namely specialising in back and shoulder rehabilitation.\n\nI'm a believer in evidence-based exercise prescription, but I also strongly believe that all athletic training should be client-specific; specific to their goals, their needs, and their likes and dislikes. Most of all, I love seeing change in my athletes' and clients\u2019 lives \u2013 whether it\u2019s at the level of function, pain, or performance.",
