    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic certified internal audit professional with 10 years experience in internal audit / operational audit with a background in business administration & sustainability. I really enjoy working in international teams and international settings, exemplified by doing international operational audits and by having lived and worked in India. I believe I can easily communicate with people from various (cultural and theoretical) backgrounds, resulting in a cohesive team in which people can count on me. \n\nI work in a structured manner and I am eager to keep on developing myself. That is why I completed the Post-Master Internal Audit & Advisory (RO) and also the reason I have always been involved in extra-curricular activities. Next to developing myself, it has enabled me to meet new people and learn from other people\u2019s stories. As a result, I enjoy helping out others by connecting them with people in my network. \nIn my spare time, I like to play racket sports which I used to play at a competitive level.\n\nExpertise:\n-\tInternal audit;\n-\tOperational audit / Soft controls / root cause analysis;\n-       Sustainability and sustainability audits;\n-       Stakeholder management.\n\nI am always interested in meeting new people, so feel free to reach out to me by connecting or sending a message.",

Practical examples of Partnering for Sustainability were provided by the interactive workshops from Cargill-Unilever, Eneco-WWF, PostNL-Municipality of Delft and KLM-SkyNRG. \nI was responsible for the communication between 3 Master Programs and all departments of the RSM involved in the organization. On top of that, I put a lot of effort in arranging workshops, promotion and selecting the venue.",
