            "description": "For my final year design project I worked on a project titled, Face-Based Access Control. The project involved the development of a system designed to ensure access control to a premise using the human face. Users authorized to enter the premises had their faces added to the database for positive identification the next time they want to access the premises. Anyone attempting to access the premise had their faces scanned with the use of a camera and if their face is in the database they were allowed entry and if their face is not in the database there were denied entry. The architecture of the system comprised of a camera that captured images of the users, a door latch and lock set responsible for opening the door when access is granted and remaining locked when access is denied, a digital audio player that communicated with the user on his/her entry status, a wireless network module that established a wireless link between the hardware at the door and the processing computer and the processing computer that held the software application that did the processing. An Atmel micro-controller was used to control the access point hardware while OpenCV within a Microsoft visual C++ application was used to do the high level processing of images. These two components were linked wirelessly which meant that the system could be used anywhere in the world while its brains sat in a different place as long as there is an internet connection between the two. The system was successfully constructed and my supervisor and examiner were satisfied with its functionality. This resulted in my project being one of the projects that received a highly commended award during the 2013 open day at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.",
