To give them a stable basis from which they can explore the world with self-confidence. \nIn October 2014 I started a new job at Rutgers and after two years went to Spark on an ad-interim basis. However, the background of my kids made it very hard to combine work with the daily care of them. A job that fits me needs maximum flexibility in approximately 10 hours a week. So if you are looking for a finance professional with helicopter view and you are open to give this mum flexibility, contact me!\nBeing at home I have trained and improved my organizational skills, I learned to be flexible and to deal with different levels of conversation. I was able to plan and get organised very efficiently, I had to set priorities and make decisions in best interest of my children.",
