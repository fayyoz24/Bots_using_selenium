Ook mensen die zich geen verhalenverteller noemen.\nLaatst was er op deze lijst nog een korte discussie over het woord storytelling: het lijkt weleens alsof het een term is die vooral door anderen dan vertellers gebruikt wordt om het verhalen vertellen nieuw elan te geven. Hoe erg is dat, kan je je vervolgens afvragen. Deze expertmeeting is bedoeld om met elkaar in gesprek te gaan: vertellers met marketeers, storytellers, journalisten  en anderen. Iedereen die 'de kracht van verhalen' tot zijn vak rekent, die daarover kan vertellen en die nieuwsgierig is naar ervaring van anderen is welkom. Wat is storytelling en hoe werken verhalen in die verschillende werelden?  Hoe zetten de verschillende werelden de \u2018power of story\u2019 in? Wat kunnen we van elkaar leren? Zijn het aparte werelden, of hebben we het uiteindelijk toch allemaal over hetzelfde?\nDe organisatie/redactie is dit jaar in handen van: Arjen Barel (Storytelling Festival/Storytelling Centre) Peter Fruhmann (digital storytelling), Annet Scheringa (organizational storytelling) en Nancy Wiltink (verhalenverteller), Eva Snijders (corporate storytelling) en Gerard Smit (journalistiek) zijn aanwezig als experts storytelling op hun vakgebied.",

In Western Europe, however, 96% reach grade 5 level reading skills. \nEurope is confronted with a very large group of students who are unable to acquire basic literacy. Students continue to fail tests and many quit studying although they could have become very good professionals in different fields. As a consequence, teachers and researchers are looking for new ways of teaching basic literacy skills.\nFurthermore, present day society allows citizens to move freely between different countries. This opportunity has created a new kind of illiteracy where highly qualified and literate people in their native language become NEET people (not in employment, education or training) in their new countries.\nFinally, literacy used to be taught from functional, to social and critical literacy, the hypothesis being that you need the operational literacy to be able to participate in society. Modern day society, however, sees citizens who are socially and critically literate without being operationally literate. \nGuerilla Literacy Learners (GuLL) is a student-centered approach which helps language learners improve their language acquisition skills. GuLL switches from how learners should learn to how they actually learn thus embracing the European recommendation that if students fail to learn, teachers might want to teach in a different way. GuLL asks learners to reflect upon the unorthodox links (Guerilla patterns) they make and then remediate it. \n",

Citizens are obliged to become more self-sufficient. These are changes and challenges not easily accepted and dealt with. \nSuccessful initiatives depend on factors such as trust, sharing emotions, recognising and accepting differences. If cohesion and progress are the objectives, then storytelling delivers the tools and also creates engagement and compassion. Stories of shared values, shared plans and more equality provide the best examples for all that. The most successful story expressing this is democracy.\n\nThe project:\nWith the project \u2018Raising Strong and resilient Communities\u2019 the consortium wants to develop a set of educational tools that can be used in adult education (with a focus on non-formal adult education) focussing on active citizenship and participation. These tools are based on existing and the further expansion of developed approaches, theories and methods of storytelling. \nThese tools are a teacher/ trainer manual, structured courses for adult educators, and a collection of videos/ audio recordings to showcase best practices and function as instruction videos.\nThe tools will be developed around the development of competences of cooperation and communication in differing communities, between various \u2018divides\u2019, such as intergenerational, intercultural, etc in order for learners to actively engage in local community work.",

The continuous education and training of staff  therefore is a fundamental issue for the quality of early childhood education provision. Creative approaches that can involve all children-independent from their social or ethnic background are needed. \n\nTelling stories offers a powerful methodology to support the development of children. It supports the listening and reading comprehension and is a natural opportunity for children to grow as language users. It besides provides a possibility for children to interact with the cultural context of fairytales, folktales and other stories, it strengthens the children's ability to concentrate and fosters creativity as well as critical thinking by stimulating discussion and debate.",
