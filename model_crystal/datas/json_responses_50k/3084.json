    "summary": "I would describe myself as a person who loves to collaborate and finds joy and energy in creating the most fitting, sustainable and feasible solutions. In order to do so, I believe a holistic approach is needed in which all involved stakeholders are taken into consideration. Due to my background in Industrial Design, I have acquired the necessary tools in order to tackle and understand wicked problems, my master's in Strategic Product Design has prepared me to understand how these problems should be solved with a strong focus on business. Lastly, my work experience in a corporate, finance and consultancy has taught me how to work with targets, collaborate with a wide range of different people from different backgrounds, apply proper time management, and cope with a diverse range of responsibilities.",
