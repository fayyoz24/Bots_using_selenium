    "summary": "CEO of EquInnoLab. - World wide unique Equestrian Sports Expertise & Innovation Centre.\n\nOne of my other passions is being active as an independent design engineering consultant in Supply Chain Management, Operations Management and Logistics. Holding a degree in Operations Management and Logistics I have continued to work at the Eindhoven University of Technology as a design engineering consultant, in parallel attaining a professional doctorate on Logistics Management Systems of the 3TU Stan Ackermans Institute.\n\nAccelerating through my studies I complemented them with a honours certificate in Logistics Management Systems and a minor in international relations. Here also I gained hands-on experience being active as interim logistics professional. As a consultant for the university, I am focused on the logistics challenges faced by industry world-wide: a systems approach to problems related to effective and efficient innovation, production, distribution and use of products and services, including information and communication systems. By implementation of the designed solutions I worked with the latest insights on change management and human resource management. Via the university I provided these consulting services to various companies and industries.\n\nWorking and living in several countires, I was involved with the private sector as well as the public sector. From covering senior management projects on integrating planning solutions for E2E supply chains in the private sector (Hilti), to acting as a urban logistics expert for public authorities developing countries (World Bank and Moroccan Agency for Logistics Development).\n\nAs a design engineer I build bridges between the latest academic development and the industry by developing design-to-fit solutions. Business cases are developed with a focus on practical logistics problems and always followed by data-driven approaches in my consultancy work. Although having experience in many Supply Chain Management and Logistics topics, I hold most expertise in urban logistics and integrated planning.",
