    "summary": "Ever since my days as a literary scholar and teacher I have been deeply fascinated with content and how it changes with time. I decided to pursue my passion for content further subsequent to my return to business.\n\nI am a storyteller at heart and an avid user of both the left and right side of my brain. I possess a strong eye for producing visual assets and a good commercial nose, with an ability to think outside the box. I am passionate and curious about all aspects of digital marketing and strive to create impactful digital assets on all platforms using excellent writing and editing skills, along with my knowledge of creative design tools and web technologies.\n\nMy transition from research of 19th century popular literature to production of 21st century digital content has further underlined my conviction that content needs to reflect the wants of its audience and adapt swiftly to the changes thereof in order for it to be appealing, particularly in this rapidly changing digital age of social, local, and mobile access.\n\nOutside of the office, I can be found reading a good book over a cappuccino in my favorite cafeteria, or at home enjoying an umphteenth rewatch of movies such as the classic Star Wars trilogy, Predator, Enter the Dragon, etc. Recently I have also rekindled my childhood passion for creating visuals: photography and drawing.\n\n\u25c6Areas of expertise: project coordination, content production/ optimization/ strategy, digital media, social media/ digital marketing, creative writing, proofreading/ editing, market trends, stakeholder engagement, research/ analysis, teaching/ mentoring",
