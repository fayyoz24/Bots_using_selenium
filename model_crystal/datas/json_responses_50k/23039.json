    "summary": "-Philosophy Research Master's student with a focus in climate change policy, political philosophy, and democratic decision-making processes. \n\n-Internationally focused professional with multifaceted work experience including climate change policy research, bioethics, speechwriting, certified ESL education, and gastronomy (in a previous life). \n \nAcademic research areas include: \n      -Philosophy of Climate Change: How should we assess mitigation and adaptation strategies for  \n      AGW? Is it possible to sufficiently address AGW within a neoliberal economic framework, and if so, \n      what reforms would this entail? How can we effectively transition into a sustainable future that still \n      meets our energy needs? How might experts best communicate pertinent climate information to \n      political leaders and members of the public?   \n      -Political Epistemology: How might political information be best accessed by a democratic public? What      \n      are the necessary conditions for public self-governance in the modern age? What would this look like in \n      practice? How can democratic nations address the challenges of anthropogenic global warming (AGW)? \n      What is the relation between expert knowledge and public opinion?\n     -Discourse Theory: What are fallacies, and how might bad faith actors abuse them to manipulate other \n      peoples' worldviews? How does propaganda and biased research harm AGW discourse, and what are \n      the political impacts of this? How can public discourse bring discussants and listeners closer to a \n      functional understanding of important public issues? What important aspects of AGW are omitted from \n      public discourse, and why?\n\n-Fluent in English, conversational (strong A2) in Dutch, beginner in Czech.",
