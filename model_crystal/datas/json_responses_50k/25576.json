However, succeeding in solutions business is challenging, requires new capabilities, deeper customer relationships, and comes with a higher cost of sales, and risks for profitability.\n\nService transformation - From hardware sales to revenue diversification\nManfred Dasselaar, Researcher - Service Systems Research, Ericsson\n\nIn the last 20 years Ericsson has transformed from being a company selling hardware to a company with diverse revenue streams from hardware, software and services up to the point where services is nearly 50% of total revenue. What has this journey been like and what can companies facing a similar transformation learn from it? In this presentation we discuss how to build up the organization\u2019s capabilities, expand the offering portfolio, opportunities and challenges bringing new value propositions to market and how this now forms the basis for Ericsson\u2019s expansion into new market segments.",

One of the specific areas to highlight is business model innovation. When creating new services the business model helps to give a holistic perspective on the service that is developed and brings understanding to the development team from different perspectives without loosing the overview and interconnections within and outside the development team.\n\nI applied this knowledge in technology research projects around the internet of things, data analytics and ICT Transformation in industries such as utilities, automotive, transport, agriculture and public safety.\nMost of the research was performed in partnerships with Universities in Sweden, the Netherlands and the United States. I took care of initiating and managing these collaborations as well.",
