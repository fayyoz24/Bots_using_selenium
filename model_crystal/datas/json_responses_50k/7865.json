    "summary": "My enthusiasm for sustainable practices was sparked by my desire to see a change in the destructive and linear economy of the fashion and textiles industry. Sustainability issues have become increasingly pronounced across many sectors and I am interested in understanding the intersections of sustainability, technology, development and how we can navigate these issues as sustainably as possible. As we become ever so confronted with the effects of climate change, I am committed to putting my passion for sustainability and professional skills in environmental compliance, project management and multi-disciplinary collaboration to good use to help create a more sustainable, just and healthy world.",
