CIVILCLIM was funded by the Research Council of Norway.\n\nThe focus of the project was a comparative study into the adaptation strategies of the civil protection institutions in Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. First, the national policy discourses on adaptation and civil protection in Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands were analyzed. Second, the civil protection system of a harbor area of significant national interest in the respective countries. As case study units, the civil protection systems of Bergen, Malm\u00f6 and Rotterdam were respectively selected.",

The parties involved in WAVE have the responsibility to adapt water management to the changing climate. Impacts from climate change has to be taken into account in spatial development. An important question emerging from the field is how municipalities currently deal with climate change in their new neighborhood planning. \n\nThe Local climate preparedness in municipalities project focused on sustainable land use planning and climate proof areas, municipal disaster planning and climate change awareness. The project had a regional focus analyzing municipalities within the Dutch province of Overijssel and was carried out in close cooperation with representatives from the province and the Groot Salland and Regge & Dinkel Water Boards.",

One of the conclusions from the research was that the local context and dedicated individuals are of great importance in the development of policies to deal with climate change.
