    "summary": "My professional experience as a pharmacist in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Nigeria (such as Regional Manager with Afrolily Pharma Nig. Ltd., and Senior Medical Representative at Gemini Pharmaceuticals Nig. Ltd.), provided me with in-depth knowledge of the organization and management of healthcare systems in a typical developing country. It has also aided me in developing skills with respect to team-building and working in multicultural settings.\n\nAs an international Master of Global Health student, I have participated in several projects that were involved in the improvement of healthcare in developing countries such as Afghanistan and India, through drug donations, improvement and/or development of drug-distribution channels and coordination of donor organizations\u2019 activities. This has enabled me develop my abilities in advanced research; health policy analysis; project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.  \n\nMy primary goal is to utilize my advanced skills and work experience in improving access to high quality and affordable healthcare throughout the world.",
