    "summary": "My goal is to work with smart people solving hard problems that make a difference. I apply the same passionate, creative approach, whether I\u2019m conducting research, developing strategy with a consulting client, or helping students translate classroom theory into real-world success. \n\n\u2605 BUSINESS RESEARCH & EDUCATION \u2605\nMy lifelong interest in problem solving has taught me that starting with the right question is critical to finding the right answer: an obvious albeit often overlooked approach. I encourage my students to think critically and ask questions first, even\u2014especially\u2014about the material I\u2019m teaching. When I\u2019m conducting marketing research, I dig deep into questions about human cognition, behavioral economics, and problem solving.  \n\n\u2605 MANAGEMENT CONSULTING \u2605\nMy commitment to helping others achieve their goals makes me a natural-born consultant. I\u2019ve applied this expertise to solve strategic and operational IT and security problems for diverse industries, including airlines, power, manufacturing, food distribution, and pharmaceuticals. \n\n\u2605 TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT \u2605\nI have extensive experience in technical management gained from leadership positions in the US Navy. During my military experience, I always put my team first. I have a strong ability to collaborate cross-functionally and generally keep the peace between different divisions. Unlike Dilbert\u2019s pointy-haired boss, I\u2019m a technical manager who actually understands technology.",
