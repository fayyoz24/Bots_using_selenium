            "description": "Electrical Energy is one of the most widely and daily used high grade energy. Electricity is one of the basic inputs required for the development of a country. An on date we are quite deficient in electricity generation and with the setting up of more and more industries after liberalization and increase in per capital income of the customer, demand of electricity is outstripping the addition of generation capacity. Even as per Govt. of India estimates this situation is not likely to improve until the end of 11th five year plan. Moreover an addition of generation capacity is costly and having higher lead time. In such a scenario the quickest tool available is to operate the present operating plants in most efficient manner for getting increased output\nEfficient utilization of steam in the turbine cycle generation more power from the same quantity of steam produced in boiler.\nEfficient operation of unit auxiliaries and lighting system contribute to reduce the in house consumption of power resulting in increased power supplied to the grid.\nIncreased output coupled with efficient generation of steam in boiler leads to reduced fuel consumption thus resulting in saving in cost of generation.\nEnergy audit and performance guarantee tests is modern tool used for evaluation of performance and efficiency of various equipments associated with the thermal power plant.\nEnergo Engineering Projects Limited, New Delhi is one of the leading companies in providing Energy Service around the globe.\n",

ORC is an attractive technology to produce energy from renewable energy sources. This technology uses an Organic fluid, which operated in the dense gas regime, and makes it important to take into account the molecular complexities of the fluid. This assignment focuses on the development of an OpenSource Nozzle and Turbine design tool.\n\nDuring this assignment, a state-of-the-art supersonic stator tool was made using Method of Characteristics. The designing tool is generalised to produce any turbine case. The design tool improves the performance of the stator by around 6%.\n\nDuring my task, I learnt about the derivation and implementation of Method of Characteristics. I coordinated with different research groups at TU Delft and delivered the project with a broad application.",

A sensitivity analysis on the different parameters governing the design of the rotor was analyzed. Considering the project timeline, a set of parameters were selected for optimization. Possible drawbacks of the turbine were identified and the %age improvement in performance by optimizing these parameters done. The results of the analysis are being now implemented in a test model for verification.\n\nDuring my tenure at Triogen, I learnt about the ORC and got an opportunity to understand the rotor blade parametrization. Moreover, I got sneak-peek into the European work culture and opportunity to do deep-dive analysis with the experienced professionals at the organisation.",

During this period I worked on a project to develop \"Drive Cycle to Simulate Fuel Economy\". The main focus of the project was to reduce the product development time by reducing the time involved in deriving the fuel efficiency of the auto-mobile. As a part of this project I did in-depth study on the methods of developing drive cycle. Considering advantaged and disadvantages of all the methods I derived an algorithm which excluded the disadvantages of some and advantages of others. The algorithm consisted of 13 derived parameters from the vehicle. I generated a MATLAB code to do the iterations. The optimised drive cycle generated was simulated in vehicle to find the co-relation between theoretical and practical data. I was able to achieve 93% co-relation. During the Project Review I was awarded as \u201cThe Best Technology Project\u201d by General Manager of the Organization. Some valuable inputs provided by my Head of Department was considered as way forward and have been encouraged to develop and prepare a technical article for the same.\n\nVALIDATION ENGINEER: I was identified as student with indistinguishable knowledge in analytical skill and offered new responsibilities as a Road Load Data Acquisition and Analysis Engineer. In which the key deliverable were to develop Accelerated Durability Test Cycle for different vehicle platform, Ride Comfort Evaluation as per ISO2631, Support to CAE Co-relation activity and support to field failures.\n\nProjects Worked: XUV5oo, TUV3oo, KUV1oo, Jeeto and Bolero platform",
