    "summary": "Junior chemical engineer with one-year experience in the material science industry (polymers) and two-year experience in customizing and developing advanced solutions (process safety software) for chemical, oil and gas industries. \n\nDeep knowledge in modeling kinetics and reaction systems for polyamides production.\nBasic experience in LNG process simulation and analyses (C3-MR and DMR technologies)\nAdvanced experience in workflow standardization and automation\nBroad experience in software development and database configuration\n\nMost recent achievements:\n- Standardize the workflow for the Process Safety Analyser solution. The new procedure was able to read different data-input formats from customers and translate the data into Honeywell applications. As result, the manual work was reduced by 50%. (Honeywell, 2013)\n- Development of a new methodology to estimate polymer properties by modeling, using end group approach. This methodology can be used as an alternative for other external software. \n\nAbility to work in following areas:\n- Process design: FEED, project management, conceptual design, detailed engineering, process synthesis, PFD and P&ID generation, mass and energy balance, process integration (mass and energy), PINCH analysis methodology;\n- Product design: BOSCARD, Product Driven Process Engineering (PDPE), Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), House of Quality (HoQ), Decision making process (Six Thinking Hats)\n- Process Control: Basic process control in Aspen Dynamics and Simulink.\n- Modeling: Polyamide reaction system, multicomponent mixture properties and behavior, Matlab, Mobatec\n- LNG production: Business general picture; Cascade process, C3MR, DMR\n- Refinery: Atmospheric distillation, vacuum distillation, desulphurisation, CCR Platforming, isomerisation, FCC, hydrocracker. visbreaker\n- Honeywell Production Control Center solution: Process Safety Analyzer solution, process documentation, product development and testing",

The new procedure was able to read different data-input formats from customers and translate the data into Honeywell applications. As result, the manual work was reduced by 50%\n- Implement the full shutdown logic in Process Safety Analyser solution for two projects (Valemon@Statoil in Norway and ShahGas@Al Hosn Gas in UAE). \n- Participate in updating the Honeywell Romania website to the global pattern. Part of this task I had to collaborate with different business groups and collect specific information about their activity, products and services, but also press releases and contact information",
