I received my PhD from Maastricht University, with a dissertation on team composition (changes), intragroup conflict and subsequent team behavior. After 4,5 years of working in Venlo at the Fontys International Business School, I decided to move back to Maastricht. Currently I work as a lecturer at the Maastricht Hotel Management School of Zuyd University of Applied Science. ",

My research area was on intragroup conflict and team performance. To be more precise, what the influence was of task and relationship conflict on the performance of dyads. These dyads had to perform a difficult task and worked interdependently. It showed that in under these stress-full conditions, both task and relationship conflicts occured, which in turn negatively influenced the performance of the participants. These adverse effects could be weakened with providing performance feedback half-way through the experiment. ",
