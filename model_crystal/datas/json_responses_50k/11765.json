Through research clinics and writing for various publications, including the university magazine and independent associations such as the Roosevelt Network at LUC, I explored topics such as policy analysis and decolonisation from environmental regenerative practices in Kenya. I am passionate about research and public policy analysis and will continue exploring it in the future.",

In addition to this, I also took part in social events organized by TECHO to better understand the community's perspective and tailor our efforts to their specific needs.\n\nThis volunteer experience allowed me to develop important skills in teamwork, task management, and resilience. Building houses and engaging with the community required constant coordination and effective communication between volunteers, which helped me hone my collaboration skills. Moreover, it gave me a deeper appreciation of the importance of community engagement in creating positive change."

It was a rewarding experience to see the positive impact of our efforts on the patients we served. I also gained valuable skills in task management, teamwork, and communication. I learned how to organize and execute activities efficiently while ensuring that the patients' needs were met. Additionally, I collaborated closely with other volunteers to execute activities smoothly, which improved my teamwork skills.\n\nCommunicating with patients and other volunteers was also an important part of my role. I learned how to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds and how to tailor my approach to meet the unique needs of each patient. The experience of working in a hospital setting taught me the importance of empathy and active listening."
