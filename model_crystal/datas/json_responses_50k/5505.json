    "summary": "In the Summer of 2019 my daughter, wife and I had the travel of a lifetime. In Australia and New Zealand we encountered on the one hand the pristine beauty that our planet still harbours. On the other hand the negative impact of human behaviour (including our travel) on this pristine beauty became all to clear as well. \n\nI'm intrigued and motivated by these moral dilemma's; combining one's curiosity and wanderlust with being active in the search for solutions, or better; improvements for the Earth's wellbeing. I motivate and guide others towards finding their better selves and being effective, having the impact they are striving for. Being effective usually means going the extra mile. \n\nI'm currently mostly at work from my personal mini-TAUW-dependance in beautiful Oosterbeek. \n\n",
