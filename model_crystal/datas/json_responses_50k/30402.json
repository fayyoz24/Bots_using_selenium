    "summary": "Aspiring quant. Passionate about modelling financial markets, stochastic calculus and structural analysis of economic systems. Econometrician by education, researcher by trade, philosopher by interest, teacher by calling, social animal by passion. \n\nI combine a love for solving mathematical problems through efficient use of computing power with a strong sense of group dynamics and communication. A true team player, I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced and social environments, inspiring me to perform at my very best, but I'm just as happy spending a week isolated in the forest trying to get a structural model running. \n\nThe world of finance facinates me, as the place where some of the most elegant mathematics meets with the messy world of human behaviour and politics. I love building bridges between man and math, making mathematical and technical topics accessible to more general audiences, and trying to express the peculiarities of individuals and society in mathematical form.\n\nWith boundless and contagious enthusiasm I dive into the many topics, projects and ideas that cross my path. My interests range broadly and through many niches of the natural, social and theoretical. I love an international enviroment, and have thoroughly travelled through Europe to taste the many cultures our continent has to offer.\n\nMy favourite computer language is Julia, but I also have experience in R, Python, MatLab, STATA, and a little bit of Java. My main programming expertises revolve around efficiently running large-scale numerical optimisation and approximation, ideally with quasi-Monte Carlo methods and quadratures. I am interested in AI and machine learning, especially the mathematical back-end, as a black box ceases to be black when one opens it and turns on the light.\n\nMy leadership style focusses on enabling and empowering, unlocking human potential by challenging rather than ordering, with attention to the varying personal styles and sources of intrinsic motivation within a team. I believe in lifelong learning, and tend to frame any task as an opportunity for personal development.",

My research focuses on the interaction between economic inequality and asset prices within the macrofinancial framework of the CCAPM. As inequality tends to drop out of models with closed-form solutions, I use numerical optimisation/approximation and large simulations for estimating structural parameters, and spend my time optimising for runtime on a high-performance computing cluster.

Ended in a political victory, with the minister of education terminating the experiment.",
