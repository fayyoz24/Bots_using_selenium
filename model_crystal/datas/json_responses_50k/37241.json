    "summary": "At this moment Auke combines two very interesting and complementary positions:\n\nAs secretary of the Examining Board Social Sciences at Wageningen University Auke is primarily responsible for chair group visits undertaken to safeguard and improve reliability, validity, transparency and practicality of education assessment.\n\nAs lecturer in responsible innovation and the ethics of technology at the Knowledge, Technology and Innovation (KTI) group at Wageningen University Auke specialises in teaching critical reflection and ethics to students from the engineering, life and social sciences. he is also PhD coordinator for KTI, and responsible for organising PhD skills training sessions.\n\nAuke\u2019s overarching research field is the organisation of responsibility in socio-technical systems. Specifically, his research interests include:\n\u2022\tResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and how it can be institutionalised. Auke has developed this topic in the context of the Horizon 2020 project RRI Practice, investigating Wageningen University & Research as a case study;\n\u2022\tInnovation models for economic paradigms not oriented at sustained growth; \n\u2022\tThe responsibility of technology and engineers for eliciting human behaviour. Auke has developed this topic in his PhD research;\n\u2022\tResponsibility in energy systems and energy transitions, particularly in the global South. Auke has developed this topic in NWO MVI projects on biofuel production in Tanzania, and on developing and implementing smart grids in India.\n\nHis publications can be accessed at his Academia.edu site at https://wur.academia.edu/AukePols.",

Its conclusions:\n\u2022A broader conceptualisation of the values of well-being and sustainability is needed to arrive at a better governance of biofuels; \n\u2022The effects of producing two kinds of biofuels in Tanzania and India were found to be mainly negative;\n\u2022Irreversible negative impacts on local ecosystems and livelihood resources make sustainable long-term and large-scale production impossible;\n\u2022Nevertheless, questionable biofuel projects often continue because of vested interests;\n\u2022EU policies on sustainability certification do not fit rural contexts in the South well and often lead to more poverty.",
