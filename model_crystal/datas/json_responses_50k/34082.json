    "summary": "I am a marketing and sales manager at BE FRUIT Colombia, a leading producer and distributor of 100% natural dried fruits in South America. I have over eight years of experience in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, where I have developed and demonstrated my skills in customer relationship management (CRM), market research, and new business opportunities. I also hold an MSc in Entrepreneurship from the University of Amsterdam and VU Amsterdam, which has enhanced my passion for trading and innovation.\n\nIn my current role, I oversee all aspects of logistics, from the acquisition, transportation, and delivery of products across the region, to the quality control and customer service. I also analyze complex market scenarios and identify new market and diversification opportunities, and implement effective sales plans and strategies to grow the business. Additionally, I collaborate with other managers and key employees in purchasing and merchandising, and contribute to the creation of new venture opportunities. I am driven to succeed and help start-ups in Colombia and the Netherlands since July 2020.",
