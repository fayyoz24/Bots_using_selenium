My passion for different cultures and enthusiastic spirit brought me all over the world. I did a research in Malawi and started my own business in Kenya to support a group of local Masai women. \n\nAs an anthropologist, I bring another perspective to the table. I easily connect with others and I help people to look at situations differently.\n\nMy aim is to inspire people and companies to stay successful in a rapidly changing world.",
