    "summary": "I am an expert in communication, strategy and creativity. In other words: I am a creative strategist. I develop creative and strategic methods which guarantee the development of a powerful but above all a clear and sincere brand identity wich will last for a long time. \n\nAn identity which \u2013 just as an individual peronality - will develop but also stays close to it\u2019s origin. This is essential for organizations who want to move forward and above all be pure and reliable to their customers. \n\nIn my opinion everything is continually on the move. This requires direction and destination in order to create constructive change. The norm is to stand out and offer solutions. Seeing opportunities that others do not, or creating chances for others and anticipating on new developments. \n\nI want to create a bridge between transmitter and receiver, communication is therefore essential.",
