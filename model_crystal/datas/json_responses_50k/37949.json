Speaking regularly in front of a group helps you calm your nerves and communicate effectively.\n\n3- \u201cPractice\u201d Presentations for Other Audiences\nEveryone has different motivations for wanting to speak better. Maybe you want to hone your presentation skills for your career. Perhaps you want to be able to speak out in your volunteer organization. Maybe you want to complement your portfolio as an author, manager, or other professional with speaking gigs? Whatever the case, Toastmasters is a wonderful laboratory for you to practice your presentations and gain valuable feedback.\n\n4- Gain the Confidence and Courage to Lead\nLeadership and communication skills are intimately bound. Some might argue that leadership is nothing more than the ability to effectively communicate a vision. As your communication skills improve, your ability to lead will improve as well.",
