    "summary": "For eight years I have been involved in transit-oriented development, albeit in different roles. I have worked in the real estate department of Dutch Railways (NS) from which I have learnt to look from the perspective of a railway company to the development of station areas. Throughout my years at Movares, a railway engineering company, I developed technical knowledge related to the construction of railways and stations. One of my tasks was to make the technical reports produced by my colleagues understandable for our clients, usually local governments. In my current role as policy advisor for a regional government I advise our commissioner for town planning regarding the role he should/could take regarding the implementation of TOD in the province of North Holland. A common theme throughout my career has been my PhD-research which focused on the driving factors behind station area development projects in Tokyo and their (possible) implementation in the Randstad (urbanized area in the western part of the Netherlands comprising the four largest cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht). Some of the interesting elements identified in this research I have actually managed to implement in my current job of which I am quite proud of! \n\n\n",

In this role I try to put the lessons identified in my PhD-research into practice. A specific outcome of this is that the province has embraced the corridor as a logical unit for coordinating land use and transport developments at the regional level and has recognized that for such coordination to succeed a more guiding role of the province is needed. The first railway section for which a corridor strategy will be drafted and implemented is the Zaancorridor.\nCurrently I am involved in preparing an implementation agreement for the Zaancorridor (the railway section between Amsterdam central station and Heerhugowaard station). This agreement should make clear how developments are going to be prioritised and how functional programmes are going to be distributed along the railway corridor. For this the province works closely with the railway sector, the city-region and the local municipalities involved.",
