    "summary": "Always been employed in multinational and multi-cultural organizations, in Italy and abroad, I have acquired experience in sales, planning and estimating. I do offer an engineering background with a keen interest in the development of new business, supported by an MBA and a personal entrepreneurial attitude.\n\nAs part of the newly defined Smart Power Vehicle division, within the organization of Yamaha Motor Europe, entirely dedicated to ultra-personal e-mobility solutions, I am taking full responsibility over the YAMAHA PAS e-kits for e-bicycles. In charge of the sales activities, I do bridge the needs of YAMAHA\u2019s European customers with the engineering functions and production in Asia and Japan.\n\nAlways attentive to scouting new tech and market trends.\n\nIn the initial 5 years of my adventure in Netherlands, starting from a fairly \u201cgreen field\u201d, I have consolidated the product management of Yamaha B2B vehicles in Europe, re-organizing the line-up and introducing new models (Tracer 900 Police, Tracer 700 Police and the City Police kit for three-wheel scooter Tricity), besides the flagship FJR 1300. Several collateral activities have been put in place (ISO9001:2015, a Local Modification Committee and a Security Trade Control process) to increase efficiency of the daily job and strengthen YAMAHA\u2019s position in the market.\nAs \"B2B and New Business department\" manager, in the last 2 years, together with the introduction of further resources, we expanded the scope of the business to the e-mobility industry for professionals and B2B users.\nPreviously, as a Cost Engineer (motorcycle & scooter), I have led cost management activities for almost 10 projects, including new chassis platform, and have implemented a shared database with purchasing dept. for univocal target setting.\n\nWhen I worked as a Sales Engineer at Siemens, my main tasks were to design layout, calculate performance and cost and prepare comprehensive offers for sortation systems, sold all over the world; acting as Project Manager support too.\n\nI always enjoy travelling and working with people of different operative backgrounds as much as interacting with top notch management.\nHigh level skills in presentation, both in Italian and in English, even in front of high skilled auditors. Context sensitivity as adaptation on the specific needs for each country.",
