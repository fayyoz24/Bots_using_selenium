    "summary": "Experienced marketing strategist, with a strong background in digital, data & analytics and project management. I focus on developing, implementing and evaluating data-driven marketing strategies. An essential part of my way of working, is to (let) use (customer) data in order to improve the knowledge of your customers, the effectiveness of marketing strategies and to make customer communication als personal and relevant as possible. \n\nWhile working in teams, I\u2019ve figured as a \u2018translator\u2019 and connector between data and business and bring along knowledge and interpretation of data (analysis) to ensure data is not standalone but rather used on a daily basis, as a guide in how and where to improve your marketing and communications. I am analytical educated, however rather intuitive while working with people. I get enthusiastic about onboarding and coaching people to work more data-driven.\n\nMoreover, I've gained experience as a (marketing) project manager responsible for various online & offline marketing strategies and campaigns, (de)briefing partners and managing internal and external stakeholders to achieve results we were all enthusiastic about. I can guide projects strategically but am also able to work hands-on if needed.\n\nIn short, what I am passionate about:\n\u300bDeveloping and implementing marketing strategies to achieve your team and company goals\n\u300bDeveloping communication frameworks and implementing e-mail strategies with the customers' journey in mind. How can we make communication as relevant and personal as possible by using data?\n\u300bGuidance of companies and employees to work more data-driven, and the behavioral change that comes along\n\n\u2028Curious to get to know me, what I can bring in or how I might help you? Feel free to reach out!\n\u2709\ufe0f : hi@marlourozeboom.nl",
