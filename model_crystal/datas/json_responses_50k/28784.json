In collaboration with Rikkert Koppes we are creating a platform that allows for a better experience in horse riding competitions for everyone involved. The goal is that people have to invest less time in the preparation  of events and have more time to enjoy the actual event. This starts with the volunteers spending less time organising the event. The judging is done electronically so no manual entry is required during or after the event. The riders and the audience can see the line-up with the times (and scoring) appear on screens during the event. This gives instant feedback to everyone present answering questions like \"When do I start?\".\nThe value I add to this project is both a technical and practical insight in the product from a customers perspective. Also advising on marketing strategy to grow the project in the market.",

The customers ranged from internal to large corporate customers. \nI monitored the expectations of both IT and the customers constantly to ensure the right thing was build at the right time and at the right cost. Communication plays a key role to achieve this. Key is also to make sure that both the customer and IT have the same functional understanding of what the application will do. Converting a business process into technical requirements and vice versa is one of the most challenging aspects of IT project management but also the most important. This specific part of managing IT projects is where my biggest strength lies. Coming from a background of working in a variety of business oriented jobs and having done a technical study it is something that comes naturally to me.\nOnce a project was delivered to the customer I also followed-up with the customer to make sure everything works as expected and if there were any additions or changes that they would like to have. For these activities, I worked closely with Account and Sales Management.",

During this 6 month period I also worked on both webdesign and development projects for Third Floor Design. \nThe outcome of my thesis was that indeed it's more successful to request then it is to offer when it comes to services. A good example of a company that successfully applied this theory is www.werkspot.nl.",
