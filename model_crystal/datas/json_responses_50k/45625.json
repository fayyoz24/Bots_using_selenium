    "summary": "As an electrical Engineer I enjoy working in technological research and development. My focus is on designing and improving physical models to find the best fitting solution for a technical problem through modelling, designing and tweaking parameters. Enjoys working with technology that involves interdisciplinary expertise, I have developed experience on sensors, microfabrication, fluid physics. quantum mechanics, acoustics and robotics. Next to mechanical and electronical technology my work has thus also involved other sciences like physics and chemistry.",
