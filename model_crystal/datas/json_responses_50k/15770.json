This organisation, being the first global application support organisation in Shell, is a partnership of EP, SITI and Accenture.\n\n** March 2004 \u2013 March 2005    SNEPCO, Lagos\nSAP project manager\nThe SAP implementation project was kicked off in April 2004 with a planned go-live date of 3 January 2005. The project team comprises on average 30 resources (BP SAP consultants, business staff and data conversion resources). Total budget: 7.7 Million USD. A recent QA review has shown that the project is on track and, subject to the timely resolution of a number of known issues, the go-live date is considered sound.  Throughout the project, extensive attention has been given to change management covering all layers of the organization.\n\n** April 2005 \u2013  March 2007    SENV/Bapetco-  Cairo\n SAP project manager / SAP support manager\nThe SAP project kicked-off  April 2006. With an original planned go-live date of Jan 2006, due to the delayed start and resourcing, the final go-live date was set 3 April 2006. While the project was considered one single project, the distinct differences between both companies did result in substantial different approaches and efforts in support of all key activities of a SAP deployment project.  After the go-live date of April 2006, both companies did celebrate successfully month-end closings and able to continue their respective business activities with only limited negative impact of the SAP supported business processes .\n\nThis project made it the largest SAP deployment in E&P oil business",
