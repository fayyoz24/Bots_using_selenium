    "summary": "In 1967 I began my career as a voluntary community worker in a huge neighborhood in decline in The Hague, the Netherlands. In 1978 I moved to the southern region of Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen and continued my social engagement by organizing care users and implementing action- and system research to improve the modestly equipped regional health care services. I combined these activities with my studies: social work, sociology, and management of non profit organizations. In 1983 I started my professional career as a part-time researcher at the Catholic (now Radbout) University in Nijmegen. I continued my career as a full-time executive with educational and developmental tasks, later director, of a regional community development institute (WONN) in Drachten. From 1992 untill 2016 I was senior lecturer at Social Work studies of NHLStenden University of Applied Sciences in Leeuwarden. In addition to that I hold a parttime position as a senior lecturer at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland, from 2002-2005. Today I am still active on a personal base in The Netherlands and abroad with education, research & development, publishing books & articles (see further) and making films (see 'Blok Social Video Works' on YouTube).",

I developed and managed the Minor International Social Work at NHL University (from 2011), including the international Joint E-Project for social work students with Canada (pilot in 2010), and after 2011 with Ireland and Switzerland. I was actively involved in modernization of Social Work & Local Social Policy in Poland from 1992-2008. First as coordinating lecturer in the Tempus Poznan Project (1992-1995), after that as initiator, developer & manager of the Matra COP Project (1998-2001) and the Matra SIC! Project (2003-2007) (see the project section), and as senior lecturer at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan (2003-2005). From 2010-2016 I initiated and organized the 'Annual International Conferences on Social Work and Social Work Education' in Leeuwarden (The Netherlands). In 2016 I was one of the initiators /establishers of the Dutch-Flemish Network of the Capability Approach in the Social Domain (CA-SD) (see the\"Projects\" section).  Since 1968 I write books, articles, reports etc. in Dutch and English language (see the list of my publications).
