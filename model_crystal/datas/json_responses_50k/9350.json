Absence from work is mainly caused by non-medical factors such as lack of competence, conflicts at work or problems at home. \n\nDirect supervisors are in the best position to understand the circumstances surrounding an individual's absence and to notice a problem at an early stage. Therefore their active involvement in the company's absence procedures is essential to the overall effectiveness and future success aof an absence policy of program.\nDirect supervisors have to carry out the often unpopular task of identifying, confronting and resolving absence issues. To be successful they should be trained in their responsibility about managing absenteeism, advised on how to conduct effective return -to-work interviews and educated in the use of disciplinary procedures when necessary.   \n\nARUTA is able to create synergy in the collaboration with companies that are willing to invest in strengthening the capacities of organizational leadership to manage absenteeism by influencing  non-medical factors that contribute to absenteeism in a positive way. \n\nIf managers are able to control absenteeism due to non medical reasons, the Occupational Health Physician has more time to focus on absenteeism due to sickness and to foster sustainable employability of the work force through preventive health research, analysis of absenteeism and advise on strengthening health policy development.",
