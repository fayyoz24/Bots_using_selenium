Cardiovascular diseases, COPD and lung cancer are expected to cause most deaths by 2050 in the western world. Early treatment could delay or stop progression  of these diseases and allow therapy at a treatable stage. The introduction of a screening method can provide us the opportunity to detect these disease while still in an early stage. Ultra-low-dose CT techniques allow us the ability to assess the biomarkers. However, screening would burden the workload of radiologists even further. Therefore, it would be useful if we could automate some of the detection of the biomarkers. \nThe NELCIN-B3 study is aimed at finding a one-stop-shop screening solution for the three diseases. My part will be creating a method for automated detection of cardiovascular diseases. I am developing a neural network which would be able to quantify the biomarkers of these diseases. Current biomarkers include the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries and epicardial fat, but I am still searching for other biomarkers which can be acquired from low dose CT data and have a predictive value on cardiovascular diseases. \nFurthermore, I am looking into techniques for quality enhancement of the low dose CT data. I am currently looking into different image reconstruction methods, image enhancement and other post-processing tools. If we could use low resolution data and process it so it becomes a higher resolution, we can use this to reduce the dose even further.",

This was done in Matlab by using the FMRIB's Software Library. The next step was testing this pipeline and using it on a database of brainscans of patients. Another part of this internship was verifying and calibrating the ASL method. The pipeline I created was used as a basis for further development of the method and the rest of the study. \n\nNext to my research, I worked as a clinical intern in the department of geriatrics and assisted with patient tests.

Here I worked to adapt the CIVET automated processing pipeline for use in infants under 2 years of age. Adapting the pipeline meant converting and adjusting tissue masks, threshold values and similar variables. It also meant that I had to do a lot of quality control and testing of the pipeline. This meant I had to learn how the pipeline worked in a relatively short time. During this internship, I expanded my knowledge of various programming languages and learned more about neuroimaging and processing pipelines.",

I was asked to create a program that could be used to measure the velocity of blood in the brains of mice. By using a high-speed camera, we could track the movement of the red blood cells in the vessels. By creating line scan images, we could use a radon transform to calculate the velocity of blood in the vessels. I then created a graphical user interface in matlab for easier use of this method. This program was used for further study of blood velocity in the brain vessels of mice and the effects of neurovascular coupling.",

To evaluate if mesenchymal stem cells could be used to quicken the recovery process of clavicular fractures, I was asked to study the growth of mesenchymal stem cells and see if they could differentate into osteoblasts and osteocytes. I used tissue acquired during clavicular repair surgery to study the cells. The samples were cultured in our lab and the cells were dyed and fixated after a different number of days. The number of cells could then be measured by a fluorescence reader. During my internship, I learned how to work in a sterile lab and learned to culture stem cells.",
