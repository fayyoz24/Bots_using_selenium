Currently YIP is active in Colombia, Malawi and South Africa. Within each country, a local and independent organization coordinates and implements YiP projects that consist of a reintegration program in prison in which self development is encouraged through creativity and self expression. This is done in cooperation with the communities, the local youth who act as role models and the children themselves. Under the name YiPART, YIP organises various artistic events and benefits in order to raise funds for our projects. \n"
