The program is still running.\n\nI designed the pre-incubation program with the following purposes: get students informed and inspired by specialists from the field; get students activated by connecting them with experts that can directly help them with their startup topics; building an entrepreneurial ecosystem around Base. This will lead to actual startup founding activity.\n\nThe program I designed goes from creating an idea, to customer testing, to startup (legal) basics, to an activation phase with business plan writing, understanding and approaching funding options and the target to actual start (and register) the startup. This is a process of 5 months with weekly meetings (every week another topic, with another external expert), networking and coaching/mentoring and experts sessions.\n\nMore info at http://www.mc4e.nl/launchbase/pre-incubation/",

I started it alone, with private tutoring for high school students and private lessons in multiple areas.\n\nBecause with Studiebegeleider.nl I was one of the first using Google Adwords campaigns (in 2004-2005) in this business area, the number of prospects grew and I hired freelance tutors to expand the business. In 2008 we served a stable customer base of ~40 students with a team of 6 freelancers. \nI started to shift my attention to adult education, e.g. by providing an \"Effective Dutch\"-course I developed.\n\nI ended my involvement in this company to be able to fully focus on my next startup Salusion.\n\nNew skills:\n\u2714 Startup entrepreneurship;\n\u2714 Google Adwords campaigns;\n\u2714 Employee selection;\n\u2714 Business development.",
