    "summary": "Welcome to my profile.\n\nI am a enthousiastic and skilled Product Owner/Project manager with experience of many years in various environments. Since 2012 I have been working in the Microsoft environment as a Project manager and Scrummaster. During that period  I expanded my skills with the certification for Microsoft Development Engineer. From 2018 I am the Product Owner for the DevOps team, discussing changes and lifecycle management with the business contacts for about 12 applications owned by Tribes all over the ING organization.  \n\nMy IT career started as a traditional path: from development growing to the roles of requirements analyst to projectmanagement and teammanagement. \nAs an IT Project manager I managed software development projecten in various environments. \nI specialized in change management and process improvement in the IT domain: Software Process Improvement (SPI) with CMMi, implemenation of Prince-2 for projectmanagement and ITIL for Service Management. \nIn 2011 I had a directing role in the introduction of Agile/Scrum in the ING Channels domain. At first the transition of two existing project teams to Scrum teams and next the initiation of a new Scrum team in in a new technical environment, MicrosoftDynamics.\nSinds 2012 I have been working in the Microsoft SharePoint/.NET/SQL-BI environment as a Project Manager, Scrummaster and Development Engineer. In 2018 I took over the Product Owner role for the team. \nI like the Product Owner role and have the ambition to expand my Product Owner experience in other environments.\n\nIf you are interested in my knowledge and skills, then do not hesitate to contact me.\n __________________________________\nContact info Wijke Stoker:\n\u260e 06-270 34 524\n\u2709 wijke.stoker@upcmail.nl\n__________________________________\n",
