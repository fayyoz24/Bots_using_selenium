    "summary": "In the last 16 year I have committed to developing people's full potential in an organisational setting to achieve sustainable growth and bring back the energy to a workspace.\n\nWhy?\nI have learnt how identifying and working from the natural contribution of people while developing inspiring, diverse and generative environments is the basis to sustainable organisational growth.\n\nSo, forget about spilling time and energy because of lack of engagement, proactivity and unclear leadership. -> Develop engagement, learn and train people and teams to understand result areas and to collaborate optimally with their peers.\n\nDiscover how to allocate people in your organisation. Everyone normally starts a job with the best intentions, still you often perceive frustration when people don't know how they can contribute to growth. \n \nDon't have your organisation freeze like a rabbit caught in the headlights. \n\n-> You can quickly learn about each person's strengths and set up successful teams that overcome diverse challenges.\n-> Become an expert on how organisations can adapt to their competitive environments and build an engine for innovation.\n-> Take decisions based on scientifically valid assessments that connect people to strategy execution and boost your organisation's immune system. \n\nWith a pragmatic and analytical approach I will help you take on new human challenges.",
