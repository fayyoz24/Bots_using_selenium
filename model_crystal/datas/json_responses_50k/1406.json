My task as a relationship manager is to develop and maintain the relationship with stakeholders of the Wadden Sea and the Lemmer-Delfzijl main waterway in the province of Groningen. \n\nThe Wadden Sea is the largest tidal flats system in the world, where natural processes proceed largely undisturbed. It extends roughly 500km along the coasts of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. For its globally unique geological and ecological values the Wadden Sea is listed by UNESCO as World Heritage. Nowhere else in the world is there such a dynamic landscape with a multitude of habitats, shaped by wind and tides. Global biodiversity is reliant on the Wadden Sea. \n\nThe Lemmer-Delfzijl main waterway is 118 kilometres long and is one of the most important waterways in The Netherlands and an important driver of the economy in the Northern part of the country. The main waterway consists of 3 canals: the Prinses Margriet Canal, the van Starkenborgh Canal and the Eems Canal. The waterway makes the Northern provinces of Groningen and Friesland accessible to commercial inland shipping. In addition, it connects Northern Germany with the globally important ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam.",

Unfortunately, the drowning rate in New Zealand is relatively high due to a combination of factors. To address this issue, the non-governmental water safety sector and the New Zealand government have joined forces in a water safety working group. \nSport New Zealand is the government home of water safety policy in New Zealand and together with other stakeholders, such as NZSAR, Water Safety New Zealand, Coastguard New Zealand, Maritime New Zealand and Surf Life Saving New Zealand we were developing policy aimed at reducing the number of drowning incidents and ensuring frontline rescue capability.",
