    "summary": "(Will think about this later, this was me from 2014. Will add lessons learned from the past 7years)\n\nThey say that the car a person drives tells you something about his personality. If I had to choose I would drive a Landrover or some other form of all-terrain vehicle. My car needs to be dependable, always working, easy to fix, and have off road capabilities. \n\nI have explored every corner of student life. I have been active several committees in both my study and student association. I have been on a six month internship in Japan. I was fortunate enough to present our iGEM project to a group of 1500 scientists at the world finals at MIT in Bosten in 2009. Throughout my student life I maintained my hobbies as a boyscout leader and I practice and teach Pencak Silat, an Indonesian martial art.\n \nThis has made me a person that is not afraid to step away from his comfort zone and would prefer to work in an interdisciplinary team.\n\nI would like to work in a company that delivers products that define the boundary of what is technologically possible. I want to contribute in extending these boundaries. Although I gained a lot of R&D experience during my study period I see the limitations of what one individual can accomplish, therefore I would like to grow towards product development, product engineering, or process engineering. This does not mean I would not want to start with an R&D job, but I would like to grow to a position where I coordinate the individual efforts of a group of experts to realize a larger vision.\n\nAny company that builds and develops high tech equipment has my interest, but I have a slight preference for a job in the biomedical sector. What I lack in biomedical knowledge compared to a biomedical student I compensate with a more extensive knowledge of mathematics and signal processing. Furthermore, I worked with a TEM  on a daily basis for half a year during my time in Japan; thus material analyses is one of my strong points. I hope to apply these skills in research of how medical equipment interacts with the human body over time.",

The goal is for a group of students from various backgrounds to create their own engineered organism using 'parts' called biobricks. The overall goal is to create and specify more and more biobricks to build a toolbox of genetic peaces of code, which can be used to build organisms with any desired properties. The organisms and biobricks are presented and dealt with as if they where machines and parts. Our team consisted of 11 people, we build a bacteria that could filter Arsenic from water and then create gas bubbles to float to the surface. Scooping up the film of bacteria from the surface could theoretically purify the water from Arsenic. My job was to characterize the parts using a mathematical model to describe the system and use the data provided to us by the wet-workers. I was selected in our group to present our project to the outside world. We went to MIT in Boston and reached the finals, where I presented our project for an audience of 1500 scientists from across the globe.",

Apart from isothermal experiments, laser induced crystallization was briefly investigated. \n\nMy internship took place at the UHVEM at Osaka University where the crystallization due to electron irradiation was investigated using TEM.",
