    "summary": "With a career in both software developer and integration engineer roles, as well as a broad technical background, I can be deployed in a multitude of activities in the solution lifecycle.\nAs a software developer I am responsible for the technical solution. Activities include input to feasibility phase, detailed design, development of software components, and testing. As well as coordination tasks and support to design teams.\nAs an integration engineer I am responsible for the deployment of a technical solution in the customer environment. This involves low level design, deployment and configuration of infrastructure and software components, integration towards customer endpoints, customizations (such as scripting), verification and acceptance test. My work is internationally oriented and required worldwide travel to engage in complex projects. As an on-site integrator I am the main point of contact for the local organization or customer, the home organization, and the design and support organizations.\nThe diversity of projects enables me to study new technologies, and then apply this into documented procedures and knowledge transfer to my colleagues. The last years I have been active as frontrunner for a technology shift towards public cloud and containerized solutions. My main strengths are my analytical and troubleshooting skills, and a strong technical background enabling me to be deployed in a wide range of demanding situations. My drive is to maintain a high standard of quality and be result oriented.",

The service is Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) based and is deployed on an Ericsson clustered virtualized application server. Main challenges of this project are the handling of complex subscriber call flows and changes to the interfaces to external nodes using protocols like SOAP, SIGTRAN, various protocols to interact with charging nodes (AIR nodes, Voucher Server, MINSAT nodes), MSCML for control of the MRF announcement function, and SIP to integrate with the S-CSCF node and core network. My background in design allows me to work on a complex design project while my background in integration allows me to, for example, improve installation procedures and configuration documentation.",
