    "summary": "Data driven researcher studying how people deal with risky decisions. \n\nI develop laboratory risk tasks as to characterise individuals\u2019 willingness to take on risk and predict which decisions they are likely to make in real-life. My approach is the use of a diverse set of experimental methodologies as I am trained to collect and analyse data from laboratory, field and neuroimaging experiments. I apply experimental findings to relevant societal dilemmas as to shape and inform public policy.\n\nApart from academia, I have held numerous board positions at different associations as I like to organize and engage with a wide variety of people. \n\nLast, but definitely not least, I am very active in long distance running and road cycling. This keeps me going strong and balanced!",
