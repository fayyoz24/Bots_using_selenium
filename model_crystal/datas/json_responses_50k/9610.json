                    "description": "As a dynamic intern at the Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries, I supported the development of new CBI projects in so-called Sprint weeks. This involved interviews with internal and external stakeholders in, for example, the IT Outsourcing sector in Morocco or the shea butter sector in Nigeria, brainstorming, and designing a business case for the project. Outside of these sprint weeks, I undertook preparatory research for other projects, such as the obstacles that women entrepreneurs in Kenya encounter when attempting to grow their businesses and export to the European market. Finally, I supported the first Monitoring and Evaluation round of 2021, where all 35 CBI projects are evaluated on their results and progress on different sustainability goals.",
