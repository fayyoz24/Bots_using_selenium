Applying Financial and Supply Chain and Operations Management knowledge, I was able to recommend the firm possible and achievable solutions.\n\nI achieved the best overall result in my class. 8,7 for the final report and 9,0 for the defence.\n\nFortunately, I was able to cooperate with the company and work together. Hopefully, we will be able to work together again in the near future!",

I worked during the weekdays for 6 hours, that helped me to adapt to the working environment at this young age.\nLater on, I was able to test my knowledge about my interests at the office with new colleagues.\n\nIn 2016 I moved to Budapest, where I attended an International Business programme at Budapest Gazdas\u00e1gi Egyetem. During this year, I was able to help the company at its Budapest office with everyday tasks, such as customer service, customer relations and warehouse operations. This position was able to show me, that customer service is not only important, but will help to keep and expand the business further.",
