From the BBC in London to Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam with stopovers in Los Angeles, NYC or France, I\u2019ve learned to skilfully merge all my experiences into the infinite possibilities that PR & Comms provide to communicate and engage with people via text, video and still image.\n\nMore info \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc www.marcuervo.com",
