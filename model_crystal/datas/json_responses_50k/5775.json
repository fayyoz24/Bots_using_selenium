    "summary": "In my childhood, driven to help people and serve society, I dreamed to become a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. Later, I realized that the chances for my childhood wish coming true weren't high, as in the grown-up world becoming a goodwill ambassador was an honor of only very famous people. However, that very wish formed my view of the world and society. I have been determined with my work to contribute to society's development. This I tried to accomplish by approaching from the media and communications sphere. I chose journalism which gave me an opportunity to serve people by reporting issues of different groups of society. During my seven-year career, I was mostly focused on covering social spheres such as healthcare, minority issues, poaching, and education. It was particularly rewarding to witness my articles leading to positive changes in the covered issues. \n\nI am an experienced multilingual journalist, currently active in company branding and communication management. I have a strong academic background (two Master's degrees in media and communications management and media research).\n\nMy expertise includes:\n\n- Communications\n- Social media management and analysis\n- Storytelling and Editing\n- Company branding\n- Company newsletter management\n- Coaching and guiding interns\n\nI enjoy communicating with diverse people, I love exploring new places and cultures through traveling and hiking, and I love getting food for thought from the art house movies. \n\nMotivated by one of my favourite quotes by William G.T. Shedd \"A ship is safe in harbour, but that's not what ships are for\", I'm continually trying to make choices that put me against my own comfort zone.",

The Bambi Belt Solution replaces adhesive electrodes, used nowadays for monitoring and causing pain and stress to babies. With non-intrusive Bambi-Belt Solution babies will feel less pain and stress. Moreover, the belt will provide an opportunity for Kangaroo Mother Care, because it is wireless. This, as a result, will increase mother-child bonding and will facilitate the baby's brain development.\n\nI am helping the company with communication and marketing. I am excited to be part of the Bambi Medical team as I believe that the Bambi-Belt Solution will serve society by improving and making babies' lives happier from day one.",

With this device, the company aims to heal chronic wounds and decrease the risk of amputation, thereby increasing quality of life for patients. \n\nQuick and painless solution Plasoma consists of an electronic pad that creates a cold plasma in the wound and a pulse that sends the electric current to the pad. When applied to the wound the cold plasma kills the bacteria and stimulates healing. \n\nHappy to help with communication with this amazing start-up with great purpose!",
