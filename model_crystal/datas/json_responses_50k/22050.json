He travels at free will, feeling at ease and able to survive in every place his travels take him. From remote corners of the world until the beating heart of the big city. \"\n\n\"We make garments that can hold their high quality and distinctive look for more than one season. We work around tradition and classical shapes without looking back. The fabrics we pick are the first lines to set out before starting with any collection. \n\nThis collection works around structured Japanese woollens. Cotton that has been developed in an Kimono-fabric specialised factory, used for shirting, and sharp suiting. All combined with Swedish sheepskin leather used for our handcrafted Lammy coat. The collection itself has been made by the hands of the tailors from Leads in England and Porto in Portugal.\"",

The participating company supports the evening that often ends up in an exuberant and cheerful party where all nationalities dance together on music from the different nationallities that are present. \n\nThe refugees are stationed within the surroundings of Amsterdam, among them are men, women and children. They fled from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Eritrea and other parts of the world. In most cases the refugees had to leave all their belongings behind and lost loved ones on their way. They are not in the position anymore to be engaged in the professions they used to have and they do not have that many chances to get in touch with the working population in Amsterdam. \n\nThis is why the Haven stichting started to organise the Haven diners in 2015 and will continue to do so with the help from an enthusiastic group of volunteers."
