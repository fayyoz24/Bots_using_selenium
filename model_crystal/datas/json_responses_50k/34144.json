    "summary": "I have 10 years of work experience and hold a Master degree in International Development Studies for the UvA. I am pursuing a career in a vibrant and socially responsible work environment. I have extensive experience in working in multicultural agencies, governmental institutions and international organizations and feel my previous employment roles have given me the necessary skills to plan and coordinate projects  related to international cooperation and sustainability, as well as qualitative and quantitative research skills to prepare briefs, reports and monitoring and evaluating projects' performance, both at national or international level.  I also have 10 years of proven experience coordinating international workshops and seminars, as well as ministerial summits in several locations, as well as events logistics (such as flights, accommodations, etc.) both in business and social  events.\nI am a motivated and enthusiastic person, who would thrive whilst working in a multicultural and flexible environment. I am a very good negotiator and coordinator and I possess a strong leadership, team building and communication skills. \n\nI also have experience teaching Spanish  as a second language, doing translations from English to Spanish and vice versa, Spanish proofreading and editing, tutoring, homework help to both adults and children and regularization classes for children and teenagers.
