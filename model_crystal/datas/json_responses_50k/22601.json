    "summary": "I am an accomplished Country Manager with a decade of experience working for a leading Italian ceramic tile manufacturer, Ceramiche Refin. With a proven track record of managing all aspects of the Dutch market and overseeing key accounts in the EMEA region, I developed highly skills in business development, sales management, public relations, with a strong focus on customer satisfaction.\nWith a proven ability to negotiate with individuals at all levels of an organization, I am well-prepared to lead and inspire others to succeed.\n\nI have achieved remarkable results during my tenure at Ceramiche Refin, including a 900% increase in the Dutch market turnover, forging unique partnerships with major clients operating in all EMEA region, and developing a new logistics system specifically for the Dutch market. \nI consider myself a persuasive communicator with a positive and energetic attitude, demonstrating loyalty, reliability, and enthusiasm in my professional endeavors.\n\nI am fluent in Italian, English, and Spanish, with working knowledge of Dutch and Portuguese. Although I studied German for nine years, it has become rusty due to a lack of practice. \n\nIn addition to my professional accomplishments, I have a strong passion for connecting people and fostering a sense of community. As a hobby, I founded the Amsterdam International Community (AIC), which has now grown to over 35,000 followers. AIC actively organizes social events, informative sessions, and shares helpful advice to aid expats in their integration in Amsterdam and enjoyment within the international community. This experience has further honed my communication and organizational skills, which I am eager to apply in my daily professional tasks",
