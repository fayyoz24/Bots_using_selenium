It fills a gap between current education and the labor market. In addition, it fits in well with students who find four years of higher professional education a difficult period to oversee. Because Associate degree-graduates can enroll in the third year of an affiliated four-year bachelor's degree, the choice of an Associate degree program can also be seen as risk management: 2 + 2 is also four!\n\nIn addition to setting up new Associate degree-courses, I have focused on the application of blended learning, the flexibilization and modernization of part-time education and the improvement of research skills.",
