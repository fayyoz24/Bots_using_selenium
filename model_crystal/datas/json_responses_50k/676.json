    "summary": "I am a designer with a strong interest in digital product development. Over the years, I've grown into a multi-faceted professional, combining my design expertise with technical skills.\n\nMy approach focuses on translating complex technical solutions into delightful user experiences. I specialise in rapid prototyping and product testing by using (event-based) data to inform decision-making and drive product innovation. My aim is to create solutions that cater to end-users and contribute to the success of the companies I collaborate with.\n\nMy skill set includes experience with various technologies, such as artificial intelligence, event-driven architectures, process mining, knowledge graphs, linked data (RDF/OWL), and many other web technology standards. I love working within diverse teams, where I can blend design principles with technical know-how to collaborate energetically and effectively.\n\nLooking for a professional that can navigate the intersection of design and technology? Let\u2019s connect and explore innovative solutions to meet your challenges.",

We are continuously surrounded by waves, but we never see them.\n\nUntil now! Because here, at the cradle of radio and television, sound waves are being visualized. Whistle, clap, talk, sing or scream and see the waves you produce yourself. Experience how waves travel through space and bounce off the walls. Discover how different tones also produce different waves.\n\nWAVES is a world premiere. The project is based on the sound imaging technology of Sorama, which is commercially available in the brand new 1024 microphone Sorama Cam. WAVES is a joint effort of a team of 9 students of OPENLIGHT: the creative lab of the Intelligent Lighting Institute of the TU Eindhoven, and a team of 15 sound experts and software developers of Sorama, a spin-off of the TU/e that is located at Strijp-S. The result is a unprecedented interactive lighting visualization.\n\nThis 6-week project I performed as part of the student team from OPENLIGHT at the TU/e. We were responsible for the conceptual development of this installation, as well as the design of the visual appearance, experience and the first version of the visualisation code used. \n\nThe installation was originally developed for the light spectacle 'GLOW-Next' in Eindhoven, but has since then been at multiple events among which the Dutch Design Week 2014 as part of the exhibition 'Mind the Step'.",

We believe educating a company's employees is a crucial part of sustainable innovation as most work surrounding IoT requires companies to change processes and perspectives internally. \n\nWithin Cindle my primary responsibilities were managing our internal collaborations, communication with customers, presenting and pitching, managing and planning projects and programming the IoT infrastructure for projects.",
