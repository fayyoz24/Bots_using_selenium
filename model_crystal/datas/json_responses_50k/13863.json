    "summary": "I am a Data Scientist with an academic background in Econometrics and Operation Research and 6 years of experience in using advanced analytics and machine learning methodologies to optimize business processes and reduce costs. My skill set covers supervised machine learning and time-series analyses. I currently work at IBM Northern Europe as a part of the Client Engineering organization.\n\nMy educational background at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Economics in Prague has been instrumental in helping me choose career areas to develop, but the part-time working experience while studying full-time during this period prepared me for a future professional career in a practical way to derive the focus fields.\n\nFor instance, my work at MSD IT Innovation center has taught me essential principles in setting up pipelines of a data science project, building trust in mathematical models, and creating performance monitoring applications to generate immediate impact, with the involvement of users in close cooperation with UX design.\n\nI chose Innovation and Digital transformation-oriented projects because I truly believe that making the best of rich historical data will produce unbiased predictions of the future and therefore optimization of decision making.\nI am passionate about innovation and I love challenging current state-of-art methodologies with new novel prediction methods, building on the top of statistical foundations.\n\nThese are my core competencies:\n\u2022\tTime Series Analysis\n\u2022\tForecasting\n\u2022\tSupervised Learning\n\u2022\tAnomaly detection\n\u2022\tStatistics\n\u2022\tMachine Learning\n\u2022\tOptimization\n\u2022\tCloud computing\n\u2022\tCode versioning",
