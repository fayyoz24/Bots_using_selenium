    "summary": "Always motivated by my love of learning, and becoming the best possible version of myself. My ideal work placement would help me boosting my knowledge in different fields and improving my leadership and problem solving skills. In addition to this, I am always prepared to get the most out of life, whether it is a big moment or a simple pleasure. Furthermore, growing up in a multi-cultural environment has allowed me to gain high cultural intelligence and a natural ability to acclimatise to different cultures with ease as I speak three languages (Italian, English and Arabic). All in all, I'm a creative person with a huge passion for life and learning.",
