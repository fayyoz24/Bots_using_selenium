                    "description": "As a TriFinance consultant, I joined Goudse Verzekeringen, where I worked on the GRIP project focused on establishing and enhancing the risk and control framework. Collaborating closely with the business, we implemented a new risk and control framework through interactive workshops.\n\nDuring these workshops, we assessed the risks associated with various departments and linked them to corresponding control measures. Based on these control measures, we established control testing for all key controls, enabling the business to evaluate their level of control.\n\nThroughout this project, we utilized Cerrix, a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tool, to streamline and enhance the efficiency of our processes. By leveraging Cerrix, we effectively managed and documented risk assessments, control measures, and control testing activities.\n\nOur efforts resulted in a well-structured risk and control framework that enabled Goudse Verzekeringen to enhance its risk management practices and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The successful implementation of the GRIP project strengthened the organization's ability to proactively identify and mitigate risks, providing a solid foundation for future growth and operational excellence.",

This implementation significantly enhanced safety protocols and mitigated potential risks.\n\nFurthermore, I successfully completed a project aimed at optimizing production processes by making production data more accessible and transparent. Through effective data visualization techniques, we provided actionable insights into production metrics, enabling informed decision-making and process improvements.\n\nMy experience at Karsscom not only allowed me to refine my PLC programming skills but also provided valuable exposure to project management and automation within the manufacturing industry.",
