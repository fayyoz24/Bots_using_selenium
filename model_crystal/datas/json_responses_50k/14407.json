    "summary": "\u2605The most important question in innovation is not whether the technology will work, but whether it matters?\u2605\n\nAs a tech enthusiast, I am deeply impressed every day by the creativity and genius of the solutions I come across. Although I do not know much about chemistry, and physics was not my strong suit in high school, I do understand a thing or two about business development and finance. And that is exactly the sweet spot I am in: helping clean tech innovators turn their great ideas into realistic and fundable business opportunities that have an impact on society. From May 2020, I started a new challenge as business development director NWE for Clariter. Clariter's revolutionary chemical upcycling technology ends the life of plastics by converting them into high-quality alyphatic solvents, mineral oils and paraffin waxes. \n\nOur unique process transforms more than 60% of all plastic waste types into 3 high-value industrial products: solvents, oils, and waxes. These go on to become more than 1000 everyday end products. Now, rather than using recycled plastic, we can all enjoy upcycled plastic-free products.\n\nTogether, we\u2019re pro-actively cleaning the planet of plastic waste, creating environment-friendly, fossil-free products, and empowering industry to meet sustainability regulations, reduce carbon footprint, create jobs, and build stronger communities.",

Within this project a combination of high-end robotics, software, online applications are being combined with the latest insights in business model development. A unique collaboration between farmers, technical suppliers, innovators, universities and governmental bodies will bring this project to reality. \n\nTogether with my team at ERAC I contributed to the design and development of this project. Based on the distress within the market combined with the latest technology and business model solutions we presented a turnkey project, which will tilt the balance.

By bringing together of separate developments, such as a vacuum toilet and an animal tracking system, a revolutionary innovation will be created that will improve the social climate in the stable considerably.\n\nLast year, a pig farmer, subcontractors, a construction company, a system innovator, various research institutes and high-tech companies along the project Big Developments developed. Frank Wind and Tjacko Sijpkens with their company Zero Gravity Movement, the directors of this process. Sijpkens: \"The involvement of all links in the chain from the base, we can develop an innovative concept for the sustainable keeping pigs.
