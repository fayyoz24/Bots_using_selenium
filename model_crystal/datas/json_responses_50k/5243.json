One of which was a huge Gala Dinner & Dance at which many local dignitaries were invited, and which I co-hosted (MC-ed) -- approx. 300 guests of various nationalities.\n\nSince having returned to the Netherlands I have always remained involved in various fundraising projects for the IWC-SL --regional as well as international ones --> Kikindia."
