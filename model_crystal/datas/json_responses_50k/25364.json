    "summary": "Ali Can is a physicist. During his MS studies, he undertook two technology projects and submitted them to the Minister of Science and Industry for support under the \"teknogirisim\" program aimed at young entrepreneurs.\n\nIn the first project, Ali utilized the NMR technique to excite the nucleus of a product. By observing the difference in relaxation time, he could determine the freshness of the product. Encouraged by the program's support, Ali Can embarked on his second project, establishing a technology company focused on the development of magnetic levitation systems. He prepared similar projects and applied to KOSGEB for financial support and an office space for his company. This enabled him to successfully develop and implement an original magnetic levitation system that can lift 10kg objects, a first in Turkey. \n\nSince the beginning of 2020, Ali has been working as a researcher at University of Duisburg-Essen, and planning to transfer to industry.",
