    "summary": "I am passionate with public policy, internationalization, influencing, corporate business development, diplomacy, new energies en hydrogen diplomacy. My aim is to stablish consolidated scientific, government, technological and business collaboration! This is what I want and where my strength lies. I grew up in Egypt, studied at an academic level in the Netherlands and work from Amsterdam for Dutch and international organizations. I am a global citizen who builds bridges between different stakeholders in the Netherlands, Europe and their desired counterparts in the region of the MENA region. I have an international let's do mindset and speak Arabic, Dutch, English and German fluently. Through my career I have developed strategic contacts within government and business and would like to utilize these networks and competencies to initiate, facilitate and achieve international cooperation projects.\nMy career is centred around three pillars:\n1- International relations & diplomacy. At Clingendael I developed and led tenth of projects and trained hundreds of civil servants in the field of public administration, international relations and diplomatic skills. I integrate much of my academic knowledge and expertise gained at Clingendael into my current consultancy work for the UNDP.\n- Corporate business development concerning new and sustainable energies, energy transition and hydrogen diplomacy. I bring Dutch businesses and other energy stakeholders into contact with parties from the Middle East and North Africa. The aim is to jointly find solutions to the climate crisis through conferences, working visits, steering groups, professional exchanges and the initiation and realization of concrete win-win collaboration projects.\n- Distinguished expertise with regard to public policy. I co-authored the book: Homegrown Warriors, Radical and Democratic Muslims in the Netherlands (2006).\n\nAs a person I am realistic, result-oriented, diplomatic, empathetic and analytical. My calm demeanour means that I quickly gain people's trust. I am a social person and get a lot of energy from working in and with teams, innovating together and setting a strategic course. My goal is to make entrepreneurs, civil servants, and colleagues aware of the growth opportunities and possibilities that emerging economies offer. I currently look for ambitious companies, ports, government organizations and knowledge institutes that are committed to the energy transition and hydrogen and are eager to establishing strategic alliances both in the Netherlands and in the MENA region.",
