At that moment I was training internally at a boxing gym for a period of 2 weeks. During Christmas morning 2019 we were about to evacuate from this property. After the storm laid down the whole gym was destroyed.\n\nAfter this disaster, I offered my help to start a crowdfund for rebuilding the gym and make it even better. My role was to provide information, advice on content creation, advice on communicating, creating the platform and copywriting. In the end it was a very succesful project."
