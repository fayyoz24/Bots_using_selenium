    "summary": "I am a driven and versatile professional with a passion for innovation and business development. I enjoy challenges and coming up with creative and innovative solutions. I am trained in solving complex, interdisciplinary problems with large stakeholder networks. I thoroughly enjoy leading and being part of a team in a variety of social and cultural environments. I also have a deep passion for philosophy, interculturality, and other intellectual pursuits. \n\nAs a Junior Business Developer at the Start-up Incubator at my University, I regularly interact with exciting start-ups and innovative ideas, watching them grow and develop. Besides, I organise and host events, am a point of contact, and focus on developing the organisation.\n\nI am passionate about organisational and cultural change, and thoroughly enjoy project management and being part of a team. I have good communication and organisation skills, and my qualities lie in getting the best out of my team members and keeping track of the bigger picture. It excites me to work on projects that aim to achieve something new and push the boundaries. \n\nMy degree in Philosophy helps me think critically and quickly process complex information. It allows me to get a deeper understanding of how the world and systems we exist in function. Specifically, the focus on science and technology and their relevance to society, as well as my experience working closely with start-ups, provide me with unique and powerful insights into the intersection between technology, society, and disruptive change.",
