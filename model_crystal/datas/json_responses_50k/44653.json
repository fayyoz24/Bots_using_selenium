    "summary": "I am a PhD Physicist investing my background in industry. My core competences span across mathematical modeling, data analysis, algorithm's design and software implementation.\n\n        I currently work in ASML, the world's lead manufacturer of nanolitography machines. I am a Design Engineer for Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) nanolithography systems, and I am part of the metrology team responsible for calibrating and qualify the EUV-light optics projection systems, to achieve the best possible imaging performances of the machines. Excellent imaging performances are a core feature of EUV systems in order to guarantee efficient and high-quality volume production of integrated circuits. The use of EUV light sources in conjunction with high performances of optical components allow to shrink the size of the circuit's features which are printed on resistors, continuing enabling the Moore's law. \n\n        Ahead of joining ASML, I have been working in the Aerospace domain for the development of aircraft training systems, in particular to the design and implementation of software packages for simulation of InfraRed Search and Track (IRST) devices.\n\n       My work in industry has widely benefited, from both the soft and the technical skills perspectives, of my previous experiences as a researcher in High Energy Physics in Academy. For more than 5 years, I have been a member of two great international collaborations of physicists and engineers grown around the Belle 2 (during my postdoctoral activity) and the LHCb (during the PhD) experiments.",
