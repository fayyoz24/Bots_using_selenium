Between 2002 and 2010, the Rural Social Research Group typically comprised a postdoctoral fellow and eight or so PhD students. Its mission was to undertake applied social research that contributes to the development of agriculture, the promotion of natural resource management, and the improvement of the quality of life of rural communities. As a result of the time I was at TIAR, a total of 10 students eventually gained their PhD under my supervision; some 25 journal articles were published between 2002 and 2010 (and a further 25 published subsequently), and various other publications were produced. Over $1.4 million of grant income was obtained. Through our involvement in various national committees and workshops, a significant contribution was made to rural policy in Australia.",
