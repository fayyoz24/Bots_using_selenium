    "summary": "After obtaining my diploma of Industrial Engineering at Mines Albi School in 2019, I went to live and work abroad in order to have an experience both cultural and profesionnal. \nTherefore, I chose to do a Volontariat International en Entreprise (VIE). This experience let me live into two different countries (Czech Republic and Spain);  improve my English and Spanish and even try to learn Czech; develop my international mindset; meet and be regularly in contact with people all around the world (15 different nationalities); work in a sector (automobile) and a field (IT development) that I had no experience before. This was a great experience and I really liked to have this international mindset for both human and profesional aspects.\nNow, after two years of VIE, since October 2021, I am working as a Digital Project Engineer Consultant for the same company. As my contract is about to end in February 2022, I am looking for a position in IT related to Project Management/ User Experience projects / Indsutry 4.0 and which will enable me to keep this International aspect.\nI am opened to any position in Europe !",
