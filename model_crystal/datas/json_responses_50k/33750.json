TechMeUp is a tech fund that invests in people's opportunities. TechMeUp believes that training should be accessible to everyone, whatever one\u2019s situation!

But who do not easily find their way around in the dominant literary and cultural-scientific discourse.\n\ndNBg has the mission to do for the Dutch language area what The New York Review of Books (NYRB), The London Review of Books (LRB) and the Times Literary Supplement (TLS) do for the English language area. \n\ndNBg offers book essays at the intersection of science, art and culture, by renowned writers and scientists - and by new talent. dNBg, published both on paper and digitally, is created by a team of young editors under the direction of founding publisher and editor-in-chief Merlijn Olnon, and published on a non-profit basis under the management of Foundation De Nederlandse Boekengids (a cultural ANBI). Because of its editorial direction, integrity and accessibility, and because of the ever-increasing readership reach (of more than 100,000 returning readers),"

Together with the parents, we strive to ensure that language and reading pleasure have a permanent place in the family. From my own experience as a volunteer reader, I have seen the enormous positive impact this has on a child's personal and cognitive development. They become more confident, sometimes because they now have a role model in their environment and sometimes because they are actually more confident in how they understand the world around them and are able to express their thoughts."

The aim of the Shimmy Shake Festival is to organise an annual dance festival including gala to bring international top dancers to The Netherlands, to bring together fusion dancers from all over the country and from abroad to inspire them with workshops, performances and presentations and to introduce Urban Fusion Belly dance to a bigger audience.

            "description": "Making the Surinamese slave registers public is the aim of the project that Radboud University Nijmegen and Anton de Kom University of Suriname are carrying out together with volunteers. The 43 parts of the slave registers contain per plantation or private owner the names of almost all people who lived in slavery in Suriname between 1830 and 1863, along with information about birth, death, sale and release. With public support and that of organizations such as the Prince Bernard Culture Fund, National Institute for Dutch Slavery Past and Heritage (NiNsee) and the Democracy and Media Foundation, the information from the scans is made available to the public and for scientific research. This makes Dutch slavery past visible and negotiable.\n\nVolunteer page Ruben Brave: https://vele Hands.nl/account/user/profile/project/run_slavenregisters/id/12046\n\nProject page Radboud University - Surinamese slave registers 1830-1863: https://vele Handen.nl/projecten/bekijk/details/project/run_slavenregisters\n\nSurinamese slave registers: http://www.ru.nl/slavenregisters/\n\nThe project was completed in December due to the overwhelming efforts of many volunteers."
