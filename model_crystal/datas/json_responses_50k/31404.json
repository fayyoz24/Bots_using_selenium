    "summary": "I am enthusiastic and open-minded with a strong international focus and interest. Having lived in four countries over the past years (Netherlands, Hong Kong, Croatia and Belgium), it fascinates me how different people and cultures can learn from -and enhance each other. I am curious by nature, always on the lookout for ways to improve and opportunities to learn. People I've worked with tend to describe me as a strong communicator with a great drive for results. I thrive most in dynamic and fast-paced environments. For me, working in a well-functioning and high performing team is one of the best feelings there is. \n\nI love to spend my free time with friends and family, preferably whilst enjoying good food together; I very much enjoy cooking, but I am also always on the hunt for new spots to eat out. I am craft beer enthusiast, so I like to pair food with a good beer. I prefer to spend my holidays travelling: from hiking the Great Wall of China to wild camping in Australia or roadtripping in Europe, as long as there are new places to discover and new people to meet I am up for it. Some other interests of mine are politics, education and (competitive) debate. Last but not least, I am passionate about football: playing (at a very amateur level), supporting Feyenoord, watching games and having endless discussions about it, I enjoy it all!\n\nIf you feel like we can be of added value to each other, please do feel free to shoot me a message :)",

In short, a Personal Development Plan is an ongoing process of identifying where they stand, where they would like to be in the future, and taking actions in order to achieve their goals and reflecting on their progress.\n\nWithin this program, they are challenged to develop a clear vision on what they want to achieve during their studies and beyond, and also to develop an action plan on how to reach these goals. During the entire process, support and feedback is given by student mentors. At the end of the first year year, the participating students reflect on what they achieved and formulate a new plan for next year.",
