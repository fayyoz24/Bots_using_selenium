    "summary": "My name is Antonia, born and raised in a suburb of Hamburg. Currently living in Amsterdam. \n\nWe live in a world where people are overwhelmed by Marketing, I believe it is a challenge to be outstanding, but an interesting, challenging and fun one. I have always liked to solve problems/quizzes and help others. With my theoretical background in Marketing and Brand Management, as well as, my practical Marketing experience, I believe I am a good asset to teams to deliver qualitative deliverables. In recent years I gained considerable experience as an Email Marketing Specialist, as well as, a general Digital Marketer. I am a curious mind, enthusiastic, adaptable and always strive to apply critical and analytical thinking. Furthermore, I like to combine analytical work with creativity. In my free time, I have self-taught myself design tools such as Figma, Canva and Wix since I like to be creative. \n\nDuring high school, I lived for one year in the United States of America, where I attended an American high school. Once I finished the highest degree in Germany, I completed my Bachelor's degree in International Tourism Management in the Netherlands where I also completed two minors in South Africa and Bali. Afterwards, I earned my Master's degree in International Marketing and Brand Management in Sweden.\n\nEmail Marketing | Digital Marketing | Branding",
