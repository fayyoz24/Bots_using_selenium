    "summary": "An energetic Relationship Manager with extensive experience developing partnerships by bringing scalable and disruptive solutions to ensure ROI.  History of being a great team player responsible for collective work in a high-performance-driven and inclusive work culture by embracing constant challenges and working in demanding environments. Experienced in developing and building exceptional B2B, B2C and stakeholder relationships in the travel, e-tail, food & beverage and sports industry. \n\nOutside of work, I love the outdoors, sport, and travel. Having lived and worked in Tanzania, The Netherlands, Philippines, and Australia with additional studies undergone in Dortmund, Germany, it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve always had an appetite for adventure.\n\nToday, my adventure is aimlessly exploring the beautiful region of Jordaan that I am now lucky enough to call home. If anyone in my network has any contacts or opportunities in Amsterdam, please reach out via DM or email, I love to chat with everyone and anyone.",
