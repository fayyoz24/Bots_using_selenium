The principal focus of the Award is on research that deals with the founding, financing, management, growth, and development of high potential new ventures, with venture capital investing, or with corporate entrepreneurship. Dissertations dealing with small high-tech ventures may also qualify for the Heizer Award. Three criteria will be used to evaluate all Heizer Award entries. They are: (1) The degree to which the entry fits the specific focus of the Heizer Award described above; (2) The overall scholarly quality of the entry and (3) The overall quality and effectiveness of the entry's implications for the practice of new enterprise development as defined above. While scholarly quality and fit will be the deciding factors among eligible submissions, Heizer Award Winners must have well developed implications for practitioners in the area of new enterprise development. Dissertations without such implications cannot win the Heizer Award.\n\nSee also:\nhttps://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2017/8/200993/ut-alumnus-writes-best-entrepreneurship-phd-thesis-of-2016\nhttps://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/nikos/news/!/2017/8/183423/heizer-award-2017-for-nikos-alumnus-arjan-frederiks-research-on-imagination-of-entrepreneurs\nhttp://myuniversity.rug.nl/infonet/medewerkers/actueel/news/arjan-frederiks-wins-heizer-doctoral-dissertation-award-2017",
