Specifically, I was responsible for performing PCR amplification of the target gene, designing and cloning the expression construct, and transforming the construct into the host strain. Additionally, I was involved in the analysis of the metabolites produced by the engineered strains, using techniques such as HPLC and mass spectrometry.\n\nIn addition to my experimental work, I was also responsible for writing a report summarizing the findings of our project. This report included a detailed description of the experimental methods we used, as well as an analysis of the results we obtained. I was responsible for writing the section of the report that described our work on cloning, amplifying, and expressing the target gene, as well as the section that described our metabolite analysis. Overall, my work on this project gave me valuable experience in a wide range of molecular biology techniques, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret complex scientific data.",
