Each year up to 20 participants were recruited among the best university graduates in various fields of study. \n\nThe programme consisted of a 4-month high-intensity course of Japanese language and culture at Leiden University, The Netherlands. Upon successful completion of the exams, the students would travel to Tokyo, Japan where they would follow an advanced course of Japanese language for 2 months at the Japan-Netherlands Institute in Tokyo. After this specialist language training the students continued with the core of the programme: a position at a Japanese company or institution, related to their field of study.\n\nThe first group of students of the Japan Prizewinners Programme started their training in September 1995. The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science terminated its support for the program in 2008; the last group of JPP graduates obtained their diplomas in September 2008.",

Ford\u2019s considerable research (based on the Harvard Service-Profit Chain model) has shown that engagement requires an emotional connection and it is the dealership employees who have to build these relationships. Together with a team of retailers from across the country, Ford developed the CEM initiative that goes well beyond any company program launched to date. The CEM was first launched in the US and Canada, and has expanded globally throughout Europe, Mexico, Asia and numerous other countries around the world. \n\nThe process is designed to provide dealers with comprehensive and valuable insight into their leadership, culture, and employee engagement. Dealers who sign up to participate in the CEM are assigned a professional coach whose role is to help get the best out of the leadership of each dealership. They do not have a process manual of what they need to do. They have tools, resources and skills to help the leadership team better engage their people. With their experience they are able to work together with the dealers who are entrepreneurs, but working within the parameters of a large corporate organization. Eventually it is about creating a positive environment that will create true employee engagement.",

            "description": "World work project for ORSC certification. The Center for Right Relationship believes that every student who passes through their program has a larger role to play in the evolution of human systems.  As students in their certification program our job was and still is to develop a world work role we are called to play; their job is to inspire and equip you for that function. For this reason, an important part of the Certification process was to develop a World Work Project. In addition to contributing to human relationship systems, this project helped to anchor and leverage my Certification learning.\n\nI certainly felt the calling to develop and shape a world work role. The purpose of my world work project was to:\n> Contribute to the world and shape my world work role as a professional with a systems approach\n> Put my ORSC skills out there and apply ORSC tools\n> Create mutual understanding and celebration between people\n> Bring love & connection in times of change\n> Have another excuse to travel and be in a country I love.\n\nMy project was to write and present my paper on the topic of Understanding and Celebrating Diversity at the conference on Multiculturalism and the prospects for Africa and African Diaspora development (organized by CBAAC, Nigeria and the State University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil). Furthermore, I designed and delivered a workshop for 70 conference participants. In this workshop the participants discovered their own frame of reference and explored that of someone else. Through the experience of various ORSC tools they found new ways to look at themselves, others and the wider context of multiculturalism and diversity. ",
