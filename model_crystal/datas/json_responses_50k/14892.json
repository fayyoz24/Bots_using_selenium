    "summary": "I'm a partner at Stratix the leading telecom and digital economy consultancy of the Netherlands. I have 20 years of experience in Internet, telecom, privacy, online content, standardisation and peripheral topics. I work on topics such as datacenters, submarine cables, mobile networks (5G, spectrum, policy), regional fibre networks, networks for utilities and internet of things. Through Stratix I work as a programme manager 5G for the Dutch Association of Municipalities. I represent the municipalities in their interaction with other governments and telecom firms and support them in implementing new regulations.  \n\nIn the past I worked as regulatory affairs manager at Tele2, as senior policy advisor at the OECD, as management consultant at Logica Management Consulting and as policy manager at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. I\u2019ve worked with (international) governmental organisations, such as the European Union and Commission, BEREC, ITU and national telecom and media regulators\n\nColleagues say I am fast thinking, hardworking, delivering and good humoured. I have a knack for emerging and complicated issues, am knowledgeable in technology as well  as governance and can think and work from perspective of business and government (if needed at the same time). \n\nMy biggest success so far has been, that in 2021 I unearthed that the reachability of 112 was in danger as a result of the shutdown of 2G/3G. The cause is that VoLTE standardisation and implementation is a mess. I lobbied pro bono with the European Emergency Number Association to Dutch parliamentarians, government and telecom firms and EU telecom standardisation, manufacturers and telecom groups to call attention to this issue. The result is that the GSMA will work on a uniform emergency call profile, that could become a requirement in the Radio Equipment Directive. Other successes were identifying the problems caused by regulations on SIM-cards and numbering for the IoT. This lead to changes in numbering policies and the approval of eSIMs by telecom firms. Initiating the BEREC-OECD meetings on IP-interconnection in 2011-2012 was another success. \n\nRegularly I accept invitations to speak at  events (ITU, BEREC, IRG, IGF, IIC) and regularly I am interviewed or quoted by journalists (Economist, BBC, Ars Technica, GigaOM, Vox, Telegraaf) on issues such as the Internet of Things, security network neutrality, television, fixed and mobile competition and economics of the Internet. I also have a strong presence on social media, such as Twitter.",
