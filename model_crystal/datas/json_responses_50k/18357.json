    "summary": "What I can tell you about myself, is that I am honest, committed and always eager to learn. I was raised with the work-hard-play-hard tagline and my greatest motivator is doing something that matters and that challenges me professionally. My work philosophy is purpose + empowerment + fun = results.\n\nI\u2019m experienced with translating actions and events into budget and planning and challenging it on feasibility. Building solid relationships with my stakeholders and colleagues is important to me and I love being part of a team. The feedback I get from others is that I\u2019m analytically strong with a critical eye, which means I like to discuss considerations from different angles before I dive into the implementation of a new plan. I can take a step back to see the bigger picture, but also be detail focused when needed. \n\nMy current activities in the Portfolio management team at Ahold Delhaize include i.a. reporting on progress and data quality of projects, preparing SteerCo\u2019s, portfolio boards and other alignment forums, aimed at providing insight into overarching risks, issues and dependencies. In addition, preparing input and argumentation for annual and quarterly portfolio and budget cycles and setting and substantiating priorities are also part of my responsibilities.\n\nOne of my favourite projects was at Eneco Installatiebedrijven, when they asked me to lead the annual inspection of tools and other equipment and implement this process for the future. Something completely different. I loved the combination of desk work and the practical side of it: I spent more than half of my time coordinating the process from the warehouse, safety shoes on, working closely with service technicians, inspection experts and others. Close to the core business it's not hard to find purpose and joy in a role.\n\nLooking at the future, I would like to develop further in portfolio management or a related area. If I wouldn\u2019t do this, I would be a writer or work in hospitality. My hobbies are 4x4 offroading, camping, horse back riding and going out with friends.\n\nLooking forward to connect!",

Previous studies have shown that the crossover of enthusiasm occurs between team members and life partners, but to my knowledge no studies have been done from the manager's perspective. To investigate the spread of enthusiasm from manager to employee, the mediating role of transformational leadership and the influence of manager's energy and personal resources were analyzed. No direct relationship between manager and employee enthusiasm was found, which may mean that crossover of enthusiasm probably works very differently when it comes to a hierarchical relationship compared to equivalent relationships. However, managers do play a very important role in stimulating employee engagement. The main finding is that managers appear to positively stimulate employee engagement through a transformational leadership style. This connection was mediated by freedom of decision, role clarity and optimism among employees. In other words, transformational leadership positively influences employee engagement by increasing various employee resources. For follow-up research, it is recommended to further investigate the roles of these predictors, identify more relevant resources and investigate the importance of specific resources in different hierarchical positions.\n\nMethod: quantitative research with SPSS.\nParticipation: 90 managers, 375 employees.\n\nGrade: 7.5",

Job crafting is defined as the cognitive and physical changes individuals make in their tasks or relational boundaries within their jobs. This with the aim to make their work more enjoyable and to use their strengths. It is important that the manager offers room for this and that your behavior does not disadvantage the work of your colleagues or is contrary to the goals of the organization. Employees who were intrinsically motivated and generally liked their work were more likely to engage in job crafting. Self-efficacy is confidence in your own ability. Here an effect was found in combination with the support you get from your manager. So if the employee receives confirmation from his supervisor that he is doing his job well, more job crafting is applied in the work.\n\nMethod: quantitative research with SPSS.\nParticipation: 200 employees.\n\nGrade: 7",
