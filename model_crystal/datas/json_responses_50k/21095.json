Hoovering above the ground, the volume of the Hotel shelters the area inviting the wildlife approaching to the site. Maintaining a safe distance and respecting the clear boundaries between the animal and the human activities.\n\nUnderground, the Creative Hub inspires from nature, witnessing casual meetings and interactions from curious animals attracted by natural and artistic events. From the atelier performances and crafting, to the food smells and the refreshing water pond. \n\nThe creative area acts as a white canvas, enhancing the free expression, creativity and movement of the artists with adaptable composition of the diaphanous space. Assisting the cultural exchange and promoting the flexibility between the design activities and their spaces.",
