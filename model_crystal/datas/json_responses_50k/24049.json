As this GSM-R system is specififcally designed for safety applications there has been a strong emphasis on availability and security during the project. Next to the design, procurement and installation of the hardware equipment it included the procurement and/or agreements required to install the GSM base station antennas.  The system has currently nationwide coverage and is in use by Dutch railways",
