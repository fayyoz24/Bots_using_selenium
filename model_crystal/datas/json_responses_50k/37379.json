Previously there was no inventory system. What I implemented was a system with hand-scanners, allowing for stock to be scanned in and out of inventory, linked to specific orders or deliveries. This significantly improved inventory accuracy, and in-turn order fill rates\n- Played an integral role in two major Nike Golf Club launches, with 95% inventory coverage for both launches. Consequently, both these product years were record sales years for Nike Golf EMEA.\n- Was a part of the team introducing an S&OP process to Nike Golf EMEA \u2013 after implementation I took ownership of these meetings, creating the templates and running the meetings.",
