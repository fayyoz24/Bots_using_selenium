This included the development and management of key projects in urban domains like public space, mobility, waste management, water management and energy. \n\nInitiated, developed and managed the Emerging Public Space (EPS) project, implemented with NRC (Norwegian contractor) and Blumont (US contractor). Objective was to foster self-reliance of refugee communities by creating non-fenced and community-run public recreational spaces in areas where refugees already gathered in the public sphere. Refugee committees shaped the project (participatory approach), made key decisions in all stages of the project and constructed & guard the public spaces voluntarily to develop community ownership. After two successful pilots, the project was handed over to NRC and GIZ to continue the implementation of the approach in the camp and in areas of host communities. \n\nOther projects included the Emerging Mobility Networks (EMN) project, water management project and urban design project of the refugee camp in its wider context and dynamics. \n\n- Project design, proposal development and negotiations to obtain approval from authorities and UNHCR; \n- Partnership development for implementation and continuation of projects; \n- Set up and facilitate stakeholder meetings and mobilize community members; \n- Technical designs, BOQs, procurement, site logistics and day-to-day management of construction activities; \n- Develop and implement M&E frameworks & quality control of reporting.",
