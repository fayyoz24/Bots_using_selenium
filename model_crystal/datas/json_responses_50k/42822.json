    "summary": "I'm a passionate and versatile content expert who's been helping clients and collaborators create understandable, compelling communications and make smart business decisions for the past 12+ years. I've worked for organizations ranging from global corporations to startups and technical companies to music magazines, with a particular focus on technical B2B companies. I'm always open to new projects in which my creativity and excellent communication skills are as much of an asset as the analytical and strategic mindset I honed during my years studying chemistry and engineering. \n\nI hail from Phoenix, Arizona in the US, but have been happily living and working in Amsterdam since 2009. My side hustles include standup comedy, public speaking / MCing, music journalism, and DJing. I enjoy discussing and learning more about music, film, science, and politics.\n\nYou can view samples of my writing here: https://www.clippings.me/carlyblair",
