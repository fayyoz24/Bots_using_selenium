    "summary": "I am a visionary architectural professional with a track record of masterful spatial planning, quality assurance, and project management. Over the course of my career, I have acquired a reputation for my comprehensive expertise on the effects of urban planning on crime prevention.\n\nAmong my many talents is the ability to communicate effectively with proficiency in English, Greek, and French, with diverse clientele across all levels of business. I am adept at engaging in effective collaboration with cross-functional professionals. I am an outstanding team leader with a demonstrated capacity to supervise teams in high-volume environments by leveraging innovative leadership strategies.\n\nIn addition, I have proven stakeholder engagement, contract negotiation, and budget management skills. I possess an incredibly detail-oriented approach to duty execution, which is an integral trait for any professional within the construction sector. \n\nI am the proud holder of a Doctor of Philosophy in Urban and Regional Planning, as well as a Diploma of Architecture from the University of Patras. I have also obtained a Master of Science in Urbanism from the Technical University of Delft, and a Master of Art in Art History from the University of Leiden. I am of the firm belief that these qualifications, in combination with the practical experience I have acquired over the course of my career, have equipped me with the required skills and expertise to serve as an invaluable asset to any organisation!",
