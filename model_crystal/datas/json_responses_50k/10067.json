She faced continuous changes to the project and the company where she had to take both quick and thoughtful decisions. She started out as a UX designer working mostly with the CSD (center stack display). This was a new experience since she had to take things into consideration that she had not before. After 6 months she was promoted to product owner of the project she had been working on as a UX designer. There she worked using kanban and incorporation the agile ways as much as possible. \n\nHer main focus was communication with different stakeholders, mostly situated in China.

In some of the projects Freja was project leader and in some project member. The process involved identifying the problem and then continued researching the best ways to solve it. This they did by using customer surveys, interviews and observations. Next step included evaluation of these and pinpointing the most important requirements. They later sketched on wireframes and worked their way forward with design tools, such as XD.",

The monsters are supposed to contribute to an interactive piece of furnish which can be used in a educational purpose and to ease with the tidying. Different solutions for storage allows, by using anthropometry, the possibility to limit the toys based on the different heights of the children. This allows preschools to both delimit and allow access of toys for children between the age of two to six. For children that already master the use of things such as colouring and crafting, this provides a great freedom. It also contributes to an improved ergonomic situation for the teachers, who does not need to accommodate the children with unreachable toys.",
