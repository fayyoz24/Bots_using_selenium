The facilities offer a comprehensive learning program for children from 6 - 17, including computer lessons, reading & library activities, and career advice. The goal is to enable the children to learn and grow, thus enriching their own communities as they grow up.\n\nTogether with the To Be team I have set up the I Want To Be programme - a programme that opens the minds of students to the career opportunities in their comminity. During the programme, the  students focus on their own talents, visit companies and interview professionals. \n\nI have run the programme twice now in Takoradi, Ghana and my role is to train the local Ghanese team, consisting of education professionals, so they can run the programme with the students locally. This includes training, creating an extensive  manual to help the team run the programme and planning the programme. "
