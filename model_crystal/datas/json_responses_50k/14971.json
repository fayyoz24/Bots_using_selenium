    "summary": "Johan has gained his test experience within projects at companies such as Nederlandse Gasunie N.V., Health Insurance companies VGZ and IZA and the Dutch telecom provider KPN Mobile.\n\nFor five and a half year in totals Johan has worked for  Gasunie. His first project at Gasunie was a very large project called \u201cBalance in Balancing\u201d.  In the end Johan was also asked to carry out tests for other projects within Gasunie. This allowed him the opportunity to collaborate as a system test specialist on projects such as Meter to Bill 2011, Application Hosting 2.0, Jason BI and Camion. In this way he gained much experience testing Business Intelligence systems and systems like Mecoms based on Microsoft Dynamics AX, in system integration testing, migration testing and Cloud Service testing (Microsoft called \u201cWindows Azure\u201d). \n\nThe months thereafter Johan did some miscellaneous testing activities for Oasys and Camion release 1.1, among other things. At that time he was asked to join the Offline Metering and Allocations team. His responsibility within the team is to plan, prepare and execute the system tests for a number of applications. At this moment the team is busy with the automation of the regression tests in Microsoft TFS and MTM for several of their applications along with the usual operational activities.\n\nJohan likes to work within a team, but he is equally at home working on his own. In his work, Johan always strives towards perfection with a satisfied customer as his ultimate goal. His aim is to produce work of quality and an optimal end result.\n\nJohan\u2019s ambition is to work on challenging and instructive projects, where he can use the experience gained so far, to deliver together with the customer high quality working products.",

The team\u2019s biggest achievement so far is the implementation of the functionality of the application SCARS within Cosmos and automating the regression tests of Cosmos and Midas in Microsoft TFS and MTM.\n\nDuring these years Johan's role shifted from actual testing to being the team lead testing of the Offline Metering & Allocation domain (currently known as the IC Domain). From January 2019 and onwards his focus as a Test Analyst moved to the Vertogas application and the Online Metering & Allocation application.",

The system integration test team was responsible for the preparation and execution of the tests for each of the new or changed integrations.

The data that could not be migrated automatically needed to be migrated manually. Also the data had to be compared and the differences had to be analyzed.

COMBAT is responsible for the gas allocation and network balancing processes. The system tests were to show that the stand-alone functionality was working properly. The allocation process is responsible for assigning gas transported through the Gasunie network to the correct Business Partner (customer/ gas transport company). Based on these allocations COMBAT starts the balancing process. During this process COMBAT determines whether or not the gas network is in balance or who responsible is for a potential imbalance of the network. During the system tests Johan tested the functionality using an automatic test tool that was developed by ATOS. Furthermore this test tool was capable of automatically executing the system test cases during a nightly run. The results of this run was examined by the test team and reported to the project manager. Test data was created using  XML-messages. \r\nIn release 2, the metering process of its predecessor NimbusIM was to be implemented. Release 2 contained primarily all the revision and change requests that could not be implemented in release 1. However the metering service was the largest and most important part that needed to be built and tested. This process ensures that all the measurement data from the gas network is collected and allocated allowing COMBAT to calculate the network gas balance.\r\n\r\nGasport is the portal used by Gasunie internal and external customers to display data stored in backend. Johan was responsible for the Test Analysis and the Test Execution.",
