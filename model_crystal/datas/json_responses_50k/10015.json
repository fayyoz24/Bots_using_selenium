It\u2019s an IT company situated on a massive \u201cSoftware Park\u201d in the city where a permanent group of developers is supported by a mix of Dutch and Chinese students.\n\nBerrie worked in Agile/Scrum teams to map the internal organization and the infrastructure it uses. This resulted in a network analysis of the current situation containing Sharepoint, Exchange and Database modeling among other things. With this information, an advisory was written that specified the creation of a new network infrastructure. Berrie has successfully navigated this advisory through the organization and gained approval to start executing the activities that were specified in the report. \n\nBerrie functioned as the Scrum Master of the team throughout the project. During this time, a new version of the JIRA reporting tool was added to the organization and Berrie provided training to the organization in using this tool and applying the Scrum framework in daily operation. Berrie has also developed a standardized set of working methods to ensure continuity within the company and educate new employees on the use of the new network infrastructure. Maintaining the infrastructure and continuing the proper use of the Scrum framework was the second objective of this methodology.",
