    "summary": "Manager at Monitor Deloitte, the strategy practice of Deloitte consulting, focussed on the Future of Energy and co-leading Deloitte\u2019s Global Hydrogen Center of Excellence. \n\nIn the period between 2014 and 2018 I finished my PhD which I conducted at Shell and Leiden University. During my PhD, I enjoyed gaining experience with multi-disciplinary projects within Shell\u2019s Scenario team and the strategy team for Shell\u2019s New Energies business in which I combined quantitative modelling with strategic analysis. I worked on the quantification of Shell\u2019s latest energy transition scenario, analysed the potential for power-to-liquids and showed how market power in the electricity market will develop in the future. Presenting these findings at top-management level has given me experience communicating complex technical analysis to business people in an international environment. \n\nIn my PhD I developed simulation models of the energy transition in which I analysed how actor-behaviour influences the emerging energy transition. With a relative new modelling method, agent-based modelling, I went beyond techno-economic modelling by incorporating bounded-rational behaviour of investors and consumers in order to study the effect of market power in the electricity market and more general the pace of the energy transition.\n\nI am an analytical thinker and excel in developing better understanding of complex systems, with a strong affinity towards the energy system, simulation modelling and data analysis. My ambition is to further develop and quantify narratives for a deep-decarbonisation of the energy system that can be used to inform strategic analyses. \n\nNext to his work I am a Professional Ballroom dancer, teacher and internationally-recognized adjudicator. I am a board member of the union of dance teachers in the Netherlands and member of several committees in dance and energy related organisations.\n",
