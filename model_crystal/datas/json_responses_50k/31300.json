A spectacular two course lunch, complete with expertly-matched festival wines will be available, and discussions led by some of New Zealand\u2019s top wine commentators will provide plenty of food for thought during the festival. Three vertical tastings will be held throughout the day offering an exclusive opportunity to see how a wine changes year on year due to its environment. The festival organisers think drinkers should enjoy wine with a story, and the best stories come from the boutique wine producers who work unstintingly to put wine on the table that creates lasting experiences. They also believe life is too short to drink bad wine, so their mission is to create a wine encounter like no other, giving vineyards the opportunity to showcase their wine to New Zealand's leading wine market, and giving those lucky enough to attend the event the chance to discover some of New Zealand's best kept wine secrets.\n\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/viva-magazine/news/article.cfm?c_id=533&objectid=11293813",
