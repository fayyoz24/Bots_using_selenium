    "summary": "Our message: Finding the right balance between sales and creative marketing and sustainability in order to help brands to sell into the Benelux market BtoB and BtoC and establish better brand awareness. \n\nAs an agency we work for CE Audio & Dj lifestyle-brands like Skullcandy, Pioneer Dj, Vonyx, Beamz and also for MDA and SDA indoor & outdoor Kitchen supplies brands like CASO-design and Induplus. \n\nWe are committed fighting climate change by reducing waste and upcycling products in order to reduce the footprint of the brands we carry.\n\nIn January 2022 we started as a Sales and Marketing consultant for an outdoor construction company to implement Tiny Houses on wheels and modular Tiny Houses of the brands Mooblehouse and Moodlehouse in the Dutch market.\n\nWe started in 2002 in the Benelux market as a distribution company for consumer electronic products to retail and etail. In 2011 we changed our distribution model into a sales- and marketing-agency in order to be able to work closer with the brands we are working for.\n\nWe help brands to setup their sales (direct and indirect) in the Benelux market and built the brand- awareness through creative Marketing, Events and PR activities. Our retail and etail experience helps us to create the right plan to realize the goals of our brands. We help companies with shelvespace in retail (Mediamarkt / BCC / Fnac etc... ) and get the right position in etail (Amazon / Bol.com / Coolblue etc... ). \n\nVia our network and experience we are able to connect the right athletes and/or influencers to create more awareness of the brand through socialmedia.\n\nFor the Tiny Houses we work together with project managers, recreational parks, campsites, investors, but also with consumers who need a second home for social and/or commercial purposes.",
