Three new power stations, Kusile, Ngula and Medupi are under construction. \n\nAs part of the construction landscape, workforce demobilisation and redeployment is one of challenges that faces the Medupi Project leadership team. The stark reality is that approximately 17 000 construction contract employees (of which approximately 7 600 live in Lephalale) will be demobilised between 2012 and project completion. In response to this challenge, the Medupi Leadership Initiative (MLI) was established between Eskom and its Principal Contractors to actively seek sustainable solutions to mitigate the socio-economic impact that the demobilisation programme has on local communities.  \n\nAfter several months of investigation and refinement, the MLI Team identified six Value Propositions (VPs) categorised into two focus areas, namely:\n\u2022 Job Opportunity VPs \u2013 which aim to offer job opportunities through initiatives such as the Drylands, Medupi Corporate Social Investment (CSI) projects,  and the Lephalale Local Municipality (LLM) infrastructure projects \n\u2022 Enabler VPs \u2013 which aim to equip beneficiaries with improved skills to navigate their way to better self-management, future employment or business ownership through VPs such as the Life Skills, Further Education and Training (FET) and the Small, Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMME) support processes.\n\nA third important area  deals with finding additional VPs to support economic development and job creation in Lephalale as well as finding additional funding to support MLI initiatives and make these sustainable in the longer term.\n",
