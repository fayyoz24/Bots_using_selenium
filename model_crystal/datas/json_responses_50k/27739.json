    "summary": "Hyperspectral Imaging Innovator, specialized in the development and implementation of hyperspectral imaging hardware and software for: Medical, Food Quality and Remote Sensing applications. \n\nMaking the invisible visible has been fascinating me ever since I was confronted with color blindness at an early age. I soon discovered my passion to explore the world with the aid of Multispectral Imaging Technologies. \n\nMy career started as a researcher in an academic medical environment where we explored new medical applications for this technology. From a technology pushed perspective we found promising results in applications in the fields of dermatology, urology and brain surgery. After eight years of innovating as an employer I made the switch to become an independent entrepreneur. From this profession I got involved in system integration of spectral camera\u2019s for food quality assessments. Later on I started to deliver airborne Multispectral Remote Sensing data for GIS users in the form of a customer defined data acquisition service. \n\nMy computer vision software developments are mainly focused on: Data Management, Hardware Control, Data Acquisition, Image Segmentation, Algorithm Development, Machine Learning and Neural Networks (AI). In addition to my software related activities, I have extensive experience with the Development, System Integration, Calibration and Optimization of Image Acquisition hardware for a broad variety of projects. By implementing these skills I have supported many innovative projects, both in prototype/feasibility stage and final Solution stage.\n\nI am looking out for further development, innovation support and marketing of new products with the latest hyperspectral imaging technologies.",
