    "summary": "\u2018\u2019We must be silent before we can listen. We must listen before we can learn. We must learn before we can prepare. We must prepare before we can serve. We must serve before we can lead.\u2019\u2019\n\nMy life mission is to make a difference in this world by helping people in need - something that\u2019s only achievable by working together. \n\nI am a person who builds her life in line with core values: Wisdom, Understanding and Love. \n\nI believe that education is the key to a deeper understanding of today\u2019s society. For this reason, I never cease to learn. My strong personality and high emotional intelligence, allow me to stay connected, determined and proactive. I constantly think about what I can do for the people. I treat failure as experience - an opportunity to learn and to contribute to any new creation. Decisions that I make include both instant effects and long-term consequences. When it comes to challenges, I love them. In fact, people often find me volunteering for difficult jobs. I am visionary and motivated. I inspire. I teach through being an example.\n\nEvery day, I invest my time into becoming a better version of myself. I am an abolitionist, a volunteer fighting against famine among children in Kenya and a servant leader. I commit to the growth of people. I build strong connections by giving a part of me. I am a person who helps others heal and become whole, who provides a space to feel safe and connected, while still being able to express individuality.\n\nIn my private life, I allow my artistic soul to come to the surface. I prioritise the people I love as well as my passions, which are: Interior Design, Drawing, Cooking, Fitness and Self-development. \n\nI follow my heart and intuition. \u201cThey somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\u2019\u2019 ~ Steve Jobs",
