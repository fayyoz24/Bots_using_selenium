    "summary": "I support Dutch businesses and entrepreneurs in their efforts to reach a global audience and create lasting, international partnerships. \n\nCreating those partnerships requires optimal presentation and intercultural communications. I contribute to the establishment of such partnerships between Dutch enterprises and those in English speaking countries. \n\nAll communications: web content, management books, brochures and promotional materials, form that essential first impression that you make with potential clients and or partners. Less than perfect is not good enough. \n\nAs an expatriate who has lived and worked in the Netherlands for 30 years, I have experienced at first hand what can go right (and what can go wrong) in intercultural communications. Having been at a 'loss for words' or unable to 'say what I meant' or 'not taken seriously' I quickly realized that, if I wanted to enjoy a full, professional life in the Netherlands, I needed to learn to speak and write Dutch well. \n\nWhen I established Write Away, text and design, it was my mission to enable Dutch businesses and entrepreneurs to communicate effectively with foreign stakeholders. \n\nWhat I can do for you:\nTranslate, edit or re-write your communications media - web texts, brochures, flyers etc from Dutch into English or vice versa\nTranslate your official documents - legal, financial, HR into English\nTranslate and edit books in both Dutch and English and advise on the effectiveness of the content\nMentor you in your writing process\nCo-write your book\nConduct interviews and write magazine articles\n\nSpecialties and skills: \nAuthor and ghostwriter\nAuthor mentor\nTranslator Dutch/English and English/Dutch\nEditor & corrector\nShort, specific training professional English",
