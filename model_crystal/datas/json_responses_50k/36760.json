    "summary": "Peter van Lith started working in ICT in 1964. He built his own computer in 1968 and became interested in Artificial Intelligence. From 1977 to 1979 he was responsible for the ICT of the large Hirab project in Saudi Arabia and here he first applied his interest in AI. In 1980 he started using AI technology and was the first one to build an Expert System in the Netherlands. In 1984 he founded Lithp Systems, specialising in AI and later in Robotics. \nHe developed the Lisp based ES development environment Acquaint and created over 15 Expert Systems. During the 90's he developed walking robots  starting with a six-legged walker, followed by the 4-legged Dappie robot dog and the 2-legged Stepper robot. These robots were the inspiration for the biped robots of the leg-lab of the TU Delft.\nHe became a guest lecturer at the TU Delft, University of Amsterdam and Free University of Amsterdam and helped teachers to set up robotics projects at school. In 2004 he founded RoboCupJunior in the Netherlands and has served on the Soccer TC for several years. He was the chair of the RCJ LOC for the World Championships in 2013. He developed a learning line for robotics in lower and middle grade schools that has been in use in over 90 schools.\nCurrently he is a member of the Tech United robot soccer team where he develops deep learning software for the Turtle robots of the TU/e. His research focuses on modeling the behavior of competing teams on a symbolic level, combining knowledge engineering with deep learning.\nA new Python based version of Acquaint is being used for RoboCup MSL game analysis, in which symbolic reasoning is used as a basis for learning to understand playing strategies of competing teams.\nRecently he started working on AI based integrated home energy management, combining information from solar panels, energy usage and thermostats to determine the most economic use of electrical floor heating, heat pump or conventional CH installations using the Home Assistant software environment.",

Walked on table top and detected edges. Used 4 interconnected Motorola HC11 processors.\n\nStepper - 2 legged robot with 6 servo's in each leg and pressure sensors in it's feet was able to maintain balance on a slowly moving platform. Could lift one foot and shift weight onto other leg to make a step. This robot became the pre-cursor to the robots from the TU Delft Leg Lab, which developed robots like Mike, Denise and Tulip.\n\nThese robots are now in possession of Rijksmuseum Boerhaave.",
