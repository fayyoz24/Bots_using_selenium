    "summary": "Aarti Gupta is Professor of Global Environmental Governance with the Environmental Policy Group, Department of Social Sciences, Wageningen University, the Netherlands. Her research is in the field of global environmental and climate governance, with a focus on transparency and accountability in governance, and the challenges of anticipatory governance of novel technologies (including biotechnology and climate engineering). She has published widely on these topics, including Transparency in Global Environmental Governance: Critical Perspectives (2014, MIT Press). \n\nAt Wageningen University\u2019s Environmental Policy Group, Aarti coordinates the \u2018Governing Climate Futures\u2019 research theme. She is the principal investigator of \u2018The Transformative Potential of Climate Transparency\u2019 (TRANSGOV) project, funded by the Netherlands Organization for Research. She also co-leads the international REIMAGINE consortium project on anticipatory climate governance in vulnerable regions of the global South. She is a co-founder of the university-wide interdisciplinary REDD@WUR network consisting of over 80 researchers working on climate-forest interactions.\n\nInternationally, she is a member of the Scientific Steering Committee of the Earth System Governance (ESG) research alliance, the largest network of social scientists working on sustainability, and a Coordinating Lead Author of the 2018 ESG Science Plan. She is Series Co-editor of the Cambridge Elements in Earth System Governance series (CUP), and was Associate Editor of the journal Global Environmental Politics (MIT Press) from 2012-2020. She has also been a member of the Academic Working Group on Climate Engineering Governance, and Vice-Chair of an EU COST Action on Transformations in Global Environmental Governance.\n\nShe holds a PhD from Yale University, with a background in political science, international relations, and science and technology studies. Prior to moving to the Netherlands, she completed research fellowships at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Science, Policy and Outcomes, and Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government. Aarti has combined this research trajectory with working outside of academia as well, including with the United Nations Development Programme in New York, Oxfam-Novib in the Hague, and Transparency International in Berlin.\n\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PEUC8PkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\nResearch Gate (with downloads of publications): https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aarti_Gupta3",
