    "summary": "Helping people achieve their goals, that\u2019s what I am good at. It is what drove me early in my career working behind the scenes in theaters and on festivals. And it is what drives me now as a standardization consultant, helping technical experts draft their knowledge into standards. Standards that make products and processes safer, support international trade and make the world more transparent. \n\nStudying to be an industrial design engineer I was taught to be a generalist, having basic knowledge of many subjects. This proved to a great  basis for my now almost 15-year career. Topics I have thus far worked on range from lighting design and business development, to standardization and food safety validation.  It shows my flexibility, and genuine interest in emerging myself in new subjects, and the people involved. \n\nI take pride in having been described as loyal, social, structured and fun to be around.
