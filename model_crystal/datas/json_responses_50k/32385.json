    "summary": "I am from India and a recent graduate of Masters in Youth Studies from Utrecht University. I am a patient and hardworking individual, who divides time equally for the activities and work I am passionate about. I have taken part in various extracurricular activities such as soccer, dance and arts. As an avid sports enthusiast and a soccer player (since the age of six), I have honed my skillsets as a team leader and a team player. I am resilient and I adapt well to new settings and beginnings. \nIn school, I mentored and worked with underprivileged students (ages 14 to 17) who needed academic help and someone to bond with. This was followed by a 3-year Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Psychology, where I learnt personality, child psychology, abnormal psychology, cognitive and neuropsychology through various interpretations of readings and case studies. \nI followed this with a Masters in Counselling Psychology. I have worked with students and \nadults of different age groups I studied and administered relevant psychological tests based on \nattitude, emotional intelligence, personality, subjective well-being, body image, and other mental health tests. In the last year of my Masters Degree, I completed my dissertation on young adults aged 18 to 35, in \u2018Body Image and Exercise Attitude among Female Gym Enthusiasts\u2019.  \nOver the years I have interned and worked at clinics and at a non-profit organisation where I conducted workshops and applied therapeutic techniques for clients with various mental health problems and disorders. \nAs a career, I look forward to working with the well-being of students and teenagers in schools or non-profit organisations, as I believe early intervention is the best prevention.",
