    "summary": "As an electrical engineer I am interested in the (hidden) information content of signals. My expertise is in the field of (digital) signal processing, information theory and communication theory. At the Eindhoven University of Technology I studied Electrical Engineering with a focus on signal processing during my master. In my master I have followed courses on control systems, signal processing, measurements in medicine and various math courses. During my internships and master thesis assignment I gained experience and knowledge about sample-and-hold circuits for analog-to-digital converters, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, coherence analysis and neurofeedback respectively. During my Ph.D. I gained knowledge about body sensor networks (BSNs), biometrics and security, i.e., cryptographic primitives and protocols.\n\nSkills: Matlab (numerical calculation software), Mathematica (symbolic and numerical mathematical software), Visual C/C++/C# (programming software), .NET (applicatieframework), Eclipse (programming software), NetBeans (programming software) and LaTeX (markup language)",
