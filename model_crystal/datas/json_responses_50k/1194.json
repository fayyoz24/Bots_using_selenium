However, despite organizations\u2019 increased efforts and significant investments towards that end, D&I policies with the aim of creating a diverse and inclusive workforce are often found to be ineffective.\n\nGiven the well-established impact of leaders on employees' work experiences and their roles as implementers of D&I interventions, leaders likely play an essential role in cultivating inclusive workplaces. However, scholarly attention to this role has been scarce. My Ph.D. project is focused on investigating the role of leadership in fostering and supporting an organizational climate for inclusion, and the impact of the leader on employees' inclusion experiences. Using a multi-method approach, this project aims to contribute to filling this critical gap in the literature.",

Some social identity groups (e.g., women, ethnic minority employees, LHBTI+'s) are associated with negative stereotypes that generate barriers to finding employment, advancing to senior levels and receiving organizational rewards and benefits. While many organizations have made an effort to remove the most overt barriers and reduce employment discrimination, subtle barriers built into organizational systems continue to privilege employees from dominant social groups.
