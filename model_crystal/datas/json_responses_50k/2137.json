    "summary": "I'm a Peruvian environmental geographer trying to tackle climate change through the restoration of ecological function in multi-land use degraded systems. I am extremely passionate about brainstorming and implementing regenerative, robust, and adaptive strategies which can mitigate the effects of climate change and contribute to the enhancement of people's livelihoods. With work experiences in technical and ecologically focused tasks, I have never isolated or ignored the human-environment interaction. This is because I am passionate about landscape governance and the diverse approaches that people have towards the land they live on, and I am especially passionate about merging these different viewpoints on how to manage land in order to achieve the most sustainable use possible.
