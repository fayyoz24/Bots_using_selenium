It created awareness for the next steps forward to increase local collaboration in creating sustainable palm oil landscapes.\n\nI organised two multi-stakeholder events in Kinshasa, DRC, in collaboration with WNF and Proforest, with a direct link to the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 agenda: https://www.tfa2020.org.
