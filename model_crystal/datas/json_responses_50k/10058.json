The project involved volunteering at the Rainbow Centre, a school for learning disabled children, raising awareness for disabilities within the school community at Tanglin Trust School, and presenting his service to a group of representatives from the World Federation United Nations Association (WFUNA). The group aided the school in integrating a new sports program into the children's lessons. This enabled me and my group to form amazingly close relationships with these children and succeeded in improving their lifestyle through sports. The dedication, perseverance and commitment to this project has all been worth the effort of getting these children to stay active during their school day."

As a skill, I furthered my learning of diving and engaged with special courses to properly identify fish in coral reefs. In terms of direct service, I performed a beach clean-up on an uninhabited island that is slowly becoming a trash island. As a result, my team carried away 260kg of waste from the small island. This 5-day service trip aided the local community in Rawa Island, Malaysia by cleaning the beaches and coral reefs. "
