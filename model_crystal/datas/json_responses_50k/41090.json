    "summary": "I'm a choreographer and musician based in The Netherlands, with many years of experience in contemporary dance as well as in alternative music. \nAfter graduating from The National Ballet School Of Canada in 1997 I came to Holland where I danced for Nederlands Dans Theater for nine years.\nIn 2005 I created my first choreography, Track, for NDT. The piece was very well received and the following year I decided to dedicate myself full-time to my own creative projects. I then created several performances for Korzo Productions in The Hague as well as for Holland Dance Festival and Aura Dance Company (Lithuania). \nIn 2012 I co-founded OFF Projects, a collective with whom I create multi-disciplinary performances and events. With OFFprojects I've presented my work all over The Netherlands as well as in Germany, France, Czech Republic and the UK. \nSince a young age I've been involved in music. I'm the lead singer and song-writer of the indie-rock band Noblesse, and I compose all the music for my choreographies as well as for other choreographers such as Johan Inger and Ana Reti among others. \nBellow you can read more about my various activities and please don't hesitate to contact me if you have a question. \n\n",

A collaboration with musician Spinvis, Howl is a crossover between a talkshow, dance performance and concert.\n\n\u201cIt is not only the multidisciplinary form of HOWL that makes the production suitable for an international tour. Probably a more important element of the piece is the way Amos Ben-Tal enters into a dialogue with the audience, a necessary concept within nowadays society. By searching for the diversity, the complex and at the same time universal and common ground of humankind, Amos invites us for a conversation. Supported by the exceptional skills of the performers, he makes us become aware of our own humanity.\u201d",

Founded in 2012, the group creates multi-disciplinary performances and events using dance, music, text and visual art. OFFprojects believe in work that is raw and modular, while being challenging and appealing at the same time. In March 2014 OFFprojects premiered their first full-evening production OFFline. The show received rave reviews and was soon followed by their second full-length, the equally well received Might. In its short existence the group has already performed extensively all over The Netherlands and abroad and has presented installations and live-music nights at festivals such as Cadance and Holland Dance Festival. \nThe group\u2019s uniqueness is in that every member has a secondary expertise except for dancing, resulting in every aspect of the production being done in-house and forming part of a conceptual whole. Except for Amos the group further consists of Aur\u00e9lie Cayla (coordinator/education), Yvan Dubreuil (dramturgy) and Milena Twiehaus (design and media).",
