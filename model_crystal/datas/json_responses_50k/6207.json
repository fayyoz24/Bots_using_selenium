    "summary": "Passionate student with an interdisciplinary background from Aalborg University, currently pursuing a Master of Urbanism at TU Delft.\n\nIn the first year of my master's, I've explored flood-preventing solutions and neighbourhood transformations through a socio-ecological lens. Additionally, I've taken an alternative approach to the textile industry, exploring the use of algae as a substitute for plastic and reimagining textile usage from a different perspective.\n\nFor my second year, I will delve into my master's thesis while curating Atlantis Magazine with my fellow editors. We aim to explore different aspects of urbanism and landscape architecture through various media, focusing on \"-topias\" such as \"atopias,\" \"utopias,\" and \"heterotopias\" in three different issues.\n\nIf you're interested in what I do, want to contribute to the magazine, or simply meet for coffee, feel free to connect!",

            "description": "This project outlines a design proposal for a hybrid building in Aalborg Airport, Denmark. It aims to connect the city to the airport via a hybrid building that conforms to the surrounding landscape. The design also aims to highlight, through the building\u2019s construction, a green connection from the city to the existing terminal building and its surroundings.\nThe design proposal is highly affected by a theoretical paper that explores the relationship between mobility, cities and airports, as well as their impact on each other through history. The paper concludes that the development of mobility is a factor that blurs the boundary between cities and airports. This statement, amongst others, is explored further in this project through a variety of methods such as site analysis, fieldwork, cases and model studies.\nThe final result of this project, Landingen, is a hybrid building that attracts both the existing airport users and city residents. It navigates the different users by providing different pedestrian areas: slow- and fast tracks combined with 5-, 10- and 15 minute routes. Through these areas, the users are led to a lively ground floor that contains a variety of functions, such as restaurants, an information center and a bakery, which enhance the sense of the place. The volumes above the ground floor encourage growing companies to establish themselves in this developing part of Aalborg, where they will be able to work nationally and easily connect internationally through a neighboring airport. Furthermore, through its diversity of functions, this hybrid building seeks to become a destination of its own. Landingen is the first step into developing Aalborg Airport from being primarily a transit area to an urban area for mixed-use development. Hopefully, it will make the airport part of a larger upcoming community and attract more users while benefiting the city, the airport, and the development of the city\u2019s mobility.",
