    "summary": "I am a young professional with a solid technical background and an analytical way of thinking. I can describe myself as a social, motivated, structural, pragmatic and innovative person, but there is still enough to learn. \n\nThe bachelor Civil Engineering applied me with analytical, technical and mathematical skills to solve engineering related problems. The master Geotechnical Engineering provided me with engineering skills to identify and solve foundation, geomechanic and offshore related geotechnical problems. My master thesis contributed to comprehensive understanding in installation of offshore monopiles, related to wind turbines. \n\nBesides my technical education I spend time developing my non-technical organisational skills by means of other education related commissions and activities. My aim is to further develop a more broader engineering knowledge and non-technical managerial skills while focusing on the marine construction industry. I will achieve this by following extra courses, immersing myself in complex/multidisciplinary projects, fulfilling a range of roles, in unknown territory and working abroad.",

                    "description": "During the master phase the University of Delft provides the possibility to work on a project with other students from different specialisations in a foreign country. Together with five other students we designed a marina for Isla Mart\u00edn Garcia located between Argentina and Uruguay. During this project we stayed in Buenos Aires. Besides applying my geotechnical knowledge, in order to design the harbour, the entire project included: lobbying for a project, composing a team, finding sponsors and arranging practical matters.\n\nhttp://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A88365933-c5b3-43f6-9658-b76803a050c5/",
