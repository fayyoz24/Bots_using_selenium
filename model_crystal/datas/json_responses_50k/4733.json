    "summary": "My interest in biology started at a young age and I decided to perform my Bachelor and Master studies in Science in particularly molecular biology and biotechnology. I continued my PhD program in molecular virology at the University of British Columbia in Canada and returned to the Netherlands where I continued as a postdoctoral researcher at the Science faculty, Leiden University. During my time as a researcher I increasingly got interested in professions that have more social interactions and individual attention. \n\nI switched to recruitment in the Pharma, Biotech and Chemical industry. As a recruiter I built a network with various companies to facilitate between professionals, and their career ambitions, and the employers\u2019 needs as well as vacancies in order to make the best match. \n\nIn my current role as a Career Counselor my ambition is to share my knowledge and experience from recruitment & science with students from Leiden University and LUMC and contribute to career orientation and a smoother transition to the labour market. \n\n#career #service #counselor #leiden #university\n\nProfile Photo taken by Maartje ter Horst.\nBanner De Stad Leiden, Illustration of schaven, aardrijkskunde: 161160390",

In general, assays are designed to identify genotoxic (GTX) carcinogenic characteristics of chemicals. However, assays to identify non-genotoxic (NGTX) carcinogenic features of chemicals are lacking. NGTX carcinogens have been characterized as chemicals that are associated with cancer induction and promotion via various mode of action. \n\nWe investigated whether embryonic stem (ES) cells combined with toxicogenomics is a valuable in vitro model system to determine the intrinsic NGTX carcinogenic potential of chemicals. We examined early cellular effects and corresponding gene expression profiles in mES cells after exposure to several established NGTX carcinogens with different modes of action.\n\nKeywords: Molecular Toxicology, Bioinformatics, Cell Biology, Biochemistry",
