    "summary": "Science and innovation practices fascinate and drive me. I think that (content-related) strategy or policies and the organisation (and actual implementation of that strategy) should always be in synergy to create the best results. I really like to combine both in my work and I can also easily convert long-term strategic goals into practical short-term plans. \n\nAfter finishing my PhD-dissertation on science policy and sociology of science at Utrecht University, I continued to be interested in research and innovation policy. I started working at the Dutch National Research Agenda initiative and later also joined NWO, the Dutch national research council. Here I worked as Management Board Member of JPI Urban Europe and as coordinator of one of the parts of the NWA. After that I worked as department manager at the Mathematics departement at Utrecht University.\n\nCurrently I'm working as Programme Director at the Netherlands eScience Center where I'm responsible for the project portfolio and the call portfolio. I love contribution to the strategy of the eScience Center and making sure it adds to the practices of research software engineering.",

            "description": "Science policies try to steer scientists to conduct societally relevant research. This societal relevance is often expressed in large societal goals, such as addressing sustainability or helping with the problems that an ageing society might bring. Emerging technologies, like nanotechnology, are often surrounded by large expectation on how they might contribute to societal progress. It is however unclear how such broad and unarticulated ambitions relate to the actual development of new technologies. This research intends to study how the different articulations of broad societal challenges are used by many different actors to specify, justify and legitimate different directions of research within nanotechnologies. It studies the Dutch national nanotechnology program, NanoNextNL. Large societal goals, like sustainability, the ageing society, responsible innovation and valorization, are unquestionably normative and summarize a broad and undetermined spectrum of possible specifications. By articulating a societal goal, a connection is made between the big word and a specific direction in science or technology. For example, the phrase \u2018new medicine will help an ageing society\u2019 is an articulation of the ageing society. The ageing society is specified, because \u2018the ageing society\u2019 as is a broad concept, but apparently new medicine will help. At the same time the \u2018new medicine\u2019 is being legitimized: it is generally accepted that is a good thing to address the problems associated with the ageing society, so if new medicine can help, new medicine is also a good thing. This study shows that some articulations have been articulated very often and have become taken for granted, while others require much more explanation. For example saying a solar panel is sustainable is generally accepted without explaining why this is so. This study has important conclusions and implications for (science) policymakers and for scientists.",

This is reflected in science policy which increasingly steers research to goals like solving sustainability, addressing responsible innovation or finding solutions for an ageing society. It is however unclear how such broad and unarticulated ambitions relate to the actual development of new technologies. \nThis study intends to study how the different articulations of broad societal challenges are used by many different actors to specify, justify and legitimate different directions of research within nanotechnologies. Understanding the dynamics of these processes helps to benefit from the potential of nanotechnology and can help see how steering of science is taking place.",
