    "summary": "David Patterson gratefully acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation as the traditional owners of the land now called Sydney, Australia, where he was born. He believes we can learn much from Aboriginal Australians and other indigenous peoples about a sustainable balance between people and planet. Patterson has over 25 years' experience in global health, law and development with the UN system, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs including the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), UNAIDS, UNDP, WHO, ILO, and the (former) International HIV/AIDS Alliance. His academic qualifications include masters\u2019 degrees in law (McGill), and public policy & management (London - SOAS), as well as post-graduate studies in community health (Montreal), adult education, and program evaluation (IPDET - World Bank & Carleton U). In 1993 Patterson co-founded the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and later, as Director of International Programs, created the Network's HIV and law programs in the Caribbean and in East Africa. From 2009-2023 he initiated and advised IDLO's Health Law Program. Patterson has mobilized over US $12 million to strengthen and expand HIV-related legal services and rights in more than 25 low and middle-income countries and to build legal capacity to address non-communicable diseases. Patterson also led IDLO\u2019s collaboration with WHO on global health law and produced the 2017 report \u2018Advancing the Right to Health: the vital role of law\u2019 (written by Prof. Roger Magnusson and co-published with WHO, the O\u2019Neill Institute and the University of Sydney.) Patterson is a member of the Groningen Centre for Health Law,  a PhD Candidate in the Faculty of Law at the University of Groningen, and a founding member of the Law and Public Health Section of the European Public Health Association (EUPHA). His current research is on the role of human rights law in the global response to climate change, through a public health lens.",

Over this period I expanded IDLO\u2019s health law program to include East Africa region through grants from the World Bank, the DREAMS Innovation Fund and PEPFAR/UNAIDS. I supported program implementation, including through field visits, including to Middle East and North Africa region (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon) and to East Africa (Uganda). In June 2015 I led a multi-agency scoping mission to Uganda to assess opportunities for addressing the issue of falsified medicines. During this period I built relationships with leading health agencies which led to  MOUs between IDLO and WHO, UNAIDS, and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA).  In addition, I contributed to thought leadership and policy dialogue in health, law and development through research, publications, conferences and other external meetings, in collaboration with academic and other partners. This included building  links with academic institutions in the Netherlands, including the University of Groningen, with which IDLO cohosted a seminar on NCDs and law in 2015 in our branch office in The Hague. In February 2016 I organized a thematic discussion on NCDs and law at the UN Interagency Task Force on NCDs, at UN Headquarters in New York. I also strengthened IDLO\u2019s networks, alliances, and partnerships with relevant governments, multilateral organizations, NGOs and civil society organizations, universities, and think-tanks. In 2015 I was appointed as a Commissioner to the Lancet Commission on Obesity.",
