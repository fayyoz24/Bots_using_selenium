This needs to change and SHIFFT is working to address this urgent and complex dimension of the zero-carbon transition.\n\nSHIFFT is an INTERREG 2 Seas project that is stimulating the adoption of low-carbon heating in existing residential and community buildings. There is enormous potential to reduce CO2 emissions through the adoption of low carbon heating, but a lack of awareness and knowledge on the technical options available and the benefits of sustainable heating; as well as the upfront investment costs of measures, can mean progress is slow. SHIFFT is helping to address this by installing measures in a number of pilot areas to demonstrate sustainable heating; working with citizens to raise awareness, remove barriers, develop incentives and co-create solutions for a transition to sustainable heating; developing city-based strategies in the 4 seas countries; and developing best practice to share.",
