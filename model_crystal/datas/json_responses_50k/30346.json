The synthesis process involved ball-milling techniques to ensure homogeneity and desired properties. Subsequently, I conducted characterization of the electrolyte, focusing on two key aspects: determining its ionic conductivity and elucidating its crystal structure, including identifying the precise space group. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the ionic conductivity, while X-Ray Diffraction analysis provided insights into the crystalline arrangement. To extract meaningful information from the acquired data, I employed the GSAS-II software for comprehensive analysis.",
