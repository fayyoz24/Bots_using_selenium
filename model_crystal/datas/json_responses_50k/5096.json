Guided by tutors, our team brainstormed on how to make the product, improve it as well as determine who could make a prototype and who could fabricate the product.\n\nOur proposed prototype was an alternative solution to the Municipality of Groningen's decision to reduce nitrogen (greenhouse gas) emissions by reducing livestock numbers. The patented technology could be used to treat and decrease the levels of toxic components present in the soil currently used by farmers across the Province.",

These cases were to be solved by students, from a socio-technical point of view. \n- Worked with both 2nd and 3rd year bachelor students when chairing Informant Sessions to guide students with their line of reasoning when writing a research proposal to solve the synthesis cases. \n- Assisted two professors closely during Team-Based Lessons (TBL) to guide students in the understanding of the course concepts. Doing so improved my confidence as well as communicative, organisational and problem-solving skills.\n\nSuccesses include: Pass rate of 85% and above for the assigned group of students.",
