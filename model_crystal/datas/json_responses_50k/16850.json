    "summary": "Suzanne is a transdisciplinary design practitioner and researcher, with a particular interest in the use of design to empower others to see, understand, re-imagine and redesign complex systems collaboratively and regeneratively. \n\nShe has an academic background in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, with a specialization in Social- & Organizational Psychology. During her MA in Sustainable Design, the majority of her work focused on researching how design can best be of service to others with the aim of helping them develop the agency to apply a systems perspective to our world and its current challenges. Suzanne is fascinated by the power of stories, metaphors, questions, places and generative dialogue to engage diverse stakeholders and empower them to collaboratively redesign problematic systems into healthier ones. \n\nIn her work, Suzanne co-designs creative strategies on multi-stakeholder systemic design projects, specifically challenges concerning equity in health systems. She seeks to facilitate change through designing research-informed tools, experiences and other resources which aim to: 1. help others see their own role in constructing, sustaining and changing systems 2. spark dialogue, collaboration and co-creation and 3. equip people to be effective leaders, innovators and changemakers within their own systemic contexts. Suzanne believes that, although the dark side of design can be exploitative and reinforce many of the problems that currently exist, design can be a catalyst for significant positive change too. \n\nDesign has the power to contribute to our understanding, shape how we grapple with challenges, bring people together and imagine a different world into being. Suzanne joined the Sonder Design Collective and the Systems Innovation Network to further explore these design powers alongside inspiring collaborators with aligned values and a commitment to contribute to empowering, participatory and impactful change. She hopes their design work will continue to be a force to inspire, guide and empower others on the path to more inclusive, sustainable and regenerative futures in which we humans rediscover the power of doing things together.\n\n\nIndividual & Systemic Flourishing I Soft Systems Thinking I Practical Pedagogy, Play I Cybernetics, Reflexivity, Meta Design I Effective Altruism, Positive Sumness I Working with(in) Complexity I (Collective) Sensemaking I Transdisciplinary Research & Pluriversal Design I Discursive Design & Experience Design I Minimalism, Essentialism, Happiness research I Collective intelligence",
