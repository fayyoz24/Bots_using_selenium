    "summary": "The ability to visualize things in their spatial setting sparked my interest and developed affinity for GIS. Numerous GIS applications, especially remote sensing for land and water management, excite me as I can see the usual 'UNSEEN' and contribute to improving irrigation systems' performances for optimal and sustainable use of scarce water resources and increasing land productivity. I am a fast learner and can adapt very quickly. I possess an extraordinary zeal to achieve my targets and goals within the stipulated time frame. I am always willing to work hard and acquire new skills. I firmly believe that learning is the key to societal transformation and is essential for ensuring society's economic, cultural and ecological vitality.",
