    "summary": "Originally an electrical engineer, I have shifted through various fields over the years. After studying multidisciplinary engineering subjects in a combined Bachelor and Master's Program at the University of Patras in Greece, I specialised in Electric Power Systems and Control. Then I moved to the Netherlands and the Eindhoven University of Technology, where I acquired my second Master's degree in Systems and Control.\n\nDuring my studies I did my internship in Preceyes, a medical robotics company and my MSc thesis at Aris, a computer vision company. My master thesis was about automatic flower counting from partial detections and the continuation of my work led to a publication in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture (Elsevier).\n\nAfterwards I worked for 2.5 years as a robotics engineer in the automotive sector (TNO automotive), where I was responsible for the development of algorithms for advanced driver-assistance systems. Other responsibilities were integration and testing in instrumented vehicles, involvement in European research projects as well as interaction with clients and technical knowledge transfer.\n\nCurrently I am working on automated guided vehicles, as an embedded software engineer at Lely. Among my responsibilities are the development of robotic algorithms for barn and feeding solutions, mentorship of junior colleagues as well as being in contact with the field farms for root cause analysis and solution of blocking issues. Being involved and interested in Agile software development, I had a short tenure as a Scrum master in a software team, where I helped cultivating an environment of self-management and transparency and improving the team's way of working.\n\nI am particularly enthusiastic about clean code principles and design patterns, which I try to apply during software development and inspire my peers about them as well.\n\nIn my free time, as part of personal projects, I have worked in web application development, mostly on the front-end side.",

In this case, this nudge is visual and is being broadcasted via an HMI (Human-Machine Interface).\n\nIn this project I have participated as part of the TNO partner.",

Firstly, the Domain Specific Language (DSL) that the agents use to communicate is created and then the system architecture of the cooperating agents is established.  Event stream communication is used for individual agents to exchange event messages through a bus, upon which a Life Cycle State Machine (LCSM) is built. This machine is the discrete coordination between all involved Car agents, which is coordinated by a Central agent. Furthermore, the single-agent behaviour is modelled in a way to resemble real-life conditions (changing weather conditions) and finally a graphical interface is created, so that the user can interact with the system. The software is developed in Python and C++.",

The forces that act on\nthese particles are gravity and the elastic and viscous forces due to the contact with\nneighbouring particles. The new position and velocity of each particle is determined by means\nof the Verlet explicit time integration scheme. In order to reduce the simulation time of the process, a new cell algorithm is implemented. The idea behind this algorithm is that for sufficiently large cell dimension, it can be assumed that a particle only interacts with the other particles in the cell and the particles in neighbouring cells. In this way the number of evaluations in particle interaction routine is reduced significantly and thus the computation time is much smaller. The software is developed in C.",

This is achieved by solving the data association problem based on the flower detections by using Multiple Hypothesis Tracking. In this way, tracking through occlusions is possible, double counting is avoided and errors of the detection algorithm can be corrected. The software is developed in C++ using the ROS middleware.\n\nAchievements:\n\u2022\tDevelopment of a counting software with promising experimental results\n\u2022\tImprovement of the counting accuracy, with respect to the original counting method of Aris\n\u2022\tCo-authorship of a paper for Computers and Electronics in Agriculture September 2021 - link below",
