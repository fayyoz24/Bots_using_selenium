    "summary": "If you need empowerment and coaching for your multicultural talent to top, I would  love to talk to you\n\nI am a professional with extensive experience in software development, maintenance and as servant leader leading co-located and distributed agile teams.\n\nMy recent couple of years were primarily focused in enabling multi-cultural (especially Indian Workforce) teams to achieve empowerment, motivation in their day-to-day work thereby make them more focused and efficient. Technically, I am backed by Agile methodology and its implementations but interestingly I acquired experience in people coaching skills by holistically understanding and dealing with their daily challenges. I get energy working with people.\n\nMy experience in working with global development teams has allowed me to interact and harness the best of the people, bridging the work cultural gaps and motivate them to put their discretionary effort in the work. I am a great link that connects business and people. I believe culture and work relationship has a strong connection and if that becomes a mystery, it should be unraveled through a more integrated training & coaching.\n\nNext to that, I practice mindfulness & meditation. My diverse and rich experience makes me the ideal candidate to help you with your agile and people coaching needs. \n",
