    "summary": "Flashback to ten years back, I recall always having the drive to try new things. Be it learning a new instrument, joining the school badminton team, or going on camping trips, I've always loved pushing my boundaries. This hunger to grow eventually seeped into my academic life as I started my journey as an electrical engineer. \n\nIn my undergraduate study at BITS Pilani, I tried out things ranging from image processing to astrophysics and existential philosophy. I even landed up in South Korea to pursue my undergraduate thesis! In the end, when the dust settled, I realized my interests were along microelectronics and MEMS devices. This brought me to TU Delft where I further developed an inclination towards multidisciplinary work, wherein multiple fields of study converge to solve a problem. My desire to push boundaries led me to also complete the grueling Honours Programme in addition to my regular Master's Programme. \nThrough all my endeavors, I have gained experience in many different fields, ranging from IC design to chip tapeouts, PCB Design, Device Modelling, and even mechanical FEA simulations. I did these by playing around in softwares like Cadence, Kikad, MATLAB, Altium, Vivado and COMSOL. \nFeel free to drop a message if you want to have a chat sometime!",
