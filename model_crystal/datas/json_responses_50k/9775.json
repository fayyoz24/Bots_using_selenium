    "summary": "I am a Jordan-Licensed clinical psychologist. I hold a master\u2019s degree in clinical neuropsychology (MSc) and have completed both my BSc. and MSc. at Dutch research-based universities. My academic focus was on autism spectrum disorders, ADHD and child (neuro)psychology. I have experience conducting research and collaborating with researchers from multiple disciplines and research methods.\nClinically, I am trained to conduct neuropsychological and cognitive evaluations and treatments. In addition to this, I apply a variety of research-based therapeutic techniques with my clients including CBT, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Narrative Therapy and stress control. I work closely with adults and adolescents with different mental health conditions such as trauma, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, ADHD and emotional regulation problems. I now work as a therapist at a private clinic.\n\nFor inquiries please contact me on: lamaalabed1@gmail.com",

The present study aimed to investigate whether healthy and ADHD-diagnosed adults with credible performances, differed from those with non-credible performances on working memory (WM), vigilance, divided attention and planning ability. The second aim was to explore whether the difference(s) found could add value to symptom validity tests (SVTs), in predicting failing or passing a performance validity test (PVT). \nMethod: An ADHD-group (N= 68) and a control group (N=139) were explored separately. The \nGroningen Effort Test (GET) was used as a PVT to classify individuals into credible and non-\ncredible subgroups. The two sub-samples of each group were compared on their performances on NBV, WAFV, TMT-B and TOL tests, using a Mann Whitney U-Test. \nResults: Individuals with non-credible scores did not differ from those with credible scores on any of the neuropsychological tests, in both the ADHD-diagnosed and the control groups. In the healthy group, the non-credible subsample was slower than the credible sub-sample on divided \nattention (TMT-B), after the GET cutoff score was adjusted. Performance on TMT-B, along \nwith performance on SVTs, failed to predict the healthy group\u2019s credibility-classification. \nConclusion: The results contradicted our initial hypotheses of finding a difference between \nthe credible and non-credible groups. The possible lack of correspondence between SVTs and \nPVTs highlights the need for using multiple validity tests in ADHD adult evaluations.  ",

Variables examined were \u2018core symptoms of\nASD\u2019, \u2018comorbid symptoms\u2019, and \u2018cognitive developmental skills\u2019. In total, twenty studies\nwere included in this systematic review. Girls and boys with ASD were compared on\ncommunication, socialization and repetitive/restrictive behaviors (RRB) as core features of\nASD. Internalizing problems, externalizing problems, medical and psychiatric comorbidities,\nadaptive functioning, sleeping problems, eating problems, and generalized overgrowth were\nall inspected as comorbid symptoms. Finally, motor skills, visual reception and expressive\nand receptive language skills were compared between the sexes.\nResults: Although girls and boys with ASD were compared on a broad range of symptoms in\nthis review, mixed findings were reported with regard to almost all the areas of functioning.\nThe traits that girls and boys with ASD were consistently found not to differ on were somatic\ncomplaints, withdrawal tendencies, aggressive behavior, medical and psychiatric\ncomorbidities and eating problems.",
