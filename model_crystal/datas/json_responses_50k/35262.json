    "summary": "I joined the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) in 1975 and completed my training as a Naval engineering officer in 1979. Graduation was followed by a one year scientific study in metallurgy, at the Technical University of Delft.\n\nAfter three operational assignments (destroyers, Leander- & S-class frigate, I was transferred in 1985 to the maintenance group in Den Helder, where I was appointed to set up a 24/7 engineering support team. Another two operational assignments (Supply Ship and Hydrographical Survey vessel) as a chief engineering officer followed. In1990 I was appointed assistant director of the Naval engineering school in Amsterdam. This appointment was followed by another two operational assignments as a chief engineering officer. \n\nIn 1997 I was promoted LTCDR and was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Naval Academy to be a coach for engineering officers. In 1998 I attended the Staff Course. This 9 month course was followed by an assignment as deputy head R&D.

The security domain includes national defense and security, which is a task of the Ministry of Defense in The Netherlands, as well as security of infrastructure and people. To achieve this objective, four research themes have been defined:\n1) System concepts and architectures\n2) Analog front-ends\n3) Digital signal processing \n4) Algorithms, software and methodology.\nIn addition to the four research themes, two non-research themes have been defined. The theme \u201cEnd-user integration\u201d creates an intermediary layer between the research themes and end-users. It translates the demands of end-users to input for the research themes in a top-down process and vice versa to verify in a bottom-up process the application potential of STARS technology. The theme \u201cKnowledge impact\u201d is aimed at the dissemination of the knowledge and technology developed during the STARS project.",
