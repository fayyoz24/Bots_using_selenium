    "summary": "At Edmond de Rothschild REIM, I am working with our fund- and asset mangement teams to make our portfolios more sustainable. Next to that, I am Portfolio Manager of the Benelux Commercial Real Estate Fund, a portfolio of 21 mostly historical office and retail buildings on prime locations in the top-6 cities of the Benelux. Furthermore, I am part of EdR REIM's General Management Council and commercial and residential Investment Committees. \n\nAt CBRE Global Investors, I was responsible for the CBRE Dutch High Street Club, a EUR 1.2 billion investment portfolio holding 30 flagship stores of mainly Bijenkorf, HEMA and other retailers on prime locations of the key cities of the Netherlands, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Eindhoven. Next to that, I was responsible for the construction of a EUR 200m convenience retail portfolio for a separate account client. \n \nFurthermore, I was heading the Dutch sustainability team of CBRE Global Investors, as I firmly believe that we (as real estate sector) can contribute significantly to the decrease of carbon emissions and to slow down climate change. Furthermore, I believe that sustainability investments are a catalyst for good performance, as well as an integral part of the long term responsible investment strategy.\n\nAs a driven investment manager, I like to solve complex problems with an entrepreneurial attitude. As a result, I have been nominated for several awards, like the ULI top 40 under 40, PropertyNL High Potential and the Yardi VGM Young Talent Award.\n\nIn 2012, I graduated for the executive Master of Real Estate course (cum laude) at the Amsterdam School of Real Estate and received the ASRE and IVBN Awards for my master thesis. Since 2005, I hold a Master of Science in Architecture, Building and Planning of the Eindhoven University of Technology. As part of my master, I followed several real estate finance and investments courses at the National University of Singapore and expanded my knowledge about the international real estate market.",

Waarvoor van harte gefeliciteerd, Martijn. Naar ons weten is hij als eerste op zoek gegaan naar de duurzaamheidspremie in de beleggingsprestaties van winkelvastgoed. Dat is een internationale primeur. Een mooi combinatie van historische, kwantitatieve analyse met een wellicht verwacht, maar heel erg goed onderbouwd resultaat. Locatie is voor de beleggingsprestaties van winkels veel belangrijker dan duurzaamheid. De jury raakte stevig overtuigd van de wetenschappelijkheid van Martijn\u2019s onderbouwing, mede op basis van een sterke literatuurstudie en een wel heel uitgebreide en complete data-analyse.\"",
