This gives a good insight in the nine views of the Business Model of a company. I can facilitate its use as a reference for detailing out the to-be Business Processes, required to achieve the objectives of the Business Model. These Business Processes on its turn can be used to drive organizational changes and/or IT adaptations and/or implementation of new IT-tools. They also can be used as a blueprint for the engineering decisions to be taken during the design of these changes.\n\nI strongly recommend this top-down approach from strategical business vision towards detailed organizational/IT changes as a critical cornerstone for the Change Management during implementation of these changes. People now understand why the changes are necessary, and not only how. They become part of the business improvement solution in stead of a change implementation problem.\n\nSee also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas \n\nor:           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FumwkBMhLo",

Master data in the sales domain (\"soft\" commercial features/options, adding value for the customers) differs from master data in the manufacturing domain (building blocks represented by \"hard\" products and software items, relevant to produce all possible configuration variants). Conditions in the manufacturing BoM automatically translate the commercial requirements into to-be picked and assembled building blocks, including manufacturing and testing instructions/documentation. \nAs part of this, also the processes for commercial catalogue creation, pricing of commercial features/options, quoting, selling, ordering, generic manufacturing BoM setup, specific order BoM creation, assembly, testing, delivery, etc have been set up and implemented internationally.\nMaster data and processes strongly support the make-to-order business that maximizes customer value (end-product according to specific customer requirements) against minimal costs (minimal number of building blocks to build all possible configurations). Design and/or production of these building blocks can eventually be outsourced to 3rd party suppliers that even can take care for replenishment.",
