The foundation plans an event every year call the \"Bike for Elephants\" where cyclist or anyone in general interested in biking takes part in a 100km bike ride in Chiang Mai, Thailand. \nI participated in the went in year 2013 along with 26 other participants coming from Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Ireland and Netherlands. The event lasted for 2 days (19th and 20th January). This wasn't only about riding a bike and donating money to help give these elephants a better life, but it was also an experience to learn more about how we can actually help these elephants. I must say although the bike ride was tiring however, I actually did enjoy the scenery during the ride and had loads of fun showering the elephants. It was one in a lifetime experience and if I were given the chance to participate again, I definitely go and this time I would love to stay longer. \n\nFind out more here: http://www.bring-the-elephant-home.org"

The network provides basic programs and activities such as giving them the opportunity to learn, receiving health checks etc. \n\nKIS International School has been providing the Hub Saidek with basic necessities such as, stationaries, books, slippers, clothing etc. Furthermore, funds were also raised through bake sales and other charity events to further help. As a student of KIS (from 2012-2014), I took the opportunity to join the network by becoming a volunteer. \n\nEvery Saturday KIS International School invites the children at the Hub Saidek to come over for 2 hours, my role as a volunteer along with other volunteers is to organize different activities such as basketball, soccer or swimming and also provide lunch to the children. \n\nThis is the link to the Hub Saidek: http://childlinethailand.org/ "
