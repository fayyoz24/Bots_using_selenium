In this, nature comes first, society is second and economy last.\nMy opinion should be seen separate from activities that are written by me or my colleagues on the LinkedIn pages of the vab.\n\nCompetencies / experienced in:\nExecutive project management, getting things done.\nSystemic thinking and acting.\nGetting a clear message across. Connecting people. Teamwork.\nMaking ends meet (even in a tight schedule).\nKeeping a complete and clear overview.\nMoving people naturaly and socialy towards a more balanced future.\n\nLess is more! A lot less might just save the future for our children.\nNature first - Society second - Economy included, but as last.",
