To do so, I looked at the interrelation of chosen trauma, identities, and belonging of Myanmarese diasporas manifested in their transnational engagement through ethnographic fieldwork. I argue that contextualizing the decades-long conflict intensified with the 2021 military coup is a key to uncovering identity construction and belongingness that are not mutually exclusive. As well it is crucial to comprehend how 14 Myanmarese diasporas make sense of themselves and home. This encompassed comprehension is unfolded from the nuances that I connected through the participants\u2019 stories over sharing meals, semi-structured individual interviews, visual ethnography, participatory observation and paying attention to the social surrogates embedded in everyday micro-practices. And beyond, the heterogeneity of Myanmarese diasporas dynamics is unpacked by the extensive observation of cross-cutting boundaries particularly, religious, and spiritual belief, intergeneration, and culturalization of transnational engagement. Hence, this study sought to bridge the gap in understanding the Myanmarese diasporas dynamic residing in Dutch and Danish contexts through transnational engagement.\n\nKeywords\n\nbelonging, chosen trauma, diaspora, transnational engagement, ethnography, identity, Myanmar, sharing meals.",

Active participation in the monthly online e-learning sessions and Summer School organized in The Hague University of Applied Sciences has enriched me with different opinions, insight and experiences from the peers across the globe on their journeys to the inclusive education  as well.\n\nThe E+CHOS project is funded through Erasmus+ KA220-HED Cooperation partnership which is led by researchers and educators from the University of West Bohemia(UWB) in the Czech Republic, Constantine the Philosopher University (CPU) in the Slovak Republic, the University for Development Studies in Ghana, along with The Hague University of Applied Sciences and the International Institute of Social Studies in the Netherlands."
