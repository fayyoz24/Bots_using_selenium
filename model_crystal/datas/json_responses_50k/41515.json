We offered a platform to young emerging visual artists to connect with private and corporate collectors. We did art consultancy for corporates and we developed and organised the  Young Art Award, an annual prize for young talent sponsored by Shell\u2019s social investment department. For our fresh approach we won an innovation award sponsored by ABN AMRO. Being a creative entrepreneur brought me many new insights, on how corporations work an think and it especially ignited my love for supporting creative \u2018changemakers\u2019.",
