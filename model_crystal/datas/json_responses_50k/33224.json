It is part of a new research project and book Go West will be working on for the coming years. As a result of our joint efforts, Go West had enough funding to start a period of fieldwork in African cities.  \n\nIn my position as a researcher in both Shanghai and Amsterdam I conducted numerous interviews with professionals and scholars in the field of China \u2013 Africa studies. Besides that, I presented our main results at conferences in China and the Netherlands and had the chance to publish about the subject. \n\nGo West Project is a multidisciplinary research and design studio focusing on the development of emerging megacities. In 2011, Go West published the book \"How the City Moved to Mr Sun - China's New Megacities\".\n\n- all pictures below are courtesy of Daan Roggeveen and were shot during fieldwork of Go West in differen African cities",
