    "summary": "Right from the beginning of my career I have have been involved in many engineering projects that started in the conceptual phase. \nI have always felt comfortable with this type of activities, but over the years I also gained much experience in detailed engineering and managing projects and managing people.\n\nMy engineering experience spreads from small consumer goods (plastic coffee cups for Douwe Egberts) to heavy industrial equipment (a 2 MegaWatt windturbine at EWT, Amersfoort), and from small product series (i.e.bearing test rigs at SKF Engineering & Research Centre in Nieuwegein, or a 30 tonnes board crane at IHC, Sliedrecht) to products that are produced at a staggering number of 80.000 pieces per day(!) at Mirror Controls International (MCi) in Montfoort (formerly: Eaton Automotive).\n\nOver the years I have been strongly active in the following areas of engineering:\n- Renewables / Wind industry\n- Heavy industrial equipment\n- Automotive industry\n- Medical equipment\n\nMy experience in various areas of engineering enables me to effectively introduce, for instance, design solutions, materials or techniques that are new to a product area or a manufacturer, but are 'common practice' in other areas of engineering.\n\nThis diversity of projects also leads to a wide variety of company types that I have worked with. One of the great challenges is to always quickly adapt to a project team or company or to a specific methodology (like 'Design for 6-Sigma') and of course to quickly understand a product and to find out how a product can most effectively be improved.\n\nI am aware of the fact that a good idea is not valued unless it is presented in the right manner, so I always pay much attention to the presentation of any result.\n\nI really this field of work and I like to be constantly expanding my horizon.\n\nErik Verdegaal",
