    "summary": "Nature's best invention? Trees.\nMankind's greatest invention? The bicycle.\n\nWould you agree? As a passionate sustainable business developer, author, and speaker, I believe the best solutions are often the simplest. \n\nSince graduating in 2013 it's been a crazy, fun, and memorable decade of entrepreneurship. Through my businesses, we made a real sustainable impact worldwide. In my private life, I learned to eat, travel, and dress sustainably and since 2022 I live in a climate-friendly house. \n\nIn 2023 I have stepped away from all professional commitments, to make some long hikes and explore new adventures.",
