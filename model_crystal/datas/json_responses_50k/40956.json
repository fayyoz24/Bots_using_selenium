I am currently Account Manager at Qima where I started as a Quality Inspector.\n\nI am characterized by being proactive, with initiative and predisposition to work as a team, passionate effective and always looking to improve myself. \nWorking in the Netherlands has allowed me to integrate into a different culture and way of working, improve my level of English and acquire skills and new responsibilities.\n\nMy colleagues would say of me that I have great capacity to relate naturally, and willingness to promote a good work environment.\n\nAt this moment I consider myself KEY for a company in 3 aspects:\n\n\u2705Decision making\n\u2705Taking risks\n\u2705Negotiate with customers/suppliers\n\nChatted? \ud83d\udcac",
