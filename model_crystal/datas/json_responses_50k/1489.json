    "summary": "Starting off as a music industry entrepreneur after setting up a record company straight out of university I have since worked in sales within IT, Advertising and Education.  I have built a successful career and have a proven track record in sales performance, team building and coaching.  Naturally positive and self-motivated, through ethical leadership and collaboration I help drive businesses forward.  \n\nAfter leaving Laureate at the end of 2016 I took a sabbatical, spending time with my family in Asia working on a project to promote Sound Healing around the world.  This experience enabled me to develop my ability to work in diverse cultural environments and improved my project management skills.  I am continuing to support Sound Healing projects in Bali and the UK through mentoring and coaching through my record label Hi-Phi Music (www.hi-phimusic.com).  I joined CEG Digital in early 2018 and have helped grow the business from 200 new students per year to now well over 3000 new students per year.\n\nI am now consulting with two companies leading the development and growth in both organisations.  These contracts draw on my passion and expertise in both music and education.  At Skilled Education I am responsible for building an OPM division to deliver a portfolio of post graduate online degrees and at Mixmasters I am responsible for running the operations of the business and being the right hand of the founder as we take on huge growth expectations.  Please email me at paul@fusionman.com or call me on +31 628928239 to discuss any potential opportunities for us to collaborate.",

Isn\u2019t beauty subjective and in the eye of the beholder?  Then, why is it in art that some things just work?  They are universally applauded and cherished for their beauty.\nCreative people have understood this for centuries and have drawn their inspiration from the beauty in nature where perfection means survival.  Think of butterfly\u2019s wings, the leaves on a tree or the spirals on a shell, these things have evolved throughout time to be perfect for their required purpose and the laws of Phi, the natural ratio of beauty, govern them all.  The golden ratio or 1:1.618 used by architects, artists and musicians to create work which is not only pleasing to the senses but also entirely functional for its purpose.  \n2006 was a wonderful year.  The summer seemed to last all year long and a label, inspired by beautiful music to seep into, was born.  Hi-Phi Music, a label that defies genre association but is rooted in natural beauty, aims to transfer this natural beauty into musical form, fit for any Hi-Fi.",
