This includes much refactoring and redesigning, documentation and testing. We organized a training session where software architects were able to use the product within only an hour of training.\n\nImprove the performance of the model extraction. Analyzing 4 million lines of code is no small task. The prototype took 5 hours to produce a model from the code base. I reduced this to 2 hours. Moreover, I made the model extraction modular, meaning users can analyze only the part of the code base they are interested in in a fraction of the time.\n\nMade a robust, tested and reliable product. The model extraction now runs every night without failing, in time to deliver an analysis report to the engineers at the start of their day.",

Furthermore, processing should be real-time on a typical consumer laptop.\n\nImplemented realistic 3D rendering.\n\nImprove the computer vision algorithms. In a short time, I learned how the computer vision algorithms worked and was able to make substantial improvements. Benchmarks showed that my improvements increased the number of recognized points by more than 25% and greatly reduced point mislabeling. This improves the scan accuracy and resolution.\n\nDesigned a user feedback system to improve the scan quality. It matters how the user makes the scan, so the user feedback system intuitively guides the user to obtain the best result.",

The verification suite reads the model, translates it to an internal data structure, and checks the model's consistency. It then interfaces with various back-end verification tools to perform the verification and displays the results to the user. \n\nDeveloped a verification technique for MILS-AADL based on security type checking. This resulted in the paper \"Security Type Checking for MILS-AADL Specifications\", published by the International MILS Workshop 2015.\n\nRead more about the Distributed MILS project in the \"Projects\" section.\n\nGive lectures for the practical sessions for the university courses \"Introduction to Model Checking\" and \"Semantics of Programming Languages\". This includes preparing the weekly homework exercises, grading the solutions, and preparing the exam exercises.\n\nCo-supervise a student's Master's thesis. In this thesis, we explore a case study in formal modeling and verification for a file system with mandatory access control: Files that are designated to be confidential, can only be accessed by users who have clearance for confidential files. I supervised the student in her research approach and execution, technical writing and the final presentation.\n\nFor the MOVES seminar course, supervise students in improving understanding of academic literature, technical writing skills and presentation skills. The students are required to perform literature research, write an academic paper and give a presentation on a topic related to formal verification of software.",

In this time, I have been a member of various committees. \n\nI was full-time vice-chairman of GEWIS for the college year 2008/2009. The vice-chairman is responsible for the internal organization of GEWIS, with its many committees and fraternities. When the banking crisis suddenly struck in October 2008, many members were concerned about our financial position. I successfully championed and managed spontaneous initiatives to generate revenue. One more senior student I hold in high regard, told me that my work as vice-chairman made GEWIS a more inviting and friendly place. \n\nWith some friends in the association, I founded fraternity GEPWNAGE and organized dozens of activities at the intersection of nerd culture and student life. \n\nChairman of Introduction week committee 2009."
