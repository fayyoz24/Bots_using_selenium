    "summary": "A committed policy professional with a passion for the disciplines of bioethics, health innovation, equitable access, trade and development. \n\nI have a solid public sector background encompassing project, people and policy management skills. I am organised, analytical, and enjoy both supporting, developing and learning from my colleagues.\n\nMy career has centered on health policy in an international context. I have pursued and secured experience at the World Health Organization, followed by responsibility for highly sensitive reviews of policy at the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.  My international experience was deepened during a post at UK Intellectual Property Office where I was responsible for representing the UK Government on trade and access to medicine issues. More recently I've worked directly in health research and development issues while based in Geneva at COHRED, prior to joining the Access to Medicine Foundation in Amsterdam in a management role. There I gained a deep understanding of the role (and responsibility) of the private sector in supporting access to medicine in low and middle income countries.  I was most recently in a management role at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, focused on supporting equitable access to HIV prevention interventions.\n\nSpecialities: Health policy, public consultation, intellectual property, development, stakeholder relationships, project management, communications, analytical problem solving, private sector engagement.\n\n\"One of the criticisms I've faced over the years is that I'm not aggressive enough or assertive enough, or maybe somehow, because I'm empathetic, I'm weak. I totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong.\" \n- Jacinda Ardern",
