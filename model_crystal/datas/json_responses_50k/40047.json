Most non-EU CENL libraries had their bibliographic data in TEL portal but their presence in Europeana was very low. By participating in this project, the non-EU libraries benefited by including their digitised objects in Europeana, making them available for wide distribution and use.\n\nThe project aimed to bring in any available digitised objects for onward distribution via Europeana for both end users and re-users by creating the conditions to access the material and cache it for use in Europeana Collections.\n\nThe national libraries that participated in the project were from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The project was coordinated by TEL and the National and University Library in Zagreb. The national libraries of Serbia and Slovenia had a supporting role because of their experience in delivering digital collections to Europeana.\n\nThe outcome of this initiative was  the creation of a postcard exhibition prepared by the project participants. National and University Library of Macedonia coordinated this exhibition, making sure all information and images were collected, writing a narrative around the postcards. The exhibition was launched on the 29th of March 2017 and promoted on both Europeana and provider\u2019s social media channels. \n\nhttps://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/picture-this-vintage-postcards-of-southeastern-europe\n",
