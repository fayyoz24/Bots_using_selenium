The setup designed was capable of measuring both thrust and moment of the propeller at various pitch and true air speed. \n\t\tWork performed include design, gauging and calibration of a two component strain gauge balance and thrust characterization of a 7\u201d propeller at different rpm and air-speed. The design methodology was based on concept of bending stresses produced in a cantilever beam and use appropriate instrumentation to measure the resultant strains. \n\t\t\t\tThe results obtained were used to plot thrust characteristic curves for propeller and to understand the effect of pitch change of a propeller in a flight. The plots generated were not in accordance with the theoretical results but the they were precise, so once the source of error is removed, the setup is precise enough to measure thrust and moment of the propeller.",
