    "summary": "Lauren Alexander (Cape Town, 1983) obtained a Masters degree in Design (Sandberg Institute, 2008) and an MFA from the Dutch Art Institute (2011).  She tutors in the Graphic Design bachelor and MA Non Linear Narrative of the Royal Academy of Arts in the Hague (KABK), as well as at the Sandberg Institute's MA of Experience Design \"University of the Underground\", Amsterdam. She has been a guest at Master programmes such as the MFA Dutch Art Institute (2016) and M.Des, AKV|St.Joost Breda (2017).\n\nIn 2009 Lauren co-founded Foundland Collective with Ghalia Elsrakbi, an art and design practice based between Amsterdam and Cairo. The platform enables us to explore shared research desires through art, design, writing, education and multidisciplinary collaboration. We continually experiment with different modes of working and have shifted roles from being artists, designers, editors, film directors and project organizers to educational facilitators and lecturers. Throughout our development we have critically reflected upon what it means to produce politically engaged, de-colonial storytelling from our position as non-Western artists working between Europe and the Middle East. \n\nFoundland was awarded the Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship for research in the largest Arab American archive in 2015/2016 and shortlisted for the Dutch Prix de Rome prize in 2015 and Dutch Design Awards in 2016. Several of our video works are in the Dutch Media Art Archive (LIMA), since 2021 several of our works have been acquired by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.",
