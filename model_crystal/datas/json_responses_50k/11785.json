    "summary": "No matter what my role I will always immediately assess the existing processes and ask myself, \u201chow can this be streamlined and improved upon?\u201d  Being from Scotland (where we like to save a penny here and there) I always apply this logic of process improvement and cost saving; from the smallest to the largest changes, I can positively envisage.\n\nThe more projects, products, or customers I managed in my previous roles I found that I love to be faced with a seemingly insurmountable number of open tasks and crises and that I thrive under the pressure it creates.  It brings out the alpha version of myself.  Nothing beats the feeling after all the dust is settled and sharing that satisfied feeling with my team that we \u2018did it\u2019 and with good retrospective handling will always do it even better in the future.\n\nTomTom hired me 14 years ago and from day 1 trusted me to apply all the changes and improvements I envisioned.  They put their faith in me to move through multiple roles first managing customers, agile processes, then hardware and in the end, my dream of being a Project Manager. \n\nIn my most recent role I managed multiple Automotive Customers and their digital map products and found it the perfect place to refine my Project Management skills.  My love of making things more efficient led me to successfully carry out over a 9-month period, the full migration of our existing project tracking software and data from our existing Rally platform and plugins to JIRA.  Resulting in annual savings of approx. \u20ac110K+, automation and zero transition downtime.\n\nI specialize in Project Management and process improvement and now attained my PRINCE2 Foundation certification.  I am now working on Practitioner.\n\nI have experience in Agile methodologies, Logistics and Bill of Material, support documentation, customer support, training and people management.  I am passionate about my customers and providing the highest quality.\n\nIn my personal life I have been learning Scottish Gaelic now for a number of years, am an accomplished renovator of buildings and you will usually find me in my spare time with my 3 dogs walking in the woods.",
