The transmitter collects data from a gyroscope/accelerometer and transmits data to the receiver via Bluetooth at a certain rate, fully wireless and working on battery power. The receiver receives a signal from a transmitter, converts the data and outputs the MIDI signal, which can be forwarded to any device that can play it.\n\nUnfortunately, the codebase has been lost, so no link here",
