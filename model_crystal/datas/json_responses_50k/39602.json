    "summary": "The marketing department of Giesen is, just like Giesen itself, totally self-sufficient.  There are experts available for every part of the marketing communication. Deeply grounded in the company we are striving to create a strong and consistent brand identity. Every day is different for the employees in the marketing department. We broadcast the products Giesen crafts but also try to convince everyone of the potential that lies in coffee roasting. We provide information and actively involve ambassadors, clients and distributors to provide behind the scenes views of real coffee roasting companies. One moment we\u2019re busy creating video\u2019s in our own studio, the other moment we\u2019re trying to improve the company\u2019s information supply. Or we will do our best to put together a great trade show, with all the promotional materials needed. We monitor the (visual) brand identity, keep colleagues informed, update the website, maintain social media channels and help HR to find qualified employees. \n\nI am committed to my work by continuing to develop and put this knowledge into practice. I am not afraid of responsibility, risks and challenges and I am happy to accept them. I provide an informal, pleasant and honest working environment where everyone feels comfortable. Appreciation, collaboration and delivering products provide constant motivation.",

This resulted in the graduation assignment, because to create added value for something, thorough research into the target group is needed. For this reason, PUIK has commissioned a study of how the informal care platform can become an online community so that it offers added value to the informal caregiver.",
