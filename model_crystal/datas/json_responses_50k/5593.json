The goal of IMHOTEP is to develop a concept of operations and\na set of data analysis methods, predictive models and decision support tools that allow information sharing, common\nsituational awareness and real-time collaborative decision-making between airports and ground transport stakeholders. The\nspecific objectives of the project are the following:\n1. Propose a concept of operations for the extension of airport collaborative decision-making to ground transport\nstakeholders, including local transport authorities, traffic agencies, transport operators and mobility service providers.\n2. Develop new data collection, analysis and fusion methods able to provide a comprehensive view of the door-to-door\npassenger trajectory through the coherent integration of different types of high resolution passenger movement data\ncollected from personal mobile devices and digital sensors.\n3. Develop predictive models and decision support tools able to anticipate the evolution of an airport\u2019s passenger flows\nwithin the day of operations and assess the operational impact on both airport processes and the ground transport system,\nwith the aim of enabling real-time collaborative decision-making between airports and ground transport stakeholders and\nenhanced passenger information services.\n4. Validate the proposed concept and the newly developed methods and tools through a set of case studies conducted in\ndirect collaboration with airports, local transport authorities and transport operators. The case studies will cover two airports\nwith heterogeneous characteristics and serving different markets, namely the Palma de Mallorca and the London City\nairports.",

The project is focused on the consideration of ConOps\nfor ATM integration in intermodal transport network serving Urban and Extended Urban (up to Regional) mobility, taking into\naccount the transportation and passengers service scenarios envisaged for the next decades, according to baseline (2025),\nintermediate (2035) and final (2050) time horizons. The target ConOps provided and initially validated by the X-TEAM D2D\nproject will encompass both the transportation platforms integration concepts and the innovative seamless mobility as a\nservice including ATM concepts. The developed ConOps will be preliminarily evaluated against already existing and\nspecifically defined applicable KPAs and KPIs, implementing both qualitative and quantitative performances assessment\napproach. The X-TEAM D2D project will develop a simulation-based platform for validating the proposed concept. This\nplatform will consider the most relevant elements of the transport in the future such as interfaces mode-mode, high-level\nnetwork model, passenger-centric paradigm. The X-TEAM D2D proposed ConOps, therefore, will be validated with the\nsimulation platform and a description of the semantic values of future KPIs and a diagnosis of the inefficiencies of the\nConOps will be provided. The conceptual design of the platform will be replicable by formalizing the relationships of the Key\nelements by using formalisms like Coloured Petri Nets or UML. The identified hot areas of the different interfaces will be\nformalized by the use of Colored Petri nets or similar formalism.",
