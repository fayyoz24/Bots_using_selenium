    "summary": "Saa Bluu is ontstaan uit respect voor de oudere medemens. Het werd tijd voor een merk met prachtige textiele producten voor deze groep. Producten met een zorgelement en tevens een hedendaagse look en een positieve uitstraling. Het eerste product is een kledingbeschermer (slab voor volwassenen, schort, servet) die Saa Bluu verkoopt aan zowel zorgcentra als particulieren en mantelzorgers.\nOok door het inzetten van het geavanceerde gepatenteerde high performance materiaal toont Saa Bluu dat ze de gebruikers en hun verzorgers en mantelzorgers serieus neemt.\n\nSaa Bluu was created out of respect for the elderly. It was time for a brand with beautiful textile products for this group. Products with a care element as well as a contemporary look and a positive appearance. The first product is a clothing protector (adult bib, apron, napkin) that Saa Bluu sells to care centers as well as private individuals and carers.\nAlso by using the advanced patented high performance material, Saa Bluu shows, it takes the users and their carers and informal carers seriously.\n",
