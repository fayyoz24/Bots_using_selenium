    "summary": "We are given one vessel, one body to live in for the entirety of our lives. So it is and should be a priority to improve and keep this body healthy for the duration of our life. That is why my passion and drive is within the Life Science and Fitness & Health industry. \n\nAt 13 years of age I grabbed my first dumbbell, determined to change and prove everyone else who teased me wrong. Since then it had been a non-stop grind and hardening to be a better version of myself with every passing day. Therefore, I am indomitable.\n\nThese same principles I have learned growing up, I apply to my work. Whether I work in Data Management, Consultancy or Analytics, as long as it involves Life Science or Fitness & Health you have someone who will jump in that boat with you all-in. \n\nNow I graduated with two master degrees in that same industry I have so much passion for. And worked at Merck Chemicals BV for two years, improving processes, troubleshooting and monitoring transactions in order to keep business running efficiently. \n\nOutside of work, I explore ways to keep improving the mind and body by reading science articles or books (i.e. Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari), working out 4 \u2013 5 times a week and listening to podcasts (i.e. Tim Ferris Show). \n\nReach out to me at any time through InMail or email at alx_nunes89@hotmail.com in case you are seeking for someone who is diligent, geared for science and business and willing to take on challenges head on.\n",
