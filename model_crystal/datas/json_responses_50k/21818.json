The new brackets were made with CAD program Siemens NX. FEM calculations were done for the design optimization and material saving.\n- Inverter Casing: The inverter has a factory made casing. However, the rule demands it to be waster tight and the need of  fitting additional PCB on top of it requires a new casing design. This was made in CAD as well.\n- Front Impact Attenuator (FIA) Calculations: In a case of collision, the driver must be safe. With the new design, we were able to utilize standard FIA. However, new calculations were also needed to confirm the analytical performance of the FIA combined with front wing elements.\n- Suspension Camber and Ride Height systems: In order to do fine adjustments on the vehicle dynamics, new spacers were required for the new suspension. These were made in CAD program and laser cut.",
