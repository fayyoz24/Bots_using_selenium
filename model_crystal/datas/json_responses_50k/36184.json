    "summary": "I am a Journalist and I am passionate about International relations. I love collaborating and making connections.\n\nA little bit about my personal journey: I studied journalism and immediately afterwards I traveled and lived for almost two years in Italy and Malta and around Europe. After that, I went back to Argentina and started studying International Relations where I am currently working on my thesis, last year I also finished a course in International Policy Analysis. Spanish is my native language and I speak advanced English and Italian. I'm also currently studying Dutch.\n\nI am a curious person and eager to know new things. I define myself as an idealist, dreaming that the world can be a better place. I believe that through cooperation we can achieve what we set out to do that\u2019s why I am studying International Relations.\n\nFeel free also to connect with me here on LinkedIn or by email at mengocandelaria@gmail.com",

My main tasks were to assist a senior journalist to create content, interview current news individuals, also wrote several articles under the supervision of my manager and furthermore, supported with smaller tasks.\n\nThis was an important learning experience as it was my first professional job, but also because I was able to learn directly from people in the field with a long trajectory. My main takeaway has been immediacy which is highly important in this environment because we have to be prepared for eventual news, so I am now always prepared. \n\nI was able to develop my personal abilities as well as professional ones. Such as; mistakes are unavoidable and that I can learn from them, also learnt how to speak with my peers, managers, and bosses.\u00a0Effective communication\u00a0in a fast-paced environment is crucial for development.",
