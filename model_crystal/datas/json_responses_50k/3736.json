    "summary": "If I had to summarize myself in one sentence, I would say that I am a passionate individual who loves connecting the dots and strives for high-performance results for both myself and my team. I have worked with global brands such as Rakuten Viber, Royal Air Maroc, Lufthansa Group, and more, providing business development consulting, PR, and event organizing services.\n\nTo provide a brief overview of my background, I completed my studies in Sociology, Human Resources Management, and Marketing before embarking on a career in Marketing. Over time, I expanded my expertise and experience to include BD and Events Management. In 2012, I founded Blue Circle, a boutique marketing agency that offers Marketing, Business Development, PR, Networking, Communication, and Event Management services to commercial businesses and startups in Greece, Bulgaria, and Belgium.\n\nMy philosophy revolves around the idea that the value of an idea lies in its ability to be realized. \nI am inspired by the words of Howard Hughes in The Aviator: \"Don't tell me I can't do it. Don't tell me it can't be done.\" \nAdditionally, I believe that communication should be simple, genuine, and a two-way street.",
