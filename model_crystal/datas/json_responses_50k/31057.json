    "summary": "I am a passionate and curious person, full of energy and drive. These traits have empowered me to quickly master new skills and quickly adapt to different environments.\n\nI am results driven and familiar with working in high stress, dynamic environments. A challenge junkie, I obsessively aim for the impossible. I do this by moving fast, focusing on key results and quickly adapting to new insights. \n\nI have been fortunate to live abroad, completing an internship in New Zealand and my master\u2019s degree in Sweden. I continued working for Spargle as a Project Manager 30 hours per week while studying fulltime for my master\u2019s degree. This is when developed my intercultural communication skills, learned to be resilient and gained new perspectives.\n\nI like hitting the ground running \u2013 getting stuff done with a big smile is what I do. When I'm not working. I love to connect with people, go to the cinema, travel and let my inner geek out and play video games.\n",

The company\u2019s most important objectives are recruitment activities, building teams and managing digital (agile) transformation projects. Spargle only recruits via referrals. \n\n\u2022 I supported clients such as Nike, Heineken, KLM and Albert Heijn in their efforts to transform their organizations to be more agile. I first assessed their company culture, structure and processes, and then collaboratively facilitated the required change. I did this by connecting professionals from within our network, consulting on the Scrum methodology or helping to re-design existing teams to achieve a continuous delivery process and cultural change. This embedded and wholistic approach was crucial to the success of the transformation. \n\n\u2022 As Account Lead I was responsible for complex stakeholder engagement. I directly reported to the directors or higher management. Working co-located empowered me to quickly build enduring relationships and become a sparring partner for my clients. By not only listening but also by questioning and challenging I gained a good understanding of their needs and always made sure I assisted in finding the right solution.",

My responsibilities were keeping track of the progress and making sure there was a consistent implementation of the strategy. I also made sure the important stakeholders were aligned and monitored the strategy was in line with the HR digital transformation requirements. \n\n\u2022  Spargle is continuously searching for talent and potential candidates. Interviewing candidates and making sure they were the right fit for our high standards was an important task for me. Spargle has a very personal approach, going beyond what candidates look like on paper and putting effort into understanding who they are as a person. This has greatly helped me to develop my soft skills, listening to what is not said, paying attention to more subtle things like body language and probing deeper to gain more insights. This helped me not only in interviews but also in my stakeholder management and coaching of our freelancers both in personal growth and difficulties in the workplace.\n\n\u2022 Spargle is a Dutch agency, which is why we had a lack of international professionals in our network. Because I have a personal interest in intercultural collaboration and had lived in Sweden and New-Zealand, I took it as a challenge to expand our international network. I hosted events, built relationships and made sure our documents were translated. As a result, we were able to build a lasting international network and expand our international clientele.",

In the evenings and weekends, I was working on my thesis for my bachelor degree. It was important for me to both work and write my thesis as I wanted a head start in a business environment and invest in my network by doing things a little differently. The hard work paid off as I gained valuable business experience and completed my thesis in time with a grade of 8,5/10. \n\n\u2022 During my internship the brand started to develop the AH to Go App. I supported the manager by keeping track of the timeline, uploading images and maintaining contact with the development agency for smaller tasks.
