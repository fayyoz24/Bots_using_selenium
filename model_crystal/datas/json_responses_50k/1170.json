    "summary": "I was born in Japan, raised in Malawi, Laos, and Madagascar, where I witnessed utmost wealth and convenience, but more importantly, extreme poverty and exploitation of less developed nations. This consciousness developed my interest in joining a global movement toward the eradication of underdevelopment while protecting our environment and supporting a sustainable future. \n\nI grew up with people from diverse cultural backgrounds, attending international schools until the last year of high school which I completed at a Japanese senior high. Through moving from country to country, adapting to different cultural norms and lifestyles, I attained open-mindedness, flexibility, and great intercultural communication skills. I am also passionate and curious in exploring new environments, leading me to travel to over 30 countries, of which many opened my eyes to new philosophy and beauties of the Earth.\n\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I equipped myself with a variety of knowledge with courses such as conflict resolution, environmental economics, psychology, social anthropology, global environmental system, food economy, sociology, and sustainability. I also studied business and Hispanic culture at a Spanish university for a year.\n\nThroughout the years in Japan, I had the opportunity to work in several different fields, such as event organization, sales promotion, beauty counseling, advertisement production, and gastronomy. Not only was I able to experience different types of jobs but by working next to my studies, I learned the importance of commitment and time management. I also realized mental toughness through meeting the highly competitive demands of Tokyo.\n\nI graduated from Waseda University in the year 2020 with a bachelor's degree in international liberal studies, and from Maastricht University in 2021 with a MSc in Sustainability Science, Policy, and Society.\n\nI am currently working as a sustainability and strategy consultant in Japan and Germany, pursuing my ambition to explore the different sustainable approaches to tackle 21st-century issues.",
