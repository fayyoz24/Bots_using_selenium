This product responds to this development by making it possible for  parents who practice sport bike activities, to make their child  (9 months - 15kg) take part in this activity.\n\nSafety was one of the biggest issues while developing this product. For this reason was decided to locate the bicycle seat between the seat tube and the steering tube of the bike. In this way the parent can see their child during the bike sport activity and offer an extra protection for the child in case of a crash. This location on the bike means that the space available for the seat is limited which considerably limited the design freedom.\n",

It is one of the two \u201cbicycle ambulances\u201d designed to be a \u201cstand alone\u201d support vehicle to facilitate the Quick Response Team (QRT-team) and is an integral part of the safety management system of the St. Elisabeth Hospital in Tilburg. Medical Emergency Teams, like the QRT-team, should be seen as a complementary system to respond quickly when the patient cannot be helped by the usual medical care system during emergencies inside the hospital. \n\nThroughout the project there was a special focus on the implementation and work flow of the current \u201cbicycle ambulance\u201d and hospital personnel working with the bike. The design is greatly appreciated for its flexibility in the way equipment could be stored making it easy to adapt to future changes in the equipment. It also makes the design suitable for implementation in other hospitals where the Medical Emergency Teams (MET) might use different equipment pieces.\n",

This mobility trend will result in a shift to where people are no longer limited to working inside their office, but work can be done from everywhere in the world. This development is called \u201cUrban nomads\u201d. This product that has been designed for Allocacoc is focusing on this new trend. It is meant as a power strip for the true urban nomad. It features a power socket on the one side, and a connection part on the other side. This connection side is where different modules can be attached. The modular system is one of the unique selling points of this product. It gives the user the possibility to choose which functionality is needed for a certain situation.",
