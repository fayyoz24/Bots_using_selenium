They are beginner level courses, focused on the practical side, aimed at developing logical thinking (algorithms, problem solving abilities, debugging) as well as teaching some fundamental technologies (Java, SQL, web-related concepts, Python, Scratch) and usage of common programmer tools (Git, GitLab, IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL). \n\nFor the Java course I've also built internal tools to stream-line the learning process for my students - like having detailed home assignments covering all important class topics, with a comprehensible suite of unit tests to check correctness, an an auto-grader solution giving them immediate feedback and computing the final score (which I later manually adjusted a little, when reviewer each assignment, but in general was spot-on).  Based on: GitLab, IntelliJ IDE, Gradle (with a customized runner+annotations), bash scripts.\nI've also researched and integrated in the Java course some beginner friendly tools: SQLite (for DB intro part), Spark web microframework and later Javalin web framework, with Velocity templates (for web intro part).",

All mentors were volunteers, and each was assigned to a small group of 5-7 children, having in total up to 30 children per workshop. I worked with older children too, but I especially enjoyed helping the younger ones to advance their logical and coding abilities.\n\nMore info: https://www.facebook.com/CoderDojoOptymyze , https://www.coderdojo.ro/"
