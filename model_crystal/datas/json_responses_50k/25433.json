    "summary": "Nowadays, globalization is no longer a blurry concept but the reality of every industry in the world, including offshore wind. I have devoted the last years to build up an international and multicultural working and academic experience. \n\nInstalling an offshore wind farm in the North Sea or managing a 50+ workers team in the Middle East to deliver a project on time in an international airport, are just two examples of what I have done during my professional life.\n\nI believe that Renewable Energy is one of the most exciting and challenging fields where a construction professional can be involved today. That is why I am focusing my career in this area full of challenges, experiences and fulfilment.\n",
