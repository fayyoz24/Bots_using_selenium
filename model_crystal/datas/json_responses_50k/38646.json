    "summary": "From the rustic streets of a town in Southern Pakistan to the notorious alleyways of Amsterdam, I have come quite a way. I couldn't even imagine that attending an air force public school at the age of 12 would somehow lead me to working for the premiere marketing agency in Pakistan, Interflow. Working with high-profile clients, scripting creative stories, and extensive media-work was all so unexpected but that wasn't the end of surprises for me. A year later, I was running an electoral campaign in a university I had only ever heard legends about. I went on to become the representative for the Faculty of Economics and Business in the Central Student Council at the University of Amsterdam and followed on to work as an FP&A Analyst for Just Eat Takeaway.com; an industry leader in online food delivery platforms. I joined while we were still Takeaway.com and saw the company make one astronomical leap after the other and tried my best to imbibe that very spirit, one astronomical leap after the other. I presently work as an FP&A Manager for Coty; not to flex (too much anyway) but another industry leader undergoing amazing transformation and on it's way up with potential unveiling each day. \n\nThe above mentioned story was all meticulously designed to make a point. The point being that there is nothing beyond my scope of abilities except using chopsticks and you will be glad to know that I have not yet given up on that endeavor either. I am an individual with a voracious appetite for knowledge and an immense love for the process. I truly believe in thinking bigger than even what one's grasp may seem, for as long as we we are willing to truly dedicate, we all possess the ability to do something... remarkable. \n              \nIf I can be of service to you in any of the aforementioned affairs or if you can finally teach me how to use chopsticks, please feel free to contact me here or on my email address: devalraj1@gmail.com. Looking forward to connecting with you!",

In a business as dynamic as Just Eat Takeaway.com and for an individual as hungry to constantly learn and grow, that served as a highly potent weapon. I got increasingly involved in strategic business projects and planning, and with each day, I got to do something different and challenging than the day before. It ranged anything from redefining order forecasts to breaking existing molds of AOV planning. It ranged from training new-hires in system to establishing best practises on on-boarding. That's the charm of working in a high growth environment, it goes from 0 to a 100 really quickly, and when it does, I am strapped in and ready to go.",
