    "summary": "My diverse range of work experience has allowed me to develop a wide selection of skills and has enabled me to work in various organizational structures. People say my key strength include friendliness, organization skills, creative concepts, loyalty and a talent that combines envisioning and realization. I have been described as committed, very social, ambitious and independent. I show individual initiative whilst working well within a team and enjoy applying creativity to my work. My work ethic drives me to learn all possible aspects of any given role so I can tackle all tasks with confidence. This has given me a keenness to learn more and demonstrates an ability and eagerness to quickly learn and apply new skills. \n\nCurrently the balance of working in events as well as in (improv) theater works well for me. It creates balance, flexibility, diversity and access to an extensive multidisciplinary network. \n\nSince I am always up for new projects, opportunities and challenges feel free to contact me. Let's find out what we can do for each other.  ",
