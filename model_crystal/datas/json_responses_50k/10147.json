The resultant cell corpses are cleaned up immediately by scavenger cells, which are specialists at removing unwanted things in the body. However, when cell corpses are not being removed efficiently, autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), develop. This startup project aims at improving human well-being by developing specialised antibodies to bridge scavenger cells and the cell corpses, thereby enhancing corpse removal to provide a novel disease-modifying therapy for SLE.",
