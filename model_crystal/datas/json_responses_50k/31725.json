            "description": "Brazil is one the fastest growing countries in terms of economy. The state of Mato Grosso, located in the centre-west region, is one of the biggest states in the country and is the leading producer in the country\u2019s agricultural sector. With respectively soybeans, corn, cotton, and cattle as its primary export commodities within this sector, the state of Mato Grosso has a large contribution in the national export. Nonetheless, at the same time, the transportation costs from the state\u2019s crop fields are raising sky high due to inefficiency in the process. Main problems in the export transportation process are the unpaved roads, excessive use of trucks, and the incompleteness of multimodal routes. \nThe Dutch consortium, consisting of: TNO, Panteia/NEA, Scheepvaart en Transport College  (STC), Expertise en Innovatie Centrum Binnenvaart (EICB), and Connekt, has commissioned the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam to map the Mato Grosso Corridor. This project included a field research programme in Brasilia (DF) and the Mato Grosso corridor. Eventually, one of these corridors will be further developed into a blueprint, which will include all information and application methods to develop this corridor.\nI have been involved in the mapping process in Bras\u00edlia (DF) and Cuiab\u00e1. In order to enhance our research, I have presented several meetings with Brazilian expert teams (ANTT, ANTAQ, CNI, SEP) and the Ministry of Transport. Our research resulted in four export routes to northern ports, which are considered as most likely and feasible. \n",

KLM is dealing with an increasing competition and therefore constantly looking for innovative and smart ideas to achieve competitive advantage. Several airlines, including Emirates, are already using the Airbus A380-800. By using an aircraft that is able to transport a high volume of passengers, airlines become a serious threat for KLM. The research is fictional and part of the Aviation Logistics course at the Amsterdam University. This research was conducted together with six other Aviation Logistics students.\nAfter an extensive research, the project group and I came to the conclusion to give a positive advise to KLM, regarding the implementation of the Airbus A380-800 in their current network and fleet mix (2011-2012). After analyzing the KLM and SkyTeam network, the advise was given to use the A380 on the route Amsterdam-Atlanta, as Atlanta is the largest hub and home base for Delta Airlines, which gives passenger a wide variety of hinterland connections. \n",

Tambo International Airport is the main-hub airport in South Africa and has the ambition to be the largest airport of the continent with reference to the passenger amounts, cargo amount and aircraft movements. The airport will have to expand in the upcoming twenty years, due to several capacity bottlenecks, to able to handle the expected growth in air traffic. By creating a master plan for Airports Company South Africa by the project group, a follow-up of the previous project, the company has the possibility to realize the expansions of the airport. Thereby, the future strategy should be taken into account as it is required to stimulate the region economically to enable the airport and its region to grow continuously.\n\nThe project group based their advice on the current strategy of Airports Company South Africa: to build an efficient and customer focused world-leading airport business, parallel to the vision to empower and sustain South African communities. The main recommendation is to stay innovative, efficient, flexible, socially involved with the surrounding communities and companies, and constantly revise the forecasts and market position of the airport. Forecasts indicated that the total passenger amounts will be over 37 million in the year 2032 and the aircraft demand peak will be 71 aircraft movements on the busiest day in the year 2032. New infrastructure and expansions are required in order to be able to handle the demand.\n\nGaining competitive advantage is an important factor to stay ahead of regional competitors and, including the increasing globalization, international competitors. Investing in expansions of the airport will have benefits for the entire region. The expansions will lead to more jobs for the city region, which will lead to economic growth as well. In the end, answers are given to four main factors the airport has to deal with during the expansion phases: the social, political, environmental and economic factors.",

The project groups of Aviation Logistics had been asked by Netherlands Airport Consultants B.V. to create a master plan up to 2032 with a durable future perspective. The focus of the master plan is on the expansion of the capacity by designing a land-use plan taking into account a new ten million passenger-terminal and one or two new runways. Since the master plan will take more than seven weeks a start of the master plan had been made together with a land-use plan. This implied an extensive market research, a twenty-year forecast and a functional design of a passenger terminal expansion. ",

The airport is an important hub for transfer passengers, which has its impact on the baggage handling system. The intention of the project was to analyze the airport\u2019s baggage handling system and see when the system will reach it\u2019s capacity, and how the system can be optimized. One of the main goals of AMS is to be able to process seventy million bags in the future. By using a trend forecast, it became clear when AMS will reach its main goal. The research requires an extensive analysis of all involved segments such as: hold baggage systems, check-in counters, fulltime equivalents, drop-off points and automatic check-in counters. The research shows that there will be a shortage of check in desks in the upcoming years due to an increasing amount in passenger rates. A break-even analysis shows that it will be more costly efficient to use automatic drop off points in the coming three years.",
