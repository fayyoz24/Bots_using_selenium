    "summary": "Over the years I have noticed that I, unlike most people, approach challenges both top-down and bottom-up. I am goal-oriented and enjoy getting things done, but I also enjoy extracting fundamental technology and insights from the experience. I like advancing the state of the art in a very practical way. I plot out a strategy, but I am also good at working out the details that matter. I am not as fast as purely detail-oriented people, but I win in the end through planning. This approach enables me to take on different roles in a project, but it's most suitable for longer-term projects that benefit from a strategic direction.\n\nI like working with both people and technology. They're both difficult to master, so I also like to keep learning.\n\nSpecialties: Consulting, strategy, quickscans, project management, turn-key system and software design and development, open source, groupware, networking, operating system development, custom Linux development, web services, grid computing.

Differentiating features are ease of use and efficiency. Syllable Desktop is an original, complete desktop operating system that is powerful, lightweight and extraordinarily fast and responsive. Syllable Server is a small and efficient server operating system built to be similar to Syllable Desktop, but on the Linux kernel.\n\nI designed the build system that builds the entire Syllable operating system and its applications, and subsequently used it to create the Syllable Server Linux distribution. I am also running the Syllable web sites and created a fully integrated content management system for them. Together with the project founder I managed the project development, its volunteers and its future direction. This included lots of small and larger activities, such as running a groupware system for the project and publishing articles in its magazine.",
