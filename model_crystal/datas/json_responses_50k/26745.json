                    "description": "Research summary: a well connects subsurface oil reservoirs to surface facilities. If the pressure and temperature conditions allow, gas bubbles form in the wellhead during flowing conditions. If this multiphase flow stops by closing the wellhead valve (shut-in), phase redistribution occurs: the liquid drains to the bottom while the gas floats to the wellhead. Thermodynamics, heat transfer and mass transfer all affect the gas cap size that results at the wellhead. After wellhead valve reopening, gas expansion associated with Joule Thomson cooling leads to low fluid temperatures and risk of brittle fracture of well material. Hence, accurate knowledge of the gas cap size after shut-in is important.\n\nA fully coupled 1D multiphase flow simulator, with motion and condensation of bubbles modeled coarsely, has been used in the past to determine the gas cap size. As motion and condensation of bubbles are expected to be decisive for the gas cap size, the present study takes a distinctive approach: employ Newton\u2019s 2nd law to track individual bubbles, combined with a condensation model based on molecular diffusion. Simulations have been carried out for mono- and polydisperse bubble groups and for the case of artificial gas lift. A sensitivity study has been carried out on various physical parameters. The results mainly suggest that the gas cap size that forms at the wellhead is smaller than predicted by the 1D multiphase flow simulator.",
