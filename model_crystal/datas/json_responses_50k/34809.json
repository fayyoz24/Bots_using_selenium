    "summary": "I have more than ten years of working experience in the field of education, data management and technology, and running my own business. I began my startup journey in November 2017, after undertaking a course in Fashion Design from Polimoda, Institute of Fashion Design and Marketing in Florence, Italy. It was my goal to add to Bangladesh\u2019s narrative as a fashion producer, by creating international awareness of an independent, emerging, sustainable clothing brand. I have worked with the garment industry in the past. My first experience was working as a volunteer during the Rana Plaza incident in 2013, during which more than 1000 workers died due to a factory building collapse. I had co-founded a social organisation that worked with charitable projects and non-governmental organisations to help fund and rehabilitate the victims of the tragedy. Many years later, I found myself working for a US tech startup as a Country Project Manager. One of my main responsibilities was to travel across Bangladesh to interact with garment workers and conduct workshops whereby they learn how to use a platform to provide data about their work environment. \n\nMy sustainable startup propelled me towards a career committed to climate action and sustainability. In 2020, I coordinated the project, Voices from the Frontline, learning, documenting and sharing stories of community resilience during COVID-19 while participating in research activities on climate change in Bangladesh.\n\nAs COVID raged on, I decided to take the leap and go back to learning, and completed a MSc in Sustainability Science, Policy and Society. After graduation, I joined Maastricht Sustainability Institute as a Lecturer on Climate Change and Sustainable Development. While teaching, I also worked as a consultant at WWF Netherlands on the project, \"Amplifying Voices for Just Climate Action\" at WWF-NL. I worked with youth activists globally to learn of their needs and of their leadership on climate justice. Such lessons were key to understanding how NGOs like WWF canfacilitate support for climate activists.\n\nCurrently, I am working as Climate Advisor at WWF Netherlands, where I am working in the nexus between science, policy and practice.",
