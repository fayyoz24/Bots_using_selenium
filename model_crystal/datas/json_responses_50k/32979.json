    "summary": "Frontend developer at Hadrian. With a passion for coding, I like to find challenging projects to employ creative solutions given limited tools. Although my focus in recent years lies in web technologies and computer graphics, I am also well-versed in general-purpose programming which stems from self-taught initiatives honed later on by many personal and other projects. Regardless of the nature of a project, I appreciate a pinch of aesthetics in my work, be it good visuals, where applicable, or well-structured and documented code. When creating software, I like to imagine the look from the other side - not just using a library, but building one, structuring a project such that it not just works, but is ready to be extended by someone else.",

Machine-learning-based relighting methods can address this problem, but, at real-time rates, are restricted to a low resolution and can result in an unrealistic skin appearance. Physically-based rendering requires suitable skin models, which require specialised equipment. Our method is lightweight and uses only a standard smartphone. By correcting imperfections during capture, we extract a convincing physically-based skin model. In combination with suitable acceleration techniques, we achieve real-time rates on commodity hardware.",
