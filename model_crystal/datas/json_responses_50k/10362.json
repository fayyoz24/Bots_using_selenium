    "summary": "I am a recently graduated engineer from the Technical University of Delft's Master Management in the Built Environment. I am always eager to learn more, to bring people together, and to tackle new challenges. I believe in the power of cooperation and bringing an optimistic spirit to every project I am a part of.\n\nThroughout my studies and work experience, I've learned how to push the boundaries of construction processes, technology, and ideas to bring the message and perspective of the client/users to the forefront. During my graduation, I investigated the various brand identities of several conglomerates with their employees and their independent and overlapping physical, social, and historical values. With the aim to make future briefings more resilient and rewarding.\n\nSeveral nominations for building, form, and environmental design have come my way during my studies. That also includes residential, landscape, and set design. For this, programs such as Rhino, Revit, AutoCAD, and Adobe Suite are not new to me. Whereby creating a project that acts as a powerhouse to connect people through inspiration and positive visual, physical, and mental stimuli is at the heart of who I am.\n\nI am currently looking for new opportunities (abroad) in set design, corporate real estate, and store planning in the (luxury) fashion industry.",
