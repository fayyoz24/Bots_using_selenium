    "summary": "I am proud and fortunate to do what I like, love and dream: being in the field of education. I am a different person when I am in school and with children irrespective of their age, country and culture. I love helping them to grow with more knowledge and wisdom with each passing day. And in this journey what I learn from every child is incomparable.\n\nI have 7.5 years of experience in some of the best Internationals schools of India and Netherlands and teaching both primary and secondary students in different curriculum like IB, ICSE and CBSE. My specialization is in Teaching (Mathematics and Science) with strong focus on Management as well. \nThrough out my career, I played different roles like Teaching Assistant, Subject Teacher, Class Teacher, Head of Department (Mathematics) and Academic coordinator. \n\nMy international exposure to diversified cultures in India and Netherlands and professional experience of working with top most schools like BSN (British School of Netherlands), ASH (American School of Hague) and Vibgyor has helped me evolve as a global citizen. And my willingness to learn new things, flexibility to take up any role and position which match my skills and interest, the passion I bring to the work place makes me a unique proposition.   \n\n",
