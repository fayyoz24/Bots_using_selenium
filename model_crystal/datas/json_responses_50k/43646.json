Moreover, with the recent demand for social network analysis, a new research interest on graph clustering has come up. Social networks differ from conventional graph due to their nature which has been mistreated in popular partitioning algorithms. In this paper we mainly dealed with the coarsening and partitioning phases of the multilevel partitioning algorithm introduced by G.Karypis and V.Kumar (\"A fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs\", Siam J. Sci. Comput.,1998) and the application of them in social graphs.",

This was the first time that the symposium was hosted in Leiden. The symposium was sponsored by SAILS and the Young Academy Leiden (YAL).\n\nThe program consisted of seven invited speeches by researchers who contributed to AI for population health within a diverse range of application domains (e.g., psychology, epidemiology, drug research, and sports). These speeches included two keynote speeches by Dr. Scott Small from the University of Oxford on reproducible machine learning for analysing wearables data in large-scale epidemiological health research and Prof. dr. Douwe Atsma from LUMC on redesigning health care using the wearables within the Box project. Daniela Gawehns from LIACS pointed to the challenges of developing AI learning systems using mixed methods research in multidisciplinary research.",

The motivation of this research comes from the medical field of health monitoring and more particularly on the \"Growing Old TOgether\" study of Leiden University Medical Center. The goal is to provide a framework that can answer the following questions, for the given sensor networks and group of activities: (i) Which is the best sensors network? and (ii) Which is the best body location for using only one sensor? Based on that, the analysis pipeline and how to further improve models is examined.",
