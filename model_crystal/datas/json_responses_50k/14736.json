    "summary": "After 30 years of IT Project Management and IT Architecture, in 2019 I made the career switch to crypto, blockchain and stocks investment researcher, educator, educational content creator, public speaker and coach. My specialty is to make complicated stuff easy to understand for everybody who is interested privately or professionally, for beginners but also for advanced users in this arena. Not only I do very well understand and educate blockchain and crypto technology, I am very skilled in profitable investing strategies and possibilities to create passive income streams. For crypto I am specialized in a.o. staking, earning, yield farming, airdrops, where passive income is the goal with the highest security measures.\nWorking in international environments and adapting to different cultures is a pleasure for me.\nEducating people and make them successful with my teachings and knowledge is my passion.",
