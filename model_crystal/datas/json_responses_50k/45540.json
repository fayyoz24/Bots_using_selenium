    "summary": "As a PhD student at the University of Groningen, I work on developing new methods to advance our  understanding of generative language models and, more importantly, putting our new knowledge to work to improve human-AI interaction. I focus in particular on machine translation applications, since the interaction between automatic translation systems and human post-editors is a promising testbed for my studies.\n\nI previously completed a master's degree in data science at the University of Trieste, with a thesis on using human gaze tracking data to adjust natural language processing systems to human preferences. I have published several papers on deep learning and NLP at international venues such as ACL and EMNLP, and I had the chance of applying my knowledge in industrial settings at the synthetic data startup Aindo and Amazon AWS AI Labs. I am passionate about positive social applications of new technologies, and an advocate for good software development practices and open source collaboration.",
