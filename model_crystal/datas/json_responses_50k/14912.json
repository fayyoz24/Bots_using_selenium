    "summary": "Chartered controller with international experience, sharp mind, and a solid foundation to act as a financial sparring partner at all levels. I have a great sense of responsibility, am ambitious, decisive, and energetic. \nI like to show and argue both sides of an argument from the \"devil's advocate\" role. I am both alert and direct and quickly see the weak spot in a proposal or argument, what possibilities there are and how they can be exploited. I am convinced that in my role as finance manager, I and my team will make a strengthening contribution to the overall strategy of the organization. At the same time, I am aware that close collaboration and coordination with other disciplines is required to achieve the Finance objectives. \nIf you would like to spar or need help in strategic and/or tactical financial management, please feel free to contact me via: \n\u2022 Mobile: +31640702668 \n\u2022 E-mail: markvanwichen@outlook.com",
