    "summary": "Walther Stikvoort, was for a period of almost 6 year a principal mechanical integrity consultant with GLT PLUS / Jacobs , and a renowned authority in pressure vessels and piping technologies, mechanical integrity evaluation and Fitness-For-Service analysis, including brittle fracture analysis. Before joining GLT PLUS/Jacobs, he worked for 7 years with NRG, 18 years with NAM (a joint venture of Shell and ExxonMobil) and  15 years with Kellogg Continental. He has  more than 50 years experience in pressure vessel and piping design matters and developed  numerous engineering standards and practices focused on improving asset integrity. He also has been a member of various national \u2013 and international committees related to pressure equipment and structural integrity and involved in the development and lecturing of training courses and seminars for the pressure equipment community. As an author and co-author, he has published already 30 peer reviewed strongly  to pressure equipment and structural integrity related papers in various recognized international journals, technical textbooks and technical journals. He has an outstanding in depth knowledge of national and international codes and standards in his field. He is active in providing comments and suggestions for improvements to the various code committees. Has extensive design experience related to pressure equipment and piping systems. Displays a prudent attitude regarding technical integrity. Has theoretical background knowledge of recognized design codes. Strong affinity to the mechanical static engineering discipline is beyond dispute. Eager to make its expertise available to potential employers aiming to disseminate his widely appreciated specific expert knowledge. Possesses intrinsic motivation.",
