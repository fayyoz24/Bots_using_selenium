The flight manual is required by regulatory agencies (such as FAA/JAA) for certification of the aircraft, as well as by the airline to operate the aircraft.\nMy tasks as an intern were related to airworthiness, aircraft performance and documentation. I have assisted in preparing of paper and electronic versions of the MD-90 and MD-11 flight manuals.
