As a German citizen however, I have the unique possibility to challenge the German government in the German Supreme Court on grounds that the German government has put an organization in place that deprives me of my basic rights as guaranteed indefinitely in the German Constitution.\n\nIn parallel I have written a book about this project/case, which is suppose to get published as soon as the court takes a decision.",
