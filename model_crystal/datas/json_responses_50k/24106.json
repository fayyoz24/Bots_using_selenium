I was involved in every step from raw material to finished product, eventually executing the entire process independently. These were type IV pressure vessels, meaning a polymer liner was used as a mandrel and carbon fiber prepreg was applied via filament winding. I was also responsible for documenting the physical characteristics of each vessel and any notable events that happened during production. This info was recorded to possibly identify the reason for any performance outliers in our data.\n\nMy additional responsibilities included interpretation and analysis of X-Ray images of carbon fiber samples and optimizing software used for identifying weak points in the vessel. I used the X-Ray images to locate and measure areas of high porosity in the different layups. The software I optimized was used to locate the sources of sounds detected when fibers broke during testing. I reduced the runtime by roughly 80%. I am also a named applicant for a patent granted to our team for development of a component used in our filament winding process.",

I performed experiments on the prototype to confirm my calculations. This model was then used to size the second version of the pump, which was an order of magnitude increase in thrust from the initial design. This project was funded by DARPA, and the attached video shows the pump in action.\n\nI also worked on a calibration device for medical sensors, an artificial lung used to develop athlete testing equipment, a hydrogen gas tin accelerator, and many other projects. Working here was an amazing experience for me because of the huge variety of projects available for me to work on. I learned how to apply the theories taught to me during school, but importantly, became comfortable learning on the job. I was very unfamiliar with several key concepts whenever I started the projects, but became consistent at working through the roadblocks.",

I was in charge of the chemical analysis. I researched and predicted the effects of different additives to standard fuels. The final decision was to test a water-fuel emulsion. The experimental fuel consisted of 90% standard RP-1 and 10% water. Water was chosen for its high specific heat and volatility at combustion temperatures. The results of the experiment can be seen in the attached paper, and were presented by myself and Robert Bertino at the JANNAF Conference in November 2016.",
