Intrigued by projects and works aiming for a better planet from all perspectives! \nMinimising food loss and agricultural waste are the goals of my current research activities! How can we contribute to these by getting the right signals from the fresh products? Volatiles are the small molecules with the big potential! \nI enjoy sharing/transferring experience and knowledge! but also finding new ways to inspire and stir up people's thoughts about the importance of flavoursome food and how to respect it.\nSome of my hobbies are gardening, exploring flavours, adding green to everyday life, and making people smile.",
