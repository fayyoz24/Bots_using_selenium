The main reasons for this are the lack of awareness and low capacity on the part of law-enforcement agencies, mainly state labour inspectors with responsibility for identification of cases,\"\u200b says Lisa Tilney, the Head of the OSCE Mission's Rule of Law Department. \"These workshops aim to support labour inspectors and social workers to gain the skills they need.\" SKOPJE, 23 November 2009",

Some 40 civil servants took part in the course to enhance their knowledge and competence in complex policy-making procedures and techniques, as well as legal drafting in order to ensure quality, effectiveness, transparency and inclusiveness in the law-making process. The law-making course will be incorporated into the generic training programme for all civil servants. Under the project, a distance e-learning course was also developed with OSCE support. It is now administered by the Ministry and will be used for further professional development of all administration staff. The OSCE has also expanded its support to cover law-drafting standards and access to legislation in the country. In addition, a new legal framework for ex post evaluation of the implementation of laws was developed to enable national authorities to assess whether the intended results are being achieved and public goals are being reached.
