I was leading and partaking in daily scrums and agile meetings, design and coaching.  I often work closely with the business side of a company to determine the best course of action when designing the systems. This means I can listen and interpret what the business side wants to see accomplished, discuss details in an easy-to-understand way, and then translate it all into a technical nuts-and-bolts output for an IT team. Being the lead, it often falls on me to be the acting or substitute resource until the right candidate is found.
