With artistic quality and focus on local styles and themes we create personal growth and social impact. Our activities include training, performance and coaching. \nLe Grand Cru has become an expert in the field of emancipation and empowerment through dance, ranging from Cuba to Georgia and from Syria to South Africa. \n\nAs co- artistic director I\u2019m responsible for the design and co-ordination of the training programs, the hands- on training of dancers and choreographers (contemporary dance- and improvisation techniques) and for the creation and organization of intercultural choreographies.\n\nAs a coach I both work with individual people as with teams. Varying from closely \u2018on the job\u2019 coaching as long distance (internationally) \u2018back-up\u2019 coaching. Groups vary from choreographers and dance managers to managers of civil society organizations like the police, project leaders of a housing corporation and academic teachers n transitions processes.\n \nThe interventions we use are based on positive mental effects as a result of movement and theatre concepts that enforce cooperation. The interventions stimulate effectively (personal) leadership, creativity and trust. For individuals within the team as for the team as a whole. The applied methodologies are combined with new insights on the subject of team and organization coaching, as shaped in ORSC (Organisation and Relation System Coaching) tools and instruments  Through playful assignments participants learn to widen their scope literally, seeing and experiencing with whom and where they are, enhancing clear decision making and recognizing the power of the group as a system.",
