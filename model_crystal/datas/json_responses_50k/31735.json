The first project was implemented successfully within 4 months to meet SARB requirements. I assisted with the design of the overall solution and due to my passion of development I requested to take the role of the IBM Content Navigator UI Development Lead, responsible for designing all ICN UI related activities as well as coach and lead the ICN technical team, one in China and one locally. I additionally taught 3 resources how to develop against FileNet in this timeframe. I continue to assist in the overall FileNet solution designs where the needs arise where deep complex scenarios are involved.\n",
