    "summary": "Result-driven Communication Management student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, seeking for an internship in Public Relations or Corporate Communications. I have developed skills in strategy development, analysis and research, organization and planning,  creative concept development, and negotiation. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with companies such as DSM, and Rustic Pastry.  \n\nI am passionate about traveling and cultures; therefore, I studied abroad in Japan as a high school student and later applied to the Netherlands, and currently, I am doing my semester abroad in Jakarta. Being an international and exchange student made me repeatedly exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people, which has made me able to adapt quickly to changes, and gain a broader perspective of different communication styles and cultures. I am passionate about helping people, being creative, and finding solutions for various issues; also I am detail-oriented and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.\n\nI believe that the skills I have attained from the dynamic environment and competitive university life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.",
