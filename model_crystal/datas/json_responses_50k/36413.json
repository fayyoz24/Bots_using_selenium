    "summary": "A New Currency for Health Insurance\n\nIn Africa, the proliferation of mobile platforms for goods and services continues. Need a haircut? Pay with mobile money. Want to send cash to your child? Send a voucher over the phone. Need health coverage? Enroll for medical care while you recharge your mobile phone. This latter option is the vision cast by Maria, a 35 year old Angolan entrepreneur.\n\nSolidarity for Solid Coverage \nAngola; doctorAfrica is rising together, with people working to meet their needs. This spirit of solidary trickles into all sectors. Like many traditional insurance models, the mobile health platform that Maria envisions requires users to pay in to a collective fund. Typically in Angola and much of Africa, mobile users recharge their phone regularly. In Maria\u2019s business model, with each recharge through a certified phone company, 5-10% automatically diverts to the health insurance pool. As medical needs arise, customers access the funds to get coverage through a participating medical facility. The mobile coverage does away with vouchers and allows patients to deal directly with doctors on a variety of  health needs.",
