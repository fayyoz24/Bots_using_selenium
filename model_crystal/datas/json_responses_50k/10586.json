    "summary": "As an Invoicing & ERP Administrator at SLB, I invoice using semi-automated processes, assist and resolve invoicing issues with customers worldwide, and monitor interfaces between systems. I also maintain relevant procedures, master data, and functional testing for a smooth operational workflow. \n\nI have a Bachelor of Accounting and Finance from Dundalk Institute of Technology, where I gained strong accounting and finance skills and knowledge. I am also experienced in Accounts Receivable and high volume billing environments, having worked as an Accounts Receivable Administrator at Ritchie Bros. for over a year. There, I balanced sales reports, reconciled and posted cash receipts, made soft calls for collection and enquiries, and prepared regular and ad hoc AR reports. \n\nI am skilled in various software and systems, such as Microsoft Office package, Oracle, Microsoft Navision, Sage accounting and payroll, and SAP. I am easily adaptable, creative, and motivated to learn and grow in my role. I have excellent communication and presentation skills, and I can work effectively with diverse teams and customers. My goal is to leverage my invoicing and ERP expertise to support the company\u2019s financial operations and objectives.",
