Together with the newly recruited e-commerce manager, I set up the online sales channel and the new e-commerce department.\n\nDuring the technical POC, most of the architecture was already determined as Auping was transferring most of the ERP landscape to Microsoft AX. During the realization phase, a few additional components (including SANA and Drupal) were added, resulting in a relatively large number of components and associated suppliers for such a project. Due to the loss of the project manager of the POC, I had to start without a transfer, with my major challenge being to maintain the original go-live date.\n\nAfter a phase of exploration and research, I aligned all parts of the organization and created a common picture of the project goal. I was able to provide all parties with the right information at the right time so that there were no delays caused by waiting parties. However, this meant a loss of time for the organization compared to the desired go-live date, but the webshop performed above expectations from the start.\n\nThe Auping webshop was launched in the Netherlands in October 2016 via www.auping.com. I took over this project and under constant time pressure ensured that the organization and suppliers were aligned. Together we realized the technical webshop, the internal organization and the logistics fulfilment.",

The current and new process are mapped out together with the various business units and the change is made transparent.\n\nThe challenge of this assignment lies mainly in managing the interests of the various business units with regard to ongoing innovations on the one hand and the required commitment to the change program on the other. I exactly knew how to move in this political landscape and to get all parties involved with my proposals.\n\nWith a structured approach that is and remains practically applicable, the use of the new process is steadily increasing. Users support each other using Salesforce Chatter and the support organization is set up. The organization is ready for the last release in 2016/2017.",
