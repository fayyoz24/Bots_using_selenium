    "summary": "Erasmus School of Economics Honours Student interested in a variety of economic topics from microeconomics (modelling and theorizing on human behavior) and macroeconomics (global and national implications of policy changes). As an active debater, the latter topic comes naturally to me, analyzing not only my perspective but varied points of view as well. I manage a healthy work-life balance by playing sports such as badminton and running - yet also make sure to enjoy the time I am working. The work-life balance is a myth if all work is engaging and enjoyable!",
