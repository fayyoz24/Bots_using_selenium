We racked our brains for a year to find a solution to this problem. We came up with SOIL as a casual and friendly place where you can go for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just for a borrel and everything is fundamentally delicious but guilt-free\"\u200b, says co-founder Gustavo Bottino.\n\nSOIL promises delicious food made from local and seasonal ingredients. The fast-casual restaurant is plant-centric but also believes there is a place for high-quality animal products from conscious local farmers who have adopted sustainable and humane farming practices. This means beef, chicken, eggs and cheese can be added optionally to the vegan base dishes. SOIL's menu promotes balance, flexibility and the concept of 'less but better'\u200b.",
