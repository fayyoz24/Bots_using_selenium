    "summary": "Technology affects our lives and assists our everyday living. What has been achieved in recent years is extraordinary.\n\nI believe that the path to success is paved by people who are ambitious, motivated, passionate and brave enough to push the boundaries of what we can achieve. Those who love what they do, are willing to improve themselves, meet their goals, help others along the way, and make an impact.\n \nThrough various competitions relevant to my field of studies, such as hackathons and the NASA App Challenge, and business related competitions like the ClimateLaunchpad 2017, I work closely with friends and I relish the opportunity to meet new people. I observe how others work together, how they establish new ideas and accomplish common goals. This inspires me to develop myself, and encourages me to take part in seminars, courses and competitions. \n\nIn pursuit of these, I became a volunteer in IAESTE Cyprus and a IAESTE Trainee in Kazakhstan where I had the chance to meet and work with people from different fields and cultures.  Moreover, I proceeded with my Graduate studies and currently, I am a Biomedical Engineering MSc student at TU Delft.\n\nMy current objective is to focus on my studies, develop future research, and fulfil my ambitions.\n",
