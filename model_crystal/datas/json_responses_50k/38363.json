Our committees were lacking members and as such some events and initiatives could not take place as planned. Moreover, the health crisis made it impossible for us to hold our planned charity ball and excursion. Lessons learned from this year are, that no matter what we are given or have at our disposal, flexibility and compassion are key. Communicating whenever there are issues and resolving them as a team is a non-negotiable. Failure is okay and most often leads to growth, creating an opening for other solutions and perspectives.",
