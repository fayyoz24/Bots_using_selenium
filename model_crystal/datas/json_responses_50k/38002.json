    "summary": "Doctor of Dentistry | MSc. Management, Policy-Analysis & Entrepreneurship in Health & Life Sciences\n\nPassionate about healthcare innovation, I bring a unique blend of medical expertise and business acumen to drive transformative change. With a solid foundation in dentistry from India, I gained firsthand experience within India's healthcare system. Currently pursuing an MSc. in Management, Policy-Analysis & Entrepreneurship in Health & Life Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I am dedicated to bridging the gap between healthcare and business. \n\nMy recent research internship at GOAL3 focused on helping my team developing a data-driven decision support system for neonatal and paediatric continuous vital sign monitoring by conducting qualitative research about implementation fidelity & healthcare professional's needs & requirements. This involved identifying and delineating crucial data for creating a digital dashboard as an e-Health tool, empowering healthcare professionals with data-supported decision-making to enhance the quality of care.\n\nPassionate about healthcare consulting, project management, and business development, I am eager to contribute to the field. My interests lie in areas related to clinical development & trials, good clinical practice (GCP), quality assurances, regulatory approvals, and monitoring & evaluation within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nLet's connect and explore opportunities to leverage my diverse skill set and passion for healthcare innovation. Together, we can drive positive change and shape the future of healthcare.",
