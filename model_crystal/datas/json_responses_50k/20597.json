    "summary": "''A problem becomes a problem, when it is acknowledged as a problem.'' - Lecturers at AUAS\n\nIn my career in becoming an IT-Consultant, one of the first few things I was taught was the quote mentioned above. Ever since, I have never forgotten about it. This is the place where I can put my passion of (re)organizing stuff and structuring the 'impossible' to good use. What I love about the IT-industry is that it has no end, I can learn new things and keep on expanding my horizon.\n\nDuring my soccer career someone once asked me \"why are you not the one who is finishing the attack?\" I would simply say that I have more to gain by playing together rather than scoring the goal myself. My team and I have the same goal that we need to reach, so why shouldn't I help them become the best version of themselves. In my opinion the process to the final result counts more than achieving the final result itself. I apply the same thinking when I work on a project. Without proper teamwork and a shared goal, a project is bound to fail. \n\nI love to dig into problems, solve them with the right approach and to keep an overview of the overall problems. Just like how I would rather be a midfielder to create opportunities for others than to finish the goal as a striker myself. \n\nLuckily, I can put the same passion into my work. From my Business IT & Management background, I can ensure that the distance between IT and other work processes within an organization narrows. As by narrowing gaps, the final goal can be achieved.",
