    "summary": "I\u2019ve always had a special inclination to make 3D models & 2D projections. As a child, I loved to predict the shadows & projections of real objects from different angles. While pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, I delivered freelancing projects in reverse engineering of making 2D AutoCAD drawings of manufactured components. This indeed made me get specialization in Mechanical Designing. Being a passionate and sincere design engineer I accomplished professional courses for software like Solidworks, CATIA, AutoCAD.\n\nAs a design engineer in TTL got an opportunity to demonstrate my leadership qualities, time management & creative thinking which results in successful and timely project delivery. Also experienced in client communication as I worked as an onsite coordinator for Rolls Royce, UK Plant for robotics simulation projects. \nI also got the opportunity to work in robotic simulation in BIW robotic line for which I used simulation software like Robcad, Process Simulate, DELMIA.\n\nI have pursued my Master's Degree in Mechanical Design Engineering while working on important projects for TTL. This experience of part-time education developed my multi-tasking skills and ability to work under pressure\n\nApart from machine designing, I like to travel and explore new places. I also like to connect with people from different parts of the world. \n\nSpecialties: Mechanical Design Engineer, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CATIA,  Fixtures & Tool Designing, Assembly Fixtures, SPM mAnufacturing, Robotic Simulation, Plant Simulation",
