    "summary": "Tourism is my passion. The industry offers various opportunities; exciting destinations, niche products, a lifestyle brand, and selling one of the most perishable commodities on Earth. These are all elements, which require management and organisational skills of well-trained and enthusiastic professionals. \n\nMy name is Romy Beemsterboer, 30-years old. Questions that trigger me are: \u2018What motivates tourists to visit destinations?\u2019 \u2018How does this travel affect local cultures and economies?\u2019 \u2018And how do issues on sustainability, authenticity, identity and commercialization fit into the picture?\u2019 I consider tourism as an adventure, education, and experience all rolled into one. The dynamic industry is a continuous learning experience. It is both \u2018science and art\u2019 \u2013 \u2018art\u2019 in terms of places we sell and the richness of cultures we enjoy, and \u2018science\u2019 in terms of managing the business side of it. \n\nMY SPECIALITIES\n- Sustainable (tourism) development\n- Experiential and international approach\n- Historical and philosophical perspective, using socio-cultural theories in tourism\n- Advanced research techniques and methods in social sciences (quantitative and qualitative)\n- Change, inter-human processes and communication\n- Academic consultancy\n\nMY CORE VALUES \nCommunicative - Dedicated - Entrepreneurial - Goal oriented - Inquisitive - Professional - Team Player\n\nMY PERSONAL INTERESTS \nIndoor biking (spinning) - Mountainbiking - Cycling Racing - Hiking - Yoga - Travelling\n\nI am an enthusiastic, passionated and ambitious individual. It is of great significance to give all you have got if you love what you do. And I love travelling, when my passion becomes my profession; it will not feel like work. Am I the person you are looking for? Let\u2019s meet!",

ATLAS was established to develop transnational educational initiatives in leisure and tourism. A forum is provided to promote staff and student exchange, transnational research and to facilitate curriculum and professional development. The association currently has members in about 60 countries. \n\nAs part of my personal and professional development, I got a great opportunity to attend the annual conference 'Tourism, Lifestyles & Locations'. The conference was hosted by Canterbury Christ Church University whereby the organising committee brought together all old, current and new ATLAS members as well as welcome non-members to the ATLAS family. Their aim was to push the boundaries of understanding tourism and its relationship to modern lifestyles and to destinations in a contemporary environment. \n\nIt was a pleasure to join this conference and meet so many leisure and tourism associates. Hope to see you all in the near future! ",

Additionally there was food available at catering stalls of local suppliers plus live entertainment on the Victorian Bandstand. \n\nThe Festival was organised and staffed entirely by volunteers. Friday 14 October 2016 and Saturday 15 October 2016 I volunteered on one of the main beer bars. Working at the Festival was great fun, the work was not too onerous and a range of benefits was offered. "
