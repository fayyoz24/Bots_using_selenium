    "summary": "Synchronizing Global Material Tech Transformation, Consciousness, Scale Up, and Jazz\n\nSince 1996, I've advocated for both mature and emerging markets in my global consulting and executive transformation journey, including the US, Germany, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and China. In 2010, my expertise began expanding into India. What fuels my dedication? Guiding companies and leaders to embrace an eco-efficient future and achieve lasting success. My jazz saxophonist days in Alabama in the mid-'80s gave me a unique lens to navigate today's paradoxical and multifaceted transformation patterns\u2014challenges that are poised to intensify in the near future. This musical foundation fuels my unwavering commitment to sustainable business. \n\nMy Dual Commitments:\n\n1. Sustainable business transformation and global market scale-up: I started with advanced cybernetic simulations in the late '80s and co-implemented an early Circular Computer Platform with key players like IBM, Siemens, UBS, SWICO, and the Swiss Science Foundation. More recently, I've focused on transforming Material Tech Value Chains such as Niobium, Nanocrystals, and Lithium across global markets, ensuring technological progress and sustainable growth.\n\n2. Conscious Transformative Leadership: Through my extensive involvement in over 150 global CEO search assignments, I've helped shape the next generation of transformative leaders. In 2011, I introduced \"The CEO's LEGACY\", a program that evolved in collaboration with world-renowned institutions. It's been rewarding to see it resonate with more than 50 CEOs, from powerhouses like Bayer to innovators like PayPal.\n\nOn the educational front, beyond my Master of Philosophy and MBA, my 1992 Ph.D. research at the University of St. Gallen introduced \"Meta-Ecology\", a framework for scaling sustainable HW SW Tech ecosystems. In 1997, I earned an associate professorship in Global Business Transformation at the venerable Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. My toolkit for transformation is diverse, spanning expertise in System Dynamics, PyTorch, to deeper human-focused certifications in NLP and Clinical Hypnotherapy.\n\nCurrently, I'm deeply involved in the UN's visionary 'Just Green SDG Cities Initiative'. While recognizing there's no one-size-fits-all for green transition, my extensive experience in transformation provides actionable insights. My vision is to empower female leaders and upcoming Gen Z and Alpha generations, collaboratively crafting ecosystems in cities, markets, and Material-Tech-AI settings that are green, fair, and competitive.",
