    "summary": "I am a Business Humanizer at Innate Motion with over 30 years of experience who works fervently to position brands for people. I partner with my clients to help them better understand the people they exist for, not only to reach them on a deeper level but also to serve a greater purpose. \n\nMy journey to understand people and brands started with earning two Masters degrees in Psychology. Since then, my path has brought me to over 30 countries on all continents: from Algeria to South Africa, from China to Indonesia, from the UK and France to Romania and Russia, and Argentina to North America. It has been an exciting ride. \n\nI genuinely enjoy being in touch with consumers worldwide, visiting them in their homes, and discussing daily dilemmas. These conversations are a great source of inspiration and information on which to build insights and relevant brand strategies across various markets.\n\nThe categories I have worked in are as diverse as the countries I've visited: Automotive, Aviation, Bakery, Banking, Beauty, Beer, Broadcasting, Candy, Cheese, Chewing gum, Coffee and Tea, Dairy, Drugstores, Electronics, Fashion, Fragrances, Haircare, Herd Improvement, Insurance, Magazines, Newspapers, Pharma, Publishing, Restaurants, and last but not least in this alphabetic order: Retail.\n\nThis range of product research has led me through cow pastures, candy factories, tractor shows, car factories, and LA TV studio makeup rooms, intending to consistently achieve a revolutionary and positive outcome for my clients and their consumers. \n\nTime and time again, through the results my clients and I have achieved, I've seen that businesses can humanize their companies to make a significant difference in their brand strategy and the world.",
