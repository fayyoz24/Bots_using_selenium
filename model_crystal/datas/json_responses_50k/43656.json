    "summary": "Enthusiastic student graduated in Applied Physics at The Hague University of Applied Sciences located in Delft, The Nederlands. During this study I have done an internship at SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research where I have worked on a sensor which will be used to detect X-ray particles to examine black holes in space. Besided that I have done an European Project Semester (EPS) at the Universidad Polict\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia (UPV) where I have worked on designing some educational tool to improve the experience of visitors of the central market. In my last year, I followed a specialization in nanotechnology and I have done a graduation internship at Airbus Netherlands where I have examined the possibilities of the reed switch to replace the micro switches in space applications. \n\nCurrently, I am doing the master Physical Science at Universidad de Murcia (UM) in Spain. \n\nI am a person who loves to take challenges and learn new things. I have a lot of perseverance and try to do everything as good as possible. I am also very creative and stress resistant.",

                    "description": "Grade: 8.1\n\nTo detect the deployment of the solar panels of a satellite after arriving in space, electromechanical switches, called micro switches, are used. In recent years, micro switches have shown disadvantages, causing Airbus Netherlands to consider new alternatives for replacing the micro switches. A promising alternative for the micro switch is the reed switch, an electromagnetic switch operated by an applied magnetic field. The small design and no required physical contact provide potential and promising applications of the reed switch for space mechanism. The purpose of this research was to gain more knowledge of the physical behavior of the reed switch as well as the magnetic actuators to examine the possibilities of the reed switch to replace the micro switches.\n\nDuring this research, a magnetic dipole model and a geometric magnetic model have been developed to examine the magnetic field of a permanent cylindrical magnet. Moreover, the consequences of the modelling error and reliability of the two analytical models have been examined. With these analytical models, the behavior of reed switches have been simulated. Verification measurements have been performed to examine the modelling errors of the magnetic dipole model and the geometric magnetic model. \n\nFrom the performed measurements, the reed switch has proven to be a promising alternative for the micro switch. The dimensions are in line with the needs of Airbus and a good sense of the physics of the reed switch and the magnetic actuators have been obtained.",

The TES is developed to be used in the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) from the ATHENA mission. To determine the energy of each X-ray particle with high fidelity, thousands of measurements are made to generate the best possible template that takes into account as many factors as possible that can arise in space.\n\nDuring this internship, available and newly acquired data has been examined and used to study how the energy resolution is affected for example by changing the bath temperature or by applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the detector. Realistic information about the magnetic field sensitivity of the TES has been provided to the X-IFU system and science team and compared with the magnetic field sensitivity defined in the X-IFU sensitivity requirement.",
