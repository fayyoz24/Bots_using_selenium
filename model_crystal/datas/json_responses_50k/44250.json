    "summary": "Hi! I'm Ties Bloemena, I have just wrapped up an Internship at PT-PSN in Jakarta, and I'm now hopefully projected to do an exchange in Mexico City. I've been an expat my whole life and this is lifestyle I aim to maintain for as long as I can. I've lived in the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Spain, Switzerland, China, and Indonesia. I love the challenge of making a foreign place a home and meeting people who similarly are thrust into the same setting as me.\n\nCurrently I'm studying Business Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam (Rotterdam Business School). I am projected to complete my studies in 2024.\n\nI have worked in Aftersales and Research & Development of business processes at an Indonesian defence contractor. I have learned a great deal about the Defence Sector; namely in processes, cycles, and communication methods. I have grown as an individual in the corporate sphere through a shared project between Thales Indonesia and PT-PSN. Furthermore, I have grown enormously from the experience, and I hope to further myself in this industry.",
