    "summary": "I am a recent graduate from the master's programme Water Science and Management, Utrecht University.\nI conducted my master's thesis as an internship with KWR Water Research Institute. My thesis focused on estimating acceptable concentration levels for opportunistic pathogens in the Dutch drinking water supply through the implementation of a stochastic QMRA, for which I was awarded a grade of 8.41. I am now eager to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained through my studies and internship in a professional setting and am actively seeking a job in the Netherlands in the field of water and the environment, (particularly in the area of environment and human health).",
