    "summary": "Travel lover, but not in the way you might expect. Being from Lombok island and living in 5 different countries between the ages of 8 and 18, my passions are for people and the planet. I strongly believe the future needs an environmentally focused lens- not just through sustainability but socio-ecological resilience as a whole. Conservation through involvement with communities, preservation through education and cultural integration, and resilience stimulation through understanding and investment.\n\nCurrently completing my thesis for Masters in Tourism, Society, and the Environment with a focus on natural resource management and development, in the chair group of Environmental Policy. Specialties include sustainable island management, anthropology for development, and governance of natural resources. Driven individual that works even better in a team. Having worked mostly in inter and multi-disciplinary teams I recognise the benefits of a diversified and open-minded team, and aim to bring out the strengths of all teammates.",
