This strategy was named: \u201cChile, All Ways Surprising\u201d. For my investigation I studied the role of the different actors: the public and private sector and the society. I held a lot of interviews with important stakeholders of the nation branding strategy: Chilean (ex)politicians, managers from the private sector: food exporters, Chileans intellectuals and the mass media. I still maintain contact with the persons I have interviewed.",
