At MZ-beveiliging I learned what it is like to be both a security guard and a host. The diversity of jobs made sure of that. I fulfilled the function of host in luxury shops at the P.C. hooftstraat in Amsterdam and fulfilled the function of security guard at tentparty's. Most of the time it is my job to combine both functions, this means that I give the guest a warm welcome and ensure their safety. \nBeing assertive is the most important thing when it comes to safety, because when the shit hits the fan you have to be ready and take action. \n\nMy tasks within MZ-beveiliging:\n-Coordinate party's (responsible for the safety up to 400 people and directing up to 3 subordinates)\n-Monitoring buildings and party's and shops\n-Conducting visitations and body search",

As a pioneer I planned different routes for my platoon or company, of course I was also the one leading up to 60 men past this self-planned route.",
