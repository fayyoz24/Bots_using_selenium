    "summary": "James, a savant prodigy, has spent the last decade at the dynamic crossroads of medicine, science, and law. His expertise spans a diverse range of fields, including medicine, agriculture, climate change, and disabilities, making him a recognized authority in these domains.\n\nHis academic journey, supported by governments from SA, the NL, DE, and FR, led him to groundbreaking research in MRI technology, pedagogy, neurosciences, nuclear medicine, radiology, surgery, rehabilitation, biophysics, lasers, and astrophysics. His pioneering work has pushed the boundaries of Sub-Molecular Medical & Agricultural Sciences, earning the endorsement of esteemed bodies such as the Parliament of ZA, Health-Environment Committees, ICNIRP, WHO, Nobel Laureates, & Surgeon General. Clinical trials and the endorsements of military, police, & veterans have further validated his innovations.\n\nAs a Diplomatic Science officer, James serves as the ZA-Chair for the committee to the WHO's International Optical Radiation & EMF Project, IAC. His unique perspective, attributed to his status on the autism spectrum (Aspergers - Autism Intelligence), allows him to discern patterns across multifaceted data, presenting novel insights and solutions through research and development. In essence, he is a visionary growth leader.\n\nJames's inventions and methodologies tackle the urgent challenges of our shrinking ecosystem, generating solutions for water, food, air, light, energy, and telecommunications while enhancing metabolic capabilities. His primary focus lies in the exploration of science-based solutions within the fundamental building blocks of life and processes, such as electromagnetism, and the convergence of light, water, and magnetism. These technologies are engineered to guide individuals toward healthier and happier lives.\n\nIn a world marked by fragmented scientific approaches, James stands as a unifier, using AI to piece together scattered elements and bring order to disorder. His mission is to create spaces where people can come together, experience renewal, and extend their lives with vitality.\n\nIn James's worldview, the questions remain constant, but the answers evolve. To reach new destinations, one must adopt new strategies. By unraveling complex concepts like quantum biology and demonstrating their practical applications in medical and agricultural treatments and diagnostics, he challenges conventional thinking.\n\nBeyond his remarkable career, James is a devoted father, supported by a superhero team comprising his four children, a loyal service dog, and a multi-talented wife.",

The purpose of the effort is twofold. Firstly it seeks to create and house a database of legislation pertaining to EMF exposure. Secondly, it seeks to promote dialogue on the risks related to   EMF exposure.\n\nThe establishment of the EMF Project is motivated by the fact that EMF of a very broad range of frequencies represents one of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences on human health. EMF may have notable positive or negative effects on health, depending on the exposure context. EMF has been around since the birth of the universe, with light being its most familiar form. Electric and magnetic fields are part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which extends from static electric and magnetic fields, through radiofrequency, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, to X-rays.\n\nVarious Organs of State have reviewed the research endeavors of the NRF in this emerging field and found that the research is innovative and strongly aligned with South Africa\u2019s national interests. The EMF project is a multidisciplinary research endeavor integrating efforts from multiple sectors. Of particular import to South Africa is research into EMF exposure risks, EMF shielding modifications, and bio-adaptation mitigation options related to climate change. The EMF Project is endorsed by the Surgeon General, and the Nation\u2019s doctor is provided with the best available scientific information on how to improve health outcomes and reduce the risk of illness and injury. The mission of the EMF Project is to protect, promote, and advance the health of our Nation.",

This included analysis and design of systems engineering, custom software development, database development, system integrations and enterprise implementations. \n\nDuring this time, he also developed bankable feasibility studies for renewable energy projects, including a revolutionary financial model for the Industrial Development Corporation and Development Bank South Africa. This model brought the return on investment down to 4 years, from an industry standard of 15 years.\n\nDelays in government legislature led to delays in the commencement of large-scale projects, which ultimately meant that Haiko Energy could not sustain itself at that time.",
