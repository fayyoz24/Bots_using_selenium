    "summary": "I am a Life Coach & Motivational Speaker and I work with individuals, groups and companies who want to achieve lasting and profound change in their life, career or company. \n\nI am, amongst others, an NLP trainer and systemic coach for comapnies and in dividuals, but I mainly coach hands on and from life experience. Having been through a very serious accident and a near death experience I have gained a lot of very wise life lessons which I share with my clients.  It is all about getting in touch with your inner strength and creating the life you desire and free your self from any entrapment of the world we live in.\n\nI speak at events and for companies as a motivational speaker on how to deal with adverse moments in your life, how to gain inner strength in difficult times and how to accomplish real and lasting change in your life, career or company.",

In 2019 I stopped at The Food Experience to return to the Netherlands and focus on consulting, coaching and speaking to motivate people to get the best out of themselves and their company. I was leading a team of 8 people and started this company from scratch and built it to the largest online wine and coffee seller on the Czech market.
