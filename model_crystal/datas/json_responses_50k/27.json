    "summary": "I am a social anthropologist trained at the University of Cambridge, teaching and researching at the University of Amsterdam. I am an expert on people with intellectual disabilities in different cultural settings which has enabled me to pioneer the anthropological study of the condition. I run three long-term qualitative research projects on the way support networks affect resilience for people with intellectual disabilities \u2013 including the first long-term ethnographic project with these individuals in India, looking at family and community responses. I teach on the social science of health, psychology, religion, care, and ethics. I am transitioning to working in Global Mental Health, and I am currently investigating which roles would suit me best. I intend to contribute to addressing the mental health care gap in the Global South, and in particular to developing culturally-adapted care systems for people with intellectual disabilities in LMIC.",

I run all aspects of the course: design, management, teaching, grading, and evaluation. The course has been consistently highly evaluated by students each of the times I have taught it.\n\nThe course starts from popular explanations of why religious people are supposedly mistaken: they are uneducated, they have no way to question the ideas their culture has given them, they are controlled by ruling elites, they are confusing hope with reality etc. But what if religious people are not mistaken in their thought and action? Over 4-months, the course teaches students anthropological tools to challenge this way of thinking, and the colonial and authoritarian assumptions embedded in these seemingly scientific explanations. It teaches students the research and writing skills to construct richer interpretations that make meaningful sense of religious thought and action.",

I teach students the major theoretical tools in lectures, and also organise guest lectures from different faculties as well as from NGOs (such as WarChild Holland) to give them insights into how research is used in practice.

Through over 10 months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork so far, I investigate how Muslim, Christian, and Hindu families of diverse socio-economic statuses find the resources, develop networks of support, and fashion new life-courses for people with intellectual disabilities in the rapidly changing context of Kerala\u2019s diverse society, developing economy, and fragmented health and welfare provision. As the first long-term ethnographic study of intellectual disability in India, this project provides unique insights into the ways that parents attempt to create safe, valued, and meaningful futures for their children through siblings, inheritance, marriage, and new communal projects.",

In 2013-2014, I conducted 15-months of intense ethnographic research on the unusually communal care provided by the L\u2019Arche community in the UK. This research has continued since then through publishing a wide range of articles on care, ethics, and intellectual disability - as well as through ongoing collaboration with L'Arche UK in a variety of voluntary capacities. My publications investigate the ethical difficulties of giving and receiving care, demonstrating how and why they create barriers to people with intellectual disabilities accessing adult rights, opportunities, and recognition. As the first long-term ethnographic study of a L\u2019Arche community, it showcases how this alternative model of care reconfigures the relationship between care and intimacy within the British context to open up new ways for people with intellectual disabilities to be adults even as they remain heavily dependent on others.",

Across the cities of Rome and Bologna, this research investigates pioneering projects to reshape the relationship between sex and disability in Italy that include reforming the law on sex-work, public education campaigns, and training people to become \u2019sexual assistants\u2019. What happens when you try to open up sexual opportunities through the idea of \u2018access\u2019 and \u2018rights\u2019? What happens to people\u2019s understanding of intimacy when professionals in the worlds of education, sex-therapy, and tantric massage are trained to offer these encounters?",
