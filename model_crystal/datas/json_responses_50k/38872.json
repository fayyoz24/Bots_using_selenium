    "summary": "I am a highly motivated and diligent 3. Year International Communication student in Groningen, the Netherlands. Currently I am studying at Uninter University in Cuernavaca, Mexico for my semester abroad until July 2022. \n\nI have recently completed a 6-month Marketing-Communication Internship at greenSand within the natural carbon removal sector. Throughout my internship, I became increasingly attentive towards corporate carbon removal, supporting companies from a marketing-communication perspective in reaching net-zero emissions. \n\nI have had the opportunity to study one year of International Business Management, a 12-month internship in the Marketing-Communication department at one of the largest NGOs in Germany and two years of experience as the voted representative of Plan Germany\u2019s Youth Advisory board. \n\nI work professionally and dedicate myself to solving every challenge I face through creative problem solving und innovative thinking. My eagerness and curiosity to learn as well as my sensitivity and compassion shape the very essence of who I am.\n\nHaving lived and worked in six different countries (Germany, England, Canada, France, Mexico and the Netherlands), I strive to leave my comfort zone and to continuously challenge myself to change, in order to become a better version of myself. I have been recognized for my high level of dedication, my creativity and my strong communication skills in various situations. \n\nI am passionate about development politics, communication, sustainability, philosophy and photography.",
