    "summary": "I completed my final year at Maastricht University where I graduated with Summa Cum Laude in the Natural Sciences with specialisation in particle physics.\n\nI am now completing a joint Master's degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije University of Amsterdam.\n\nTo complete my Bachelor thesis, I fulfilled a secondment at Bonn University in data analysis concerning semileptonic B decays at the Belle II experiment.\n\nPreviously I conducted research work as an affiliate at CERN in Geneva Switzerland on the LHC Beauty experiment being one of the youngest ever members to have collaborated and presented results to an International team. I am also a member of Nikhef: National Institute for Subatomic Physics of The Netherlands.\n\nOnce again, I have returned to the CERN LHC Beauty experiment as part of a Programme; to work on trigger software development.\n\nOne of my proudest personal achievements is that while studying and achieving a starred first degree, I held down 2 jobs both as a student advisor and in a car wash, this taught me that one can always do and achieve more than was foreseeable.",
