    "summary": "For over thirty five years Kristin has worked in a variety of positions/roles within the field of contemporary dance. Her journey led her to being appointed director of Dansateliers in 2011. She has recently (as of January 1st 2023) stepped down as a director of this beautiful house for dance development. Collaboration, co-creation, reciprocity, appreciating one's differences and sharing responsibility are essential to her working practice and how she relates to the people she works with. In her professional practice, she uses  a dramaturgical approach, cautiously wandering through listening, observing, questioning, mirroring, reflecting and responding.\n\nShe started her career as a dancer -working in the Netherlands and abroad - engaging in opportunities where she could share her artistic interests, which were mainly oriented towards innovative and transdisciplinary forms of dance/performance. Next, she worked for fifteen years in several positions in the dance department of the ArtEZ Institute for the Arts. As Head of the Bachelor\u2019s program, she concluded her path in dance education after having (co)developed and implemented a huge curriculum change. \n\nShe highly appreciates working in an international context and has experienced the opportunities she was engaged in as great learning environments during her career. She very much enjoyed being actively involved in the development of various EU projects, generating opportunities for artists and related professionals to further develop themselves and broaden their (choreographic, communication, dramaturgical etc.) practice and their networks.\n\nKristin is cofounder of the network Moving Futures, a constellation of Dutch Dancehouses, which supports dance artists in their growth and promotes their visibility. Currently she also holds the position of chair and member in several boards of cultural organisations.",

The outcome of the project will be a mapping of the potential of soft skill learning through contemporary dance practices.\n\nSoft skills are personal attributes that can affect relationships, communication, and interaction with others. Complex problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, intercultural skills and teamwork are regarded as the most important skills required in our contemporary society and in the workplace*.\n\nThis project aims to provide evidence on how the practice of contemporary dance helps personal and interpersonal development. The project is based on the idea that a continuous contemporary dance practice helps people deal with change, build resilience, gain confidence and develop healthier interpersonal relationships. However, there is little evidence to date recorded about the implicit but powerful skills of contemporary dance.\n\nKnowledge that is specific to dance is often implied or \u201csilent\u201d knowledge, operating in the background and rarely named (in detail) for its unique impact and potential in diverse settings. This project will identify, collect and articulate the implicit skills developed through dance practice by focusing on five examples of contemporary dance practices involving a community of non-professionals.\n\nIn The Netherlands, the research will focus on the Movement Class programmes. These are a series of choreographer-led classes and open to anyone interested in body awareness, choreography and dance. \n\n*According to The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs report",

By joining forces, the five partners choose to stand up for an important new generation of dance makers. A generation of artists who is conscious of their surroundings, think of context and audience and create organic connections within society. With the development of their work, diversity is secured and the art form will keep on moving.\n\nWith the network we have initiated a first traveling festival: Moving Futures Festival, which will start October 9th-12th in Amsterdam, then lands in Tilburg from October 15th-17th, arrive to Rotterdam from October 31st-November 2nd, then move on to Arnhem from November 6-8 and for now close in Nijmegen/Lux on December 18th. More dates will follow in the coming year. ",

They explore new cities and new ideas, give presentations for local audiences and form a European network. Each maker receives a freight load of new information and impressions and shares these with colleagues and with an audience in the cities they visit. They are invited to start a dialogue with their contemporaries and allow the influences of new places into their work. It enables artists to develop new ideas and practices, gain deeper insights into different dance ecologies and build professional networks. \n\nChoreoroamEurope 2011-2013 is financed by the European Cultural Programme.

For more than twenty five years, the organization has produced and promoted several generations of dance artists ensuring an ongoing nurturing of the national and international contemporary dance field.\n\nDansateliers offers the possibility for emerging dance makers to research and investigate ideas, concepts, (movement)principals, contexts and the use of dance languages in the search for their artistic identity and specific signature as the author of an artwork in order to position themselves in the field. Becoming an independent artist, with a sustaining career requires multiple skills, qualities and insights, which are developed over longer trajectories. Our coaching and support is provided on an artistic, dramaturgical and organizational level. Every dance artist who works under our umbrella is actively seeking to push boundaries, to turn existing forms inside out and to find or pass the edges of the discipline. Activities include professional classes, workshops and encounters with (potential) audiences through movement classes, workshops, discussions and open rehearsals. All projects are presented; in the studio, in theatres, site specific or in other spaces. \n\nDialogue, sharing and exchange are an essential part of our working method, not only in how we work in our organisation, but also when connecting to other parties or organisations. Projects are designed tailor made and in different formats. We operate both nationally and internationally. \n \nDansateliers is subsidized structurally by the City Council, Department Arts and Culture, of Rotterdam.",
