I work on providing physical simulations and constantly work on making my simulations smarter and faster using intelligent programming. To be able to provide the best simulations and speed up my computer analysis programs, I actively learn new techniques and I follow up new research in different fields of research. Furthermore, I work with the data provided from different telescopes, such as James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and analyze them using intelligent algorithms such as Multi-Nested sampling. As part of my job, I visualize large data  in a comprehensible manner and present results based on data to a wide audience. I have presented my work in scientific talks in international conferences as well as through scientific posters and papers.\n\nAs part of my work, I constantly communicate with other researchers from all over the world and collaborate with them. Therefore, I use git-hub to version control the simulations when we are working on projects together. I am also in charge of supervising students and leading short or long term research projects. For this I teach them how to conduct their own research, be independent, present their results, use existing tools, and if needed teach them how to program their own simulations.",
