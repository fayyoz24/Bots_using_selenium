    "summary": "After the graduation and specialization in Gestion, Economics and Finance, the first part of my career followed the finance and controlling path in multinational companies. During the 10 following years, I scaled by positions and challenges each time more relevant, from financial analyst to Corporate Controller.\n\nDuring these years, I had the opportunity to participate and lead several national and international projects, as: SAP implementation, SAP migration, restructuring of the monthly closing and Budget processes, IFRS16 analysis and implementation, creation of Internal Control department and a lost reduction project in Rio de Janeiro plant. All these experiences allowed me to develop knowledges related to project management as Lean Six Sigma, Scrum and Agility.\n\nAfter those years, looking for an expansion of my project management experience, I decided to assume a new challenge as Project and Financial Manager in a restructuring process in one of the main eyewear retailers in Brazil. For 18 months, I led a deep financial, corporate, and commercial turnover project. It was a great opportunity to apply the previous knowledges on a totally different environment, where the financial resources and the corporate culture are much more sensitive.\n\nFrom that point, observing the current and the potential growth of digital products, I have decided to work in this new market. First, I built a company specialized in online therapeutic content and courses. In two years, we achieved several product, 1500 students and more than \u20ac100K in revenue.  This experience allowed me to go far beyond Project Management and act also as a Product Manager, working with user experience, UX and UI, pre-sale and post-sale attendance, product creation, websites creation, social media management, digital marketing, and platform integration. Because of this experience, I had the opportunity to work as Project Manager in software development for Weezzi, a Portuguese software house which develops customized digital solutions to B2B and B2C clients.",
