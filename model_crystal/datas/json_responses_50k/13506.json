    "summary": "I am a disaster risk reduction advisor and my work is focused in the field of flood risk management, community resilience, stakeholder engagement, social inclusion, capacity development and risk communication. Currently, I work at Deltares and one of my recent works include development of guideline and training materials for the local authorities of Dar es Salaam to enable them to formulate local level disaster risk management (DRM) plans. Under this project, I led stakeholder consultations, content development and trainings. I have experience of working in projects in Nepal, Tanzania, Bangladesh and Europe. Within the projects, I have conducted disaster risk assessments, formulated DRM plans, developed stakeholder engagement & communication plans and so on. It is very important for me to understand the societal benefits of the work that I do. I have enjoyed and learned a lot working closely with local communities and authorities in DRM. With my technical background and my nature, I have a critical capability to bridge the gap between the technical expert groups and other stakeholder groups. My ability to connect with the stakeholders has been very fruitful in projects and I have always been appreciated by my team and the clients. I come up with innovative ideas and have conceptualised & developed various serious games, participatory tools and communication materials. Apart from my knowledge and skills on DRM, I have essential interpersonal skills. I have strong planning & organisational skills and am confident working independently or as a team member. I am enthusiastic and always willing to expand my knowledge and skills. have an eye for details and context. In my professional life, I have always dealt with problems in a resourceful manner and negotiated to obtain beneficial agreements. I am empathetic, kind and trustworthy person and honest person. I am also good at following up on initiated actions and checking on their progress to achieve quality results in a timely manner. I have also good leadership skills and can effectively delegate duties among the team members. I currently live with my husband and our 2 year old son in beautiful city of Delft. When I am not keeping busy with work, you can find me enjoying my hobbies such as watercolor painting, reading and being in nature.",
