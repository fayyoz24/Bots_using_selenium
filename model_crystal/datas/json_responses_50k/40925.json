    "summary": "I am looking for an opportunity as Agile Coach or Agile Transformation Specialist where I can be deployed at customers to help with their Agile roadmap. \n\nA bit about myself.  My name is Frank Noort, 56 years old and have worked at IBM for more than 25 years as project manager, with the last 5 years a focus on the Agile transformation of the outsourcing branch of IBM.  Using a dedicated and nicely structured method, we have introduced thousands of employees within IBM BeNeLux to the principles, values and practises of Agile, making them enthusiastic to use these on a daily basis. \n\nFor various customers we have transformed the delivery teams to an Agile operation connecting them much better to the customer requirements. With a lot of enthusiasm and energy this transformation became very successful which was very well appreciated by both customers as the internal organisation. \n\nIBM started this year with a restructure of the organisation resulting in the split off of the Strategic Outsourcing into a new company named Kyndryl. As a result of this reorganisation, I got the chance to leave the company with a good separation agreement which allows me to follow my passion: Implementing Agile at other companies. \n\nI am now actively looking for a new challenge so I am open to ideas.\n\nThanks for your help",
