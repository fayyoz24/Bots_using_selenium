    "summary": "Hi there, my name is Maik Overmars and I am currently PhD student at the Mathematics of Operations Research group at the University of Twente. The fields I specialize are Data Science and Stochastic Operations Research. Topics from these fields that interest me are machine learning and solving decision making problems among others.\n\nAs an Applied Mathematician my passion is to use mathematics to solve real world problems. I think I'm at my best when I apply mathematical methods to model these problems. Due to its generality, such methods can be applied in very many cases.\n\nI'm a calm worker who is great at working on problems individually. However, I enjoy it most when I work on a project in a team. Furthermore, I'm a quick learner and can pick up new skills fast.",

During my internship, I analyzed data sets that TSC had collected from a large number of events. This data included what type and how many incidents happened at events, what type of people visited the events, at what time most visitors arrived and more. The goal was to use this data to predict the incidents that can happen at an event in terms of the visitor demographic.\n\nIn my internship I learned how to use Python to collect data from multiple sources, such as Excel sheets. I applied machine learning techniques on this data, also using Python. I applied models from courses I learned during my Master's. These models included different types of regression, decision trees, principal component analysis and more.",
