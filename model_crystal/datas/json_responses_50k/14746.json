    "summary": "I'm a driven person with a strong analytical mindset concerning (financial) institutions, IT and processes. My way of learning is by doing, in a self-starting way, and also asking the necessary questions. Previous work and my academic background have led to experience in project-driven surroundings, working in teams and analyzing business requirements, business settings and data integrity. \n\nMy experience lies in business consultancy/analysis and information analysis,  mostly in the health insurance sector and telecommunications on the aspects of IP Address Management, IT Asset Management and IT Service Management. I also have implementation and application management experience in Oracle ERP systems and functional and end-user experience concerning Oracle ERP systems and Oracle Business Intelligence systems. \n\nWithin a business setting I like to act as an interpreter between the business and the software implementers. I'm characterized as an open and enthusiastic person with a problem-solving mentality, who likes to get the job done for the customer while providing help and explanation where needed. The latter is what gets me truly motivated. Devising and realizing solutions for customers is what energizes me: the more complex, the better. My challenge is found in projects on the cutting surface of IT systems, processes, architecture, data and infrastructure. I can work well alone, yet I excel within a, preferably Agile, team approach.

KPN and CGI decided on an incremental approach to the interfacing of departments and their source systems to the NetCo CMDB. \n\nThe CGI project team, tasked with the incremental interfacing, approached me to perform information analyses on said source systems and the different needs of departments using these source systems. With my hands-on mentality, problem solving attitude and particularly my ability to continuously switch between software, documents, department data and theoretical configuration, I managed to be added value for the team as well as managed to help each department. \n\nAs a result all tasked department assets have been correctly made available in the NetCo CMDB within time and budget constraints. Together with the CGI project team, I have designed, tested and implemented new functionalities as well as improvements on NetCo CMDB and non-NetCo CMDB source systems (such as GLPI and Infoblox). Additionally, new configuration items have been configured by me and the project team acquired maintenance of (parts of) source systems.\n \nTools: BMC Atrium, GLPI, SAP Business Objects, Toad for MYSQL, Oracle SQL Developer, Infoblox, VMWare Workstation, HP ALM, MS-Excel",
