    "summary": "I am an expert in discovering, testing, and applying novel study designs and analysis methods for patient-oriented clinical research, notably to direct individualized treatment and care decision-making. Since 2016, my research has increasingly focused on individualized clinical decision-making in cancer treatment, with a strong emphasis on risk prediction models. \n\nI am the national senior methodologist responsible for the development, validation, updating and implementation of clinical models that predict treatment effectiveness and radiation-induced toxicity to guide radiotherapy strategies, e.g., proton therapy. In this internationally renowned and unique project, I collaborate closely with (inter)national stakeholders, e.g., PMC, EORTC, NVRO, Zorginstituut Nederland, Zorgverzekeraars Nederland, and NFK. This work directly impacts clinical practice in The Netherlands and beyond as it is directly applied in the clinical prediction models that are currently nationally and internationally used for model-based treatment decisions.\n\nI currently lead a team of researchers\u00a0on personalized prediction model-based treatment decisions in cancer patients, especially in radiotherapy. Since 2016, after my 2-year visit to Stanford University (personal NWO Rubicon grant; supervisor: Prof. John Ioannidis), I have gradually and successfully expanded my team via multiple successful grant applications, e.g., ZonMw, Horizon 2020, KWF. I am also the vice chair of the Methods of Epidemiological Research Team at the Julius Center. My broad training, combining clinical epidemiology with biomedical engineering, allows me to effectively collaborate and connect team projects with ongoing initiatives. \n\nAdditionally, I am an expert in the development and application of novel methods to evaluate healthcare innovations. These innovations are notably medical devices, meaning I have MDR and IVDR expertise: I performed 5 landmark COVID-19 rapid antigen testing studies and evaluated >30 commercial healthcare innovations at THINC. Since recently, I hold a senior advisor position for the nationwide network of Zorgevaluatie & Gepast Gebruik (ZE&GG).\n\nMy work has been published in high-impact journals (140 papers; cited >8000 times) and incorporated in clinical guidelines. I contributed to >20 successful grant applications (>20M euros).\n\nFuture plans\nMy team and I will focus on developing and applying cutting-edge techniques in epidemiology, statistics, precision medicine (molecular diagnostics), and data science (e.g., AI) to further optimize clinical decision-making in cancer.",

I am and have been involved several large international individual participant data meta-analyses in which I combine all available data from clinical studies on the effectiveness of a certain treatment to prevent a certain disease. Within these meta-analyses I also focus on subgroup effects to investigate whether certain individuals may benefit more from treatment than others (e.g. males vs. females).\nAdditionally, I have reviewed, developed and validated numerous clinical prediction models that aim to predict the future occurrence of a disease based on clinical characteristics of individual patients. \nFrom Sept 2014 till Aug 2016 I was a visiting assistant professor at the Julius Center as I was appointed as a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University (see below)",

Further, my research included both primary research as well as meta-analytical research.

Vergouwe) and the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (Dr. C.W. Hukkelhoven) I validated a prognostic model that aims to predict perinatal and neonatal death based on certain birth characteristics. The model was developed in England and we were interested in whether the model would perform equally well in a Dutch setting. The scientific paper of this internship was ultimately published in the best journal in the field of Pediatrics and later on published as an invited double publication in the Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde.
