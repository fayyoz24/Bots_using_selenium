    "summary": "I'm a hands-on Project Manager / Product Owner with 20 years experience in Payments (both cash and electronic), Supply Chain Management, Business Change Management and Business Process Outsourcing. I always look from a business perspective to process improvements and changes. Team focus, short communication lines and clear reporting are in my opinion essential for the speed with which results are achieved.\n\nMy character can be described as result-oriented, analytical, pragmatic and with a good sense of humour. I am convinced that in successful projects, a methodology is important, but that people make the difference. In addition to focusing on budget, timelines and quality is my approach therefore on team development and the acquisition and retention of commitment. This makes the project result a common goal.\n\nSuccess factors: \n\u2022\tPrince2\n\u2022\tSCRUM",
