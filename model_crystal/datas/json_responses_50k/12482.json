My work for NS mostly involved maintenance of several Windows Mobile apps for the scanners carried by conductors, but also migration of an internal registration system to a modern server environment. For DHL I primarily worked on a navigation app for Android that allows couriers to plan and drive their delivery routes more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, I also worked on an in-house project called RoutiGo, which is a cloud-based version of the product we made for DHL, aimed at small to medium-sized transport companies. Here I worked on adapting the backend to turn it into a more generalized product, building a web application that allows planners to inspect routes before releasing them to the couriers, as well as taking care of the automated deployment process and maintaining the cloud servers.",
