I had the opportunity of learning about and taking part into the different stages of development of an R&D project and to see how failure analysis is dealt with.\nDuring this period, I was also trained to have a full overview on how the company is organised and on the business peculiarities.\n\nAfter that, I spent several months in one of the company's plants (Livorno Mare Plant), first learning about the internal dynamics and roles of the plant and then being responsible of the industrialization of a new product (which I had already been following during my R&D period). During this phase, the most important thing was being able to quickly react to solve the problems which might happen with the process or with the machinery.\nI have also worked as a blue collar for one month, which gave me the chance to learn about the way a plant works from a different point of view and to propose some improvement ideas thanks to my direct experience. It also helped me to understand how important the relationship white-blue collars is. \n\nDuring the third part of the graduate programme, I got assigned to the sales department, where I learnt about the market distribution of the accessories business and cooperated with the sales manager in several projects and meetings. \nMoreover, I took care of the preparation of the documentation for qualification tests with foreign utilities, thus contacting all of the involved departments and coordinating the data collection.",

It is composed by a variable number (60 to 100 in average) of members from the local groups, thus involving people from all over Europe.\nMost of the communication and of the work happens online, and the coordinator is responsible of following things through with the project leaders and represent the committees on events.\nTwice a year, some of the committee members also meet for a live working events, where the coordinator is responsible for everything regarding the content, the outcomes, their dissemination and the implementation of the decisions which might have been taken.\n\nDuring my mandate, thanks to specific training and to the constant work in such a multicultural environment, I managed to develop my soft skills, such as Leadership, Project and Time-Management, Problem-solving, Persuasion and Negotiation, Online working, Teamwork",
