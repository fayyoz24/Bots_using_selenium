Thoroughly studied the required system components.\n- Successfully Ported multi-threaded application for Beagle-bone Black board.\n- A custom embedded linux distribution was made using Yocto : poky-2.1 and CLFS document.The three boot mediums were used : NFS , SD Card, NAND storage.\n- The latest kernel source was fetched and cross compiled for the Beagle bone Black. All the configuration options were studied in great details and depth.\n- A user spy kernel module was built and deployed to keep track of user system calls.\n-  GPIO ,General Purpose Timer, I2C driver for MPU 6050 were written and tested for beaglebone black.",
