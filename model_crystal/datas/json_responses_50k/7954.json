    "summary": "One time when we came to Budapest from Italy, where we lived during my childhood, to visit relatives, I wondered at the big red trolleybuses of the city: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t cars like this? Electric, silent and, most of all, clean? Surely nobody likes those ugly black fumes coming out of cars!\u201d Sure, my parents pointed out to me that wires would criss-cross above every street in the city, but after going back to Italy and seeing the power supply systems for electric buses integrated into the streets of Trieste, I thought \u201cHuh, I don\u2019t see any wires. So where are the electric cars?\u201d.\u2028\u2028\n\nNow I know that system also had its problems, but that way of thinking stuck with me ever since: if we have the possibility and the technology to do something better, why don\u2019t we? Why get stuck in the ways of old, if they are inefficient, provide bad user experience (switching from a modern electric car to an internal combustion engine one feels like ditching your smartphone for a Nokia 3210) and create huge problems?\n\n\u2028\u2028I earned business degrees, but I\u2019ve never let go of my passion for technology, and now I use the best of both worlds to find solutions to tomorrow\u2019s challenges. How can we revamp an old-fashioned industry like the energy sector with radical digital innovations like blockchain? How can we create a fleet of connected vehicles and put them into service in trucking, a booming industry with personnel shortages? How can we create urban environments that can adapt to climate change and provide new services to their citizens and businesses? How can we reform a business model that has been used for more than a decade to adapt it to a new technology?\u2028\u2028\n\nThese are just a few of the topics I\u2019ve worked on during my career, surrounded by people from every background, bringing their knowledge together, gaining insights, consulting with clients and partners, disseminating information, compiling strategy briefings, presenting them to decision makers and driving the actions needed to make change happen.\u2028\u2028\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to cook and try out foreign cuisines, explore craft beers, travel, ride my bike, read science-fiction, fantasy and history and do photography.\u2028\n\nOne more thing: I once read that humans cannot lick their elbows. Having never tried it at the time, I did. I\u2019ll have you know that yes, I can lick my elbow. Dare to try. ",
