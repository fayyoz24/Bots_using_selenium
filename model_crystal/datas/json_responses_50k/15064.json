    "summary": "Hello!\n\nI'm an Italian-rooted Managing Consultant with a focus on Energy Transition and a deep passion for innovation and sustainability with consulting and business development expertise spanning multiple markets and industries.\n\nBased in Amsterdam, I'm currently part of IBM's Customer Transformation practice, engaged with global customers in the heavy industry, primarily mining. My role centres on digital platforms' role in accelerating decarbonization through data integration, enrichment, process optimization, and critical operations management.\n\nMy background showcases a robust business acumen and a sincere interest in innovation. I specialize in Business Development, adept at shaping Go-to-Market strategies, establishing Target Operating Models, and leading workstreams. I'm also well-versed in project management, advocating Agile methodologies and serving as a Scrum Master.\n\nBefore joining IBM, I thrived as a Business Development Manager at SMEG in BENELUX, driving online sales growth through bespoke products and digital transformations. A stint at Toyota Tsusho in Belgium exposed me to researching business dynamics, particularly the impact of 3D printing and Hydrogen on the Toyota Production System (TPS), alongside valuable insights into Japanese culture and Lean Management practices.\n\nMy journey has taken me from my Italian roots to diverse roles in Ireland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, allowing me to thrive in different cultures and capacities.\n\nOn a personal note, I'm driven by ambition, a thirst for learning, and a competitive spirit, which I previously channelled through semiprofessional sports during my youth. As a matter of fact, I played many and specifically, I did alpine ski races for about 8 years. A sport that has not only taught me to always push for the best but more so taught me how to be a valuable team player. These are some of the values that I passionately bring to my day-to-day work.",
