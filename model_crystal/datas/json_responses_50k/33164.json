    "summary": "I was always fascinated by the fact that Design can be applied on a range of areas and has the power to really improve people's health and living. That's why I chose to dedicate my studies and my professional life to the design field.\n\nI have a Bachelor degree in Product Design from UNESP in Brazil and have studied Creative Product Design at University of West of England in Bristol for one year. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to learn about product design, design processes and the design mindset, which are today very powerful tools that I use to work with innovation and creativity.\n\nI have experience in working as an Innovation Consultant, accelerating the innovation process for big corporations using Agile and Design Thinking methodologies. I conducted several design thinking workshops and led design sprints as a product owner in different kinds of industries (healthcare, tools, consumer goods, pharmaceutical, etc).\n\nCurrently, my work is focused on digital product development and on the creation of design solutions that are viable from a tech and business perspective. And of course, that delivers true value for users.",
