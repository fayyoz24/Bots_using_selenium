Radiocarbon dating of these charcoal fragments resulted in unexpected young radiocarbon ages. It was hypothesized that adsorption of young organic material to the charcoal disturbed the radiocarbon dating. Therefore, several treatment methods were used to remove this adsorbed fraction, after which the composition of the charcoal was analyzed by pyrolysis-GC/MS. It was indeed shown that 1) several fractions of the soil organic matter adsorbed to the charcoal, 2) these fractions could be removed and 3) the adsorbed young organic material disturbed the radiocarbon dating. This could have far-reaching implications for future and past radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments.",
