In parallel, I am also fascinated by the concept of financing nature and gaining a comprehensive understanding of impact investing. I aim to combine these areas of expertise to provide distilled, detailed, and science-based research to stakeholders engaged in responsible investing. By doing so, I aim to guide the path toward achieving net-zero emissions and promoting environmental, social, and governance values in investments.",
