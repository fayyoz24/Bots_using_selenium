    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b I'm an Agile Coach. Yes, I tend to write down everything on post-its. (nowadays, mainly on Miro)\n\nI also help teams/organizations to be customer-focused by\n- having short feedback loops \n- fostering a continuous improvement culture\n- minimizing \"bureaucracy\".\n\nSounds cool? Let me make it more tangible;\n\n\u2705As a manager, when you work with me, you can expect \n- finding ways to engage \"all\" in the change (most people don't resist change, they resist being changed)\n- learning about yourself and from \"all\" about how you might improve the whole system(focus on long-lasting change, not only daily quick wins)\n- discovering practices to shape the boundaries in which people can thrive(autonomy loves alignment)\n\n\u2705As a team, when you work with me, you can expect \n- having more space to make decisions about the way you work\n- increased awareness of the impact of your current way of working\n- experimenting with a way of working with a clear benefit in mind\n\n\ud83d\udd8dI frequently use visualization to simplify(but not oversimplify) complex ideas/concepts. It helps me think and work with leaders, team members, and other coaches on organizational opportunities.\n\nMy values are:\n- \"respect for people\"\n- \"involve many brains, not only a few\"\n- \"transparent real-time feedback\"\n\n\u26cf Specialties:\n- Agile Coaching, 1-on-1 Coaching, Team Building, Servant Leadership, Open Space Technology\n- Scrum, Kanban, Facilitation, Visualization, Lean Startup\n- Workshop Design, Product Vision, Prototyping, User Story Mapping, Product Roadmaps, Product Backlog Management, Coaching Product Owners\n- Public Speaking",
