    "summary": "I'd describe myself as a kind, empathetic, hard-working and enthusiastic team player who's not afraid of new challenges which call for creative solutions.\n\nWith this being said, I can say that one of my top priorities is staying true to myself; which means pursuing a career in something I am wholeheartedly passionate about. In my case, I am deeply passionate about climate change, as I regard it as one of the most critical issues of the 21st century. \nNext to this, I discovered my passion for arts and culture while living in New York City.\nI can see myself working in either one of these areas in the future. \n\nIf you are interested in more information about my work experience or educational background, please feel free to contact me.",

Besides this, I represented HAN University of Applied Sciences at a student fair in Dortmund, Germany. Last but not least, I got to participate in a social media project, which consisted of two different projects. One of them was creating the After Movie of the HAN Open Day, in which I interviewed students and showed the viewer around the campus. The other one was conducting multiple interviews with students from various countries, which were asked to talk about various topics related to being a student at HAN University of Applied Sciences.",
