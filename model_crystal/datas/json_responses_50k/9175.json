    "summary": "I am a hard-working person who is fascinated by languages and cultures. I have been actively learning Dutch for almost one and a half years. I also speak Hungarian, English and a bit of French. I am used to working in a team and working remotely as well. My studies and previous professions allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and react sensibly in any situations. Teaching is one of my passions, I am a patient and empathetic teacher who loves motivating her students to reach their goals. I am a freshly graduated teacher, who gained her Master of Education in July 2022. I had worked as a Junior Mentor for 1.5 years at a Hungarian student employment agency, Mel\u00f3Di\u00e1k. Therefore, I am familiar with recruting, billing and keeping contacts with partners and students. Planning and organising come natural to me as I am a licensed tourist guide and worked in this field for almost 3 years. Finding the best deals is something I could do passionately as I enjoy using my sales skills on a daily basis. I learn quickly and I do not get scared of any new challenges.",
