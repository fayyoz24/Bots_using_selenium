    "summary": "After an extensive career within the international Oil &Gas industry (Royal Dutch Shell), I  am now working for Hi Delta, a foundation that supports networking and joint innovation for high tech and manufacturing companies, their suppliers, knowledge and government organisations in the western part of The Netherlands.  \n\nI am an all-round IT professional (30+ years) mostly in Shell's Oil & gas business working in complex and international environments. I have worked in many different roles in Information Technology varying from Leadership, Business Consultancy, Business Analysis, Change Management and Recruitment. \nLooking back, I have tremendously enjoyed starting up new leadership teams, building a strategy and creating a coherent, effective and efficient team to deliver this strategy. \nThese strategies were always connected with the ongoing IT trends - like agile development, \u2018DevOps\u2019, \u201cStart Small-Go big\u201d - and at the same time embedding people aspects like talent development, skills growth and rewarding staff. \nI enjoy motivating teams to collaborate in an effective and efficient way in order to deliver business value for the company as a whole and to grow individual team members in their personal development. I am a people manager, not only looking at the content to be worked but always interested in people. I very much enjoy collaborating with business stakeholders and executives, identifying opportunities, getting alignment and support for the proposed solutions and implementation models.\nMy background in mathematics helps me to analyse abstract and complex issues, quickly identify the root cause and define and implement practical and simple solutions.",
