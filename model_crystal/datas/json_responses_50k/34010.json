    "summary": "Short Summary:\n-----------------------\nTinkerer and builder. Passionate technologist. Polyglot developer with expertise in Java, JS/TS, Go, Rust, microservices, cloud-native, DevOps, solution architecture, visualization/prototyping, and proposal writing. Passionate about emerging technologies. Hands-on expert in Enterprise Architecture, Microservices, Cloud & Containers, UX Implementation, rich web development, and hybrid mobile app design. Published Author, International Speaker & Blogger.\n\nOpen Source aficionado & community leader, Java, JS, Rust, Cloud Native Advocate, a core contributor and co-lead for JHipster\n\nSuper power: Can learn anything in a bunch of days and start writing about best practices in it :)\n\nLong Summary:\n-----------------------\n\nFrom an Electrical engineer to a software designer, that's my story. I would like to call myself a software engineer with a soldering iron. My love for tech started in high school, I was assembling home theatre systems and PCs for pocket money, learning from the internet. This led to me graduating as an Electrical and Electronics Engineer from Anna University, Chennai in 2009.\n\nI wanted to be a Robotics Engineer but the universe had other plans. Turned out I was good at coding more than the soldering iron, so started off as a trainee in Tata consultancy services in 2010.\n\nFrom there on I have worn hats of a Java developer, Business Analyst, Program Manager, Tech Lead, Solution Designer, Product developer, Principal developer & Developer Advocate till now.\n\nI wrote proposals, designed software and made prototypes as part of a solutions team previously for an Airline client of TCS\n\nI worked at XebiaLabs, building DevOps and Cloud Native products. I currently work for Okta as a developer advocate\n\nSince coding at work alone doesn't satisfy my inner nerd, I contribute to open source software community. I'm the co-lead & active contributor for JHipster, a cool application development platform (www.jhipster.tech). I also host multiple OSS tools and Projects and write blogs. I have also published two books.\n\nMy love for Robotics, Quad-copters, and Astronomy have become my current hobbies.",
