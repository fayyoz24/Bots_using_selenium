    "summary": "A dedicated marine conservationist specialized in marine mammals, particularly cetaceans, working on ocean connectivity. \n\nMy aim is to help people, governments and industry to make choices for a living ocean, not just for a world in which marine species and the ecosystems they depend on survive, but thrive alongside us. This is not just for the sake of them, but for humanity too, because we are nature. We depend on it, we influence it, we are affected by it. Our future is interlinked with that of all elements and life on earth.\n\nI advise based on science, facilitate collaboration, stimulate innovative and data-driven solutions to restore biodiversity and reduce cumulative pressures and I am a voice for oceans. I have a strong scientific background that I use for applied connectivity conservation within the context of human society. I combine this with my education in environmental policy and nature conservation and focus on underwater noise, collisions, overfishing including bycatch and entanglement in ghost gear, climate change and illegal trade and use. My personal interests overlap with my work: (free)diving, whale watching (including photo-id) and beach walks are my favourite pastimes.\n\nOceans connect us all, through the air we breathe, the food we eat and the goods we use. From a global perspective, we basically all live on islands connected by one big ocean home to unique biodiversity. Marine migratory species such as whales, dolphins, sharks, rays, sea turtles and tuna use entire ocean basins during their lifetimes and are often dependent on specific bays, beaches, mangroves or coral reefs for raising their offspring and finding food. These critical habitats and the journey between them has become increasingly dangerous in this fast changing, demanding and complex world. Marine biodiversity has plummeted by 68% since 1970, reflecting a degraded state of oceans. Through our consumption and life styles we are crossing natural boundaries and affecting ecosystem services such as carbon capture, food production and coastal protection. With our actions and choices we decide the health of oceans and simultaneously which species, that have been around for millions of years and are part of a large web of life, will have a bright future.",

Individual development workshops were also part of the training. On 14 December 2012 we organized a conference related to this topic and presented our results. \n\nThe protein transition reflects a solution to the world hunger dilemma. To feed the world in 2050 this concept describes that we need a transition from an animal protein based system to a plant based protein system.\n\nIn a team with four other trainees I did research on the knowledge and attitude of adolescents to food, animal products in particular. Subsequently, we developed an educational method to stimulated awareness among adolescents about this topic. The results were published as a book titled: 'Meat the Truth Next Generation \u2013 Verkenningen in de transitie naar een plantaardiger voedingspatroon'.",
