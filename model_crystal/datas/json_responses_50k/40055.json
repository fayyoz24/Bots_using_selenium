    "summary": "With over 25 years of experience as an internationally acclaimed and certified business mediator, I've devoted my career to business conflict resolution. Each day, I am reaffirmed in my decision to embrace this profession, as it provides sustainable solutions. My practice is characterized by personalized outcomes that seamlessly merge the human and business aspects of the situation, while lending a listening ear when it's needed most.\n\nMy journey into mediation was catalyzed by a pivotal moment during my early legal career. A client's candid remark, \"A legal approach won't suffice, I need a commercial solution\" ignited a career change. This encounter was a driver in my transition from a tenacious jurist to a seasoned marketing executive at corporations like Schering, Nestle, Werner & Mertz, and Guhl. These experiences enabled me to discern the innermost drivers of clients and the essence of effective assistance\u2014going beyond a legal approach. In my role overseeing international marketing departments, I found myself mediating\u2014albeit unknowingly\u2014between various stakeholders. A serendipitous discovery led me to the world of professional mediation. My path into mediation was anchored through rigorous training, including programs I attended at Harvard Law School.\n\nSince then I have supported lawyers, entrepreneurs, managers and their employees in all kinds of conflict and negotiation situations. As a deal facilitator and advisor when negotiating a contract, as a mediator when entering into, reigniting or carefully terminating a collaboration or employment.\n\nBesides this, I enjoy teaching mediation and negotiation skills to others.\n\nwww.manonschonewille.nl     www.mundimediatores.com      www.academylegalmediation.nl",
