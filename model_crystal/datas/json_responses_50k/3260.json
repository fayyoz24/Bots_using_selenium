    "summary": "Energy transition can only be realized through effective and creative combinations of energy saving measures and sustainable energy production, at local and regional level.\nInvestments will only be sustainable when based on sound feasibility analysis.\nInnovative funding and financing approaches.\n\nEffective energy transitions are strongly supported by local sustainable energy organisations: local companies, individuals, homeowners, municipalities need to cooperate to develop their best adapted approaches to reduce energy consumption and implement sustainable energy. Solar panels for individual housing is now economically attractive.\n\nI'm now involved in developing a local energy organisation in Alphen aan den Rijn, Energiek Alphen aan den Rijn (www.energiekalphenaandenrijn.nl). This energy cooperation will be involved in:\n- delivery of sustainable energy (electricity, gas) to households and companies;\n- developing and realizing sustainable energy projects (solar, wind, biomass);\n- establishing cooperation with the municipality, housing corporations and companies;\n- develop an energy transition strategy for the region;\n- provide information and support to individuals and companies on energy saving measures and sustainable energy;\n- cooperate with similar organisations in other municipalities;\n- any other activity contributing to sustainable development.\n\nInternational Projects:\nI was team leader for a range of international, Dutch and EU funded, environmental projects:\n- Implementation of the EU Chemicals Directives in Turkey (EU-IPA);\n- Establishment of Industrial REACH Helpdesks in Turkey (Dutch Agency);\n- Development of the National Waste Management Plan for Bulgaria (Dutch Agency);\n- Development of an Environmental Master Plan for the Marmara Sea Basin, Turkey (EU-MEDA);\n- Development of Environmental Approximation Programmes for Romania and Estonia;\n- Implementation of the EU IPPC Directive in Turkey (Dutch Agency);\n- UNEP evaluation studies.",
