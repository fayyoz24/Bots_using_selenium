    "summary": "I was unable to weather the pandemic storm at my last job, with 40% of the company let go. However, this time allowed me to focus on my family and my well being. Now having launched my own freelance communications business, I am free, happy and excited to work again!\n\nIn my working career of more than 23 years, I have been on a great journey of self-discovery as well as learning, and absorbing from some pretty awesome mentors. I've hit my sweet spot now and I a confident I know exactly where my best talents lie. It's my job to make your company's story shine and get lift off. I love to create intricate communications strategies and perfect them from every angle, but even more fun is the implementation and watching them bloom. \n\nInternally, I use people skills to create the binding tie throughout an organisation, ensuring employees are engaged, challenged, and most importantly, happy. Well versed in Employer Branding, I make companies better, stronger, faster.\n\nI'm able to manage more than just communications, getting into company communications coaching, teaching and offering business strategy.",
