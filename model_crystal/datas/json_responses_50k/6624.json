    "summary": "The beauty of working in Treasury is that it equips me the flexibility. No matter for banks or corporations, maintaining the liquidity is the key, via different funding sources and products, seeking return when the excessive appears and hedging if FX, IR and tax risk emerge.  With 8 years at bank sell-side front desk and 3 years at investment analysis team, I am an absolute team player, able to work under pressure and equipped with excellent communication and analytic skills. I am now passionate to develop step further, not only to continue utilizing the current skill sets and knowledge, but also to seek developing a genuine financial experience growing along with the fast changing and dynamic corporate context.",
