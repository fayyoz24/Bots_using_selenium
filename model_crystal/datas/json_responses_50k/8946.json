    "summary": "I am a Senior IT business analyst with experience in software- and project management in several financial areas. I have worked on system implementation projects for Epam Systems (Switzerland), LeasePlan (New Zealand), Home Credit International (Kazakhstan), CMSS (Czech Republic) and Provident (Hungary).\n\nIn my current role I am leading the Business Analyst team of the mobile-entertainment domain at Liberty Global, which is a great opportunity for me to challenge myself outside of the financial IT. In this role I am focusing on requirement engineering on multiple platforms, and also managing the agile processes of the development teams. Previous experience at a world-leading Swiss bank focused on E2E requirement management in investment banking domain.\n\nColleagues know me as a creative and detail oriented analyst with a positive, can-do attitude. I know that client requirements come first, and I can find the most effective solution to fulfill these needs. I have excellent people skills, which always help me to develop a good relationship with client stakeholders, and find the balance with the project team. I can work well alone, but I am at my best collaborating with others.\n\nI did my MSc studies in Leadership and Organization at Budapest University of Technologies and Economics (BME), which I was doing in parallel with working for Loxon Solution.\n\nI\u2019m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you\u2019d like to connect.\n",
