    "summary": "Hello, my name is Mark. I graduated from Wageningen University in September 2022 with a Master in Food Technology where I double-specialized myself in Dairy Science and Technology & Food Ingredient Functionality. For this, I had to follow two theses. \nMy first Master's thesis was with the Food physics department (FPH). For this thesis, I researched the effect of fat and sugar concentration on a quark-based dessert. Fat and sugar are ingredients that often come up when talking about unhealthy food. We often add them to make a product taste right (sweet and creamy), but it also determines the physical behaviour of the product, for example how thick (viscous) it is. My thesis gives more insight into how fat and sugar influence these properties.\nMy second thesis was with the Food Chemistry department (FCH). For this thesis, I developed an internal standard for Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) so that volatiles that develops during fat oxidation can be determined very accurately. This gives a clear insight into the quality of fat oxidation-sensitive products.\nAfter this thesis work, I did an internship at Friesland Campina in Wageningen. Here I looked at gelatin replacement in milk products such as mousse and tompouce. During the internship, I adapted the recipe and looked if vegetable alternatives like Pectin, carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, gum arabic and fibres can make similar products.\nDuring my Bachelor's in Wageningen, I took a minor in Food of Animal Origin and did a thesis on Food Quality Design. For this thesis, I researched a sustainable form of Active-Packaging. A technique in which the packaging material actively combats microbial spoilage.\nFurthermore, I like to keep myself busy with sports, mainly ballroom dancing. Every year I like to participate in the Dutch- & European tournament for dancing students where I reached 6th place in the amateur class in June 2022.\nBesides my studies, I also do volunteer work in the form of committee work. I have organized several activities such as a vacation to France and a dance gala, but I also designed a yearbook.",

The project is executed as the \u2018\u2019meesterproef\u2019\u2019(rough translation: master test) for the course Onderzoek en Ontwerpen (research and design), a course in which students work on different projects that companies and institutions in Cuijk, and the surrounded area, give to them.\n\nOne person uses more force during scooping than the next, this results in a variation in the amount of milk powder per feeding. Our project showed that this variation is significantly small. So the scooping works well.\nThe project includes: \n-how big the variation is in amount of milking powder between different people during scooping. (Significantly small)\n-different solutions to achieve universal scooping milk powder (was unnecessary, since there is no problem with how scooping is done now).\n-the development of a machine that scoops universal (using the milk powder scoops inside the packages). This machine is made manually and a 3D-model replica is made in Blender and printed using a 3D-printer.\n\nDe ene persoon zet meer kracht bij het scheppen dan de ander, dit resulteert in een variatie bij de hoeveelheid melkpoeder in een voedbeurt. ons project heeft kunnen vinden dat de variatie tussen the scoopen significant klein is. Bij dit project is: \n-onderzocht hoe groot de variatie is in de hoeveelheid melkpoeder tussen verschillende testpersonen tijdens het scheppen.\n-Bedacht op wat voor verschillende manieren universeel geschept kan worden (niet nodig omdat er bijna geen verschil was tussen het normale scheppen).\n-Een machine ontwikkeld die universeel schept (met de schepjes in de melkpoederverpakkingen). Deze machine is handmatig gemaakt en daarna is met Blender een 3D-model ontwikkeld en uitgeprint met een 3D-printer.",
