Hands-on approach and determined to achieve the best results. Able to implement own initiative and work as part of a team with the pressure of meeting challenging deadlines. Great communication, presentation, organizational and strategy development skills with persistence needed to succeed.\n\nDuring the course of several previous years I have been, and still am, involved in multiple entrepreneurial projects. These previous experiences drove my work ethics to succession in order to investigate a new industry or environment, recover from setbacks and to continuously improve the projects in which I was involved.\nThroughout these projects and multiple extra curricular activities I developed the necessary leadership skills to manage a diverse team.",
