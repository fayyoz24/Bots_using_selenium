    "summary": "As a textile researcher, I've always been drawn to the intersection of technology, creativity and sustainability. My passion for textiles began at an early age, when I learned to sew with my grandmother and became fascinated by the endless possibilities of fabric and design. As I pursued my studies in textile engineering, I quickly realized that I wanted to focus on product development and sustainability - two areas that I saw as critical for the future of the industry.\n\nOver the years, I've honed my skills in project management, industrial engineering and sustainability, always striving to stay at the forefront of the latest trends and best practices. Whether I'm working on a new product launch, collaborating with cross-functional teams or implementing sustainable practices in a manufacturing facility, I'm driven by a desire to create positive change and make a real impact on the world.\n\nMy expertise in textile product development has allowed me to work on a range of exciting projects, from high-performance athletic wear to luxury bedding and everything in between. I thrive on the challenge of bringing a product from concept to commercialization, always striving to balance creativity, functionality and sustainability.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, I'm committed to finding new and innovative ways to reduce carbon footprint, minimize waste and improve working conditions throughout the textile supply chain.\nWhether it's through the use of recycled materials, the implementation of energy-efficient processes or the promotion of fair labor practices, I believe that every small step we take can make a big difference.\n\nOverall, I'm driven by a deep passion for textiles, sustainability and innovation and I'm excited to continue making a positive impact in the industry for years to come.",

To avoid risk, it is important to know about the functional\nlifetime of the garments before supplying them to the industries. However, the European leasing\ncompanies that supply protective garments are not aware of the life span of the supplied\ngarments. Due to a lack of forehand experience, it is difficult for companies to justify\nfunctional testing and inspection. The companies dispose of the protective garments when visual\ndamage is found. Therefore, the goal of the study was to find out and analyze the functional life\nspan of the protective garments with an optimum inspection process that was environmentally\nfriendly and cost-saving compared to other feasible inspection processes. The literature study,\nsemi-structured interviews and functional testing on protective garments were conducted for this\npurpose. The key challenges were to perform all necessary functional testing following CE\nnorms, make sure the availability of the required equipment before the testing, alternative testing\nprocedure, confirm standard atmospheric conditions, sufficient supply of the samples, analysis\nof the LCA and testing cost for the inspection process.",

                    "description": "Antiviral hospital bed linen for COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe pandemic situation of COVID-19 is spreading all over the world. It is globally declared a deadly virus. A huge number of people get infected on daily basis. With this increasing rate of COVID-19 infected patients, the healthcare systems are facing crises such as the shortage of medical supplies and healthcare staff. Especially in India, the number of COVID cases has drastically increased. And thus, more patients are admitted to hospitals which causes a shortage of beds and bed linen. After interviewing the medical staff in Maharashtra state such as Rushikamal hospital, Astha Hospital & Research Center and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, it is found that the daily changing of the bed linen is the main reason for the shortage. As per disinfection, the bed linens are changed after 24 hours and sent to the laundry. Considering the problem, this study is conducted to develop antiviral bed linen that can prevent the spreading of the virus and can be used for more than 1 day. Besides, it should be skin friendly so that the patients will have no side effects.",

With this growth, SPGPrints B.V. has been successfully leading the business in providing digital textile printing technologies. One of the factors for such success is that digital printing has proved more sustainable than other traditional printing methods such as screen & rotary printing. With digital printing, SPGPrints B.V. has to lead the market to new technologies and machines and drive the company itself to more sustainable options. However, SPG Prints doesn\u2019t have a data catalog to support sustainability or carbon footprint within digital printing technologies. This means that SPG can neither claim nor affiliate their machines and products as sustainable. Apart from that, with the European Union establishing strict regulations on carbon footprint and climate-neutral economy by 2050, SPGPrints B.V. would need to take special measures and preparations on how they can stay sustainable in their business.\n\nConsidering the problem, the project goal is to analyze carbon emissions of three digital printing technologies (major business & market for SPGprint B.V.). These three technologies are Reactive textile printing, Transfer or Sublimation printing and Pigment printing. The life cycle assessment and comparing analysis are carried out by using ModintEcotool software and Idemat 2020 database. The project is synthesized with expert interviews, research on related works of literature, and analyses of the digital textile printing processes itself. This project is also equipped with evaluating input materials such as inks and chemicals and digital printing processes.",

Recently, customer demand signaled a need for a transfer paper that is capable to transfer pigment onto natural fibre textiles. In response to this demand, Neenah Coldenhove developed a pigment transfer paper called Texcol\u00ae which was introduced in July 2019 at ITMA. Texcol\u00ae can not only expand the types of textiles fit for the existing transfer printing machines but also turn pigment printing into a more sustainable and dry production process. However, customer feedback informed the company that the hand feel of the print on the fabric has a plastic feeling on the surface; which is considered stiff and stands for a negative property when looking for a 'good' hand feel. From the company's test results, one of the conclusions is that the heavyweight cotton fabric\u2019s hand feel is noticeably stiffer compared to the lightweight cotton fabric samples, leaving room for improvement. Therefore, the focus of this research is on the Home Textile market, a market that is known for the use of heavyweight cotton fabrics in its applications.  \n\nTo sell Texcol\u00ae in the market, this study focuses on; \n\u25cf\tRecognise the influential factors for the plastic hand feel after print.\n\u25cf\tProvide suggestions for a suitable fabric & process for Texcol\u00ae based on sublimation printing",

Literature research and expert interviews are used to gain information. Data is collected through primary and secondary sources. In addition, for product development the design concept Lamb and Kallal is applied. This concept considers the functional, expressive, and aesthetic needs of the end-consumer. \n\nThe study discusses different technologies to apply conductive ink to textiles. The technologies can be categorized in printing and coating. Printing consists of screen printing and ink-jet printing. The coating is categorized into nano-coating and traditional coating. Nano coating techniques are vapor deposition, plating and electrospinning. \n\nTraditional coating techniques that can be used are dip coating, roll coating, foam coating, knife-over-roll coating, transfer, and lamination. Furthermore, conductive textiles are currently being applied in a broad range of markets: fashion and lifestyle; medical and healthcare; sportswear; military and defense; workwear and safety; home textiles; aerospace; and automotive industry. Nonetheless, different market research reports show that health care, sportswear, and military and defense are the major markets. With military and defense as the largest end-user market. Three different applications are designed for each of the three markets: smart rehabilitation market, smart T-shirt for cyclists and a smart military suit. All three applications are printed with conductive ink by the Chromojet printer. When looking at demand and easiness to produce, the former application is most viable. In conclusion, the health care market is the potential interesting, followed by sportswear, and military and defense.",
