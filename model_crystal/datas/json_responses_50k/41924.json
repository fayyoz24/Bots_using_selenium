    "summary": "In brief: I started programming when I was very young, creating many incomplete textual adventures and classic math problems solver, then the game turned into passion and quickly into my job, leaving untouched the fun. Starting from the first serious experiences inside the EDP department of the Italian Ministry of Aeronautics, then hired in a small (but open-minded) company where I had professionally grown up as developer and project manager. \n\nDuring the military service I learned some fundamentals truths about life: multiplicity of perspectives is a good thing, the creative approach is a key for solving problems and engineers are often as weird as they worth.\n\nThen, in the following 15 years I demonstrated my abilities as developer and gradually as a software engineer. I built software in many domains, primarily written in Java or for the web, but also dealing with plenty of IT environment and technology combinations. I designed concrete solutions looking at theoretical guidelines, always aiming at having the best reliable final product. \n\nRecently I moved into The Netherlands, first working as developer for an online travel agency (which has an impressive software stack) and eventually at ESA, where my responsibilities are much more wide open.\n\nDuring these years I've learned how to manage the entire project lifecycle, from requirement analysis up to software deployment, passing through customer relationship, planning and even helpdesk. I've worked alone or in small teams, I got tasks assigned and I assigned tasks.\n\nI'm very keen to share my knowledge (I tutored my students and taught a basic java course), I love confront people challenging my ideas to make them better, I enjoy being a moderator but I'm also able to take practical decisions when deadline is close by. \n\nI'm curious about (a bit of) everything, very passionate about technology, good writer, amateur photographer and open-minded music listener.",
