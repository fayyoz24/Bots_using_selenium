    "summary": "I can be best described as a person who is focused on continuously growing and developing. I believe that there is always something new to learn. I started my education in Economics, but I soon broadened my view with courses on Marketing and Business during a year abroad and in a master in Marketing after that. That's how I rolled into the field of online marketing. \n\nWithin online marketing, my focus is on SEO. Optimizing websites with the help of SEO, writing original quality content and helping organizations to increase their visibility online. \n\nMy interests also extend to nutrition and health. Topics that have been important in my life since I was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and I found out that I have several food intolerances. I combine my interests in nutrition, food and online marketing on my food blog Karlijnskitchen.com. \n\nMy goal with this blog is to provide tasty recipes for people with food intolerances. I focus on people with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrom) who have to follow the low FODMAP diet to decrease and control their IBS symptoms. Karlijn's Kitchen is visited monthly by 100.000 unique visitors. Mainly from the Netherlands and Belgium, but also extending to the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. \n\nI am a fanatic and goal-oriented worker. I believe in working together to gain better results and to use everyone\u2019s talents together to benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and skills. Loyalty and sincerity are very important to me and being open-minded is something I value highly.",

My blog is also for people with other food intolerances, such as a gluten- or lactose-intolerance. \n\nI believe that everybody should be able to enjoy eating and food intolerances shouldn't stop you from doing that. With my blog help and inspire people to continue to cook, eat out and travel after they found out that they have limitations in the things that they can eat. \n\nThe work that I do for Karlijn's Kitchen consists of: content creation, SEO optimalization, social media marketing, e-mail marketing, recipe development and food photograpy.",
