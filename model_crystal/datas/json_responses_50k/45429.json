    "summary": "My inquisitive nature and the diversity of both my academic and professional background has enabled me to understand the nuances of the problems faced by organizations and the world at large, without feeling confined by a single discipline. It has also made me a lifelong learner with broad interests and unafraid to challenge the status quo. My affinity for reading and writing has fostered my belief in the power of communications. \n\nI\u2019d like to be at the intersection of business, technology, and psychology, and am especially interested in: \nChange Management | Business Transformation | Human Capital & Organizational Consulting | (Internal) Communications | Project Management | Organizational Design | Business Process Management | Continuous Improvement\n\nI have master\u2019s degrees in International Business and I/O Psychology, and am currently an OCM Analyst at Infosys Consulting. Colleagues would say I am highly committed, driven, resourceful, and positive. In my free time, you can catch me enjoying nature, volunteering, or discovering (new) coffee spots in Amsterdam.\n\nLet's connect!",
