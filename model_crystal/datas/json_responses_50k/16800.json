    "summary": "I am an incoming student in the Scientific Illustration Master's program at Maastricht Institute of Art at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences, where I will learn to create accurate visualizations of topics from the clinical, medical, and biological domains, using a wide range of traditional and digital techniques. I recently graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Visual and Dramatic Arts, with a concentration in Studio Art, and minors in Business and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.\n\nI am passionate about the intersection of expert scientific knowledge and exceptional art design through producing accessible and engaging scientific images and visuals. I hope to contribute towards improving the communication of medical and biological research and concepts through accompanying visualization in articles, editorials, proposals, books, etc., as well as independent advocacy work.",
