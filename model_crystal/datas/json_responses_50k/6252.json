    "summary": "I am currently Associate professor at and interim chair holder of the Marketing and Consumer Behaviour group of Wageningen University. After having finished my PhD in Social and Economic Psychology (Tilburg University, 2008), I expanded my research expertise to marketing and sustainability. I worked as Assistant Professor Marketing Management for 6 years at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University before I moved to Wageningen University in 2014 and became Associate professor. I am currently an expert scholar on creating emotional experiences, emotions (especially shame and guilt), sustainability, climate change, online retailing, advice taking, cooperation, gift giving, product maintenance and repair, and food waste. I have published both scientific and societal articles on these topics in the top journals of social psychology, emotions, marketing, consumer research, decision making, and sustainability, and received multiple grants for my research (e.g., The NWO Aspasia Grant, the KIDV research grant, the ERIM and WUR excellence in research grants, the EU SUSFOOD grant).  I have given many keynote presentations at scientific and societal conferences, and given interviews for newspapers and TV. \n\nIn addition to research, I have ample experience with developing and teaching many different courses (e.g., Methodology and Statistics, \"Introduction to Social Psychology\", \"Emotions in Consumer Behavior\", \"Managerial Decision Making and Negotiations\", \"Influencing People: Psychology and Practice\", \"Supply Chain Management\", \"Supply Chain Networks\", \"Principles of Consumer Studies\", \"Marketing Honours Programme\") at the bachelor, master, and PhD level. I have supervised more than 200 bachelor and master students for their thesis or internship, I am currently the examiner for all MCB Bsc theses, and I have been nominated for Best Teacher of the Year award three times. I organize the yearly MCB PhD Day, the MCB inspiration series, and many other things. Currently, I am a member of the WUR Teaching committee, the WUR selection committee, the NWO VENI/VIDI/VICI committee, and I am the interim department chair of MCB.\n\n If you are interested or would like to know more, please do not hesitate to contact me!",

One other way to move towards a more sustainable future, however, is to motivate consumers to use their products for longer. In this project (and subsequent projects), we will examine how consumers can be motivated to use their products for longer, and to engage in repair activities instead of wasting products. Moreover, we will take a business perspective, and examine how companies can stimulate consumers to extend the lifetime of their products in for companies economically viable ways.",

Consequently, all of these products are wasted along the whole supply chain.

More specifically, I conducted experimental research and published scientific papers on how emotions influence people's cooperation, prosocial behavior, gift giving, advice taking, advice giving, and motivations to be together with other people. \nNext to research, I developed and taught the successful course \"Influencing People\": a course that focuses on influencing skills, communication skills, and negotiation skills. I also supervised marketing management master students on their master thesis, and I was the coordinator of the Marketing Management Honours Programme. \nFinally, I visited other universities and conferences around the world to network and present my research.",
