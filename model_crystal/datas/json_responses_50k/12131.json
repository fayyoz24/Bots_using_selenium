By combining this data with physical, chemical and biological models and integrating 3D views from engineering, Atos and Siemens have built a digital twin of the GSK microfluidics sub-process to optimize operations and simulate changes to the process.\nThanks to the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, predictive and prescriptive models will provide new insights and control over the vaccine production process.",
