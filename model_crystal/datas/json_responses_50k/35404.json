It is the task of the Key Expert responsible for Quality Infrastructure and Technical Barriers-to-Trade to manage, with his supporting team, all activities that strengthen the QI of the country at national and provincial level. The EU-China Trade project will support this strengthening through reinforcement of:\n1. Standardisation; China needs to move from being an adopter of standards to a co-producer and exporter of standards in order to meet its industrial development targets;\n2. Technical regulations; There is a need to move from being prescriptive to setting up the framework and overall goals and limits so that the economic operators may use innovation as a means to achieving the objectives of the regulation;\n3. Conformity assessment and testing; China requires convergence of conformity assessment procedures and at the national level and international harmonisation of certification requirements including acceptance of internationally accredited conformity assessment bodies;\n4. Market Surveillance; As a major producer, user and exporter of consumer products, China needs to ensure effective product safety and protection for all consumers through strengthening its market surveillance at national (strategic) and provincial and local levels (tactical application).\nProject activities are carried out under the direction of the EU-China dialogues (industrial Policy, Industrial Sectors and Products, Information Society, Consumer Product Safety, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices) and their working groups.",
