    "summary": "Chemical engineer with 25 years experience in polymer application development, processing and positioning of ABS, PC/ABS blends and PP for automotive applications. In the Automotive period at Dow Chemical I have been instrumental in the development of applications involving Insite metallocene elastomers. Blends with PolyproPylene resulted in best in class 15% talc filled PP and related compounds are now qualified throughout the industry for car interior parts. Led various teams as Six Sigma Black Belt and developed -40\u00b0C ductile reactor TPO for bumper fascia. In conjunction with this reactor TPO, a 70% talc master batch has been scaled up to control CLTE and shrinkage after injection molding. System is patented and implemented. During my Automotive period various approvals have been obtained at different customers and OEMs with Inspire PP, Magnum ABS and Pulse PC/ABS. Besides customer service and development of business goals, always investigating new opportunities for growth, cost reduction and business improvement. Able to built strong relationship with customer links. Identified new areas for technology differentiation ie granular reactive hotmelt adhesives and filed 14 patents applications from which 8 are granted.\n\nSpecialties: Product design for Automotive applications in PP, ABS and PC/ABS\nPP & TPO product, process and market expert\nZiegler-Natta and Metallocene olefins\nDegradation and stabilisation of polyolefins\nPolymer analyses and characterisation\nCoatings & Adhesives for polymers\nCompounding and reactive extrusion of Polyolefins\nVOCs and Organoleptics (Taste and Odor)\nPolyolefin Elastomers and Plastomers\nGranular Reactive Hot melt adhesives for Body shop\nOlefin skins & slush for automotive interior applications",

The standards and labeling mostly refers to building and construction materials. The automotive industry has set their own test methods and limits for exposure to VOCs and odor which is covered in this presentation. Amount and quantification can be done via VDA277 and VDA278. Odor testing according to VDA270/PV3900 describes the use of 5 panel members, however according to various presenters a test panel should at least consist of 15 members when untrained and 8 members when trained. Under development  for cars is ISO/DIS 12219-1  for indoor air of road vehicles. Part 1: Involving whole vehicle test chamber, specification and method for the determination of volatile organic compounds in cabin interiors. In Europe only BMW seems to use their own chamber test for detecting TVOCs and components or substances. Main NOK & concern at BMW with ABS and PC/ABS is the presence of free acrylonitril (BMW 2011 target value < 10 micro gram /Nm3) and for (TF) PP main concern is the high TVOCs and the max. total TVOCs are set to 2000 micro gram/Nm3.\n",

By this method continuous LGF production with single fiber has been performed upto 80% LGF and parts were molded by diluting the LGF CC in PP.",
