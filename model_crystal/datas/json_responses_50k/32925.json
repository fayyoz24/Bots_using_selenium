    "summary": "I am the Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer of StarCage, currently doing my master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering at the Technical University of Delft and hoping to become process engineer in the future. I use social media as a way to understand new cultures and getting to know people. This approach led me to learn 6 languages and experience several different cultures. During my studies, I wanted to make something different, something new. As chemical engineering taught me how to think practically, StarCage gave me the goal to create an innovative platform for students to gather them up under a socio-educative environment to increase communication and ease the spread of knowledge. With this new project, I am aiming to gain knowledge and experience in project management.",

Consequently, the economics of the entire process were determined by using the CAPEX and OPEX costs which led to the determination of the profitability and effectiveness of the whole installation. The whole process was designed to operate at a feed rate tuned and determined by the desired 75% conversion in the reactor, mass flow rate of phenol\n(30kton/year) and its purity in the bottoms column outlet (99.9%).Therefore, in order to achieve such values, a feed stream of 58.84 kton/year of cumene and 77.125 kton/year of air were needed. Moreover, the dimensions of the packed-bed reactor required to obtain such parameters led to a L/D of 7.066 (L=21.2 m ;D=3 m). In addition to that, the flasher condensing the synthesized phenol was found to operate with a vaporfraction of 0.88 in order to ensure 95% of acetone removal to the vapor stream. Lastly, the final purification unit was composed of a total number of 19 stages operating at a reflux ratio of 5.5 and a distillate to feed ratio of 1.15.\nFinally, the overall plant operational cost was found to be 60.007.901,179 \u0404 /year with a resulting revenue\nof 66.375.000 \u0404 /year, a profit of 6.367.098,821 \u0404 /year and a life-cycle of 10 years.\nThis project was prepared under the Course General Process Equipment.",
