Today, there is a significant divide between actors who seek to address class-based problems of labor and socio-economic inequality, and those actors who seek to combat ecological problems of pollution and climate change. We helped provide a tool-kit for CEPAG's community education programs that can be used to bring people together and break down the barriers between the working class and environmentalists.\n\nThe Centre d\u2019Education Populaire Andr\u00e9 Genot (CEPAG) is a progressive community education organization based in francophone Belgium. Today it is devoted to the practice of \u2018popular\u2019 or \u2018permanent\u2019 education among diverse sectors of the Belgian population and pursues emancipatory agendas aimed at empowering workers and marginalized social groups. Additionally, CEPAG is devoted to addressing issues of migrant rights, global justice, feminism, anti-fascism and environmentalism by developing strategic social ties between migrants, workers and students.",

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, one out of every eight D.C. households cannot afford or does not have access to nutritionally adequate and safe food. With financial support from the TOV Fund, the WHC Hunger Project is working hard to lower that number. \n\nAt each packing event our volunteers \u2014 adults, children, families, individuals, and groups \u2014 put on hair nets, gloves, and aprons to carefully measure and package ingredients that become over 12,000 nutritious meals for the underserved in the area."
