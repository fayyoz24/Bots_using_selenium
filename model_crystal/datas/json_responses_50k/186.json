The Faculty of Science (dr. Antonia Praetorius, dr. Lies Jacobs, myself) is working together with the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (dr. Cameron Brick, Anna Bosshard) and the Faculty of Economics and Business (prof. Sander Onderstal) to develop a novel, human-centered research method to collect data on household microfiber emissions, and investigate how participating in citizen science contributes to learning and engagement, as well as stimulating pro-environmental behaviour. Our overarching  goal  is  to  investigate how  local  behavioural  changes  can help mitigate global pollution issues. For this, 100 citizen scientists did their laundry for us for three months. The results were presented in March 2023.\n\n\nCIFINDER project (October 2021 - August 2022)\nThis was a pilot project funded by the NWA Idea Generator grant. Its main goal was to assess the feasibility of implementing citizen science to obtain quantitative data of synthetic microfibre emissions originating from everyday textile washing. For this, I work together with dr. Antonia Praetorius and dr. Lies Jacobs on developing a new method for at-home microfiber emission measuring, and how to best communicate this to our citizen scientists to ensure no misunderstandings can occur. During the testing phase of our pilot study, a small group of citizen scientists tested our methods for a month. These results were then used to set up a bigger citizen science project called META.",
