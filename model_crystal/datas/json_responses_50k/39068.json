    "summary": "The past 10 years have been the rollercoaster ride of my life. I love building companies and products. \n\nIn 2013 I quit my corporate job at the world's largest shipping line. I went from wearing a suit and tie to sitting on cardboard boxes in an old apartment. 3 years later we had raised \u20ac3m from great investors and scaled to 50 people. \n\nToday I fight fast fashion by using technology to make a new generation of lifeproof menswear. We make our own proprietary stain, odour and wrinkle resistant fabrics in Italy and Portugal. \n\nI like doing things differently. This year we took the whole team of 13 to Bali for a month, and next year I'm marrying my cofounder.",
