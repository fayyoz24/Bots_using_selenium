    "summary": "I love building a team in a complex and ever changing environment. When change is needed, structure is missing or a crisis occurs, I feel most at home. Inspiring colleagues, creating momentum and most of all building strong connections with the teams around us, is the toolbox of choice for me. Business can be very serious, but humor and a lighter note are essential for me. \n\nWith almost 8 years of experience at bol.com, I feel most at home in an environment which thrives on entrepreneurship. I have fulfilled a number of different roles within the logistics department of bol.com, ranging from operational planning, through project and program managemt to managing a new team. I have gained an in depth knowledge in logistical planning, forecasting and daily operations. But most of all I enjoy leading, inspiring and coaching my own team.",
