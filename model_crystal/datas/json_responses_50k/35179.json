    "summary": "The heart is the sea, Language is the shore ... whatever sea includes, will hit the shore ~Mevlana Rumi~\n\nThe quote from Jalaluddin Rumi described both my job and passion! I love my job (supply chain - ocean shipment) and poetry. I am an Indonesian Javanese woman, who was raised in a traditional way. Spending my childhood in a small city called Bondowoso East Java, surrounded by fresh air, blue sky, paddy fields, coffee and tobacco plantation, volcanoes, and the warmth of humble people who love to help each other. From the top of the mountain I stood, I could see the calm ocean delivering the vessels to the port near the city I lived. I also learned the history of the Majapahit Kingdom, one of the greatest dynasties in Nusantara that sailed up to Madagaskar and South Africa, as a commodities trader. All of these stories might bring me to what I am today, part of a commodities trading company based in Amsterdam The Netherlands.\n\nMy job is super fun! I help the traders to deliver customer satisfaction by preparing the shipments from our warehouse to their final destination, finding the best routes over the ocean, crossing the continents, and bringing the containers on trailers or on a barge for a shallow-draft waterway. I carefully prepare the shipping documents as per countries' import-export compliances\n\nEstablishing a good relationship among the stakeholders is also part of my job. I love to help people to find the information they need. Assisting customers beyond their expectations is one of my best skills!\n\nI enjoy my job, and I am proud to be part of Meelunie B.V.
