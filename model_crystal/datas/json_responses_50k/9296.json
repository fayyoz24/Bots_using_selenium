    "summary": "Hi there! Let me introduce myself. I am an enthusiastic International Tourism Management professional. Maintaining an open mind and attitude, having an eagerness to learn, pushing myself into new tasks and exciting opportunities and being a hard worker with an abundance of self-determination have all strengthened and moulded me into the person that I am today. \n\nDuring my studies in International Tourism Management I followed my graduate internship in southern Thailand as a National park tour leader and snorkel guide. Here I was in charge of customer meet & greet, guiding clients on their 3 days /2 nights snorkel excursion and providing customer service whenever needed. In addition I prepared customer information project work, customer administration and eco project participation & admin. My dissertation research focused on ecotourism potential in the village of Kuraburi, Thailand. Evaluations of resources in Kuraburi as well as its surroundings have been completed and recommendations have been given in order to increase the appeal of Kuraburi to higher its visitor numbers. My Bachelor study, work experience and dissertation research in Thailand have made a lasting contribution to my life academically, professionally and personally.",
