    "summary": "Thanks to the privilege of the experiences build over the past few years, traveling (mostly solo) to different sides of the world and having had the opportunity to live in different countries have shaped me into the independent and strong person I am today. \nEvents which have added to my character - responsible, organised, passionate and confident are some of the associated adjectives - which have thereby made me highly adaptable to changing situations and shifting environments.\nAdditionally, I am very passionate about the natural world, one of the drivers behind the choice of my studies in environmental sciences and biology as well as that of making conscious decisions in my lifestyle. Most of all, I am an ocean lover, thus deeply enjoying actives such as surfing, free diving and scuba diving (currently holding a Divemasters qualification with 175 dives on my logbook). \nFurther, I have combined my above mentioned experience and passions into creative work as photographer, freelance writer, illustrator and graphic designer. A way for me to share what so dear to me with these around me: www.demikerkhof.com and @thedancinganemone.\n",

Mainly including the gathering of data and information, using scuba diving and freediving, regarding key species such as: manta rays, whale sharks, small-eye sting rays, humpback whales and dolphins. The latter included photo identification and behavioural analysis in correlation to dive truism. Moreover I performed my own research using a RUV system (remote underwater video) for reef monitoring purposes. The latter focused on a preliminary assessment of the fish diversity and abundance on three shallow dive sites in the Tofo Marine Area. Additionally we were also asked to give weekly talks about marine megafauna to the public and to local groups to inform them about the importance of marine life and the different ecosystems. Through this internship, I developed many qualities that have helped me along my academic career as well as personal life. Some include the gathering and analysing of scientific data, working in a big international and intercultural team, public speaking in front of big groups and living in a remote area. The data gathered during the internship and the report written have been of considerable use for the population research and monitoring studies the organisation is and has been conducting.",
