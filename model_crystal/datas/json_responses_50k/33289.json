The platform serves as an integrated, open, bottom-up tool to provide cooperation and a level playing field in the aircraft building sector. This will promote innovation and give more momentum to sustainable technologies.\n\nIn 2019 KLM, NLR and GKN Fokker exist for 100 years and this was celebrated at an exclusive jubilee with directors, CEOs and other leaders from the aviation sector. In order to ensure that flying remains attractive in the next 100 years, it is essential that aviation continues to become more sustainable at a rapid pace. An unprecedented task! Innovative insights from the new generation are essential. \n\nDuring the 100 Jaar Luchtvaart Challenge we devised innovative ideas for sustainable aviation in 2050 and got the unique opportunity to present our idea to His Majesty King Willem-Alexander, the Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, and the top of the aviation sector at an exclusive jubilee at the EYE museum in Amsterdam.",
