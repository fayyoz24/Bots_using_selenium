Processes that can be optimized -by improved information- are chartering and planning of vessels, deadweight utilization, optimum speed and port turnaround time . The intention is to come to an international approach of port call optimization through processing up to date information. Essential for all fleets for running a competitive business and so to improve on port efficiency. Mission; optimize port calls for all visiting commercial vessels by improving the quality and availability of nautical port information, both master and event data. To present and base these data on existing standards and formats and to develop internationally accepted standards. To develop applications and make the data available and usable within a number of processes. Decisions that are supported by nautical port information will lead to a reduction of costs and emissions and general improvement of safety for shipping, terminals and service providers.      ",
