    "summary": "With an MBA in Marketing & Analytics and a BSc in Statistics, I have a strong foundation in data-driven decision making and business problem solving. I have applied my analytical skills and domain knowledge to various roles and projects at Flipkart, one of India's leading e-commerce platforms.\n\nAs a Senior Manager of Business Growth and Profitability, I led a team of analysts and managers to optimize the pricing strategy, demand planning, forecasting, marketing, merchandizing, and inventory management for the fashion category, which contributes to over 40% of Flipkart's revenue. I also managed the P&L for the category, ensuring profitability and growth targets were met or exceeded. Some of my achievements include increasing the gross margin by 15%, reducing the inventory holding cost by 20%, and launching multiple successful campaigns and promotions that boosted sales and customer satisfaction.\n\nPrior to that, I was a Manager of Pricing Strategy and Business Planning, where I developed and implemented the pricing framework and policies for the entire Flipkart portfolio, covering over 100 million products and 200 categories. I also supported the business planning and forecasting process, providing data-driven insights and recommendations to the senior leadership and stakeholders. I was instrumental in delivering a 25% increase in revenue and a 30% reduction in price competitiveness gap with competitors in 2020.\n\nI am passionate about leveraging data and analytics to create value and impact for the customers, the business, and the society. I am always eager to learn new skills, tools, and methodologies to enhance my capabilities and performance. I am looking for new opportunities and challenges that will allow me to apply my expertise and experience in pricing strategy, business growth, and profitability to drive innovation and transformation in the e-commerce industry.",
