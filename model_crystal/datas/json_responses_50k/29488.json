My group partner and I agreed that we\u2019ll apply hypothesis driven development (HDD) for identifying a problem and finding the right solution. The process was rather tedious as for every idea we had to follow HDD protocols:\n     a. Produce persona hypothesis \n     b. Problem hypothesis and \n     c. Finally, a feasibility study \nFor each idea we designated a design sprint. Each sprint lasted 7 days. During sprints, we identified technologies used for the development of the idea. Next, we consulted professors in COMSATS University and conducted rounds of short meetings and interviews. Below is a simple representation of the process flow.\n\t  ________\n\t |Timebox |\t\t\nInput -> |________| -> Output\nInput: Input was the idea to be brainstormed.\nTimebox: Timebox was the design sprint.\nOutput: Output was three aforementioned documents.\nAfter 5 design sprints we concluded the process and drew a problem solution and an innovative solution for our final year project. Details of my FYP are mentioned on my website portfolio. \n",

I took this opportunity to try and test out design thinking paradigm and to my surprise, the process became much more effective. My responsibility was to carry out the main activities of Software Requirement Engineering Phase I.E: \n\n     a. Requirement Elicitation/Empathize: During this activity, I empathized user needs by \n         conducting informal interviews with my client to get a gist of the project at hand. I used \n         Trello to streamline all aspects and problems. Furthermore, I researched the existing \n         literature which really helped me to concluded this phase and move on to the next. \n\n     b. Requirement Specification/Define/Prototype: I guessed in the start that requirements \n          will change from time to time so I made sure to draw up an SRS document ample \n          room for change. I used a prototypical fashion for the \n          SRS document which back fired to some extent, the reason will be discussed in later \n          activities.  \n          All the functional and non-requirements were put together to produce a formal \n          software requirement model. \n\n     c. Requirement Validation and Verification/Ideate: The entirety of this phase revolved \n         around rigorous and intense sessions of reconsidering and negotiating requirements \n         validity. To solve the ambiguities, I traced out the change variables that are always root \n         to ambiguous requirements.  Hence, I turned to Lean philosophies.\n\n     d. Requirements management: After I had completed and submitted these documents I \n         managed the SRS for 2 months before my semester ended. During this project, i \n         realized the importance of keeping a requirement traceability matrix and why agile \n         methodologies are widely used today. \n",

During my experience I was able to understand perspectives from all across the globe, making me realize how the world is now a small place and that the perspective of being a global citizen is of utmost importance.\n\nMy chosen workshops during the program were: Science and technology, sustainability and innovation. During these workshops, I was exposed to how delegates from other countries think about these topics and how at their end of the world, they are becoming the catalysts of change."
