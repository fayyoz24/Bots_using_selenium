Their mission is to enable one million people get out and stay out of poverty by 2030. \n\nThey create quality lifestyle products like bags, jewelry, notebooks and more, for both B2B and B2C markets. But even though these products are great, they are simply a means to a larger ambition: To create life-changing opportunities for people to truly live a life out of poverty and to inspire others to join Tiny Miracles.\n\nSince 2010, Tiny Miracles has been working hands-on and on the ground in the slums of Mumbai. It is their deep-rooted belief that our generation has the power to build a better, more equal world. \n\nAs an intern, I had the opportunity to work at both offices in Mumbai and Amsterdam and see firsthand the opportunities created by these products for those who work with Tiny Miracles. Amongst other things, I worked on setting up reporting mechanisms to report on impact, marketing strategies to reach Indian brands, sampling, and organizing visits to our workspace in Mumbai. An overall highly informative and inspiring experience.",
