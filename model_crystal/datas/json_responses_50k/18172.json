The MWW project is set up to identify standardization opportunities within lock systems. The objective of my graduation project was to identify reliability and availability (RA) risks within a lock system for ships that can be considered for standardization. Since RA are characteristics of the whole system, and cannot be solely attributed to its individual components, the way these components interact, i.e. their dependency structure, has been analyzed. By using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and DSM based methods, the underlying coupling structure of the system was exposed. This structure was subsequently used to identify RA risks within the system. By completing this analysis, a DSM that depicts the whole coupling structure of the system was obtained and the quantitative RA risks within this structure were visualized.",
