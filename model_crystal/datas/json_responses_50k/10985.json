The prototype racecar is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.\n\nThe car from URE had until this point no aerodynamic packages. Because they needed to compete with cars with aerodynamic packages and continually improve their car, they wanted to investigate the possibility's, advantages and disadvantages they would gain. At URE I developed, build and tested an undertray diffuser for their Formula Student Race car.",

When different parts slide over each other they can vibrate an make sound due to the stick-effect.

Different forces, speeds and temperatures had a great effect on the stick-slip property's.",
