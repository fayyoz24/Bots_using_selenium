    "summary": "I was introduced to Agile techniques within Software Engineering about 20 years ago. In 2006 I started working at the RIPE NCC, as Scrum Master and Engineering Manager. I have a lot of experience in transition processes and in optimising teamwork in a socially and technologically diverse environment. Understanding the technical details and overviewing the big picture at the same time, I try to keep everybody on board in the process. In the end, it's all about the people. Technical choices are for sure relevant, but the people will make it shine.\nI enjoy coaching the Agile transformation at all levels in the organisation.",
