    "summary": "With over 20 years of experience in conflict and dispute resolution, I am passionate about fostering constructive dialogue and collaboration across cultures, sectors, and borders. \n\nAs an independent accredited mediator and arbitrator, resolving international commercial, art, trade, finance, insurance, investment and sports disputes, as well as disputes between international organisations and their staff, contractors and consultants. I specialise in the specific legal and dispute resolution needs of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). I have a dual qualification in civil law and common law, and I practice in English and German equally. I lecture at graduate and master's level at Sigmund Freud University in Vienna, and I am a much-published author on various topics related to private international law and arbitration. \n\nI am also the Director of The CDRC Vienna - The IBA-VIAC Mediation & Negotiation Competition. I organise this world-leading moot competition that attracts negotiator and mediator teams as well as expert assessors from around the world, as well as the competition's academic programme.",

This has led to confusion about important aspects of cross-border transactions, such as which court can hear a particular dispute or which law applies to a particular cross-border contract.\n \nThe Standing Council on Law and Justice is tasked with improving private international law in Australia. \n",
