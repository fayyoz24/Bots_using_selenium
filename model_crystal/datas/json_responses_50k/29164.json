    "summary": " Lead the development in the UAE of SaferTrident, world\u2019s only Semi Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) for Professional Divers. Currently Co-founded Captain AI a company that solves Autonomous Navigation for ships. \n\nMy interest in this area of engineering was first stoked while studying Marine Science at the University of Hawaii (UH). During my studies I worked on a team to develop a Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). I then went onto work as a lab assistant at the Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization Lab (SDAV ). It is during this time at SDAV (2012) that I gained exposure to machine vision and marine data capture systems.\n\nSkilled in Prototyping, Machine Learning, Geo spatial Analysis , Programming, CAD, and Management.  BSc Marine Sciences from University of Hawaii. \n ",
