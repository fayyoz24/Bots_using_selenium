    "summary": "PhD Researcher | Media & discourse studies | People, digital labor, technology & cities | Quantitative and Qualitative research  | Experience with survey-based experiments and ethnographic research.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcda Exploring the Intersections of People, Media, and Communication \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udf0d\n\nWelcome to my LinkedIn profile! I'm Mariana, currently a PhD candidate within Erasmus University's Media & Communication department. \n\n\ud83c\udf93 Academic Endeavors:\nMy academic journey is defined by an unwavering curiosity about people, their communicative practices, the nuances of language use, social change, and the power of (mass) media. My research has relied on both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. My educational journey includes Public and Institutional Relations, a Master of Science in Sociology of Culture, Media, and the Arts, and a Master of Arts in Media, Culture, and Society, both earned with Cum Laude distinction. \n\ud83d\udd0d Ongoing Chapter:\nIn my current research, funded by the NWO PhD in the Humanities grant, I'm delving into the dynamic realm of city communication and branding. My research project explores the portrayal of cities as innovative tech hubs and the experiences of people who work in these fields, offering insights into the intricate world of urban identity and the narratives that shape our perception of cities.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Beyond the confines of academia, I have ventured into the private sector in the past, where I have developed my skills in press relations, the development of innovative marketing strategies, and the orchestration of communication campaigns that resonate with audiences. This mix of academic insight and real-world experience fuels my passion for improving communication, building meaningful relationships, and fostering understanding among individuals and organizations\n\n\ud83d\ude80 When I'm not immersed in research or professional endeavors, you'll find me fueling my passion for learning, mentoring others, exploring the globe, and embracing the thrill of challenging assignments. I thrive in international teams, and my knack for professional and academic writing in both English and Spanish (+a dedicated effort to enhance my Dutch proficiency!) adds a versatile edge to my skill set.\n\nLet's connect!\n#MediaResearch #Communication",

How the people behind the data reshape the smart city\n\nTechnologies and stories about how technologies can help cities circulate rapidly and globally. App-based services, entrepreneurial start-ups, and innovative tech-companies are allegedly the answer to urban challenges. But do digital workers \u2014typically seen as crucial in transforming cities according to Silicon Valley\u2019s recipe\u2014 really think, talk, and act accordingly? This ethnographic project compares the experiences of three types of digital workers in cities in The Netherlands and Argentina. The project, thereby, provides insights into how digital city workers, against the odds, can re-shape the Silicon Valley bandwagon.",
