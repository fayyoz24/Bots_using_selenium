    "summary": "My name is Renata Ferreira, and I am currently doing my bachelor's in International Relations and Organizations at Leiden University. Besides my studies in the field of political science, I have been part of many volunteering works, and now I am part of the Unicef student volunteers in the Hague and I work part-time in a restaurant. \n\nI am a dedicated and curious student. I have lived in Brazil, Tanzania, and the Netherlands where I was introduced to people with different backgrounds, went through different experiences and learned the power of education as a transformative force. I speak fluent English, Portuguese and Spanish. \n\nI've learned from the hardships of climbing Kilimanjaro to the frustration of working hours in a code that did not succeed. However, as a student at the beginning of my career, there is still a lot to learn and grow as a person and as a professional. I look forward to working in an environment where I can be challenged and continue to attain knowledge and experiences.   \n\nPhone number: +31 620187108\nE-mail: renatad.ferreira@hotmail.com",
