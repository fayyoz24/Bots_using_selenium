I did all the communication with the client, subcontractors, field assistants, specialists and other stakeholders. The work involved drill planning, supervision and interpretation, including making a conceptual site model and designing and executing a remediation plan. \n\nOn top of this, I was working for the \"sustainable subsurface\" team for about 1/3rd of my time. Being part of the \u201csustainable subsurface\u201d team in ARCADIS, meant that I was part of a team that advises authorities and companies on complex groundwater problems. Our projects included combining groundwater remediation with (sustainable) groundwater energy (Heat Cold Storage Systems) and multiple groundwater use. We designed systems where Heat Cold Storage Systems were used to contain, control or sustainably remediate groundwater. Depending on the local situation, Heat Cold Storage Systems could be designed in such way that it would lower or increase the groundwater table (in respectively wet or dry area\u2019s), and/or that it could supply process water for industries. As a specialist I was responsible for designing master plans for the underground and designing groundwater energy systems within contaminated areas.",
