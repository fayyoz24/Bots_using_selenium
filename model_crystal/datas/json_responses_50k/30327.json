    "summary": "I am a motivated, hardworking and dedicated person. My power lies in the ability to lead, teach, coach and communicate. These are skills I developed in a history of academic studies, teaching & working experience and coaching traineeships. I consider myself a team player with  comprehensive social abilities. Nevertheless, working experience, study topics and personal interests shaped me too a b\u00e8ta-minded person as well. Herewith I create solutions within many disciplines taking social and b\u00e8ta aspect into account. I started my academic career at the University of Groningen where I studied the human brain and it\u2019s resulting behaviour. Together with academic collaborations and working experience, I learned to understand how to approach, motivate, and guide people. With my biologic and human behavioural knowledge and willingness to spend my time and effort on the important questions that our generation faces, I started my study MSc Sustainable Business and Innovation. Eager to further develop my knowledge about sustainability and to learn the tools how to implement this discipline into the business world. In my masters, I aimed my focus on the innovation of old business ideas, in order to shape new sustainable strategies, beliefs and solutions. Therefore I know understand business and posses the skills and tools to innovate them for a better future. After a year of consultancy were I got familiar with innovative technologies like Blockchain, AI and LinkedData, I am now working on a PhD at Utrecht University focussed on the Circular Economy",

We actively facilitate frictionless transactions enabling highest value reuse opportunities for materials. This creates a transparent and reliable source of secondary- or excess materials, ranging from reinforced concrete blocks to orange peels. \n\nOur marketplace facilitates transactions across sectors and industries since this is where the innovative power of the circular economy is maximized. We facilitate the exchange of these materials with state of the art technologies, knowledge and services. This means matching materials with the help of AI, safely exchanging sensitive data via blockchain and spurring innovation around material reuse with our knowledge partners like AMS, EY and ABN AMRO. We are tapped into a global knowledge network of circular economy experts. Our goal is to reinstate waste for the valuable resource that it is. This enables companies to become more resource resilient, decrease their environmental footprint and improve their bottom line by turning their trash into cash",
