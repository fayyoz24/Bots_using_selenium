    "summary": "Originally educated as a Marine Engineer in the Royal Navy, I\u2019ve fulfilled many roles over the years in multiple industries, giving me a rather unique outlook on life and a huge array of stories to tell! I\u2019ve spent the last decade working in the games industry working on multiple genres and titles, from MMO\u2019s and ARPG\u2019s, to FPS Shooters and VR Experiences.\n\nI specialize in Brand Identities and I have a strong passion in designing user friendly products with special attention to Interaction and UX. I take great pride in project management, leading teams of skilled designers and producers to create Trailers, Key Art, Logos, Swag Production, Email Campaigns, Websites, Ad Placements & Storefront Banners, as well as assist the marketing teams in creating campaigns and events, such as game booths for conventions or even organizing Press Events. I also have experience with large IP's and platforms and dealing with the additional challenges that can bring to marketing campaign timelines regarding deliverables and approvals.  \n\nI\u2019m not just limited to marketing though, I also have in-depth experience with the development cycles of games, including initial pitch decks, designing in-game UI, designing Game Systems and Creating Environmental Art. \n\nI like to lead by example, as such I\u2019m skilled in all of the tools my teams use, allowing me to mentor my team when issues arise, as well as work alongside them in the trenches! When I\u2019m not working, I spend my spare time playing games and building model kits. I'm also a huge Sci-Fi fan and love going to conventions.",
