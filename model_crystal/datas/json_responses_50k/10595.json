When health care professionals become more proficient in the exploration of their own inner worlds, and learn to attend to themselves in a kind and healing way, the greater their ability to help their clients. \n\nA course was composed in which we introduce mindfulness and self-compassion as means of maintaining therapist health and well-being, as well as a systematic way of training key therapist skills, contributing to stronger therapeutic alliances and improved treatment outcomes.",
