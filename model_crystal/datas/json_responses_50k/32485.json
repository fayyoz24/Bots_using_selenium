    "summary": "I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at TU Delft and MPI-INF studying the human factors of cybersecurity by focusing on system administration work. I have a masters degree in aerospace engineering with a specialization in air transport operations. I also have a bachelors in mechanical engineering.\nMy master thesis work focused on understanding how people coordinate in complex high-risk systems. This work gained insight into how people create successful outcomes everyday despite the numerous challenges. \nMy PhD research extends and applies these lessons in the domain of system administration.\nMy postdoctoral work explores the human factors further in the domain of internet operations and also by using feminist research methods.\n\nEducation:\n[Ongoing] PostDoc in Human Factors of System Administration - TU Delft and MPI-INF\nPhD in Human Factors in Cybersecurity - TU Delft, the Netherlands\nMSc in Aerospace Engineering - TU Delft, the Netherlands\nBEng in Mechanical Engineering - RITM (VTU), India",

With the market, it is comparatively easier to forecast demand and in turn forecast production to meet the demand with sufficient supply. When it comes to the aftermarket, the data is usually quite arbitrary and sporadic that it becomes quite difficult to derive any helpful forecasts. This is especially true for the helicopter aftermarket.\nBeing a market leading helicopter OEM and a pioneer of the tiltrotor aircraft, Bell Helicopter has a firm foothold in North America. North America is the largest market for helicopters in the world followed by Europe being the 2nd largest. Currently, Bell is looking for growth opportunities in Europe as well as Middle-East and Africa (EMEA) in terms of after-sales services and support.\n\nBy means of extensive desk research I mapped the EMEA helicopter market, analyzed the competition and further interaction with the experienced Bell staff helped me to make realistic recommendations in terms of accessories for certain helicopter models, stock recommendation at the supply center as well as recommendation in terms of market strategies that could potentially facilitate approaching this aftermarket.",
