In this function, Safety, Environment, Quality and Production are the main points of responsibility for a so called \u201cTRIO\u201d. A TRIO consists of 5 Team leaders and 3 members dayshift. To achieve the objectives,  interpersonal contact is a very important point of particular interest. The Production Manager, together with the other team members (TRIO), is also responsible to create a list of needed skills and education for that area. \nIn November 2010 there was an organization change in which the 3 existing areas where divided into 2 areas. So the existing area of Oil, Water and Furnaces became a bigger area because the rougher section of the mill was implemented into the new area: Half Produced Slab (HVP).\nI was appointed as the Production Manager of that area. \nI have implemented 2 projects which consist the saving of personnel. This projects were done with the \u201cLean\u201d philosophy.\nIn this period I made annual plans, monitored budget of small improvements and safety, dealt with ideas, composed monthly reports, reported those reports, composed and presented a Work Shop Process Safety and a Work Shop for a new production unit together with other presenters. \nAssessed new students (from April 2011).
