    "summary": "Since ample twenty years I specialised in the application of spatial decision support tools for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in a spatial planning context. At ITC and abroad I am coordinating and running short courses, distance courses and (consulting) projects in EIA and SEA. \nPast experience was in the field of mapping and monitoring of (coastal) wetlands. My thesis was based on the impact of grazing on the saltmarsh of one of the small islands in the Netherlands. I did, together with students from ITC, fieldwork in the mangrove forests of Thailand, Indonesia and Tanzania, and the papyrus swamps of Kenya and Uganda.\nRecently I am also teaching and training in dynamic land use modelling to assess different planning scenarios, using models like CLUE and Metronamica.\nAt present I am involved in capacity building in SEA for geothermal energy development in Indonesia, as part of the GEOCAP project.
