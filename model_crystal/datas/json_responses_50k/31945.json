Responding to the dense entanglement of museums with every aspect of social, cultural, political and economic life, the journal welcomes original articles, commentaries and reviews that situate museums as vital interlocutors in many of the most urgent debates of our time, from racial justice and post-truth politics to inequality and climate action. Bringing together in-depth research, critical analysis and creative thinking from around the world, Museums & Social Issues seeks to provide a platform for pioneering work across the sector. The journal takes an expansive view of museums, and specifically aims to bridge theory and practice in this interdisciplinary field. Topics may include but are not limited to: diversity, representation and inclusion; health and wellbeing; sustainability, resilience and uncertainty; participation and engagement; rights and (in)justice; power, diplomacy and democracy; ecology and the environment; activism and social change.",
