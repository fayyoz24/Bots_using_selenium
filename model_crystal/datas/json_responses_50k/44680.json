The goal will be to use this software to establish and optimize a new layout and system for the company. On top of being part of the team that develops this software for the optimization, I will also take part in weekly visits to the testing lab, where I will be inspecting engines and taking part in engine tests, so as to gain insight and data for me to incorporate in my software tasks.  \nFor the software tasks, I will be using Python, Power BI, and C# along with the in-house developed software that lead to the current factory layout and work instructions.",

                    "description": "I am a member of the student rocketry society, DARE, and I have been working on the rocket project STRATOS IV since completing the Small Rocket Project. As a recovery engineer in charge of the main parachute, my goal is to ensure proper recovery of the payload which in this case is the rocket's nosecone containing all the data. I design and test parachutes and implement them with the rest of the recovery system requiring precision skills as well as collaboration and communication skills.",
