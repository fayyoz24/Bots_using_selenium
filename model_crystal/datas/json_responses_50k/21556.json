Spottersweg - Oirschotsedijk => creation of traffic sign.\n pareto of incidents dropped from 40/4 years to 0/2 years!\n2. Gagel-Ringweg [Best]. This point was proven dangerous for cyclists and cars. My proposal was accepted and executed by the local government.\nThe result is that 2 major black-spots are eliminated to reduce future fatal incidents."
