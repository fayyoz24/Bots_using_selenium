Climate change is a global problem that will cross all spatial boundaries but will be dominated by locally complex risks. As coastal population density and economic activity increases, pressures on coastal ecosystems will increase.\n\nWHY FUGRO?\nFugro, as the world\u2019s leading Geo-data specialist, can help unlocking insights from onshore and near-shore coastal Geo-data, and contribute to planning, monitoring and acting on the increasing risks that coastal population, assets and natural capital are facing.",
