    "summary": "My name is Misi Dwi Jayanti, and I am an Executive Support Specialist.\n\nI am a passionate individual with an extensive educational background in International Hospitality Management, both from Bali \u2013 Indonesia, and Leeuwarden \u2013 the Netherlands. Herewith, I obtained two bachelor\u2019s degrees, namely an Indonesian Bachelor of Management (S.M.) and a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). \n\nIn recent times, I have been working with several companies, such as Plataran Canggu Bali Resort & Spa, Alila Villas Uluwatu, Alila Villas Seminyak, Stenden Hotel Leeuwarden, PT. Panorama Hospitality Management, PHRI (Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association), Evalan and the most recent one is G\u00c9ANT. I have also established my own start-up company in early 2022: Monocustom, which specializes in printing on-demand, retail merchandising, and digital marketing.\n\nI am very open-minded and extremely eager to explore new cultures, languages, hobbies, and skills. Besides, I love engaging myself in various activities such as Javanese traditional dancing, karate, swimming, cooking, volunteering, and a marching band. I am also a very competitive person who loves to take a part in various events and tournaments.\n\nFurthermore, I want to broaden my knowledge, experience, and skills. That is why I would love to connect with more people from different backgrounds and nationalities to expand my professional and personal networks. If you are interested in learning more about me, please leave me a Direct Message, as I am always open to job offers and new challenges.\n\nThank you very much.",

This report was based on a real-world learning program that allowed me to work at Plataran Canggu Bali Resort & Spa. In this luxurious property, I provided assistance to the Resort Manager to welcome VIP guests during special events and wedding showcases. Besides that, I was also responsible for assisting the FO department as a call attendant, performing room inspections to ensure that all the amenities had been well-prepared, and giving travel information to all the guests in general.",
