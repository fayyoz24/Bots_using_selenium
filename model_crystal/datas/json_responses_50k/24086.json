    "summary": "I am a trained primary educator who has always loved gathering people. After the birth of my first child, I became passionate at helping new parents find a community where they can feel supported and valued. \n\nAll my work experience has prepared me to take over the day to day leadership of Delft MaMa Stitching. I have been a university minister, a classroom teacher, a mom, a retreat planner, and a hiking guide. Through these experiences I have learned how to plan events, organize and teach people, foster community, fundraise and multitask. \n\nOur mission at Delft MaMa is to connect international families living in Delft, Netherlands with each other and the larger Dutch community in Delft. We do this through advice in our virtual community online as well as in our in person gatherings. We also hope that by gathering people at playgroups or social gatherings that people will make friends and feel supported through their time living in Delft. When we have friends, we are much happier to stay and connect with a foreign place. \n\nAs a person who has left her home country over five years ago and has birthed two out of her three children in an unfamiliar place, I care deeply that people moving to Delft will feel welcomed and safe im this beautiful town. With the Board of Directors of Delft MaMa, I am working to ensure that Delft MaMa will be this safe place for international families for years to come. ",
