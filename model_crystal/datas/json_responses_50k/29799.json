    "summary": "My goal is to develop tomorrow's technology, by using my knowledge on microsystem fabrication and mechanical engineering in challenging projects. I am very enthousiastic about my area of expertise and keen to increase my knowledge in this seemingly boundaryless field. I am especially motivated to work on projects with an application in healthcare, due to their social relevance. I explored my entrepreneural and project management abilities when I started my own company while working on my PhD degree. Here, I found that I have a natural affinity to these skills and I would like to develop them further during my career.\n\nKeywords: high creativity, out-of-the-box thinker, team player, excellent communication skills, passion for automization, keen interest, multidisciplinair, future driven, mechanics, microfabrication, MEMS",

However, the complexity and number of simultaneous experiments is limited with current fabrication approaches. In this project, a novel CMOS compatible process to fabricate embedded microchannels was used to fabricate a multichanneled device that can differentiate cells based on their biomechanical properties. The fabrication process was developed as a platform technology, meaning that it can be used for other microfluidic application to greatly enhance the functionality and scalability of microfluidic experimentation.",

To assess the situation before, during and after this treatment often an ultrasound catheter is used that can make a cross-sectional image from within the artery. Implementing this same technology on a guidewire would be most useful, as this device - in contrast to the catheter - is always inside during the surgery. In this feasibility study a road map for intravascular ultrasound on a guidewire was conceived and the first crucial aspects were investigated, such as: the optical coupling of a high speed optical datalink to fit inside the 360 \u00b5m guidewire, the combination of underbump metallization with vias to preserve space, microfabrication of a flexible substrate with high-density rigid islands with sharp definition (Flex-to-Rigid).",

            "description": "Many diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis and cancerous growths alter the mechanical properties of the diseased tissue by changing the cellular mechanics or extracellular network. Hence, in situ evaluation of the Young\u2019s Modulus of tissue is of high interest for diagnostic reasons and navigational purposes. In this project a novel fabrication method is used to mass manufacture devices with flexible membranes which can be easily assembled to fit within the diameter of an optical fiber. As such, the optical fiber is used to interrogate the sub-micron membrane deflection through a Fabry Perot interferometer.",
