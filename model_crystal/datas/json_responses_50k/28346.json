Take inspiration from them, and maybe you will be the next student to feature on the Wall of Fame.\"\n\nCriteria and selection\n\nAll sorts of achievements are eligible: winning a prize, exceptional academic achievement, or a special achievement in the fields of research, innovation, entrepreneurship, sports or culture. An important factor is the way in which the individual\u2019s studies contributed to the achievement. For group achievements, such as a student project, the entire group is eligible.\n\nOnce a year, and in consultation with the Faculty Student Council, each faculty submits a list of selected candidates. The final decision as to who will be included on the Wall of Fame is in the hands of an assessment committee. Other factors taken into account are whether the achievement was distinctive, innovative or creative enough, and whether it provides inspiration for other students. Of course students will only be featured on the Wall of Fame if they give their permission. ",

A proposal to draw up a curriculum of this kind has now been submitted to the National Science Foundation in the United States by Dr Michael Hacker of Hofstra University, New York, who was the third person involved in the prize-winning study. The prize was a cheque for $ 500 and a certificate.\n\nThe Council on Technology & Engineering Teacher Education (now CTETE, formerly CTTE) is an international professional organization focusing on the needs of Engineering and Technology Teacher Education.
