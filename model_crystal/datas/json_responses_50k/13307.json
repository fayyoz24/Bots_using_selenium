A survey conducted by the Kenyan government in 2004 showed that there were around 18,520 orphaned children around the area of Malindi alone.The main objectives are to supply the children with psychological support, basic education, health care and nutrition.\n\nHenry Ndurya established the organization Forum for Orphans Malindi (Pendo) to support the orphaned and vulnerable children in and around Malindi. Since its founding, Mr. Ndurya and his team have been able to establish and build 20 schools where more than 3.000 children have found refugee. \n\nOur project was executed in two stages; \n\n- A pub quiz and poker fundraising event that was organized as a collection on behalf of Pendo in order to raise financial support and awareness for the children in Wantamu. \n\n- Organised a team from Salesforce to assist in the construction of sanitary facilities for three schools in Wantamu, as well as the renovation of several classroom over the nine school that are still in need of support from Pendo.
