    "summary": "Since September 2022, I work as an Associate at the Boston Consulting Group. I hold a MSc. in Operations Management and Logistics from Eindhoven University of Technology, with a specialization in healthcare operations management. Prior to joining BCG, I conducted research at the Municipal Health Service (GGD), the Elkerliek Hospital and the Netherlands Red Cross. Additionally, during my studies, I obtained my qualification as a mathematics teacher in secondary education. My experience gained in the United Netherlands program about United Nations and Multilateral Diplomacy as well as in the work I do for Maya Foundation in Nepal fueled my interest in global development and social impact - with experience in (global) health, education and climate & sustainability. \n\nI am driven by purpose, impact and visible results, and I have strong interest in national and international policy and practice (!) with the aim to solve our society\u2019s biggest challenges and reach the Sustainable Development Goals, making this world a fair and green place.\n\nIf not now, then when? \ud83c\udf0d",
