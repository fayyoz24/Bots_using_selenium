    "summary": "\"Technology is equal parts fear and wonder because in so many ways so are we.\"- Liam Young\n\nSuch an impactful phrase that has been stuck with me for a long time now. Even if I read it again and again, the same realization hits me every time: how strong is the power of change and the infinite amount of ways we can use it. This is the reason why every job or position I had until now was related to \"changing the others' perspective.\"\n\nI have always been a curious, hardworking, ambitious and helping person, and this can be seen in my previous experience as Student Ambassador of Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences or Senior Public Relations representative at Rotterdam Business School for example. Both of them gave me the opportunity to enrich my international communication, managerial, problem solving, organizational, content creation, team working skills, achieving all this while living and working in a multinational environment. \n\nOne word that can describe myself the best is organized. I have always been an organized person who likes to have a clear image of my goals. For this reason, I am very ambitious and strategic, which helped me develop my leadership skills during the last 3 years of my life. I got the chance to explore this new quality that I used multiple times, also during my previous jobs at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, but mostly during the diverse projects I took part in, inside and outside university.\n\nI have experienced so many changes in my life and a thing I learned was that change means movement, it means evolution and it means I am learning and becoming a better version of myself everyday.",
