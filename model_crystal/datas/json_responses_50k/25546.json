So as to study and experience practically the basic protection schemes which are required to protect an induction motor we took up a project titled \u2018Speed Control and Protection of Three Phase Induction Motor using Micro-controller\u2019. We designed a speed controller based on stator voltage control method with Single phase protection and over current protection. The key components used were microcontroller AT89c52, step down transformers, rectifier circuit using diodes 1N4007, IC 7805, IC 7411, dimmer chip, opto-triac and PCB . ",

Considering the transition from AC to DC, there is a need to study the feasibility of using these AC cable joints under DC conditions. As a  first step, in this master thesis, research has been performed on the silicon insulation material to investigate its conductivity behavior under DC conditions. 'Space charge' accumulation in insulation materials under DC conditions is a well-known phenomenon. A study has been carried out to determine the electric field threshold values for space charge accumulation in the Silicon insulation. Finally, simulations were performed on a real cable joint model in COMSOL Multiphysics to study the electric field distribution under DC conditions.",
