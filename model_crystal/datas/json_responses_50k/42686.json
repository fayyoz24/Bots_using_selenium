    "summary": "With over eight years of work experience in the legal and education sectors, I am a Senior Manager of Government Relations at Meraki Foundation, a non-profit organization that aims to empower children from low-income communities through holistic education. In this role, I lead the advocacy and policy initiatives of the organization, working with government officials, stakeholders, and partners to create a conducive and supportive environment for our programs. I also oversee the research and analysis of the education landscape, identifying opportunities and challenges for our mission. Some of my achievements include securing a large contract with the state government to scale up our interventions, developing a strategic plan for the organization's expansion and sustainability, and facilitating multiple collaborations and partnerships with other NGOs, foundations, and academic institutions. I have a Master's Degree in Law from King's College London, and I have honed my skills in public speaking, research, and strategic planning through my previous roles as a Program Lead, a Programme Manager, and an Associate at various law firms. I am passionate about education equity, and I am motivated by the impact and transformation that Meraki Foundation brings to the lives of thousands of children and their families. I am eager to join a team that shares this vision and values, and that can offer me diverse perspectives and experiences to learn from and contribute to.",
