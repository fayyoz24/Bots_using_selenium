    "summary": "What I'm interested in, is how I can express intentions, images, sounds, thoughts, feelings and emotions through movement. How conscious should the audience be of this message in order for it to pass through? \nEven when movements are purely physical, the performer needs to live them. Personal involvement is what makes the dance interesting.\n\nAlso I'm always searching for new ways: different locations, new audiences, other ways to approach movements, other styles, a change of mindset and perspective. Especially on borders (extremes, collaboration with other disciplines..) there is lots of interesting things happening.\n\nSpecialties: Choreography, Contemporary dance, Floorwork, modern dance..",
