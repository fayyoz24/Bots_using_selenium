The pressure of an increasing global demand and a changing climate is threatening the sustainable production of coffee in tropical regions. Therefore, it is of great importance to enhance the resilience of coffee management systems against climate change in order to contribute to the livelihood of small-scale farmers that are dependent on their coffee production. Coffee agroforestry systems are thought to provide several climate related ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation and adaptation and soil nutrient retention. This research project aimed to assess these ecosystems services and determine the direct and indirect trade-offs with coffee productivity and major threats by pests and diseases. Data collection (3 months) included carbon stock assessment, microclimate measurements, soil analysis and a management practices survey on coffee plantations in the region of San Mart\u00edn, Peru. Data analysis and report writing was done in The Netherlands. The project was in cooperation with non-profit organizations Hivos and Solidaridad.",
