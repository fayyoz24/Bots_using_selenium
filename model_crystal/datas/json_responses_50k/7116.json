    "summary": "All my life I have lived in a multi cultured environment, my birthplace is Kazakhstan, but my home country is Italy. As a result, I developed a passion for different cultures at a very young age and learned to respect and appreciate diversity in the world. I would call myself a global citizen since I always had the privilege to travel throughout Europe and Central Asia, getting to known different cultures and lifestyles, broadening my horizons and learning about new cultures and customs. I have studied many languages such as Italian, Russian, English, Spanish, French and consolidated my knowledge by attending language courses in different countries, twice in London and once in Nice, France. I had also the opportunity to live and study for two years in Vancouver, Canada and after that I continued my study path in the Netherlands, first in Rotterdam and then in Breda.\nBeyond my passion for travelling, I always had a wide interest for different expressions of creativity such as music, photography, cinema and art, I myself like to draw sometimes. I am also into sports, I have been practicing Taekwondo since the age of six, as well as swimming and skiing, and I enjoy trekking. I\u2019m an empathic person, I like to communicate with people, share experiences and emotions. I\u2019m a good listener and I like to help others. I consider myself quite resilient and quickly adaptable.",
