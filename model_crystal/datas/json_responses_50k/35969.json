    "summary": "Paul Stege did the bachelor BSc of biomedical science in Groningen and the MSc of microbial biotechnology at Leiden University. During his master he performed one internship in the group of Prof. Ram in Leiden applying mutagenesis on Aspergillus niger and a second internship in Groningen at the group of Prof. Veening, where he studied Streptococcus pneumoniae and the effects of stochastic fluctuations on its virulence. Since June 2017, Paul has started his PhD at the UMC Utrecht in the department of Medical Microbiology in the group of Prof. Rob Willems, where he is studying the resistome dynamics in the intestinal microbiota.",

Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are the two main species responsible for Enterococcus infections. Being closely related, both carry an efficient gene exchange system which allows for rapid evolution. Strains isolated from hospitalized patients often carry resistance genes to frequently used antibiotics like ampicillin and vancomycin. Moreover, colonizing strains carrying resistance to relatively new \u2018last-resort\u2019 antibiotics like linezoid have also been reported *. \n\n\nOnly after colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, Enterococci can infect the host and eventually spread to other organs. While the mechanisms for the incorporation of the resistance genes are well studied, the process of outgrowth of these pathogens in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract is less well-understood and will be studied in this project.\n\n\n* Inkster, T. et al.

The aim of the current study was to determine if enhanced pathogenicity can be caused by phenotypic variability in a population of pneumococcus, originating from amplified stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. Expression of a transcription factor was used in a system to create a positive feedback-loop in order to amplify stochastic fluctuations. \n\nThis feedback-loop resulted in heterogeneous populations displaying diverse distributions of GFP and pneumolysin, as determined by flow cytometry. Biofilm assays showed clear indications that when only a small subpopulation is expressing pneumolysin, cells are still able to form wild type levels of biofilm. Since this could give an advantage to the population it seems possible for bimodal populations to gain an increase in virulence. Either way, this system has been proven suitable for the bimodal expression of virulence factors and use in future pathogenicity studies using in vivo invertebrate and vertebrate models will be used to validate potential changes in virulence.",

To understand valuable information about the gene functions in this filamentous fungus and other species, variable genetic engineering methods have been used so far (e.g. mutagenesis, RNAi, etc). Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a versatile technology for inducing precise genetic alteration in a number of different species, including prokaryotes, mammalian and plants. However, this technique is not yet been used for genetic engineering in A. niger.\n\nCurrently, there are four major technologies for gene editing (I) mega nucleases (e.g. ISceI), (II) zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), (III) transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) nucleases and (IV) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with the CRISPR associated (Cas) nuclease also known as the CRISPR/Cas system, or simply CRISPR.\n\nIn this project we are going to apply CRISPR technology to knock out a gene in A. niger. We will use pyrG as candidate gene because of the possibility for easy screening of pyrG mutants. We will know from the outcome of this project, the applicability of this technology to A. niger  and compare it to the current methods we use in our laboratory for generating gene knock outs.",
