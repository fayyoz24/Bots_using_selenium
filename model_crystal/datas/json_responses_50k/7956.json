    "summary": "A focused, dedicated, pro-active, ambitious and professional MBA graduate with 7 years experience in Strategic Sourcing. I've started working in the pharmaceutical industry, in different Sourcing positions, since I got my bachelor degree in pharmacy in 2007. \n\nDuring my working experience, I gained a lot of business knowledge and skills, and it was then when I found my passion for ideation, innovation and entrepreneurship. Hence, I started to come up with creative ideas, acting on them and starting new projects that helped in making the department more efficient and more effective and driving change within the organization. I also founded two start-ups along with some friends at the same time.\n\nI strongly believe that passion, self motivation, accountability, attention to details, dedication and persistence are some of the characteristics that I have which can help in adding value to the work place and achieving great results. Moreover, I believe that if every person gives their best in whatever they do in an organization, then success will ultimately be the result that everyone will see. Furthermore, I am an eager learner who believes that every experience and every person we meet along our life journey, carries a lesson upon which we can reflect and eventually learn, grow and prosper.\n\n\u201cLeadership is less about the position you hold than the influence you have. It's about doing world-class work, playing at your peak, and leaving people better than you found them. It's about Leading Without a Title.\u201d Robin Sharma",

Finally, we presented our business plan (pitch style) at a summit in January 2015, at the Nyenrode campus, for an audience of Red Cross/Red Crescent leaders and representatives from business, academia and government. During the summit, audience voted for four teams\u2019 ideas to be prioritized for further consideration, and our idea was one of them. ",
