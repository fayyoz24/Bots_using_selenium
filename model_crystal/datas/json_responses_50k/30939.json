    "summary": "Hello, I\u2019m Marcos :)\n\nI was born in Argentina and raised in Marbella, Spain. At the moment I am in The Hague following the Hotelschool The Hague BBA which I expect to complete by September 2023. Although my studies and side jobs take up a considerable part of my weekly agenda, I always find time to further improve myself. \n\nAt a professional level, by the age of 30 I would like to work as a customer relationship manager for a high-end engineering sports car brand. My grandfather used to purchase cars in the U.S and drive them all the way to Buenos Aires where he would, together with his teams of engineers, set the car up and compete with it in the Aut\u00f3dromo de Buenos Aires. Being this the root of my passion, I deem it my mission, to make more people curious and interested in this lifestyle which is full of emotions and passion.",
