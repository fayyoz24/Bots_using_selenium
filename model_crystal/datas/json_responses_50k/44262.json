We explored various drug delivery systems and techniques to optimize the release rate, duration, and efficacy of VHC for surgical applications. Through extensive testing, we assessed factors such as polymer compatibility, drug loading capacity, and release kinetics. Additionally, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility of the VHC formulations.",

Through extensive laboratory work, we have conducted in-depth investigations into the behavior and characteristics of SOAS-2 cells, aiming to uncover potential therapeutic targets and develop effective treatment strategies. Utilizing cell culture techniques, we have cultivated and maintained these cells in a controlled environment, allowing for detailed analysis and experimentation. Our research has involved studying the response of SOAS-2 cells to various drug compounds, identifying promising candidates for further investigation. Additionally, we have explored the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and the role of genetic and molecular factors in the progression of osteogenic sarcoma. ",
