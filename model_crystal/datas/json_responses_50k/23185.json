In this work a (planar) material is designed and characterized which is based on a spring lattice. The springs are specially designed by curving leaf springs (using optimization), to obtain spring behavior like an ideal spring. If placed into a lattice, analytical approximations and numerical simulations show that a linear elastic isotropic material with zero Poisson's ratio over large strains is obtained. Part of this work was done in cooperation with the University of California - LA.",

This research studies the use of \u2018fluid cavities\u2019, nearly\nincompressible enclosed volumes, to model orbital fat in a 2D finite element model. To\ntest stability and calculation times simple test are used to simulate the muscle tendon\nrolling onto the eye and the optic nerve moving through the fat during eye rotation. A\nsimple model of orbital mechanics consisting of the orbital wall, two optical muscles and\nthe eye is created. The tests show that the cavity-based method is able to cope with the\nlarge deformations and a stable 2D-model of the orbit is obtained with low calculation\ntimes.",
