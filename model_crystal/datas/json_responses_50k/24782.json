    "summary": "The course of study taught me to be a Logistics Engineer, in which I have gained experience on all aspects within the logistics branch. During the studies my interests in logistics strengthened, and in particular Supply Chain Management; to control all links of the entire supply chain. In my opinion, Supply Chain Management plays a crucial role in the success of a company. Supply Chain Management determines the bottlenecks, reduces costs and achieves better business results. I think that without effective coordination in the supply chain, it is no longer possible for an organisation to compete. This also makes it a very interesting matter for a company itself. \n\nDuring my studies I learnt to handle, as efficiently as possible, different logistics issues and thereby the optimal processing/implementation of these. For me the best part was to gain experience in real business life and to deal with real, tangible issues. To strengthen my personal development, it is a priority for me to aim as high as possible.",
