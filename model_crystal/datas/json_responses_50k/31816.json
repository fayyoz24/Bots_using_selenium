With compulsory digitization of  cable, multiple satellite direct to home service providers, local cable operators and powerful aggregators, the Indian entertainment industry has very complex dynamics. This leaves the Indin cable distributors very powerless in the value chain, both as buyers as well as suppliers. A study of the entertainment industry value chain was done in the Netherlands. The value chain was compared with the Indian value chain. The industry understanding was achieved by the interviews at multiple companies such as RTL, Endemol, UPC in the Netherlands and IndiaCast, Endemol and Hathway in India. Based on the challenges and opportunities recognized, a holistic approach was presented to the company for step wise change management. This included short term as well as long term strategies for improvement of ARPU. Through these strategies, the company would adapt itself with the changing industry and customer needs while increasing its power in the value chain.",
