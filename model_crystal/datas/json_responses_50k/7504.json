    "summary": "I am a recent graduate of Erasmus University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Management of International Social Challenges (Public Administration) and a minor in International Relations & Human Rights Law, who has experience in SMM, PR, leadership, advocacy, public speaking & debate, and consultancy. I am originally from Kazakhstan and currently I am on my orientation year residing in the Netherlands, where I plan to stay long-term and where I am qualified for the reduced salary criteration. I love making music that I never release, going on walks, cooking, and writing run-on sentences that scratch my brain just the way I like it.\n\nI am interested in many career paths from copywriting to researching, but what matters most to me in a career is the ability to help others. Aiding others in decision-making, risk assessment, problem solving, change management, strategic planning, goal setting and achieving is an essential part of who I am as a human being. So, I would like my profession to reflect and honor that side of me. Whether it is an individual, a private sector business, or a public sector organization, I strive to nurture, protect, and be of help.\n\nDuring my studies, I have been a student representative at several bodies, where my work was primarily focused on representing student and staff interest in faculty-, department-, and programme-wide policy-making. Beyond just honing my persuasion and advocacy skills, this experience has also given me an opportunity to learn how to be a contact point for a huge body of students and deal with competing interests, descending opinions, and institutional bottlenecks, all the while maintaining my integrity and not losing focus of the best interest of the university population as a whole. \n\nPrior to my studies, I have also been a VP PR of Astana Toastmasters Club, did SMM for a couple organizations, successfully participated in debate competitions and scholastic Olympiads in English language and geography. Although I do not put a huge emphasis on my pre-university activities, they have played an important part in my growth and bestowed me with great communication skills and resilience.",
