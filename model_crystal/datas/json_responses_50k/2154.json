    "summary": "Pilar Mata Dupont is an artist living between Australia and the Netherlands. Spanning video, performance, and photography, Mata Dupont\u2019s work aids her research into the malleability and fallibility of structures of history, gender, and memory, and often combines many seemingly disparate references to create a new, and often dreamlike, visual world where these themes can be investigated. Using highly theatrical and cinematic methods, she re-imagines histories and classical texts, creating alternative readings that question the conditions of the construction of dominant narratives that shape Western society. Her Argentinean background, and upbringing in Australia, Argentina, and Brunei Darussalam \u2013 all settler states and/or former colonies or protectorates \u2013 feed into her practice.\n\nHer solo exhibition, 'Only Weeds Emerge', opened at TENT Rotterdam in late 2018. More recently, her work exhibited at at The National: New Australian Art at the Art Gallery of NSW, curated by Isobel Parker Philip; and 'Into the Open', presented by Te Papa for New Zealand Festival. She was recently awarded a development grant as part of the Ian Potter Moving Image Commission for her work-in-progress, 'La Piedra'.\n\nIn July 2015, she was the winner of the main award at the Plymouth Contemporary Open Art Prize in the UK. In October 2015, she won the Residency Prize for the Wexner Center for the Arts at Videobrasil, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Other recent exhibition highlights include the Box at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Ohio; SeMA Biennale \u2013 Mediacity Seoul, at the Seoul Museum of Art; Salon Fluchthilfe, at Secession in Vienna and W\u00fcrttem. Kunstverein, Stuttgart and Rencontres Internationales, Paris.\n\nIn collaboration with Tarryn Gill, she participated in the 17th Sydney Biennale and won the Basil Sellers Art Prize in 2010.

Spanning video, performance, and photography, Mata Dupont\u2019s work aids her research into the malleability and fallibility of structures of history, gender, and memory, and often combines many seemingly disparate references to create a new, and often dreamlike, visual world where these themes can be investigated. Using highly theatrical and cinematic methods, she re-imagines histories and classical texts, creating alternative readings that question the conditions of the construction of dominant narratives that shape Western society. Her Argentinean background, and upbringing in Australia, Argentina, and Brunei Darussalam \u2013 all settler states and/or former colonies or protectorates \u2013 feed into her practice.\n\npilarmatadupont.com",
