I initially began as a client manager in advertising and I've transitioned into fashion, starting with design and focusing on buying and production. I've made this through learning that :\n\n-While I loved working with campaigns , I wanted to work with people in cultivating their brand and visual identity \n\n_I really enjoy analysing trends and implementing them into my projects. During this time, it was in marketing analysis for consumer interactivity and I felt that positioning myself closer to consumers is the next step forward.\n\n_I am efficient in dealing with managing timelines of several ongoing projects and have been keen on precise communication, but I desire to work in an area that has management meet with creativity.\n\nThrough my education and work experience, I\u2019ve learned that:\n\n_I love the synergy between creativity and agility, considering market responses while maintaining a creative signature.\n\n_I enjoy condensing trend potentials from various sources of media, occasions, and countries and cross-referencing them with data analytics.\n\n_I believe that through buying, we get to know our demographic at heart\u2014their interests and their potential growth in aesthetics\u2014and that we can provide options to help them navigate themselves.\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve lived in:\n\nMalaysia\nAustralia\nLatvia\nthe Netherlands\n\nHaving lived and worked with such a significant difference in cultures, it really provides me a fluid lens on how people carry themselves visually and develop a skill in adaptively communicating a shared interest in fashion. Additionally, it strongly increases my visual vocabulary in garment styling and precision in detecting upcoming trends in fashion and marketing.\n\nI desire to continue this journey of improvement professionally and provide a unique pair of lenses to finesse in your team.
