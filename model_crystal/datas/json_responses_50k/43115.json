    "summary": "I strive to bring change and solution-oriented impact to the high-tech sector, driven by curiosity, perseverance, growth, and ethical values. \n\nAs a research fellow, I lead international projects on supercomputer simulations and software development at the intersection of high-tech HPC, data science innovation and astrophysics. My problem-solving approach combines attention to detail, systems thinking, modern agile methodologies, and collaboration-focused leadership.\n\n- I am drawn to challenges and I love tackling problems that are thought unsolvable. Re-defining the state-of-the-art through innovative ideas underpins all my research and my vision for value-driven delivery. During my PhD, I became the point of contact for designing zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations within the Virgo Consortium, the largest international organisation for computational cosmology research.  During my 5-year experience, I developed software to extract novel insights from complex systems and presented at 9 international conferences, over 30 plenary meetings and in 7 technical reports.\n\n- I lead research projects with teams in the Virgo Consortium, the world\u2019s leading partnership in computational cosmology by combined h-factor, and I coordinate 4 projects using the UK\u2019s top supercomputing facilities from DiRAC-STFC.\n\n- I have mentored 100+ students, run 50+ programming workshops and communicated principles of agile working, data science and presentation skills to 2 award-winning groups of students (SARSTEM and DSI-Africa).\n\n- I was fortunate to chair the student-run Astronomy Society at the University of Manchester. During my appointment, the Society featured in national events (BlueDot) and television (BBC), organised 100+ science outreach events and its member count surged by 400%.\n\nMy interests: \nSelf-development books & educational resources (Bloomberg, Financial Times, The Economist) | Business, economics, investing | Coding projects & Machine-Learning | Alpinism, fitness, nutrition | Photography (awards for astronomical and landscape compositions) | Travelling & exploration.",

I assigned each member of the international team tasks to develop and report on during weekly meetings.\n\n- Coordinated the research plan with separate Virgo projects running in parallel (COLIBRE, FLAMINGO).\n\n- Produced a suite of zoom-in simulations and built a pipeline to generate the resolution-refined initial conditions (PANPHASIA, Fortran), running the full-physics model using numerical time-integration (SWIFT, C and MPI) and the post-processing using a halo-structure finder (VELOCIraptor, C++).\n\n- Led the development of a novel masking tool for defining the halo\u2019s Lagrangian domain in the initial conditions. Before refining the high-resolution mask, I introduced an algorithm for detecting topologically disconnected subsets of the Lagrangian region and then used Scipy\u2019s space-filling tools to fill the gaps while minimising the amount of volume added to the original mask.\n\n- Results presented at General Virgo conferences and paper accessible at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221009978A/abstract.\n\n- The code and data are open-source and freely accessible at  https://github.com/edoaltamura/entropy-core-problem",

This limit arises because, with a single band gap $E_g$, photons below this energy ($\\hbar \\omega < E_g$) are not absorbed, while photons above this energy loose their excess energy $\\Delta E = \\hbar \\omega - E_g$ as thermal waste. Tandem cells, made of two or more cells with different band gaps, seek to bypass this limit. However, studying the spatial uniformity of such cells is challenging, as at least one critical interface is buried within the device.\nThis project seeks to develop an optical technique to inspect each layer based on compressive sensing. By projecting structured light patterns of different wavelenghts onto a tandem cell, the spatial distribution of current generation can be measured for each sub-cell. Furthermore, by sweeping voltage, a spatial map of fill-factor and/or efficiency may be produced.\nIn this project, the candidate will design a prototype device using a single board computer, integrated digital projector, designed PV acquisition board and a simple photovoltaic as prototype device. Building on proof-of-principle work carried out previously, the candidate will construct a fast, self-contained device for projection and acquisition of spatial data for photovoltaic applications.\n\nKeywords: Multispectral, Efficiency, Photovoltaics, Semiconductors, Compressive Sensing.",

While this feature will benefit my research on the core-entropy problem, it will also become a milestone for future high-resolution zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters.\n\n- Design and deployment of the spin-jets coupling in supermassive black holes at the centre of AGNs. This project is a follow up from my recent work on the core-entropy problem (paper in preparation) and leverages a new self-consistent BH jet model introduced by colleagues in the Virgo Consortium, but not yet tested in a full cosmological simulation setting.",

Not only do I consider my role important as a part of a local team of volunteers, but also it encourages me to learn about biochemistry, biology an physiology ongoing research, which has numerous connections to my main fields of study. This is also relevant for outreach events, where a cross-field scientific knowledge is crucial and invaluable for raising public awareness on the effort made in cancer-research."
