    "summary": "Throughout my life I have been influenced by my father, who is an engineer and my mother who is a painter, writer and illustrator of children books.\n\nMy work is often a mix of dance and multimedia. I like to use animation, because I believe it can help to emerge the viewer into the world I am creating. My interest in animation originated from my parents, but also from the fact that I saw many similarities between dance and animation. They can both give a twist to reality that I believe can help us to step back from our own reality and see it in another perspective. On a more basic level I think they are similar aswell. To say it very simple, sometimes I choreograph movements for dancers and sometimes for pixels. In the end they are both translations in time that I\u2019am trying to give a meaning.\n\nI am starting to use multimedia in my creation process and in my final result. I am busy developing a method to be able to use multimedia to give direction to the improvisation of dancers. Like this I am trying to involve the dancer in the creative process, without losing grip on the movement material as a choreographer.\nhttps://youtu.be/4BwvHi1Xaxg\n\nThe aim in my work is to make the multimedia part equal to the choreography and integrate it in a way they support each other, not fight for attention.\nIn 2015 his new foundation\"Another kind of blue\" will tour through the Netherlands start the 18th of September in the Zuiderstrand theater in Den Haag\n\nThrough the use of technology we have the opportunity to accelerate our capabilities. We are faster, stronger, more beautiful and intellectually super charged. The question is, how do we deal with that much power?\n\n\u2018I believe that I, the audience and Americ a have just been Middendorphed\u2018 (jurycommentaar America\u2019s Got Talent ). \u2018Zijn voorstellingen betoveren de zintuigen \u2019 (NRC).",
