In my role day-to-day, I help customers translate their KPI's and product questions into collectable data that is easy to understand and manage. Answering a question can include historical data which I can help customers to extract and transform from existing sources like Kafka/other event streams, data warehouse, customer data platforms, CRM's or application backends. \n\nBesides the technical aspects of user tracking and data engineering, I help my customers in building a real data-driven culture. I do this by guiding in setting up the data management process, helping to formulate better questions, sharing industry best and privacy best practices.",
