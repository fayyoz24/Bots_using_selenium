    "summary": "My technical and digital experience together with my soft skills is an unique combination. I\u2019m a Scrum Master / Agile Coach, SAFe Agilist or Product Owner, but never at the same time! I\u2019m a team builder with organizational sensitivity and strong analytical capabilities. I\u2019ll bring business value (PO) and high performing teams (SM) together and think team autonomy (DevOps, CI/CD), Jira (userstories, velocity measurement) & Confluence are the basics to become a mature Scrum Team. Communication (onsite & offshore development teams), Stakeholder management (in big corporates, with scaled agile) and fun are the most obvious necessities! And in my spare time I got inspired by my friends, cooking, cycling, downhilling, yoga and fashion.",
