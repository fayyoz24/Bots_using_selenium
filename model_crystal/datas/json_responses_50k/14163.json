    "summary": "Freshly graduated starter in the field of public health. During my bachelor's, I largely focused on \nthe complex connection and interplay between our environment and our health, specifically looking at public health promotion and disease prevention. Research and data analysis come second nature to me, and by extension any kind of play with numbers is my jam.\n\nI hold a big interest towards all things health, biology and ecology, technology and AI. When I'm not deep down the rabbit hole of journal articles on interesting clinical-trials and health innovations, you can probably find me doing all things creative from film and video production to editing and visual design or hiking in some deep woods or somewhere on a mountain. Working on such diverse projects has fostered great adaptability and flexibility, and there\u2019s never been a challenge I have not been able to surmount, or at least think of innovative ways to succeed.",
