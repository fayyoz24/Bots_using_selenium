    "summary": "As a landscape architect and master planner, my primary goal is to improve our (living) environment. My designs have a strong connection with the spirit and characteristics of a site, based on thorough research and analysis. Sustainable approaches, town planning and cultural history are integrated in my visions, concepts, designs and details. Therefore I  work together with and can understand multiple different disciplines in the field of public space to produce integral large scale plans with a focus on practicability and understanding on lower scale levels. Management and communication on this entire process is guaranteed with a focus on feasibility and project costs. Respect to different (design) cultures, desires are off course leading. Besides large scale project, I also work as a garden (and interior) architect. I gathered a network of suppliers and craftsmen to guarantee the construction of projects and am the spokesman for clients and constructors.\n\nMy strength is to have a creative clear overview and understanding in large complex systems, such as landscapes, and the interrelations in them between participants. In my opinion this 'helicopter'-view is a surplus in multiple varying businesses and fields of work. At first this became clear in my garden projects and their construction. But this appeared also in my career to become catering manager. A rational and creative approach as a successful entrepreneur within a large organisation resulted in the development of new food concepts and new presentation or selling methods. In this career I also broadened my empathic skills, such as team management and coaching within my team, as well as setting up methods and management of communication systems between us and other outsourcing facility service partners. Primary focus are the desires, experiences and appreciation by our clients.\n",
