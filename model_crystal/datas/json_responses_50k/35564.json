    "summary": "I believe in a balanced (metropolitan) landscape, where nature and culture go hand in hand. To achieve this, visionary thinking and decisiveness are required. I apply this every day, so that I get the best out of people and their organizations. In this way, we can make the world a little bit better every day.\n\nI aim to connect people, technology and knowledge using a holistic approach. Projects that focus on making the world better for people and the environment are close to my heart. Here, I can combine my areas of expertise in hydrology and spatial planning with my devotion to learn more.\n\nI focus on creating mutual understanding and trust, by encouraging discussion and open communication. This optimises knowledge and technology exchange, which I believe is vital to advance sustainability. By making the world a little bit better every day, I hope to contribute to a planet where nature and people are in harmony.",

After an extensive development period, the system will be tested in operational conditions from April through to July 2018. Following this test period, final improvements will be made and the definitive version (2.0) will be delivered.\n\nThis FFWS is a very special project because of the number of countries surrounding the basin of the Sava (97,700 km2): Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. There is also a very small section of the basin in Albania. Each country has its own models, monitoring systems, forecasting systems, water authorities and interests.\n\nThis new uniform system is intended to bridge these differences and enable cooperation in water management. The consortium had three tasks: setting up an effective organisational structure, ensuring that the right information gets to the right place at the right time and organising training for the stakeholders.",

I supervise and facilitate project teams of 3 to 20 people, creating an open atmosphere in which the specialists, consultants and other team members can excel and everything can be said. To ensure everyone feels part of the team, I give everyone their own responsibilities and make them aware of different communication and thinking styles. In the project team I see everyone as equal, where everyone can shape their own role. My responsibilities are:\n- Close customer contact to ensure that the project runs smoothly on time, budget and quality and when this is not the case, we can act quickly. The aim of customer contact is also to make important choices together, to create common product.\n- Make sure everyone knows their tasks and responsibilities\n- Prepare quotations including budgeting and staffing\n- Monitoring the GROKIT indicators\n- Critical thinking and quality control of end products (deliverables)\n\nI distinguish myself as a project manager by proactively thinking with, communicating openly and carefully examining the needs of the project team. This allows me to offer tailor-made project workplaces. With my goal-oriented nature I switch between control and delegation. The different ways I work in my projects are directing, waterfall or Agile.\n\nFurther tasks I have as a consultant are, work on large (inter)national projects, where I focus on advising and determining the customer's needs. This advice often takes place in collaboration with a specialist.",

The study showed that 2D modelling is a possible approach to get preliminary results based on mainly a digital terrain model for cases where there was not a dominant flow direction. In cases where there was a dominant flow direction it is strongly recommended to use a 1D/2D model.\n\nBesides my modelling work, I implemented the Bradbury method to estimate coastal breaching and support the hydroinformatics team in Peterborough.
