    "summary": "As a child I used to tell my parents off for leaving the lights on after they left the room. It was bad for the environment to waste energy. While growing older and gaining more life experience, I learned that telling my parents to turn off the lights isn't going to cut it (and they didn't really listen anyway) and more action is needed to protect the beautiful world around us and everyone and everything that lives on it. It is my passion to contribute to this by helping to solve environmental issues and working towards circularity.\n\nAt the moment I finished my masters degree in environmental engineering and I am looking for a new challenge to contribute to environmental topics such as clean water, resource recovery and pollution mitigation.",

The interview results show that DinKes (health agency), PAMSIMAS (rural water company), and the village board are the key players that connect the upper administrative units to the local communities. The data obtained also show that the root causes that influence the WASH condition are low education level, upbringing norms, weak economy, and geography. The water quality testing results show that in terms of E. coli 14% and 12% of the respondents had a high chance of contamination in their water source and household respectively. These numbers are 25% and 29% in terms of total coliforms. Approximately 59% respondents still use poor sanitation facilities, which includes open defecation (33%) and unimproved latrines (26%). The other 14% respondents are listed under limited sanitation service, and 27% of the respondents had their own toilet, however, it is difficult to conclude if these people fall under the basic or safely managed category of sanitation services.",

You organise or attend a gathering to which everyone can bring their old clothes. That means, clothes that they no longer like but that are in good condition. This way you can swap your clothes for different ones and change your wardrobe in a sustainable way.  When Covid-19 hit, the clothes swapping gatherings came to an end. Luckily a covid-friendly alternative was set up in Amsterdam by Nichon Glerum. Instead of gathering to swap clothes, the clothes are deposited in a big shopper bag and passed around the neighbourhood. This way you get to meet your neighbours at a safe distance, while still being able to beat fast fashion. When I heard about this initiative in Amsterdam, I immedeatly volunteerd to bring the inititiative to Delft. At the moment of writing, over a hundred women joined the swapping chain and the initiative is still growing. #beatfastfashion #slowfashion"
