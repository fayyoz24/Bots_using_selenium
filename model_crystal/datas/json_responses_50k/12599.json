Located near Chongqing in Southwest China, the project is designed for a population of 180,000 inhabitants and is divided in 5 construction phases. Our Chinese healthy city concept is based on the healthy urban lifestyles and urban design. Our strategy is to implement a healthy urban economy based on organic food production and consumption through urban and peri-urban agriculture, social healthcare R&D for China, healthy tourism and sport activities. \nThe streetscape and public design is specifically defined for an \u201cage friendly\u201d urban environment able to respond to the emerging challenges of the ageing Chinese population. Safe and green streets are integrated with green corridors in order to preserve the existing ecosystems during the process of urbanisation. \nResidential communities are permanently encouraged to learn about healthy food consumption through urban agriculture and safe, low-carbon mobility. \nA complete program of low carbon housing development will be implemented phase by phase to limit the carbon footprint and the urban heat island effects. The car traffic management includes three \u201czones 30\u201d where every street is designed for pedestrian safety and slow mobility. The train station of the new town is connected to the communities by a BRT system and a local slow shuttle network, stopping every 200 meters in order to maximise the safe accessibility to people of all conditions. The pedestrian network is organised to minimise the crossing points with car traffic. ",

Due to its location, our team decided to imagine a township made by and for the local culture, with a sustainable perspective. Designed for 6 independant communities in terms of energy and food, the Garden City integrates urban agriculture at the community and the family level. Moreover, the new township is surrounded by 21 farms with biogas facilities facing the rural areas around that provide sufficient food and energy for the inhabitants. Multifunctional public green spaces are implemented at the heart of each community to develop and preserve the social and economic cohesion of the neighbourhoods and offer space for markets, education and sport.",
