The pigments used in a painting can be determined and they have to match with the era in which it is supposedly painted. It must also match the pigments used by the artist who supposedly painted the painting\nResearch included:\n- literature research about Vermeer, what materials need to be used, natural and artificial aging processes in paintings (such as saponification) and the forging techniques of Han van Meegeren\n- visual inspection of the painting\n\nTo gain insight in the process of authenticating a painting we did the following research on two paintings:\n- xrf spectrometry\n- microscopic layer analysis\n- pigment chronology analysis",
