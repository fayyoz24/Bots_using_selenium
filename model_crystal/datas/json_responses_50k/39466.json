    "summary": "A political scientist by training, I am an experienced EU program and project manager, with a Human Resources background, passionate about stakeholder engagement and empowerment through skills development. I have experience in developing and implementing engagement and building expertise strategies, as well as in project management and quality assessment tools, and the set-up of relevant policies and procedures.   \nI am a results oriented generalist with an eye for identifying needs and contributing to appropriate solutions. I enjoy being inspired by the people I interact with, while I always look for ways to inspire and\nempower those around me. People describe me as their \"go-to\" person when in doubt. My main qualities are integrity, accountability, empathy and problem-solving. \nI strongly believe in giving back to the community. I volunteer for stray animals and visually impaired people (audiobook recording). I have been a caregiver for children victims of neglect or abuse temporarily placed in greek public hospitals following the intervention of the state.",

            "description": "In 2015 the vision of a European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) emerged. EOSC would provide an open and trusted environment for accessing and managing a wide range of publicly funded research data and related services, helping researchers reap the full benefits of data-driven science. EOSC is now entering its implementation phase (2021-2027) which requires active engagement and support to ensure widespread implementation and adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, to define and share standards and develop tools and services, to allow researchers to find, access, reuse and combine research results.\n\nWith the ambitious goal to realise an EOSC of FAIR data and services, the FAIR-IMPACT project responds to these needs by supporting the implementation of FAIR-enabling practices, tools and services across scientific communities at a a European, national and institutional level.\nFAIR-IMPACT will identify practices, policies, tools and technical specifications to guide researchers, repository managers, research performing organisations, policy makers and citizen scientists towards a FAIR data management cycle. The focus will be on persistent identifiers (PIDs), metadata, ontologies, metrics, certification and interoperability, starting with real-life use cases on social sciences and humanities, the photon and neutron sciences, life sciences and agri-food and environmental sciences.",

Develop a pedagogical foundation based on well-proven active learning pedagogies for open/citizen science practice with the aim to encourage creativity and skill development, and to increase knowledge dissemination among citizen scientists in a pedagogically sound way\n3.

Enrich HE teaching, learning and training resources on active learning pedagogies (problem-based learning, game-based learning, maker education, crowdsourcing education, inquiry-based learning) with open and citizen science initiatives as demonstrations of current trends that claim an active role of citizens in decision making and governance.\n5.

This led to a new BPA \u2018community-first\u2019 approach.\nDuring this second phase, AARC built on the work done with the objective to extend the results to the largest possible number of users. To this extent, 8 research infrastructures joined as partners, with the goal to understand and adopt the AARC architecture and policy recommendations \u2013 ELIXIR, CORBEL, CTA, EPOS, LIGO, Helix-Nebula, WCLG, EISCAT-3d and LifeWatch. For this reason, new pilots became core activities, to verify requirements amongst the new communities and to implement solutions for each of them. Training activities played a central role in this second phase of the project, with the creation of a range of courses to meet the needs of all user types, from the technical expert to the manager who must choose how to manage access for the community services.\nAARC established two forums to facilitate dialogue with research communities. The Community Engagement Forum (CEF) made information accessible, encouraged research community feedback on various pilots, and gave communities the opportunity to present their specific case, sharing solutions to problems that could be common or presenting unsolved issues. The AARC Engagement Group for Infrastructures (AEGIS) is for e-infrastructures that operate an AAI that is compliant with the BPA and is used to present results, promote a shared and coherent vision of federated access and facilitate activities so that different infrastructures can adopt interoperable solutions.",

Covering both access and deposit, from informal data sharing to longterm archiving, and addressing identification, discoverability and computability of both long-tail and big data, EUDAT2020\u2019s services will address the full lifecycle of research data.\nOne of the main ambitions of EUDAT2020 is to bridge the gap between research infrastructures and e-Infrastructures through an active engagement strategy, using the communities that are in the consortium as EUDAT beacons and integrating others through innovative partnerships.\nDuring its three-year funded life, EUDAT2020 will evolve the CDI into a healthy and vibrant data-infrastructure for Europe, and position EUDAT as a sustainable infrastructure within which the future, changing requirements of a wide range of research communities are addressed.",

The network is comprised of 600 organisations from more than 40 countries, which include other than the 27 member-states, the candidate countries [Croatia, FYROM, Turkey], the members of the European Economic Zone, as well as third countries [eg from the West Balkans, Russia, Armenia, U.S.A., Egypt and others].\nThe Greek hub of EEN [Enterprise Europe Network \u2013 Hellas] forms the largest network of comprehensive business support in the country, comprised of research and technical institutions, commercial and industrial business chambers and other established organisations in the fields of entrepreneurship and innovation.",

A network of people, represented by the National Open Access Desks (NOADs), will organise activities to collect H2020 project outputs, and support research data management. Backing this vast outreach, is the OpenAIRE platform, the technical infrastructure that is vital for pulling together and interconnecting the large-scale collections of research outputs across Europe. The project will create workflows and services on top of this valuable repository content, which will enable an interoperable network of repositories (via the adoption of common guidelines), and easy upload into an all-purpose repository (via Zenodo).\n",
