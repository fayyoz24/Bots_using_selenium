    "summary": ">>> See section licenses & certifications for achieved SAP and Microsoft certificates <<<\n>>> See section accomplishments for attended courses and recent projects <<<\n\nDue to the increasing complexity of solution landscapes and the more integrated and comprehensive the solutions in a modern SAP landscape are, the greater the need for a holistic approach to application lifecycle management. For this reason I am passionate about the SAP ALM product SAP Solution Manager and Focused Run. I believe in the added value of them during the complete lifecycle of SAP solutions.\n\nModern (SAP)solutions do not stop at the on-premise border. Cloud solutions are part of SAP landscapes nowadays. Knowledge about cloud solutions (SAAS/PAAS/IAAS) are no luxury and necessity to keep businesses running. That's why I gained knownledge about Microsofts cloud solution and in particular SAP workloads in Azure.\n\nIntegrated (cloud)solutions also requires an as per design security approach. This applies certainly also for a central Solution Manager or Focused Run system and therefore I encourage applying transport layer security and encryption by default for all used application protocols (SAP or generic).\n\nDespite the extended support from SAP for their Business Suite (R/3) until 2030, migration to the successor product S/4HANA will be commonplace next years. I am certified to migrate to S/4HANA. Let's do the migration together!\n\nWith a strong focus on quality and customer satisfaction and 20 years experience I have in-depth SAP knowledge but also a broad interest in adjacent topics.\n\nMainly working in projects (installation, upgrade/update, migration/copy) and innovations (refresh automation, Focused Run implementation, ...) in past years. From 3.1I to S/4HANA and everything in between :-). From Oracle to SAP HANA and all the the other DB vendors. See section experience and projects to have a complete overview.",

In our customer base these ASE databases are managed centrally via the Solution Manager DBACockpit. Due to the replacement of Solution Manager by Focused Run some of these Solution Manager systems are decommissioned in near future. To guarantee the support of SAP ASE a new system is positioned in the KPN tooling landscape. Goal of this new central system is to support all customer ASE databases. Foundation is a SAP Netweaver 7.50 ABAP running on SAP ASE. Because of the central character of the system security aspects are applicable.\n\nNetwork and transport layer security aspects:\nCommunication crosses different network zones (KPN tooling and several customer VLAN's) so on transport layer packet filtering is applied. Only the necessary service is available in one direction.  Traffic is encrypted on transport layer by enabling TLS on SAP ASE database server. Via this transport layer protocol the ODBC application protocol is secured. That is: all database connections that are made in the central DBACockpit are encrypted.\n\n- Technical design is made.\n\nStay tuned!",

Solution Manager operates with all functionality in parallel with Focused Run with respect for single point of truth concept. \nLatest Solution Manager innovations applied: Outside Discovery is executed via SAP Host Agent instead of Diagnostics Agent. Outside Discovery and DataSupplier payload is directly delivered to LMDB bypassing the SLD. This significantly decrease administration and improves landscape descriptions drastically. CA Introscope is shared with FRUN\n\nNetwork and communication security aspects applied:\nCommunication channels are secured (client/server authentication, integrity an encryption) for network traffic in between network zones with transport layer security. International standard application protocols HTTP and P4 are secured via TLS while SAP application protocol RFC and SAPdiag are secured via SNC.\nSolution Manager operates exclusively secure for both internal and external communication.

Via these encryption protocols all standard application protocols (like http and SAPdiag) were already secured. This means that Solution Manager already used secure services for both internal and external communication. That means indeed that no unsecure services were defined.\n\nHowever some communication channels were still left unsecure. In succession of the Solution Manager configuration all left-over application protocols were made secure. Because transport layer security was already enabled this wasn't a big deal anymore.\n\n- All RFC's from and to the Managed Systems are now encrypted via SNC.\n- The SAP transport infrastructure (TMS) RFC's are now encrypted via SNC.\n- The application protocol ODBC in the communication channel AS ABAP towards the SAP HANA database (ABAP tenant) is now encrypted via TLS.\n- The database connections from Solution Manager towards the Managed Databases (for the execution of the database extractors) are now encrypted via TLS.\n- The application protocol JDBC in the communication channel AS Java towards the SAP HANA database (Java tenant) is now encrypted via TLS.\n\nOf course on the transport layer TLS protocol version 1.2 is enforced by following the SAP guidelines with respect for the KPN security policy.

A lot of customer connections are routed via the SAProuter so a decent strategy is made to migrate SAProuter smoothly. Also SAML (cross-side SSO) is active and must be available after the ERP migration (incoming traffic is routed via SAP WDISP). ERP also uses ADS functionality and this ADS functionality is deployed on an old SAP Netweaver Java that will be decommissioned, For this gap a new SAP Netweaver Java is deployed.\n\nNetwork and transport layer security aspects:\nSAProuters involved are deployed in different network zones so new firewall rules are made.

The integration and troubleshooting was done together with software vendor Empirius.\n\n- Create a plan to integrate SAP HANA restore\n- Collect cross-side restore details at KPN side (what to automate)\n- Discuss automation details with software vendor\n- implement the solution provided by software vendor\n- Test, adjust and troubleshoot the provided solution together with software vendor\n\nThe result is working one-step procedure (without any human intervention) to refresh a SAP system based on SAP HANA. Within just 2 hours! You can't believe until you see it happen :-). Next level refreshing!\n\nNext target is supporting the one-step procedure with more database vendors with first focus on SAP ASE and MSSQL.

            "description": "Implementation of Focused Run 2.0. After a successful Proof Of Concept with former release Focused Run 1.0 a 2-tier Focused Run 2.0 landscape is implemented. The development system is intented to serve the KPN demo landscape while the production system serves the KPN customers.\nIn the KPN demo landscape several systems types (ABAP, Java, SAP ASE, SAP HANA) are located, both on-premise and in the Azure cloud. Also a Solution Manager system is located in the KPN demo landscape and from Focused Run perspective this Solution Manager system is Managed. Focused Run is has the managing role and is therefore the lead Lifecycle Management solution. This means that KPN customers are administered via Focused Run instead of via Solution Manager for all common functionality (an analysis is done in the POC phase), however both solutions can operate in parallel. The optional SLD Router is implemented with the aim that SLD payload can be routed flexible. Outside Discovery payload is routed to LMDB directly.\n\nNetwork and communication security aspects:\nCommunication in-between the Focused Run infra and towards customers are crossing network segments. A decent traffic flow design is made and TLS is used to secure the transport layer (TLS 1.2).\n\n- Installation SAP HANA 2.0\n- Update SAP HANA 2.0 SPS\n- Installation / upgrade SAP Webdispatcher\n- Installation Focused Run 2.0 FP00\n- Support Hub configuration (multi-customers)\n- Configuration Focused Run\n- Simple System Integration (SSI) of KPN demo landscape and the first KPN customer \n- Upgrade to Focused Run FP03\n- Educate two colleagues to start customer onboarding\n\nTechniques / keywords:\nFunctional design, technical design, TLS 1.2, server authentication, client authentication, CA signed and self-signed certificates, SAN, key-pair exchange, sapgenpse, CommonCryptoLib, Ciphers, SSO, STRUST Identities.",

That's a challenge!\nTo make it even more fun some extra the requirements:\n- Supported stacks: ABAP, Java, Dual-stacks\n- Supported DB-vendors: all (..)\n- Supported OS: Linux, Solaris, Windows\n- Supported SAP versions: as much as possible.\n\nA SAP refresh can distinguish three phases:\n1) Pre-process: save technical settings of target system\n2) Restore: restore/recover source database\n3) Post-process: restore of saved settings to target.\n\nIn co-operation with Empirius GmbH their BlueCopy suite is implemented and pre-process, post-process is automated. For restore Commvault is used.\nThe result:\n- Two step procedure (restore done manually)\n- All requirements are met\n- High quality refreshes with satisfied customers (strong reduction of post incidents)\n- Strong reduction of human resources necessary\n- Done is a fraction of time (hours instead of days)\n\nTasks and challenges faced:\n- Adjust software to specific circumstances. Debug software together with the software vendor\n- Request software adaption / feature requests\n- MCOD designs (multiple schema's in one database)\n- Customize software (homebrew Tablesets, SQLsets)\n- Standardize the refresh procedure (both KPN and customer side)\n\nUsed techniques: ssh, powershell remoting\nRole: lead consultant",
