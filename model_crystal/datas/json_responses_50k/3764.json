    "summary": "Does your organization struggle with actually implementing circular processes and solutions? \n\nWell, that\u2019s what I help with. I work with organizations by guiding them in making the right choices to become circular and future proof.\n\nWhen clients work with me, they get:\n\u2022\tup to date knowledge on the latest circular economy developments\n\u2022\tthe network to connect with essential partners\n\u2022\ta practical, results and pragmatic focused approach \n\nWhen it comes to building a future proof organization, I know you are aware of the demand for more circular processes and solutions, from either clients, investors and/or colleagues.\n\nYou want to be resilient and innovative as well as profitable, and this requires change. \n\nBut in order to change, you need the right tools and knowledge about \n\u2022 Circular business models\n\u2022 Product Design strategies\n\u2022 Your Value Chain & Environmental + Economic impact analysis\n\nAnd this is information you do not have internally.\n\nI understand how difficult, frustrating and time consuming it can be to gain the expertise to make the right choices pointed towards circularity.\n \nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to say, I\u2019ve personally helped over 50 organizations in the road towards circularity, together with Ecoras.\n\nYour focus is to lead your company towards becoming circular, while staying innovative and profitable.\n\nSo, reach out to me so that we can help you.\n\nStop losing time and resources and start making decisions based on knowledge of the circular market.\nLet me guide you towards becoming future proof and circular.\n\nWillemien Veele\nwww.ecoras.nl \nw.a.veele@ecoras.nl\n050 317 5550\n\nAbout me:\nMy interests are within the circular economy and biobased economy, life cycle assessment, Value and supply chain analysis, waste and resource management, reuse and recycling, biological solutions and innovations. I am an enthusiastic social team player that works hard to achieve set goals. I contribute to a transition to a more circular and bio based economy by building new value chains and helping businesses and organizations reach their circular ambitions. My passion lies within waste topics, how to prevent it from forming by smart and circular design, process optimization and to see waste as a resource instead of a nuisance. Let's get connected!",

The scenario had to be affordable, maintain a security of supply and tackle climate change. \n- My main taks was project management.\nTogether with my team of 5 we made it to the finals.

No longer exhausting the earth, but designing and organizing systems differently. In a practical and applicable way. So that we can achieve a circular economy that contributes to a liveable planet in the foreseeable future. \n\nWhat does Ecoras do? \nWe use our expertise and competences to work on a liveable planet together with organizations that want to handle raw materials carefully and responsibly. \n\nEcoras provides insight into the value chain and overview of the industrial ecosystem. We realize projects that matter and deliver tangible results for organizations and society. We believe this always starts with the raw materials; We strive for increased use of biobased raw materials as well as reused/recycled raw materials. That is raw materials that flow back to another production system (cradle-to-cradle) at the end of their life phase in an environmentally efficient manner. Our expertise lies in the three domains: Green Chemistry, Sustainable Polymers and Biobased Solutions. \n\nWithin Ecoras I am active within the field of Circular Plastics and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). We use the Life Cycle Assessment approach as a tool for strategy, business and product development. Next to that we are able to provide scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG protocol reports, EPD's and PEF's as well as CO2 footprints and other environmental impact measurements. We work according to ISO 14040 and 14044. \n\nFor more information: \nwww.ecoras.nl\nw.a.veele@ecoras.nl\n050 317 5550",

I have motivated, inspired and guided serveral companies (large and small) to start seizing the opportunities that are within the circular economy. I have organised several multi stakeholder events, building new value chains from which innovative projects have been developed. By seeing the connections, possibilities and potential between stakeholders I have helped the transition of not only organisations, but the region as whole to take the next step to becoming more circular, especially on the topic of Circular Plastics. I have written an Transition Action Agenda and a Proposition for the region on Circular Plastics. This has resulted in the Program called The Clean North which has now been taken up into Greenwise Campus - Circular Plastics as an organisation the further lead this transition. I ofcourse never did this all by myself. By working together with all the different (amzing) people in the region this was made possibe. Together we can and are doing it!",
