    "summary": "I am academically schooled and enjoy a challenge. I am good at seeing relations between people, problems and techniques in order to tackle a problem. I am not afraid to ask questions to find the root cause of an issue. I am open, honest and direct.\n\nI am precise and thorough, but need a creative outlet, either artistically or practically in finding solutions.\n\nI can work well individually, but need a team to be able to brainstorm. I thrive when I am supporting others and thinking about improving processes is what brings me more joy than 'producing' on my own.\n\nI am a hard worker, pick up new skills quickly and like hands-on work or technical challenges as well. \n\nIn my free time I love reading a book in the garden, playing board-games with friends or working on improving our house with my husband. I like reading books to my son and playing outside with him.",
