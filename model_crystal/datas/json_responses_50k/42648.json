    "summary": "Well, hello there! Care to read about me? Great, here we go....I'm an American business woman/mom/wife/art lover, permanently living in The Netherlands. I have over 20 years experience in EdTech, learning and development, program design and management along with operational strategy. I've managed big and small teams in both hierarchical and matrix organizations and guided them through both clear and muddy waters to success on the other side of the river.  I have an MBA and PMP which means I understand business and know how to execute on time and on budget.  I'm also a CELTA certified English Teacher, which means I know how important language and communication are in the professional and international world of business. \n\nI have a unique mix of business + liberal arts, which isn't for every organization, but for those that do  like hybrids, you'll find me a valuable asset in seeing both the financial impacts of business decisions with the impact to our human clients/customers. I'm fantastic at untangling and root causing really tough problems along with figuring out a strategy and plan to tackle \"what's next\" and how to fix it. \nMy personality is a blend of professionalism and warmth, task-focused but with a prankster release valve along as being a rational \"voice of reason\" with a dash of dark humor when necessary. \n\n\n\n(Alternative spellings; Madeline Schalet, Maddie Schalet, Madaliene Shalet, Madeline St.Amand, Maddie St.Amand)",
