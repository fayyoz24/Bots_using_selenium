    "summary": "I have had, so far a relatively successful carear in the construction industry albeit sometimes a turbulant carear, due to boom and bust economic situations especially since 2007.\nThe construction industry is particularly sensitive to these turbulent changes. In the down times I have pursued further education in business studies including work in other areas such as the MCCI (Chamber of Commerce) working in the information department (librarian), gathering information for the members.\n\nAt this moment I want to develop an  unique levelling system.\n\nThe goals I have are to pursue my interests in novel levelling and to build a reputation for highly advanced levelling systems. Therefore uniting my long carear in construction and the intimate knowledge I have gained especially of on sight levelling problems, with my new  system.",
