    "summary": "I am an archaeologist with museum experience and a passion for culture and heritage, which I am keen to share as widely as possible, making it relevant to modern day society. I completed my BA in Ancient History and Archaeology at Durham University (2011) and hold an MPhil in European Prehistory from the University of Cambridge (2012). I worked as an assistant curator in the archaeology department of the Drents Museum (Assen, the Netherlands), before starting an AHRC-funded PhD project on the later prehistoric East Anglian Fens at Durham University in October 2014. I undertook placements at the British Museum (UK) and the Moesgaard Museum (Denmark) and worked as a research assistant at Wageningen University and Research (2019-2020) and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit (2019-2020). In 2020 I became curator of Archaeology at the Drents Museum, where I was responsible for the Archaeology collection, which I shared with as wide and diverse an audience as possible through research, publications and exhibitions.\n\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Archaeology at University College Dublin, where I contribute to the 'Animals and Society in the Bronze Age Project'. This project aims to explore the role of animals as active participants in Bronze Age social worlds, rather than passive objects of consumption. My research focusses on 'animal architectures', which I study to investigate human-animal interaction and spatial engagement at different levels (from farms to settlements and the landscape). To analyse these spaces of encounter and interaction, I will identify animal-related features and examine how animals moved across the landscape.",

I wrote the storyline for these rooms, selected objects, wrote the exhibition texts and collaborated closely with designers to create the exhibits.

Combined, these highly important ecosystems face a range  of significant challenges in the twenty-first century. The transdisciplinary research strategy and framework of this project are tailor-made to address the challenges of physical, social and political environmental change that wetlands are facing.\n\nThe project aims to have the following outcomes and products:\n\n1) Raised public awareness of the importance of cultural heritage values in key European wetland environments, communicated through various mechanisms, including public outreach activities through social media;\n\n2) Enhanced knowledge of places, processes, communication and stakeholders to local and national decision makers (e.g. land use planners and policy makers), reported in policy summaries with recommendations;\n\n3) Knowledge and tools for decision makers on how to deal with diversity in society in general, reported in a booklet that describes general findings, and practices for organizing dialogues, and methods to study and understand stakeholder perceptions.",

It examined how wetland(er)s fit in the wider socio-cultural and physical landscape by considering past human-environment interaction and its social outcomes through time. I studied food remains in and around the former Fens to understand how the wetlands were used throughout time. I then used social theories current in mainstream Archaeology to examine how people\u2019s identities were constructed through their interaction with the wetland environment and to assess to what extent \u2018wetlander\u2019 identities may have affected people\u2019s relations with others.",
