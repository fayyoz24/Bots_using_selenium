My field was conducting Commercial practises such as: marketingplan, communications, accountmanaging, business plan and sponsorships.\n\nLately I handed over my tasks to another friend (Jorn Blanksma), and are now Accountmanaging my nearest Sponsorships.\n\nUnfortunately Pisart Festival Eijsden has stopped: http://www.pisartfestival.nl/2015/#features.
