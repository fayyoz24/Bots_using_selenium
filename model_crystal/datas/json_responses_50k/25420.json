    "summary": "As a PhD candidate at Eindhoven University of Technology, I am passionate about advancing the field of physics through cutting-edge research and innovation. I have a strong background in physics, having graduated from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, with a BS-MS dual degree in 2019. I have also developed skills in Python, Mathematica, and MATLAB, which I use to conduct simulations, data analysis, and modeling for my projects. I have contributed to multiple publications and presentations in international conferences and journals, showcasing my ability to communicate complex ideas and results effectively. I am motivated by the challenge of solving real-world problems and collaborating with diverse and talented peers and mentors. My goal is to pursue a career in academia or industry that allows me to apply my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on society and science.",
