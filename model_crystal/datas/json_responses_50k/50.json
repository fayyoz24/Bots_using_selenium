    "summary": "My motto: \"Passion is the fuel for success\" \n\nAbout me:\nI have completed my Bachelor of International Business and Management Studies at the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen (HAN University of Applied Sciences), in the Netherlands.\n\nThe first two years in the Netherlands built a strong foundation of international business knowledge, my third year took me to Germany for an internship and France for a study abroad. I have also carried out a research assignment for Wellman International located in the Netherlands, in order to broaden my horizons and put my skills into practice. My thesis was carried out at a UN affiliated training center, Antwerp-ITCCO, in which I conducted research and provided advice on how they could develop their marketing strategies for their various \"Action Learning for Sustainability\" training courses. \n\nI completed my primary and secondary education in Dubai, (U.A.E) After completing secondary school I took the opportunity to gain work experience in a small IT Consulting firm (Complease Consulting) which has a strong reputation for customer relations and quality. Due to the small size of the business I was able to gain real first hand experience into every day working life. I had many opportunities to try different areas during my time there involving data entry, managing project work flow, purchasing, meeting with clients to discuss issues and potential solutions and managing projects such as providing the infrastructure and support for an international news company at the Dubai Airshow.",

I was also able to improve my knowledge of basic HTML, some photo editing, Wordpress and Prestashop website creation as well as working with various plugins.

The company has a very strong reputation for quality and customer service and is small in size. These characteristics gave me an excellent opportunity to try a number of different tasks and decide what I could potentially do in the future. I carried out a number of tasks during my time there, some of which are listed below:\n\n- Managing Projects such as setting up the infrastructure for an international news team at the Dubai International Airshow in 2009\n- Managing data entry and work flow in the Lotus Notes Suite\n- Coordinating work flow and engineer visits by scheduling appointments with clients\n- Creating various spreadsheets and maintaining databases related to inventory management\n- Working on social media and learning the potential of online business through the use of their web development department\n- Being in regular contact with clients to ensure that requirements are clear and are being met\n- General tasks such as delivery and collection of engineers, hardware/software and payment collection.",
