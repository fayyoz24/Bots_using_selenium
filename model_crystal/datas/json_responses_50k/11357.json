    "summary": "I am a scientific researcher and lecturer in economics, specialized in the analysis of individual choice behavior.\n\nSkills and experience: I am highly experienced with data analysis, experimental design, survey design and policy evaluation.\n\nMy research: My research concentrates on the behavioral effects of financial and non-financial incentives in organisations. For example, do financial incentives such as bonuses and sales commissions increase work motivation? Or should managers use non-financial incentives such as spontaneous recognition and performance feedback to motivate employees? And do H-R policies affect the type of workers attracted to organizations? \n\nAccomplishments: my research has been published in leading international scientific journals and received substantial press coverage. Moreover, I held numerous conference presentations for academic as well as non-academic audiences.\n",
