After a pilot fase earlier this year, we are now expanding to all employees (2000).\n\nThe adoption program is connected to the HR initiative 'Worx', a New Way of Working program (NWOW) that is to be launched.\nWorx and Connections are introduced through an introductory film to sponsor the launch and to create a buzz and a general feeling what it is all about and to which goals the program is aimed.\n\nTo ensure IBM Connections is going to be fully adopted and integrated into work we are developing 8 usage scenarios. For each scenario we are crafting workshops (including train-the-trainer) for each scenario to be included in the Academy's courses. Also we are going to create scenario based films, which are to demonstrate the use cases for Connections scenarios, and not features and functionality.\nTo learn how to work with all the Connections featus there will also be small instruction videos (how-to's).\n\n",

We made a recommendation on agreements and ways of working with Outlook, along with some preferences and settings, especially for group mailboxes and calendaring.\nDuring one week all users were migrated to Outlook, and during that week we held presentations and workshops, as well as 'floorwalking' (support on the workfloor) at all the offices spread in the Netherlands.\n",
