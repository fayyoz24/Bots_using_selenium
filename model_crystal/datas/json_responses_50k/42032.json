They gave me the maximum flexibility to explore what I like about the products of esri related to urban planning and management. Durting this time, I got to know products such as CityEngine, BusinessAnalyst, CommunityAnalyst, ArcGIS online, etc and developed tutorials for potential customers. Anther great experience with Shannon is Geodesign. I participated in the Geodesign Summit 2013 and witnessed the spread of such concept and practice in Asia and Europe. When Chris and Shannon knew that I wanted to go back to school (Europe) for research, they were willing to help me and provide whatever I needed to make it possible. I like and miss my days in sunny Southern California.",
