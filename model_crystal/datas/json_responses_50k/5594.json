After extensive inquiry at 4 companies I formulated 2 main conclusions:\n\n1. Instead of helping strategy implementation, organisational structure was often felt as an obstacle by participants \n2. Assumptions on roles and effective management differ amongst managers, caused by disciplines and hierarchial layers, which makes it difficult to implement strategy across the entire organisation.\n\nThe most important recommendation by far is: use a constant dialogue between all layers in the organisation (horizontal and vertical) to verify and check meaning and sensemaking on what you're implementing.",
