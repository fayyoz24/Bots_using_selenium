WOTRO funds research that is relevant for development and characterized by scientific excellence. I worked as a staff officer at WOTRO assisting a senior policy officer in all aspects of tasks and responsibilities linked to the above strategy.\n\nThe Global Health Policy and Health Systems Research (GHPHSR) programme aims at contributing to better health in low-income countries (LICs) by conducting research aimed at strengthening health systems. Furthermore, strengthening research capacity in LICs as well as strengthening collaboration in the Dutch research and knowledge community are aims of the programme. I was involved in the whole process towards the final decision for funding of the second call of the programme. For more information about the GHPHSR programme and the awarded programmes, please see www.nwo.nl/wotro/healthpolicyandsystems.\n\nThe Netherlands-African partnership for capacity development and clinical interventions against poverty-related diseases (NACCAP) is a national programme that contributes to the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Paternship (EDCTP). NACCAP aims at combining excellent scientific research with sustained investments in the Research & Development capacity in Africa in fighting the diseases of poverty: HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
