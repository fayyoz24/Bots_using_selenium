    "summary": "I had a long and versatile career at the Custodial Institutions Agency of the Ministry of Justice and Security: first a nurse in the prison of Amsterdam, after I graduated in sociology and criminology I became policy officer and eventually a senior strategic advisor. My main expertise is prison healthcare (including addiction and mental health care) and normalization of the detention climate. I have extensive international experience. I was a member of the steering group of the WHO Health in Prisons Program (2004-2015), from 2012-2015. I was project leader of an EU project in Turkey (\u2018Harm reduction in prisons\u2019), and in 2015 I was involved in an EU/Council of Europe project aimt at health care improvements in prisons in Georgia. From 2004 to date I have been in Ukraine and Belarus regularly to do assessments, give presentations and workshops and as a project leader (involving training for staff in juvenile detention centers).\nIn 2019 I was accepted as an expert by CPT (Committee for the prevention of Torture and Inhumane Treatment) of the Council of Europe. \nSince my retirement  I'm also involved as a  \"buddy\" for disadvantaged children as a volunteer at Foundation Studio 52nd, a theater group that works with children with the aim to stimulate their creativity and to increase resilience and self-confidence.",
