    "summary": "I may best be described as an open, social and ambitious person, an enthusiastic team player with great sense of responsibility. I'm genuinely interested in people and team-dynamics, closing off a day where I have had genuine connections with colleagues and/or customers leaves me with a great feeling of fulfillment. I am an analytical, quick thinker, and this allows me to simplify complex issues. My strength lies in building bridges between companies, departments and people.\n\nCurrently I fulfill the role of Director Cabin Operations at KLM Cityhopper. This role suits me well mainly because working with people gives me energy, and I get to work on both long-term strategy and daily operations. This ensures a dynamic work environment where no two days are the same. In the hours that are left I like to travel, read and listen to podcasts about those I aspire and admire.",
