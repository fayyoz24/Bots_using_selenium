    "summary": "Naval architect in the Oceans of Energy team living in the Netherlands.\n\nI graduated with a double Master's degree in Naval Architecture at Chalmers University of Technology and Fluid Mechanics at INP ENSEEIHT Toulouse with main interests lying in Fluid Mechanics and Ship Design. My Master's Thesis concerned dynamic subsea cables for wave energy converters (WEC). The goal was to better understand their fatigue life due to the water tree phenomenon.\n\nDuring my studies, I got involved in a few projects. I worked on the conception of the foil for the previous Chalmers sailing boat to compete at the 1001VelaCup. The concept was awarded 1st prize in 2020. I have also worked on a project of a Ro-Pax Ferry for Stena Line with wind assistance made by rigid stails and hybrid motor propulsion.\n\nHence, I have acquired many teamwork skills as well as worked with different cultures. I work conscientiously and learn quickly to achieve my objectives.",

I am using commercial software such as ANSYS Mechanical and CATIA.\n\nI also have additional tasks such as hydrodynamic simulation of the dynamic power cable and post-processing of data. For these tasks, I mainly use Orcaflex and Python.\n\nMoreover, I am in charge of projects in close collaboration with external companies. \n\nMy personal benefit from working for Oceans of Energy is the fast experience and knowledge I get in being involved in every step, from conceptual design to fabrication. \n\nFinally, I have the chance to go offshore or to help in the fabrication process of the offshore floating solar farm. It allows me to foresee the best adjustments to improve the farm.",
