The main focus is on investigating the capabilities and limitations of these models as a much cheaper alternative to CFD. The model is based on the data from LES simulations and is verified by the results of DNS simulations. To do so, a large set of LES simulations with different boundary conditions and geometrical configurations will be carried out. Our research is motivated by the necessity of robust, rapid, and accurate models for indoor environment simulations. Later, these models could be used in building ventilation design and control, in order to ensure adequate indoor air quality and to reduce the risk of infection spread, such as COVID-19, in confined spaces.",

Within this framework, we propose to work on the development of advanced supercomputing algorithms. They should be stable and reliable, working with a minimal amount of empirical information, and focused on two important renewable energy fields: solar thermal plants and wind energy. These fields involve many different physical mechanisms combining a broad range of physical and temporal scales (multiphysics-multiscale modelling).\n\nThe project consists of two interrelated main lines of research. The first one is a basic research line focused on the development and improvement of numerical techniques for fluid mechanics in the turbulent regime and heat transfer. The key elements to improve their accuracy are threefold: the computing capacity of modern (i) high-performance computers (HPC) based on hybrid architectures (e.g., CPU+GPU), the improvement of our (ii) numerical techniques and the reliability of (iii) turbulence models. In this regard, this research project interlaces these three pillars with the aim to tackle the problem of turbulence and heat transfer in incoming HPC systems that demand new algorithmic approaches with much higher arithmetic intensity. The second line of research is applied to the above-mentioned renewable energy fields: solar thermal plants and wind energy. This line follows the supercomputing trends of the Scientific Excellence Challenges within the Horizon 2020 framework. Moreover, it constitutes a great tool for the priority challenges in renewable energies in Social Challenges of the Horizon 2020. ",

This is motivated by our very recent findings: namely, eddy-viscosity models with the proper cubic near-wall behavior are able to provide a good agreement at moderate Rayleigh numbers (Ra) but show discrepancies at higher ones. To study this, complete direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection of a liquid metal at high-Ra will be computed and used for a priori/posteriori LES studies. Advances in this regard are crucial to obtain accurate (numerical) resolution of turbulent liquid metal flows which are relevant to many cutting-edge applications such as breeding blanket design for nuclear fusion reactors.",

Such a flow configuration exhibits a delicate energy transfer by means of the surface tension term. The newly proposed technique ensures that this is treated in a fully conservative way for the first time.\n\nIn the first stage, simulations are carried out within the wavy turbulent regime for a period of up to 50 flow-through cycles, which provides a comprehensive result of the wave evolution as well as its instabilities. In a second stage, the working conditions are stressed to match those relevant for the\ntypical applications of a solar-cooling device.

Within this framework, we propose to work on the development of advanced supercomputing algorithms. They should be stable and reliable, working with a minimal amount of ad hoc empirical information, and focused on two important renewable energy fields: the generation of electricity (solar thermal plants and wind-energy) and the improvement of the energetic efficiency in buildings (bioclimatic architecture). These fields involve many different physical mechanisms combining a broad range of physical and temporal scales (multiphysics-multiscale modelling).\n\nThe project consists of two interrelated main lines of research. The first one is a basic research line focused on the development and improvement of numerical techniques for fluid mechanics and heat transfer. These should work efficiently on supercomputers using hundreds of thousands of processors keeping in mind that in the near future modern supercomputers will reach the Exacomputing capacity. The second line of research is applied to the above-mentioned renewable energy fields (solar thermal plants, wind-energy, bio-climatic architecture) involving complex systems with many different interacting physical mechanisms. This line follows the supercomputing trends of the Scientific Excellence Challenges within the Horizon 2020 framework. Moreover, it constitutes a great tool for the priority challenges in renewable energies and buildings in Social Challenges of the Horizon 2020.",

                    "description": "As a PhD student at CTTC, I developed the HPC\u00b2 (Heterogeneous Portable Code for HPC). It is a fully-portable, algebra-based framework capable of heterogeneous computing with many potential applications in the fields of computational physics and mathematics. This framework aims to provide a user-friendly environment suitable for writing numerical algorithms in terms of portable linear algebra kernels. In its application to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the algorithm of the time-integration phase relies on a reduced set of only three algebraic operations: the sparse matrix-vector product, the linear combination of vectors and the dot product. This algebraic approach combined with a multilevel MPI + OpenMP + OpenCL + CUDA parallelization naturally provides portability.\n\nBy way of example, our team has demonstrated the single-device performance of the HPC\u00b2 on many Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors, different NVIDIA and AMD graphics processors and ARM-based SoC devices. Besides, the parallel performance has been demonstrated on up to 200 nodes of MareNostrum 4 supercomputer (two 24-core CPUs each), 64 nodes of TSUBAME3.0 supercomputer (two 14-core CPUs and four NVIDIA P100 GPUs each) and 64 nodes of Lomonosov 2 supercomputer (one 12-core CPU and one NVIDIA K40 GPU each), among many others.",
