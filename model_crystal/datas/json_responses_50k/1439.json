    "summary": "In Short: Solution-oriented, design-led thinker with a diversified background. Passionate about sustainable business strategies and well-being in and out of the work place. Helping travelers discover their best trips. Entrepreneur. Creative data geek.\n\nThe Backstory:\n\nI'm a design-loving New Orleans native who grew up shaped by the art, design, music, and famously good food my hometown is known for. When I moved to the Sonoran desert in my mid twenties, the landscape and its extreme changes opened my eyes not only to a spectacular plant palette, but also the growing need to conserve resources.\n\nThis move also spurred more awareness of the importance of cultural preservation. As a landscape architect focusing on projects in culturally sensitive destinations, I designed authentic experiences for the traveler that allowed for the greatest connection with the local communities while providing positive benefits to all.\n\nAfter working remotely for the better part of a decade across Europe and the Americas in creative direction and holistic health, at the beginning of 2020 I fused my passions for design, travel, and wellness together, filling a gap I saw in the conscious travel space.\n\nAnd so Good Trips was born: curating and showcasing the most unique, beautiful, and sustainably focused businesses, making them easier for the mindful, design-loving traveler to find.\n\nI'm here to help travelers navigate this beautiful planet and get to know the hosts and communities who help to keep it real.",
