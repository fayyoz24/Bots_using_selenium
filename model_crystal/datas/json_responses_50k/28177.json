    "summary": "Phrases which would describe my attitude:\n\n- No pain, No gain.\n- Obstacles are temporary and are allowing you to accept the challange and come up with the right solution which would last forever.\n- Perspectives, ideas and knowlegde from others are assets gained from experiance. Stay eager to learn from others expertise and experience.\n\nAs long as I can remember I had a interest in scientific matters. Because of this reason I chose an education that verifies my interests in classes, which were: Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.\n\nHaving these interests, a path towards Organic Chemistry was formed. Starting with my first degree as Associate chemical-physical scientist (Analytical Chemistry) and followed up by a prestigious/respectable Bachelor's degree in Organic Chemistry, which was accomplished within 2 and a half years. During my laboratory career, I was allowed to experience GMP, QC, Forensic and R&D laboratories.\n\nWhile in my Bachalors, affinity for Medicinal Chemistry was developed. This includes matters in Protein/Peptide Chemistry, Synthesis of Small Molecules, MS techniques, HPLC Purifications and Biochemical approaches.",

The main field of research is conducted on the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). Within this group researchers are developing new techniques to profile cellular processes using synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) as scaffold.\n\nThe thesis-project was called: \u201cThe development of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Ub-SUMO-based tools to identify specific interactors of SUMO-Ub hybrid chains\u201d with my part being the synthesis of these poorly understood hybrid chains using novel synthetic approaches. Understanding those responses of these chains is crucial since these signals play a role in DNA repair, immune responses and regulation of membrane dynamics. The main goal of this project was to identify specific interactors of such hybrid chains, to understand the biological processes that they mediate.\n\nDuring my Internship, experiance in the following techniques were obtained:\n- Organic Chemistry, Including Protein Chemistry and Click Chemistry \n- Shimadzu/Waters HPLC systems\n- Biorad NGC - FPLC, SEC system\n- Full characterisation NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC)\n- Column Chromatography\n- LC-MS\n- LC-HR-MS",
