    "summary": "Jessica is a passionate back-end developer and scrum master. She is a team player who welcomes change and any feedback she can get. She has an eye for detail and has an organisational talent. \n\nAfter completing her Master in Computer Science at Utrecht University in 2013, Jessica has gained a variety of experience. From UX to VR, Java to C++, Scrum and Agile. In the last few years she mainly focussed on Java, Scala, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Python, CQRS & Event Sourcing and Microservices running in the Cloud.\n\nOn top of that she takes interest in the architecture within and between (chains of) services as well as integration testing and monitoring and alerting. In development she pays special attention to quality and security. She has presented a short talk about robustness for micro services at the JFall conference which she has evolved and repeated for several clients.\n\nOn the job, she noticed many teams and organisations had a demand for guidance in their working process. Determined to learn more about this and help projects to the next level, she has been seeking mentorship of more experienced colleagues, scrum trainers and agile coaches, eventually completing a Scrum Master Academy program.\n\nJessica loves to work on software products that have a positive contribution to society. For example, she has worked on e-learning applications, in the serious gaming industry and in the financial industry regarding financial economic crime. Until september 2022 she worked for Simacan where she contributed to the micro services landscape for monitoring and managing large logistic operations and communications. She took additional ownership by participating in 24/7 support.\n\nJessica lives in Leusden with Patrick. She loves crafting clothing, and travelling by train with Patrick.",
