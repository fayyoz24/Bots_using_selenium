    "summary": "My intrinsic motivation is to work on complex matters and based on a thorough analysis and understanding, contribute to practical and innovative solutions. Development studies, a multidisciplinary perspective on the most relevant local and global issues regarding development, provided the academic skills to operate in this diverse field.\n\nThe advanced Master Development studies was the kick-start of my professional career, aiming to contribute to pro-poor development. The international agribusiness sector and worldwide food security challenges, give enough angles to challenge me and devote my knowledge and passion.\n\nMaking impact, a positive change for small scale farmers, entrepreneurs, people less fortunate to participate in economic activities and give them equal share and chances, that\u2019s my drive.\n\nI am motivated to contribute to a more in-depth understanding of complex matters, and contribute to a practical and robust solution. Based on this analysis, understanding, theory of change so to say, I want to contribute to more effective transfer of knowledge, and a better delivery of capacity building and learning trajectories.\n",
