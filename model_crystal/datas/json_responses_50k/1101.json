Onze doelgroep bestaat uit de volgende drie categorie\u00ebn:\n\n* drukke professionals die weinig tijd hebben en toch fit en gezond willen blijven\n* vrouwen en mannen van middelbare leeftijd die gezond willen blijven maar niet altijd de motivatie  \n   vinden om te gaan sporten. Zij zijn gesteld op hun privacy en de wekelijkse afspraak met hun \n   personal trainer die ze nou eenmaal minder snel afzeggen.\n* gepensioneerde mensen die graag actief blijven terwijl ze ouder worden. \n\nDe meeste leden zijn 45 plus. We hebben ook jongeren van onder de 18. En ons oudste lid is boven de 90 jaar oud. Kortom, fit20 is for life. Kijk op onze website voor meer informatie: www.fit20.be.\n\nZelf uittesten? \n\nDat kan!
