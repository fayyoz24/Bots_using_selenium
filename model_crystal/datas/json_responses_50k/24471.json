    "summary": "Currently, I am following the rigorous and well-respected International Commercial Arbitration Law LL.M. program offered by Stockholm University. \nA graduate with an LL.B. from Maastricht University\u2019s European Law School, this program featured a heavy emphasis on comparative law, namely between the English, Dutch, German, and French legal systems. Additionally, my studies included in-depth studies into the substantive and institutional laws of European Union, and elective studies into international law. I am a dynamic and passionate individual. A quick learner, I thrive in fast-paced and engaging environments.\nDuring the course of my LL.B., I earned two minors: the first in Business and Law, and the second in Globalization and Inequality. Both of these minors provided me with important context to my general European legal studies. \nI thrive in environments that are dynamic and intellectually stimulating. My background in comparative, European, and international laws has equipped me with a uniquely versatile skill set: the ability to quickly adapt to various cultures and perspectives, whether legal or individual. \n",
