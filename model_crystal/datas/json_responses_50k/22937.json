            "description": "In this project, the possibility of constructing a railway track system made of asphalt concrete is being explored. The project idea is motivated by the fact that traditional railway tracks made of granular ballast materials suffer from frequent wear and tear and hence, require routine maintenance. The idea is thus to replace granular ballast with asphalt concrete that will directly support the rail-fastener-sleeper assembly. \nIn this research project, the primary goal is to analyze the mechanical behaviour of ballastless asphalt tracks. This is achieved through building and testing a full-scale experimental setup of the track under different types of vertical loads in an indoor environment. A diverse array of sensors- both embedded and surface, monitor induced mechanical response of the mockup at different locations.  A response model of the mockup is developed and validated with the experimental measurements. The validated model presents opportunities to investigate other loading scenarios and optimize the test section.  The findings of this study provide insight and improve the overall understanding of the mechanical behaviour of ballastless asphalt concrete tracks during train passage. ",

Subsequently, a 3D, dynamic, nonlinear, viscoelastic FEM model of the mockup was developed and validated with experimental data. \nMain findings: \uf0a7\tBallastless asphalt concrete tracks exhibited pronounced time & temperature-dependent, which were non-linear \n\uf0a7\t Measured track responses were of very low magnitude, indicating little or no damage under anticipated service loads.\n\uf0a7\tPeak vertical accelerations were measured to be lower than ballasted tracks\n\uf0a7\tIf longitudinal braking loads were to be only intercepted by means of sleeper-asphalt friction, then heavier sleeper types would be needed.",
