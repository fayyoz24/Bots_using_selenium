    "summary": "I am proud to be a student at the University of Tilburg. In Tilburg, I am following my interest of working in the department of economics and/or finance.\n\nAside from studying, I am a member of the Council of Advice of ESN Breda (previously, the president). ESN Breda is a non-profit student organization in Breda that helps international (both full-time and exchange) students integrate into the local culture and benefit from self development through the idea of \"students-helping-students\". This position is voluntary, however, it helps me to provide advice to new board members based on my experience during my presidency.\n\nRegarding business, I manage four separate businesses. The first being a business Webbie where I manage the financial aspects of a retail trading company. The second is, managing clients for a company Tradelink International that assists the growth of foreign retail brands in the Dutch and Belgian markets. The third is being a mentor for students that are interested in becoming a successful retail seller on the platform Bol.com. And the fourth is managing a free online website that provides information to help and support international students when integrating into The Netherlands.",

After a few years of being an avid seller on Bol.com and independently learning my way through the whole process, I decided that it would be great to share my knowledge about this business path to people in my position (seeking \"financial freedom\").\n\nThat is when I began my course on YouTube. Since the beginning, I have only released a few videos that gives English speakers more insight, however, I realised that there was a demand for this after being contacted multiple times. After helping out my first client, I decided to create this business where I would help other interested sellers and offer them the knowledge that I had accumulated.  \n\nIn my program, I teach enthusiasts that are interested in setting up their business and becoming a seller on the platform. My course covers topics that begin from the basics (how to set up a business legally with the Chamber of Commerce) and eventually dives into specific topics such as the exact product that will have a high conversion. I work closely with my clients to ensure that they understand the program and (by the end of the course) become independent.",
