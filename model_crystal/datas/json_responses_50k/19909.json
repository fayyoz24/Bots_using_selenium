    "summary": "I am a calm and youthful student who aims to achieve a bachelor\u2019s degree in international human resources management (IHRM) hoping that one day I can help others and contribute to society.\n\nI like to believe that I am mostly a positive and cheerful person, open for new experiences and intercultural communication.\n\nMoreover, I see myself as a perseverant and professional person when engaged in projects with clients.\n\nFurthermore, I also believe that my locus of control is internal, thus, owning up to my actions and the consequences of those without blaming outcomes on external factors.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that I could be a potentially good asset to any workplace as I can easily pick up on instruction and I also believe to have an out of the box approach when faced with unforeseen issues.\n\nLastly, I believe that even though my work experience is quite limited I could have the potential to learn a lot a successfully adapt to different situations. Also, I believe that my lack of experience based on work settings is irrelevant, as anyone has the potential to learn and adapt.\n\nContact: andrada.becheritu@gamil.com",
