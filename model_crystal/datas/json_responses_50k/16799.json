    "summary": "With over 5 years of experience in scientific research, I am passionate about bridging the gap between science and policy to address the pressing challenges of global change. I hold a Ph.D. in Marine Sciences from KAUST, where I investigated the impacts of oil pollution on coastal ecosystems and habitats.\n\nAs an Environmental Policy Consultant at Trinomics, I advise governments, public institutions, and NGOs on economic and policy matters across topics of environment, energy, and climate. I have supported the development of methodologies and solutions for environmental taxation, ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, indicator development, data analysis of public consultation, and participated in ex-ante impact assessment of new environmental legislation. I co-lead the business strategy for the water sector, leveraging my expertise in water resources management, aquatic ecology, and understanding of the EU policy framework and strategic canvas for biodiversity, environment, and natural resources management.",

On the technology side of things, I provided advice on microalgae strain selection for desert environments, scale-up, and maintenance of microalgae cultures, and participated in site visits. In addition, I also helped conduct preliminary evaluations of strain tolerance to varying light intensities as part of developing a patent for an 'Integrated microalgae cultivation system' featuring harvesting of solar energy for microalgae cultivation coupled with sensors for environmental parameters.",
