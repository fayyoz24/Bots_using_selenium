My role as a Make Up Artist was also closely tied to Sales representative. This means that I had to adapt a hands on approach in order to reach my selling target successfully. The first part consisted, through make up trials and using my creativity as an artist to convince the customers that certain colours and make up were more favourable than others. The second part consisted in treating the customer like a buyer instead of a person who was receiving make up on my behalf. Therefore, finding this balance between creativity and convincing the customer to purchase was often very difficult since they are two completely different roles. \nI am happy to have been given this opportunity to form part of one of the most successful businesses in the world. Demanding and Challenging but managed in a unique and great way.",
