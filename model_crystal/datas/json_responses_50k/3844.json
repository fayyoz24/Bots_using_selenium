    "summary": "I am specialised in managing learning and development needs in multinational companies, working closely with talents in the field of learning and development and digitisation.\n\nMy expertise is modernisation and digitisation of training tools and training materials in order to reduce training time and cost and improve learning curves. I achieve this by implementing the use of video's, animation, gamification and knowledge retention tools within learning environments.\n\nMy goal is to make learning possible anywhere and anytime and making it fun.\n\nMy main focus on learning and development goes hand in hand with assuring quality. Providing training and education only has long-lasting effects on people when sufficient follow-up and practice are in place. This is where quality assurance and knowledge management also play an important role. And where great stakeholder management is needed to ensure successful collaboration between different departments.\n\nOn a personal note: I'm a people person and love to travel in my free time. I have lived in 6 different countries, am fluent in several languages, love to stay fit and healthy by working out and living a healthy lifestyle.",
