    "summary": "I am a teacher by education and a people person by heart. Developing and helping others is what I am passionate about, and where I get my energy from. My philosophy is to always leave something a bit better as I found it; whether that is a classroom, within a team of employees or in customer care. Working with people,  requires a caring, open and friendly attitude, and that is why I can work in many various settings.\n\nI have worked and lived in more than six countries, as a volunteer, freelancer, teacher, customer service representative and a manager. All these experiences allowed me to develop myself both professionally and personally on many levels, as I understand what it is like to start over, having nothing but myself, my skillset, and a positive attitude towards life. My peers consider me as a very well-versed, pro-active, adaptive, caring and accurate. \n\nI currently hold:\n- European Bachelor Degree in Preschool and Primary School.\n- NZQA Level 7 recognized Primary School Teacher Degree.\n- IELTS Academic Diploma - Overall score 8 / CEFR C1.",
