The experience spaces are always a result of collaboration between different creatives , professionals and disciplines, with the senses optimally stimulated and encouraged.\nThe experience space Im'mersion is a Dome that immerses the visitor. In the new space, the visitor will be made aware of its own different senses. The senses are first deployed one by one and combined later. As they progress, the space becomes interactive. Thoughts, intentions, feelings and senses are focused on the same point. With the interactive element the target group achieve goals, which means they experience happiness. When they return to the outside one feels more consistenty and a calm state of mind. Not only in relation to the inner world, but also towards other people and the world in general.\nThe target group are people between 20 and 35 years old. Many at this age have already suffered from a burnout,chronic stress or depression. We read, hear and see what the success stories are of other young people. For the target group, not being a succesfull  millionaire at the age of 25 means failure. The people in this age group have big goals and want to achieve this in the shortest possible time. Partly because there are so many options and therefore they do not know where to start, while the pressure to perform is still there. They lose sight of happiness. But the power is in the process, not only in the goal.  \nWith Im'mersion we go back to give them the feeling of happiness with sensory awareness. During this experience in our space happiness and satisfaction will be measured using biofeedback. We want people to experience happiness through flow so they unconsciously discover what they can do with their own body and mind. \n",

In the new space, the visitor will be made aware of its own different senses. The senses are first deployed one by one and combined later. As they progress, the space becomes interactive. Thoughts, intentions, feelings and senses are focused on the same point. With the interactive element the target group achieve goals, which means they experience happiness. When they return to the outside one feels more consistenty and a calm state of mind. Not only in relation to the inner world, but also towards other people and the world in general.\n\nThe target group are people between 20 and 35 years old. Many at this age have already suffered from a burnout,chronic stress or depression. We read, hear and see what the success stories are of other young people. For the target group, not being a succesfull millionaire at the age of 25 means failure. The people in this age group have big goals and want to achieve this in the shortest possible time. Partly because there are so many options and therefore they do not know where to start, while the pressure to perform is still there. They lose sight of happiness. But the power is in the process, not only in the goal.  \n\nWith Im'mersion we go back to give them the feeling of happiness with sensory awareness. During this experience in our space happiness and satisfaction will be measured using biofeedback. We want people to experience happiness through flow so they unconsciously discover what they can do with their own body and mind.",

She believes that clothes should be worn for more than a single season, and her aim is therefore to create pieces that combine to form a substantial basic collection, so there is no need to replace them every six months. Her I am Nold designs are created individually from recycled, ecological and fair trade materials. The designer also uses innovative technologies to make the fashion industry more environmentally friendly. Natalie de Koning wants to promote a consumer society that is healthier than our present one, which she considers too impersonal, fast-paced and destructive to humans and animals. In the future, she hopes to team up with researchers and biologists with a view to discovering more new and green techniques. \n\nMy job during my internship at Natalie de Koning was to create a marketing plan aimed at better use of the social media channels.",
