    "summary": "I am a security professional who thinks it is important to keep a hands on mentality when it comes to security. Working parttime in the Dutch armed forces, and fulltime as a security specialist wit Pinkerton allowed me to focus on security without losing the big picture. \n\nPreviously I helped fight the covid 19 pandemic with the GGD where I was mitigating the effects of Covid-19 in The Hague and later advising organizations on Dutch Covid-19 policies. I also recently finished what i started at the Hartenlust vmbo by graduating for my MSc. (Leiden uni) in Crisis and Security Management where I specialized in Counter Terrorism. \n\nI really enjoy working in an international environment, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn. \n\nFeel free to contact me!",
