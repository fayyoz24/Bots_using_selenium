    "summary": "Having worked 10+ years in government, corporate and non-profit (international) environments and with a background in hospitality, I found that making positive impact and making connections are my main drivers. Both on an individual level, and on a larger scale.\n\nI love to put in some hard work and thinking in order to get us where we want to be. Ideal combination for me is to be active on a strategic level and then roll up my sleeves to make those plans happen. Ideally I\u2019m teaming up with colleagues to achieve this and working actively with partners from within my network.\n\nI have a positive approach to whatever is put in front of me and have found that there's always a way to make it happen. From personal experience I know that with a positive attitude and the willingness to learn one can be of value in any environment (in my case: innovation ecosystem, aerospace, ministry foreign affairs, airline, hospitality).\n\nIn general in life I'm aiming to be a reliable colleague, good daughter and friend, supportive partner and loving mum to my son (3) and daughter (0).",

In line with this strategy I team up with partners who wish to support our mission and our community, and who want to be inspired by our talented community.\n\nThe program strategy I craft focuses on: \n- inspiring talented individuals and connecting them to opportunities (they hold the future!);\n- allowing startups and scale-ups to grow (faster);\n- building a strong innovation community;\n- economic growth of the city of Rotterdam; and\n- leaving enough space for serendipity, creativity and experimentation.\n\nTo name a few of my activities: I am the right hand to our Executive Director, am in charge of monthly reviews, receive (international) delegations, mentor awesome interns (MBO, HBO & MSc), support our markcomm colleagues, represent Venture Caf\u00e9 at external events, engage and maintain relationships with innovation partners, and attract sponsors and maintain relations with the partners who financially support us in our non-profit mission (sponsors range from corporates to governmental agencies and service providers). \n\nWe are practically entrepreneurs ourselves! In other words: an exciting, rewarding and dynamic job!",
