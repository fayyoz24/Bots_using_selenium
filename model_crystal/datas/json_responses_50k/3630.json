    "summary": "I am a very dedicated people-person. I love communicating with all kinds of personalities from different backgrounds, cultures and religions. That is why I chose to do my Hospitality study in an international applied sciences university - collaborating with my uni-colleagues on hospitality projects is a passion of mine. \n\nBeing open-minded has sometimes been a pitfall in the stiff society that I used to live in (in my home country Bulgaria) and that is why I decided to turn it into an advantage, by moving to The Netherlands - one of the most creative and freeing countries currently existing. Still, my \"hunger\" for different cultures cannot be satisfied by simply communicating with Dutch people, so that is why I chose to make use of the very diverse environment of my current working place.\n\nIn my free time I love to travel. Visiting new locations and countries can recreate my mindset, expand my professional and personal network and give my internal satisfaction as nothing else can. Furthermore, it helps me learn new languages and practice the ones that I already master.\n\nIf you are looking for a passionate interlocutor or a very eager to experiment and inspire new employee, well, you are looking at the right LinkedIn profile!",
