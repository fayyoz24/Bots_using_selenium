    "summary": "I am a multilingual publishing and communications professional with wide-ranging experience as editor, producer and brand manager in fields ranging from bookselling to visual storytelling and sustainability reporting. \n\nAs producer and editor, my focus is in upholding high standards, from research and fact checking to copy editing, briefings for graphic design, and color proofing of photographic reproduction. I\u2019ve edited and reviewed technical documents, headed complex productions, and delivered parallel editions of publications in multiple languages in print and online.\n\nAs brand manager, I\u2019ve conceived logotypes, managed corporate visual identities, and written style manuals for the implementation of new brand guidelines. I am experienced in cross-cultural communication and have written and edited newsletters, press releases, and brochures to streamline corporate messaging.\n\nAs commissioning editor, I have worked with journalists and visual storytellers and collaborated with designers, writers, and publishers to develop award-winning books, exhibitions, apps, and websites, often with image as core content. This comprises over 50 photo book titles, including two decades of World Press Photo yearbooks. As curator, I have supervised the hanging of hundreds of photo exhibitions in galleries, museums, and other public spaces around the world.\n\nI am critical and analytical with a flexible mind, and I can zoom in quickly from the big picture to small detail. Challenging stereotypes, celebrating diversity and authenticity, I believe that access to reliable information and engaging storytelling supports good decision-making and drives change.",
