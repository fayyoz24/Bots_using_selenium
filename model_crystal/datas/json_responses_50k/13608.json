This concept is further developed and expanded into online communities for young professionals, students, businesses and talented Individuals.\n\nBy looking to move to free educational resources (web ) seminars, books, programs and various e -learning programs encourage each other to develop skills and talent . For yourself and others.\n\nCurrently this is done in two forms. One is on the website and on the facebook page ( http://facebook.com/candoproductions ), Here it's done by inspiring videos, articles, interviews and trendanalysis. In addition, trends are briefly discussed in how it could impact our future - I started writing about how Dutch young startups are using them on www.articulum.nl, in the near future this will be done with deeper insights on a extra platform. MORE ABOUT THIS SOON.\n\nThe second form is in the form of a strong community, this happens currently in the Facebook group ''Can -Do Productions'' (https://www.facebook.com/groups/candoproductions) where everyone can be a member of . People show their talents and passion and build up a network and a strong expanded Curriculum Vitae which really helps branding theirselves and there innertalent besides just the courses or education they have done. It is intended that this community grows bigger so that they can collaborate on a platform in order to strengthen talent on another, for example by learning how to work with a program like Adobe Photoshop together aswell as extreme examples like spitting fire to achieve a spot in the Guiness book of Records. This ensures that attention is acquired by businesses and that talented people will work at the right place. That is what I call Co-creation combined with gamification because we encourage people to develop themselves and others further, in an interactive playfull and open way.",

We had to come up with creative solutions and new technology to make it easy of shipping their communication resources (from banners to presentation tables and more). We designed new promotional materials using latest technology and which added value to their core values. With a multidiciplairy team of five we presented solutions which they are using today.\n\nThe day was part of the first \"8 uur overwerken voor het goede doel\" (8h volunteering for a charity) day and after that, the initiative attracted a wide range of cities that organised the sequel of this great event the following years."
