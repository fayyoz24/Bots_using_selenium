    "summary": "I love words.\nI love how they have the power to transport us, change us, inspire us, make us laugh, make us cry. I grew up with my nose in a book. Lots of books actually.\n\nI am a wordsmith who likes to shape words into stories and I want to share that passion for stories with others. I have written three books for children. They are set in South Africa and are committed to bringing more Southern Hemisphere diversity to the landscape of children's literature. I have created my website, Hello Typewriter, as a home for my children's books, online courses and as a platform for encouraging reading, because I believe that if there is a kind of magic in the world, it can be found in the pages of a good book!\n\nI have an MA\u00a0from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and have spent the past ten years working as an English lecturer in teacher education where I taught language and literature. My teaching has always been underlined by a love of reading and stories and I hope very much that I've inspired my students to spread a love of reading into their future classrooms!\n\nI've also worked for NGOs evaluating educational projects aimed at whole-school improvement in rural and township schools and taught English to refugees in Durban, South Africa.\n\nI am currently working as a writer and marketing professional at maxwell+spark in Rotterdam, where I am turning my love of words into new narratives in a corporate environment.",
