We were nominated after winning the poster presentation contest in the course - System Integration Project, where over 30 groups participated.\n\nThe poster presents a clean and affordable energy system concept for 500 households in Cairo, Egypt. The system is designed to operate as a microgrid powered by rooftop solar PV, small hydropower from the river Nile and Li-ion batteries for energy storage. We performed simulations on MATLAB/Simulink for a duration of 1 week to account for three different scenarios - seasonal variation in solar PV generation, maintenance of solar power plant for 1 day and drop in performance of the plant after 25 years to prove the reliability of the system. It was also followed by a financial assessment of the system to prove its economic feasibility.",
