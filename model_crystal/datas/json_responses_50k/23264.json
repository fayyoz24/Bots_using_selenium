    "summary": "Visual creator & communication specialist with a passion for storytelling that makes your brand feel authentic \u2728\n\nCreating (visual) stories is what I love to do, experienced in content creation, (corporate) communication, photography and visual design. Based in Utrecht, available worldwide. What I do? Find my \u2018need-to-know\u2019 shortlist down below.\n\n1) I may or may not have done more projects on a passion based mindset than I'd like to admit. Sometimes they weren't the best paying gigs, but I did make some great memories. Wanna hear about the time I almost tripped down a flight of stairs at a shrine in Japan to get a photo of a new product? It's a fun memory.\n\n\n2) During my bachelor I had to take classes to learn how to code. Although I am fluent in anything digital, it wasn't my cup of tea. I will never forget the moment I managed to successfully create an animated windmill. To this day, I am still proud of that (ugly) windmill.\n\n\n3) I love working with brands that speak to me on a deeper level and value the same qualities I value in my work & daily life. You might say I'm a bit of a perfectionist but in a good, healthy, slightly over-active way.\n\n\n4) The first meeting I've ever had with a big, corporate I had the brilliant idea to tell them I was wondering how they were achieving their social media goals while being such a 'super old-fashioned' company at heart. I got hired a day later.\n\nAlways open to expand my network and horizon! First \u2615\ufe0f is on me. Actively pursuing my ambition to work abroad.\n\nwww.thirsanijwening.com | hello@thirsanijwening.com",
