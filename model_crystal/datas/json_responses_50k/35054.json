    "summary": "Hi, I am Robert. I am a man of dreams.  \n\nAt the age of 15, I wanted to travel the world. I did. I travelled to 71 countries. I hitchhiked from China to Turkey. I cycled from Amsterdam to Italy. After finishing my Master Degree in Change Management I decided to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I did. I learned from my first failures in Amsterdam's startup scene but also my first successes setting up new innovative startups from scratch. \n\n6 years ago I started Orange Minds. We are all about Design Sprints, Design Thinking, (corporate) innovation and mindset change. As a Design Sprint Master I help companies with their innovation quests with the customer in mind. Putting the customer at a central place enables many businesses to come up with new innovative ideas and improvements to current products and services. I am happy to spark, facilitate, coach and use my creativity in this process. #customercentric #designled\n\nDuring one of my travels I was intrigued by China. I am fascinated by their way of innovating and their move from copycat to global innovator. When doing my work as Design Sprint Facilitator, I always look East to see what is happening in China around this topic to get inspired. \n\nI am proud to have worked with companies such as: Aegon, Akzo Nobel, Booking.com, Bol.com, SHV Energy, Essent, de nieuwe bibliotheek Almere, Friesland Campina, Nationale Nederlanden, PostNL, de FlevoMeer bibliotheek, Stork, Shell, Westland Kaas, Wolters Kluwer, Peerby, de Volksbank, Triodos Bank, PVH, Equipe Zorgbedrijven. \n\nDon't hesitate to contact me: +31 6 36 16 33 69 | robert@orangeminds.nl \nBased in Amsterdam, working globally. \n\nKeywords: Design thinking, Intrapreneurship, Entrepreneurship, Lean Startup, Google Design Sprints, Customer Discovery, Experience Design, Strategy, Workshops, Facilitator, innovation, interviewing, Service Design.",
