    "summary": "CEO & Founder of Clicks Talent\n\nI prefer to keep things authentic and avoid the third-person narrative - it just feels more genuine.\n\nSince 2017, I've been immersed in influencer management, representation, and marketing. I began working with TikTokers when they were still called Musers, which has led me to claim that I know my way around TikTok. Ultimately, you can be the judge of that. \ud83e\udd17\n\nI left university after just two weeks to establish an influencer agency. Today, we represent over 150 TikTok and Instagram influencers exclusively, boasting a total of 50 million+ followers. We also have non-exclusive agreements with over 5,000 influencers!\n\nMy expertise lies in launching social media platforms in the US by enlisting hundreds of content creators for consistent content generation. Over the past five years, my company has worked with apps like Kwai, Likee, TikTok, Pococha, Bigo, Liveme, UpLive, Mico, Hakuna, Holla, Facecast, Triller, Livit, Hago, Cheez, Zynn, and more!\n\nWe've partnered with renowned brands such as Google, Sony Pictures, Toyota, Cheetos, Pepsi, Manscaped, FabFitFun, FlatTummyCo, Bytedance, YY, Hyperconnect, Kuaishou, Skechers, Lysol, and labels like Atlantic Records, Armada, Dim Mak, CloudKid, and Colombia Records.\n\nOver the past 7+ years, I've devoted significant time to studying human psychology and body language, both independently and in-depth. This knowledge allows me to provide the best possible experience for my clients and employees.\n\nI'm always open to working with and networking with new people in the industry, as relationships are the foundation of my company.\n\nFeel free to get in touch:\n\nWhatsApp: +1 818-200-6130\nWeChat: abclickstalent\nEmail: ab@clickstalent.com",
