Each vase is made of the highest EU-quality porselain and every vase is not perfectly round and therefore unique in shape. A very exclusive scent is created especially for Smeldt by Master Perfumer Christophe Laudamiel in NYC. Every candle comes with an exclusive handmade giftbox manufactured by the Purveyor of the Royal Queen of the Netherlands.\n\nHaving a rainbow family myself; being married to my husband and having two sons, it is my personal mission to improve the situation and rights of others in the LGBT+ community. To join forces and create impact, Smeldt is proudly partnering with the All Out Foundation. \n\nFor more information and inquiries:\n\nwww.smeldt.com\ndavey@smeldt.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/smeldt/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/smeldt",
