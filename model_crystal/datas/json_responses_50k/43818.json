    "summary": "I am a recent honours graduate of Msc Philosophy, Politics and Economics at University of Groningen. I previously completed MA Philosophy and Economics at University of Glasgow, with first-class distinction. My key differentiation is a wide variety of extra-curricular involvement, ranging from co-representing 6000 students at the Glasgow Student Representative Council (SRC) in 2017, leading a sports club to a European Cup in 2018, to ranking fourth at the European Debate Championship in 2021. I have developed both leadership and collaboration skills, and have excelled in presentation and in-role learning.\n\nI am currently seeking opportunities for shadowing and internships, with a primary focus on Project Management, Business Analysis, and Management Consulting.",

While I was aware of my limited background in the area, I concentrated on delivering our findings clearly and convincingly, which gained us first place and overwhelmingly positive feedback on our presentation skills.\n\nAt the event, we delivered a 15 min presentation at Hilton Grosvenor to a panel of judges in senior management positions at Rathbones, KPMG, Scottish Equity Partners. We were announced in first place, because we justified our assumptions best and therefore our case stood the strongest.\n\nThis opportunity taught me how to work with a completely unknown subject under significant pressure, and gave me an experience of what Investment banking or other related careers can include.",

Without any conducting education or experience, leading a group comprised mostly of elderly locals presented me with a serious challenge.\nI led and organized weekly meetings of a small village choir, culminating in our performance at multiple charitable concerts during the Christmas season. We helped to raise money for church renovation, but also spread art in a rural area that typically lacks similar initiatives. \n\nI received positive feedback from the choir members, the previous choirmaster and also from the various concert organisers. Even though I haven't led the choir since, I still occasionally am contacted with offers of performance in the region."
