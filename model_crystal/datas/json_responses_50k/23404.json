    "summary": "I HELP ACADEMIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCHERS CONNECT AND FORM LONG-LASTING, PRODUCTIVE AND COMMERCIALLY-VALUABLE COLLABORATIONS.\n\nAcademic and industrial researchers want to work together on the most exciting, productive and commercially-valuable projects.  But they don't always know the details of technology/data transfer or intellectual property.  They're also not experts in promoting their work in the media or translating their work into business applications.\n   \nI am a knowledge transfer professional and business developer who loves to connect discipline experts with real-world business needs.  \n\nBuilding on my research background, my expertise includes: partnerships, business development, contracts & intellectual property negotiations and relationship management. My current research collaboration portfolio covers data science, life science and research performance metrics.  I specialize in creative collaboration strategies, ROI and process development, as well as partner outreach.  \n\nThroughout my professional career in research publishing, marketing and knowledge transfer, I have worked with hundreds of top-ranked academic institutions to ensure that they are getting the corporate expertise, data, and funding they need to develop highly-productive collaborations.\n\n#ResearchCollaborations | Knowledge Exchange | Business Alliance Development | Contract Negotiation | Data Licensing | Technology Transfer| Communications| Stakeholder Engagement | Project Governance | Impact Assessment ",
