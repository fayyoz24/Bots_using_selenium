    "summary": "Curious, critical and result driven are keywords which describe me well. During the MA Middle Eastern Studies I specialised in international relations, with a special focus on Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories. I like to use my strong communicative skills to share my research findings in understandable language with specialists and non-specialists alike. Therefore, it is my ambition to utilise my passion for research and my experiences abroad during my work. In doing so, I seek to contribute to a more equal world and a better and stronger Netherlands. \n\nNieuwsgierig, kritisch en resultaatgericht zijn woorden die mij goed omschrijven. Gedurende mijn master heb ik mij ontwikkeld tot deskundige op het gebied van de internationale betrekkingen, met een speciale focus op Jordani\u00eb, Isra\u00ebl en de Palestijnse Gebieden. Ik ben communicatief sterk en deel mijn bevindingen graag in begrijpelijke taal met anderen. Mijn ambitie is dan ook om mijn passie voor onderzoek en mijn buitenlandervaring in mijn werk toe te passen. Zo hoop ik bij te kunnen dragen aan een gelijkwaardigere wereld en een beter Nederland.",

As a board member I am not only responsible for the provision of a warm welcome to all new international students, I am also one of the people they can go to whenever they have problems or feel lonely during their studies.\n\nBeing a board member for Compass Breda brings along great responsibilities, especially concerning international trips (i.e. a trip to Paris). Internal and external communication are my tasks, together with trips to other cities and other countries. This asks for well-developed organisational skills, which I have learned to possess and use over the period of time I have been working for Compass.",

Together we arrange important matters, such as requesting social benefits, furnishing credit (inrichtingskrediet), and relevant allowances. Additionally, I coach people in finding a suitable general practitioner, dentist and pharmacist, as well as an electricity company and internet provider, and applying for insurances. \n\nTogether with the person in question we develop a plan of action regarding their future in the Netherlands based on their personal wishes and goals. This could be providing assistance in finding the right study program for them, educational institution or bringing them in contact with an employment agency in order for them to successfully build a future for themselves in the Netherlands. Additionally, each refugee is required to pass their government mandated integration exams within three years. Although this is a personal responsibility, I nevertheless assist in finding Dutch classes or other relevant study programs to work towards a positive result. \n\nThe duration of the supervision is eighteen months starting from the moving date to the municipality."
