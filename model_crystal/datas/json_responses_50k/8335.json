Low cost processes, fair solutions and transparency are key.\n\nRights are universal entitlements, and should be accessible to all. But delivering rights is more than a moral duty. Justice is a proven concept for overcoming poverty and stimulating human development. Legal identity means access to education, health care and the economy. In secure, safe relationships, people will invest more. For themselves, but also for their children, for their community and for their business partners. \n\nUnfortunately, justice is hard to deliver. Throughout the world, lawyers, courts and legislators find it difficult to serve the poor. Legal empowerment through innovative, low cost legal services is needed."
