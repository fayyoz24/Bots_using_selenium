The gas from Lunskoye will provide the majority of the Sakhalin LNG plant capacity with 1800 MMscf/d for plateau production. The 1st six wells, which will initially feed this LNG plant, are expected to produce 300 MMscf/d per well.\n\nThis presentation will look at how the sand face completion design has impacted the project. Shell\u2019s Fully Integrated Sand Failure Prediction Tool enabled the sand volumes to be quantified and used for the 1st time during completion selection in Shell. The results predicted that unmanageable sand volumes would occur upon start-up, for open hole completions with pre-drilled liners. \n\nThis led to a revision of the sandface completion concept from PDL to cased and selectively perforated liner (C&P). A sand management strategy was developed, where the weakest zones are not perforated. Further studies from the exploration/appraisal wells indicated that, less than 10% of the net reservoir should be left un-perforated. The resultant lower well deliverability has been more than compensated for, by deviating wells from near vertical to 55\u00ba through the reservoir and maximising the tubing size to a 9.5/8\u201d monobore design. Well potentials are now over 500 MMscf/d, but they will be beaned back due to surface constraints.\n\nWith the selected completion minor amounts of produced sand are expected for C&P completions during the first 15-20 years of field-life, beyond which manageable amounts of transient sand are expected for remaining production lifetime. A sand management plan has been developed, to ensure the facilities and personnel are prepared and able to manage sand, in these high rate gas wells.\n\nAt the end of this presentation, you will see that cased and perforated completions are a sound form of sand control completion, optimizing production and minimizing risk.",
