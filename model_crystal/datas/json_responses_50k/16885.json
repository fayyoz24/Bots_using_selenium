    "summary": "Purpose motivates me much more than profit or individual rewards. Curiosity, creativity, and empathy, drive me. So I have done more responsible volunteering jobs than paid ones so far. Thanks to the gift/curse of adhd, if I get fascinated and control my hyperfocus I can learn new subjects in depth fast, and I have learned more subjects to a professional level than I have formally studied in academia.  \n\nMy primary higher educational background is biology, particularly collective animal behaviour, host-parasite coevolution, cognitive ecology, and then analogies with and applications in human social sciences. I'm now 5/6ths through a second Bachelor's degree at University of Amsterdam in Communication Science, and while I take a semester off I'm learning more Python programming. \n\nWhat I want to do next academically is a MSc or MRes in a more computational communication or social science program, and I'm already planning my PhD thesis and research plan on how poetry affects society, using social and semantic network analysis methods to test and improve theories about that by poets globally. What I see myself doing eventually is helping to co-create more social and semantic network intelligence public tools to strengthen global civil society relative to state and market networks, so that the globalisation by the internet spreading stabilizes into a more democratic trajectory over time. \n\nMy working memory is my most annoying limiting factor, but it's much better at coordinating and recalling information in a networked system than in a line or sequence. I've used this ability in e.g. refugee aid coordination, especially among legal aid NGOs I volunteered in, 2015-2017 mostly.  \n\nOther weird skills I'm good at because of my neurodiversity: pattern-matching across systems with very different material constituents (ants / humans, brains / computers, material / digital); noticing what's absent; acute sensitivity to language usage and the metaphorical images conjured up by texts and how they're connected to create a narrative in the mind (especially in poetry and its evil twin, propaganda); and thinking laterally how to creatively solve problems and experiment to test and improve theories to be more practically beneficial. I can also hyperfocus on simple tasks if they're purposeful.\n\nWorking in a good team is very important to me. I'm done with masking my neurodiversity out of fear. I'm looking for a role and a team and a manager now where my talents matter more than my weaknesses, where my intrinsic motivations and intelligence are valued more than my paygrade.",

I designed and carried out the fieldwork, carried out McMasters fecal egg count technique on hundreds of samples, and did some initial data analysis involving beginning to learn R programming. The dataset was incomplete because of equipment damage, but we still hope to salvage some individual level data from it for a joint publication with my supervisors and other recent students using data from several related projects.",
