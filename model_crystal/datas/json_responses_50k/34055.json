    "summary": "I am strong in delivering a clear and well-functioning customer experience for the end user. I oversee the entire chain from the perspective of stakeholders and end users and I know which part of a platform should do what from a technical point of view.\n\nIn my roles I was responsible for the development of information systems, for example for the electronic publishing of data up to and including the billing and operations platforms.\n\nI am successful in small and large complex organizations because I am in continuous dialogue with stakeholders at all levels. I take the initiative to collaborate, that is the key to achieving a good result.\n\nThe platforms I worked with were complex by definition, including geographically distributed platforms, teams and chain partners.\n\nI always work from the customer experience of the end customer and I also use the NPS scores for this. All this including geographically distributed networks, platforms and teams.\n\nI wrote epics, features and user stories, kept track of the product backlog and prioritized it. I also informed the team when questions would arise during the performance.\n\nI have worked with different methodologies such as waterfall and interactive or a combination thereof and through platforms such as Atlassian Jira and Kanban.\n\nI have been working in roles as product owner, product manager and project manager for 14 years. I have worked in companies that work according to scrum and agile. Because of my experience I clearly have a university work and thinking level.\n\nContact:\n\u2706 +31646278466 for Whatsapp and Telegram calls\n\u2709 herman.lokhorst@gmail.com (for Zoom/Teams/Skype calls)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: \nDNB, ECB, UBO, KYC, KYB, Wwft, 5AMLD, 4AMLD, sanctiewet, sanctions law, DeFi, Web3, dapps, Scrum, Agile, processes, Digital TV, UI, UX, DVB-C, DVB-S, DVB-S2, DVB-T, EPG, HDTV, CA CAS, STB, VOD, Catch Up TV, OTT, CI+, IPTV, Mobile, Broadband, Fixed Voice, VOIP, Telephony, Internet, XDSL,  VDSL, FTTH, Satellite, terrestrial, Cable, Multiscreen, Quad play, Triple play, six sigma, eos, horizon, liberty global, upc, ziggo, kpn, edgeware, RGB, Imagine, AppearTV, Nordija Fokuson, Metrological, Apple, Android, Cisco, Irdeto, Verimatix, DRML",
