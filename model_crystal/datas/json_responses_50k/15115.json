    "summary": "Hi all! I am an operatic mezzo-soprano from Houston, Texas currently based in Amsterdam. My work ranges from early music to premieres of new works, presenting, and running a vlog. With my work, I hope to communicate to a larger audience the power and beauty of opera, so that the genre can continue to thrive in a fast-paced, technology driven world.\n\nI also work part-time as a Social Media Manager for individual clients. I help my clients with not only design of social media posts, newsletters, and website pages, but help them understand where and how they can reach more people across different platforms in order to drive sales and grow their business.\n\nI love languages and speak Dutch fluently, conversational German and am working towards improving my Italian. French is close behind!",
