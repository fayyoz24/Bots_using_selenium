    "summary": "Hello! My name is Kaisla, a curious and enthusiastic Master of Laws graduate based in Amsterdam.\n\nI recently graduated from the International Business Law: Climate Change and Corporations Masters program, the first ever business law program in Europe to focus on the legal means to fight climate change, and on the obligations and possibilities for companies in the field of climate law. I wanted to study international business law with a focus on sustainability as I wanted to learn how corporate and climate change law can be used as tools to help fight against climate change, and reach the aims of social and climate justice.\n\nI am Finnish but grew up in an international and unique environment, and have lived in China, Finland and now the Netherlands. Due to having lived in both Asia and Europe, I have great intercultural competence and want to enhance it further by working in diverse teams.\n\nI enjoy connecting with people from all over the world, so please feel free to add me on LinkedIn if you want to connect!",
