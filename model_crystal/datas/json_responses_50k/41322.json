    "summary": "I've been studying Social and Cultural Education at the Hoge School of Amsterdam, after which I moved to Portugal Aveiro where I had the opportunity to join the team that was preparing the implementation of the local youth centre. After that experience I worked at a Cultural Association where I coordinate the daily activities. Still in Portugal I had a change to develop my research skills at the University of Aveiro. Since then I've been very enthusiastic about creativity and innovation management and how both can help companies become more competitive and help collaborators being more motivated and productive at their jobs. Since 2006 I've also been working as a facilitator, teacher and junior consulter on matters related to both creativity and innovation as well social and cultural education. My goal is to work at (international) projects where I can link my professional skills with my educational background and be of a value for social innovation issues.\n\nSpecialties: I speak fluently Dutch, English and Portuguese",
