Not only do we as the board create the opportunity to contact other students, but also support the learning process of the members. We are joining forces to show how much fun HBO-ICT is in order to attract and retain more women for the training and to allow more women to move on to the work field! We also won the HvAll-inclusive award 2021! \n\nThrough my role as a board member I also gained experience in managing internal affairs in an organization. The administrative tasks I perform for FemIT have also given me a lot of practical experience. Together with the board, we arrange activities such as webinars (the FemIT-Inspire(s)) or workshops on ICT-related topics.",
