This year to be held from the 29th of June until the 10th of July.\n\nThe Summer Course, UNISCA, is not only an official MUN, it is also an international approved course. UNISCA is open for students from all universities and is an interdisciplinary course worth 6 ECTs based on the Model United Nations principle. The academic accreditation of 6 ECTs makes UNISCA unique in comparison to other MUN organizations.\n\nParticipants are assigned a different country and for the duration of the conference, and they represent the country\u2019s official policies and defend them on different global issues, depending on the Committee they are part of. In order to do this, you need to research the policy of the country you are representing. This includes researching not only on the official policies of this country, but also on its specific policies on given topics (the ones that you will discuss in your particular committee), so students are able to react in an appropriate manner to any questions regarding the policy of their country. This will also enable students to make sure the countries\u2019 interests are properly represented in the resolutions that committees are going to draft.\n\nThe lecture days will expand the students' knowledge of the subjects that will be discussed during the second week, the conference week. The second week is all about the UN simulation. During the conference, students represent a country during a fully-fledged United Nations Conference simulation. Resolutions are to be written, coalitions will be made or broken and an international court case will be simulated. All these events will be reviewed, reported and commented upon by the Press Department.\n",
