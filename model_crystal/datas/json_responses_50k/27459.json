These projects include the development and integration of water systems (ABIS water system) to enable access to clean water, as well as recycling of that water. Additionally, projects for environmental education include the integration of a school permaculture farm, and sustainable fishing practices for children to participate in actively (chosen with the consultation of experiential learning theories for environmental education in the field of psychology). \n\nTo enable and sustain both present and future projects, a great deal of attention is also placed on the development of fundraising campaigns. The funds are likewise to be used for the funding of school supplies, sanitary products and anything else which would contribute to the children's' education and wellbeing"
