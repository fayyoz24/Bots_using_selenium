    "summary": "\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf93 As a Work & Organizational Psychologist, I possess a critical mind and a keen interest in human capital. \n\n\ud83c\udfe8 My experience working in three prestigious hotels in Chile and at Hotel Ingenhousz in Breda as HR intern, have only strengthened my passion for hospitality and service. Throughout my time there, I learned the importance of working in a team, managing complaints, and providing valuable experiences for guests from all over the world.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc My love for hotel service is matched by my critical thinking skills, which allow me to set goals and think of improvements in macro processes while ensuring the satisfaction and well-being of employees. I firmly believe that a more human workplace is possible and a must, as we spend most of our lives there.\n\n\ud83d\udc63 Currently, I am traveling the world and gaining new perspectives, but I look forward to new challenges upon my return in The Netherlands. \n\n\ud83d\udc64 Please feel free to contact me at ignaciocbobadilla@gmail.com if you have any questions or if you would like me to send you my CV and Motivation Letter.\n\nThank you and have a wonderful day!",

I even got to interact with people from all around the world, which sparked an interest in international cultures and backgrounds.\n\nBut the real test of my abilities came during stressful situations and customer complaints. It was then that I truly learned how to manage my emotions and focus on finding solutions that satisfied everyone involved.\n\nMost importantly, this job showed me the impact that even the smallest actions can have on a guest's experience. It made me realize that every single employee can contribute to creating a positive and memorable experience for guests, no matter their position. As a result, I became more critical of both guest and employee needs and expectations, and always strived to exceed them.\n\nMy experience as a food server inspired me to continue seeking out opportunities to grow and learn, and to never underestimate the importance of delivering exceptional service.",
