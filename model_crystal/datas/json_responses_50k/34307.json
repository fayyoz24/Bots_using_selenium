    "summary": "I\u2019m an efficient, energetic problem-solver who is looking for a challenge. An avid learner in pursuit of better business models, more thoughtful analyses, and innovative partnerships. I have high expectations, demanding the best from myself, my peers and the work that we produce.\n\nMy experience in corporate, government and non-profit sectors in the U.S., Morocco, and Zambia has taught me that trust, strong values and a sense of humor translate across borders. I\u2019ve learned to converse with anyone: middle schoolers in the Sahara, business owners in Philadelphia and government officials in Lusaka. With these experiences, I\u2019ve cultivated my ability to build partnerships in complex spaces, aligning divergent ideas into a common strategy.\n\nI believe in a collaborative approach in teams and while serving clients. Working with minimal resources encourages creative, resourceful methods to getting work done. I use my talents as a natural leader, empathetic listener and connector to build more resilient, engaged teams and organizations.\n\nDuring my MBA, I\u2019ve understood that a better world is built by better businesses. Experience in consulting projects in stakeholder engagement and change management have proven that company strategy and people strategy work together to move business forward. I'm seeking opportunities in a people strategy role where I can use my communication skills, creativity and collaborative approach to develop more sustainable, people-focused businesses, enhancing team and organizational performance.\n\nTags:\nI Partnerships I Consulting I Innovation I Problem Solving I Strategy I Entrepreneurship I Social Impact I Sustainability I Business Development I Digital Transformation I Client Relations \n",
