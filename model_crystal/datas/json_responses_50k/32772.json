    "summary": "\u201cNot only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.\u201d - Werner Heisenberg\n\nThe quote above perfectly describes my experience with science. Every time I learn or see something new, I am amazed by what our universe is capable of. However, I am more amazed by the fact that we are able to capture most of this wonderful universe with simple scientific theories.\n\nIn an attempt to understand complex life from a physicists point of view, I started with the Nanobiology Bachelors Programme. In this relatively new field of science we try to explain processes at nano-scale, using mathematics, physics and chemestry. As the missing link between physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, chemists and biologists I am capable to review a problem from different scientific views. However, I found that the programme contained to little physics and computational science for my liking, although I took every opportunity to incorporate these two sciences into my projects. In the final stages of the Nanobiology Programme I knew I wanted to specialise more in computational physics. That is why I started with the Applied Physics Master, as this allowed me to take additional courses combining both physics and computational science. Currently I am working on making two fundamentally different physical computer models, describing the same system, congruent in order to eventually decrease computation times and increase efficiency.\n\nIt was my high school Physics teacher that sparked my interests in science. Due to him I have learned and done wonderful things. I wanted to be the same kind of insporation for other young boys and girls. That is why I became a certified high school Physics teacher. Next to my Bachelor and Master courses I taught Physics at a local high school. This allowed me to grow as a leader and as a team member. Hopefully I inspired at least one kid to explore the wonderful world of science.\n\nIn the final stages of my Master, I am looking for an opportunity to broaden my horizon. I have been a car fanatic my whole life, what started out as collecting hot wheels has now led to a racing simulator in my living room and a Subaru in the driveway. During my studies I founud that my interests are physics and computational science. Together with my love for cars and racing, it is only logical to pursue a career in motorsport. Sadly, I have never realised that this was a possibility, until not so long ago. Currently I am going all out to become an engineer for a raceteam.\n\nCan you help and kick-start my motorsport career?",
