Alper, a renowned color theorist from the 20th Century, believed that artists of art movements like Impressionism and Pointillism held elusive color knowledge developed through experience. Nelson, however, developed the Color Matrix, a color periodic table that demystifies the color mastery of artists like Van Gogh and Monet.
