    "summary": "After several years teaching of English in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, I am now based in Switzerland. \n\nI love running my language school, the English Voice Academy, and enjoy teaching along with a small team of local teachers. \n\nAs well as general English for individuals, children and groups, we have extensive experience in helping learners at all levels find success with popular exams, such as the Cambridge suite.\n\nAfter several years of working in banks, international organisations and local government, I am able to take care of important in-company business English contracts. \n\nIn addition, I am interested in continuing to teach remotely, via Zoom, telephone or Skype. \n\nI am CELTA and Delta qualified.\n\nIn 2020 I was thrilled to launch the Infant Communication Baby Sign Language Online Course to bring the benefits of early communication to all parents of newborn babies. \n\nPlease feel free to contact me for more information. \n\nWe look forward to working with you!",

This means mums can be the calm, confident parent they want to be. With stress free communication, mothers have the space to successfully teach their baby their heritage language(s).\n\n-I created my online video course - the complete step by step course to teaching your baby to communicate with you before they can speak - launched in June 2020\n-I am supporting my students to ensure they get the best out of the course. \n2 students reported their 6 month old babies reacting to signs within 2 weeks of enrolling on my course. \n1 reported her 9 month old performing several signs within 1 month of enrolling on my course. \n-I am currently studying online marketing techniques to bring my course to a wider audience.\n\nDownload your free guide to getting started with Infant Communication here:\nwww.babysignlanguagecourse.com\n\nInfant Communication YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHpcbG7Nt6BWhaENPRJnuQw",

I also gained experience with the TOEFL test. There were also projects such as writing language learning material, I wrote the Supercomm A2 coursebook now used by all teachers teaching at that level, and delivering cooking workshops designed to help learners improve their English in a social setting. Teaching English to small children was an additional fun and valuable learning experience.\n\nI taught in-company at:\n-Deutschebank\n-Royal Bank of Canada\n-Fortis Bank\n-BNP Paribas\n-JP Morgan\n-Litasco\n-Local government offices",
