    "summary": "Imagine for a moment that you are trekking on a mountain. You love trekking. You are enjoying the journey, including the tricky portions of it. At some point in your journey you face a decision: there is a high bridge you must cross in order to continue your path. The bridge looks safe, yet you feel insecure about crossing. The fact that the trek on the other side looks more promising is not enough push for you to cross the bridge by yourself. You doubt. You need reassurance that everything is going to be fine during and after crossing.\n\nThat is what I do as a Sales Solution Engineer in Media. I walk side by side Media companies providing them reassurance at every step that crossing the bridge of change is needed and safe. I help them materialise their future state vision whether is at operational or strategic level. \n\nI am an evolved Media specialist in content monetisation models. My 12-yr domain expertise in Media covers multiple functional and technical areas along the Advertisement and Subscription Sales processes from lead to cash.\n\nRespect, honesty, humanness form up my core.\nResilience, adaptability, collaboration define my style.\nInnovation, curiosity, learning are my motivation drivers.\n\nMedia strategist. Consultative seller. Solution seeker. Storyteller.",
