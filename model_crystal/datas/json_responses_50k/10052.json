    "summary": "Community-oriented urban designer with affinity for architecture, passionate about inclusive and sustainable urban planning. \n\nGrowing up being fascinated by miniatures, I have grown fondness of the relationship between space and people and how they shape each other. While formerly trained as an architect, I further developed an interest in urban design during my time working as an assistant architectural designer in Taipei. There I have worked on projects ranging from housings to public, cultural, and commercial buildings, as well as urban masterplans, and it was through these experiences that I was introduced to a different perspective of approaching assignments, and I find it fascinating how inseparable these two scopes of focus are. I think I am intrigued by the idea of exploring the balance between architecture and urbanism.\n\nMy altruistic qualities are my main driver as a researcher and designer, as I have come to realise my passion for social community and community-based regeneration. This passion has led to the fruition of my master's thesis project, where I addressed the topic of the Nomadic Creative Community (NCC) moving across London, and their role as an engine for community-based regeneration. The aim was to explore the challenges and opportunities of improving the liveability in the peripheral urban areas through creative public space interventions facilitated by the NCC. It was interesting to explore how a series of public space interventions could bring positive socio-economic changes to the neighbourhoods, and how involving local parties is so important in the design and planning process.\n\nAmongst the world crisis we are facing now, I feel the responsibility as an urbanist and architect to create meaningful spaces, where they add values to the wellbeing of people and environement, bridge the gap between the two, and work towards a more inclusive built environment for all species.\n\nIf you're interested in having a chat on topics such as placemaking, participatory community-based interventions, climate adaptation, circular economy, densification, and urban regeneration, feel free to send me a message! Also welcome for opportunities and collaboration in the disciplines of architecture, urbanism and landscape architecture!",
