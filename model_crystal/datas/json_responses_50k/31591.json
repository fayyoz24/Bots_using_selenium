I took many opportunities to work at the university in my early studies (e.g. as tutor or student assistant) as I was fascinated by the environment of pioneering and investigation of the unknown. I enjoy the process of knowledge-knowledge interaction. Meaning that once I expose myself for discussion with an audience (e.g., with students, conference participants, or peer reviewers), knowledge of people with different disciplines, interests and experience is interacting with my own knowledge - hopefully converging to synchronization. What do I like most when writing a scientific article? Definitely the discussion, reflecting my own findings, trying to find a resonating result or critical damper in literature. My believe is that failure, despite material failure, is flying under the radar of the scientific community. A well-discussed failed experiment can provide more knowledge than a plain successful experiment. My recent experience as a leader of an international test campaign taught me about group dynamic, collaborative research, and communication. Communication is key, not only in the documentation of scientific results, but also to deliver your message to the industry. Privileged to have an active cooperation in industry during my PhD project, I understood that our research can decide the outcome of a tender or not be of interest at all. I am passionate to become an expert on a small-scale (PhD) to contribute to a larger scale.",

We conducted experiments of an offshore wind turbine in model ice in June 2021 and April 2023 in the ice basin from the Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland. Due to the application of a real-time hybrid test setup, we were able to overcome challenges related to ice-structure scaling laws. The main scientific findings can be found on ResearchGate [1]. It was found that offshore wind turbine are prone to experience ice-induced vibrations of multi-modal nature. Next to operational and idling scenarios, also misaligned load scenarios were experimentally investigated, whereas it was found that the ice in wind load direction is likely to constrain structural motion at low relative velocities between structure and ice. The application of a hybrid test setup in model ice might set a new standard in model ice testing, allowing to investigate a variety of vertical-sided offshore structures in future experiments.\n\n[1] https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Hammer/research",

As the industry experiences a boost of offshore wind projects in cold regions (e.g. in the Baltic Sea), the importance of coupled ice-structure interaction models is increasing rapidly and will further increase within the next decades. Unfortunately, existing guidelines, for the design of offshore (wind) structures against dynamic ice loading are mainly based on experiences of the oil- and gas industry (ISO 19906, IEC 61400-3-1). This is why engineers in the offshore wind industry have to deal with high uncertainty during the design of offshore wind turbines in cold regions. To minimize this uncertainty and to contribute to a faster energy transition, our research is also aiming to support the offshore wind industry by providing and sharing design relevant insights for structures under dynamic ice loading.",
