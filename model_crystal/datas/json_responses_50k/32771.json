    "summary": "If I could send a message to myself in the past, I would say \u201cbeing a biomedical engineer is one of the best decisions you\u2019ve made in your entire life.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve had my bachelor\u2019s degree from University of Twente, where I absorbed various engineering expertise from different disciplines. However, I did not have a goal in the middle of my study for my future, and I thought I may end up with working without passion until I had an opportunity to work in a Dutch company for a student project. I was deeply impressed by the modern, fashionable, high-tech medical device that was presented. I finally figured out what I truly desired to be, a biomedical engineer.\n\nIf my bachelor program has introduced me to the beauty of science, my master at TU Delft and internship at UMC Utrecht made me prepared for my profession. I was adapted to the clinical settings and laboratory environments that cannot be forgotten for a long time: I\u2019ve watched surgeries and the surgical procedures cannot scare me anymore but made me wonder what instruments can be improved; I\u2019ve performed experiments on porcine and human cadavers, which made me skilled and brave; I\u2019ve designed and performed experiments for verifying simulation results, which made me good at analyzing and solving complicated tasks. \n\nDesigning a medical instrument is a long process. I have partially contributed to one project during my internship, but I was not satisfied. I want to join a team where I can devote myself from the very beginning, the idealization, until delivering the final product. So, if you think that there is a chance that I can be a promising candidate, please don't hesitate to contact me for a short meeting!",
