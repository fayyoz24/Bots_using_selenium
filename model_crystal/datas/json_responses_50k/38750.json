    "summary": "* Experience: Cultural anthropology | Qualitative methods | Ethnographic fieldwork | Research design | Indigenous people | Australia | Lecturing bachelor, master, research master students | Developing and coordinating higher degree courses | Individual student supervision | Organising seminars, panels and symposia | Reporting research findings to stakeholders.\n\n* Personality: In the past decade I have lived and worked in the United States and Australia. This international experience, in particular my collaboration with Indigenous Australians in a remote community in the Western Desert, has shaped me to become an independent, flexible and social person. As lecturer, I combine these qualities with my academic training to offer my students an educational experience adapted to their individual learning needs and styles. At the same time, I encourage them to take ownership of their learning. \n\n* Ambition: Although trained as a researcher, my passion is higher education. I have been teaching young adults about academic writing, research methods in the social sciences and various social and cultural theories. What I love about lecturing is solving didactic puzzles: what approach to communicating ideas and knowledge works best in what context, and for whom? How do I adjust my teaching to suit the learning style of a particular student? I enjoy thinking about examination criteria and assignments for courses and like to read literature on education to advance my expertise. In the near future, I aspire to a role in which I can become more involved in organising and coordinating a series of higher education courses (i.e. coordinating at a higher level), without losing contact with students. \n",

Utilized in-depth interviews, informal conversations, survey research and participant observation as research methods. Worked as a visiting student for the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, the Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia. Used time in Canberra to carry out literature review. Wrote a 100-page MA thesis based on research results. This thesis has been used by the director of Fregon Anangu School for the purpose of training teachers. Published findings in a non peer-reviewed article.",
