            "description": "Graphene is an extremely flexible material with exceptional material properties, this\nhas piqued the interest of the research community to explore these properties and\napply them in novel applications like sensing, computing, data storage etc. Due to\ngeometric nonlinearities, the tension in circular graphene membranes is strongly\namplitude dependent, which makes graphene susceptible to nonlinear behaviors\nlike frequency splitting of degenerate modes under asymmetric tensions. In my\nresearch I look into the large amplitude response of the resonance modes in circular\ngraphene drum resonators. The graphene is actuated using a modulated blue diode\nlaser in a Fabry-perot cavity setup and a red He-Ne laser is used for reading the\nmotion of the membrane. It has been observed that the frequency-response of\nsplit degenerate modes merge into a single non-linear frequency-response curve\nat large amplitude driving. In addition there are subharmonic and superharmonic\nresonances at twice and half the natural frequency . While one of\nthe explanation for the resonances could be parametric excitation due to changes in\ntension as explained in this literature review, they are not expected to be observed in\na homodyne detection scheme. My research focuses on conducting experiments to\ngather data on this peculiar behavior and also develop a mathematical model that\ncould simulate this behavior in graphene nano-drum resonators. Once the models are\nobtained, by utilizing the knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the resonator we\ncan extract thermo-mechanical properties of graphene from the nonlinear response\nof the resonator. This methodology further can be applied to other potential 2D\nmaterial based resonators.",

A dynamic wind load, dead load and live load due to traffic as experienced in real life is used for the analysis.\n\nvarious numerical techniques were investigated like Power iteration, subspace method, orthogonal deflation method, Craig-Bampton method for substructuring, Time integration through Newmark method, base excitation methods.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the dependency of modal parameters on different material and geometrical properties and finally computation cost, accuracy and consistency of different methods were compared and analyzed.",

These dice are separated from\neach other by a process called sawing in which they are literally sawed apart. These dice are carried\non a film carrier. The sawing process can cause the sides of the dice to develop a chip or a crack. Hence, the dice need to be checked for such chip-outs and cracks before they are sent to the customer. \n\nThe main objective was to carry out the inspection  on 5 sides by taking an image on 5 sides and process them using an algorithm.\n\nThe team was in charge of designing precision mechanism with flexible elements to inspect chips of various sizes within the constraints given to us as specifications.",
