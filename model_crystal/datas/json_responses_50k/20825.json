Guys came up with a sipid metaphor: they associated the whole process of fonts creation with organic farming, their fonts\u2014with vegetables and fruits and themselves\u2014with farmers.\n \nWe took inspiration from classic agricultural magazines and made a magazine full of useful information, tips about farming, recipes with the mentioned fruits and vegetables, and even a crossword puzzle and sudoku for the readers to have some fun. And all of it with hints and references to the type design. \n\nResults: The specimen had success and was sent out to Canada, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, USA and got picked up by AIGA Eye On Design in New York\u2014a magazine that writes about the best new work by the world's most exciting designers.

And we also co-created series of videos #MyLifeMyStyle with influencers: street artist Pokras Lampas, the founder of the street culture festival Faces & Laces Dmitriy Oskes and the digital artist Zorian Istomin. It\u2019s important to say that we did not limit ourselves to Moscow and St. Petersburg, but expanded our campaign to another 9 Russian cities: Ekaterinburg, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Sochi.\n\nResults: more than 6,5 million views, 2000 comments in social media and 110 publications in key lifestyle media popular with millenials such as Daily.afisha, The Village and also by the traditional media.\n \nThe success of the campaign got recognized by IPRA Golden Award committee, that awarded us with a victory as \u2018Launch of the new product\u2019 of the year.",
