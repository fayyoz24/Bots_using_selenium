    "summary": "I completed my Bachelor of Arts at The College of Idaho (USA). I majored in History (with a focus on Ancient History) and doubled minored in Classics and Journalism. Then, due to the economic recession, I was forced to look at other options outside of academia, and thus, I pursued an Information Technology career. I served in various technology roles, wearing many hats, such as Help Desk Coordinator, Project Manager, Educational Technology Trainer, IT Purchase Orders/Bookkeeper, IT Device Deployment, Assistant to the Director of IT, and Business Analyst. Recently, I completed a research master's degree in Ancient History at Utrecht University (Netherlands). Currently, I have been awarded a Provost Award at Trinity College Dublin to continue my research as a PhD Candidate in Classics. \n\nI have traveled to 33 states within the USA, and I have traveled to several countries: Greece, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, France, Belgium, England, Scotland, Austria, and Slovakia.\n\nIn my freetime, I enjoy long walks, hiking, reading fantasy novels, listening to music, and watching films.",
