    "summary": "I am an experimental social scientist with an interest in laboratory experiments and cooperation dilemmas. \nI started my academic career with a BSc in Sociology at the Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology (ICS) at Utrecht University, after which I attended the two-year Research Master in Sociology and Social Research at the ICS. I continued to explore cooperation dilemmas in CPRs during my PhD at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, for which I received an Advanced Quantitative Methods funding award by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). Highlights of my PhD in Oxford include traveling the world to attend conferences in amongst others Japan and Peru, and being awarded a pre-doctoral Fellowship from CESS Nuffield- FLAME University to stay for a month in Pune, India, to do research and conduct experiments at FLAME University. My research areas include institutions for collective action, laboratory experiments, cooperation, agent-based models, common-pool resource dilemmas, Game Theory and analytical sociology.  Currently I am a researcher at the socio-economic department of Statistics Netherlands (CBS). \n\n\n\nPublications: \nvan Klingeren F (2022) Using player types to understand cooperative behaviour under economic and sociocultural heterogeneity in common-pool resources: Evidence from lab experiments and agent-based models.

And if so, why, since when, and how quickly? We answer these points by studying intergenerational social mobility during the past 300 years. More precisely, we compare the social class positions of children with those of their parents in various epochs, countries, and within countries in various regions, and relate these associations to the institutional contexts of the societies and to notable characteristics of the individuals in question. Has there been a trend towards more intergenerational social mobility in all or some parts of Europe? Have levels of mobility converged? If so, where and when did those trends start? What were the determinants of social mobility in the various regions and historical periods? Which institutions have historically furthered and which have hampered social mobility between the generations?\n\nWe answer these questions using a unique historical database of 4 million individual records from historical vital registers, employed in combination with surveys, job advertisements in newspapers, and data on institutional contexts.  A comparative classification of occupations (HISCO) and associated measures of rank (HIS-CAM) and class (HISCLASS) are applied.",
