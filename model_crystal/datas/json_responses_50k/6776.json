Last year, we saw 175 bachelor, master and MBA graduates go forward to the next exciting stage of their careers.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic and can see an exciting year ahead, and I think that in this respect 2022 will bring us a much brighter and more relaxed year, with less focus on what trouble COVID-19 is causing us and more emphasis on other important matters \u2013 including many of the issues covered by the Sustainable Development Goals, that Wittenborg has committed to encompassing in its curriculum, including those covering the environment, but also peace, justice and strong institutions (#SDG16). Wittenborg\u2019s values of #Internationalisation, #Diversity and #Ethics will remain the centre of support for the school\u2019s mission in 2022.\n\nSome of our highlights for 2022:\n\u2022\t2022 \u2013 a continued quest for quality higher education and applied research;\n\u2022\tMaking the Strategic Plan happen in 2022;\n\u2022\tThe Big October Event: EuroChrie 2022 Conference;\n\u2022\tSaying Hello to our new location:  Brinklaan and say goodbye to Aventus in 2022;\n\n#Wittenborg35: Save the Date: 11th November, 2022 \u2013 Wittenborg 35 Celebration Gala",

This includes our international, English taught, bachelor's programmes that were started in 2006, and have gone through three full cycles of accreditation, & even received the European ECA accreditation for internationalisation. In 2015 we gained our first bespoke Master accreditation when our MBA was accredited by FIBAA and later in 2016 by NVAO. The MBA now has 11 different graduation specialisations and we have over 200 MBA students studying at present. In 2020 we gained NVAO accreditation for our Master of Business Management programmes as a Master of Science (MSc), with 9 specialisations, and around 150 students are enrolled in the programmes. \n\nDuring the past 15 years at Wittenborg, I have learned much about accounting, finance, ICT projects, higher education law-making, politics, lobby, HRM, & above all about the milestones that a growing organisation goes through. Since 2010, we have grown from under 200 students representing around 20 nationalities to just over 1200 representing 100. Our faculty and professional staff have quadrupled, as have the budgets. We have carried out interesting EU and national research projects and are engaged in new ones. We have refined our strategies, our positioning, and increased our stakeholders at a local, national & international level. We have developed a strategic plan, which is to lead us through the exciting developments in 2022-2026 and beyond. We have placed our strategy and thus the organization on our three main pillars: internationalization, diversity & ethics.\u201d",

After Wittenborg moved its campus location from the city of Deventer to Apeldoorn, in the summer of 2010, it was decided to divide the governance of the University into two separate foundations. The original foundation became the still independent Wittenborg University of Applied Sciences Advisory Board, and currently consists of 6 independent members. The directors of WUAS were brought into the Wittenborg University of Applied Sciences Executive. This change has achieved a greater level of corporate governance required at this privately funded institution that fulfills a semi-public role.",

At that time, the main programme was a broad Bachelor in International Business Administration, specialising in in Banking and Insurance, Hospitality and Tourism, Small Business, Real Estate and Marketing & Communication. In 2007 Wittenborg decided to gradually close the Dutch programmes (Real Estate Management, Banking & Insurance, and Communication Management) and concentrate on building its international programmes and developing a true international classroom.\n\nPeter developed the use of the e-learning platform based on Moodle, (www.wittenborg-online.com) that is still central to Wittenborg's curriculum and teaching management.\n\nHis responsibilities / portfolio at this time included: Financial Management, Personnel, Curriculum Management, and Information (also Technology) Management\n\nIn 2006, Peter led the organisation through its first full accreditation by NVAO, instigated as a result of the introduction of the European Bachelor / Master structure (Bologna) and a new accretion requirement as part of the Act of Higher Education. It was this process that paved the way to the fundamental changes at Wittenborg which resulted in the English speaking and international business school it is today.",

Read it as an amusing and at times fascinating travel narrative, a useful reference book, or an invaluable guide to distilleries. Whisky Burn is the story of a journey - one man, one Vespa, one thousand miles (1,600km), a lot of distilleries, and a fair amount of rain.\n\nWhiskey Burn -The Distilleries of Ireland by Vespa\n\n1,600 km, 21 days, 1 man and his Vespa, and a fair bit of rain. Ben takes us on his second \"painting\" trip, this time around the Irish distilleries. The distilling landscape of Ireland has changed dramatically over the last five years with the resurgence of Irish whiskey, with dozens of distilleries being built and planned. Join Ben as he discovers the old, the new, and the yet-to-come distilleries of Ireland in Whiskey Burn.\n\nBoth books are published by Wittenborg University Press, Apeldoorn. see: http://www.whiskyburn.com",
