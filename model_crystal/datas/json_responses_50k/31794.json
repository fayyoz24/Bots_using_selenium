    "summary": "Shana O'Brien is a freelance consultant providing human resources and organizational development consultancy services to purpose-driven organizations. She has over 13 years of experience in the non-profit sector, primarily with humanitarian organizations. Her areas of focus include team dynamics, organizational culture change, and staff well-being. Most importantly, she is highly values-oriented, and works according to the values of authenticity, courage, empathy, and justice. This includes approaching HR work through a lens of intersectional feminism, anti-racism, decolonization, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nShana is passionate about human resources within non-profit organizations as she has experienced first-hand how HR policies/practices can strongly impact the well-being of personnel, the success of organizations, and ultimately the ability of people to achieve their purpose.\n\nShe has substantial field experience in countries including Poland, Nepal, India, Georgia, Kenya, Chad, Uganda, Djibouti, South Africa, and Senegal. She has experience working with a variety of donors and international organizations (CARE, Plan, IPPF, European Commission, UNHCR, UNICEF, US BPRM, Red Cross, MSF, RedR, VSO, among others).",
