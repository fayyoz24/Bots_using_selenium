Occasionally I would also conduct mock job interviews with students who had a real interview coming or answering career-related inquiries in person during events or online via email. \n\nBetween September 2020 and March 2022 I also became a trainer for career-related workshops on topics such as self-analysis or personal branding in the employment context, networking, etc. During that time I gave close to 40 workshops and moderated more than 10 workshops lead by another trainer. \n\nSome other tasks that I did for the Career Services between September 2019 and September 2020 include but are not limited to, managing the organization's social media Instagram account (careerservices_ug) and organizing a career event for students (Career Opportunities at the EU, 28th May 2020).",
