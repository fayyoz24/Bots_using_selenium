    "summary": "I am a highly driven Maltese student who constantly aims to broaden my knowledge and develop myself as much as possible. From a young age I was intrigued by the vastness of space and our lack of knowledge about it. I am highly ambitious and after seeing that I couldn`t pursue a degree program related to studying and increasing my knowledge on space I was determined to find it elsewhere. Hence, the reason why I decided to pursue a degree program in Astronomy at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I am also currently following an Honours program alongside my bachelor\u2019s degree which has introduced me to a vast number of diverse skills and topics, including \"Effective Teamwork\", \"Academic Writing\", \"The Art of Influence\", \"Debating\" and \"Living a balanced life\".\n\nHaving studied Pure mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry at an advanced level has enabled me to create links between the four disciplines and better understand the way in which the world works. While only mathematics and physics can be said to be directly related to my choice of degree, chemistry and biology allow me to approach the universe in a variety of ways and connect the dots between different scientific phenomena.\n\nI aim to continue broadening my knowledge of astronomy as well as that of biology and chemistry to the side so as to contribute to the interdisciplinary knowledge of the natural sciences. With this knowledge I will then carry out research on the origin of life on Earth, life on other planets and other topics encompassed within the field of Astrobiology.\n\nIf you wish to contact me you can send me an email on elisecamilleri2000@gmail.com",
