    "summary": "My specialism is traffic management, optimizing the flow of traffic during road works. This includes  preparation of traffic management plans and control scenarios on the side of both the client and the contractor (contractor) and detailed coordination with internal and external stakeholders. Also (regional) control scenarios for regular problem sites in the context of a network approach belongs to my work package. \n\nSince 2012 I've developed as a project manager, working on several multidisciplinary studies in Europa and the Middle East. Besides traffic and transport I've developed a wide understanding of ecology, flora and fauna, archaeology, noise and vibration, and land acquisition.\n\nFrom 2008 onwards my focus shifted to working internationally, applying my experience and giving commitment to new developments. These project differ from high level transport planning studies (Traffic Impact Assessments and Studies and High Level Transport Studies, Traffic Surveys and Transport Demand Studies) to the level of detailed design (including specs and BoQ's). These activities are executed in The Netherlands, as well as abroad (Belgium, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, India).\n\nSpecialties/Keywords:\nProject Manager\nAdvisor traffic models\nAdvisor traffic and transport\nAdvisor Traffic Surveys (ATC/TMC/Traffic Demand Interview/Road Side/Public Transport)\nMultidisciplinary projects\nTraffic engineering design\nSustainable Safety Advisor\nVCA-VOL\nBRL9101",
