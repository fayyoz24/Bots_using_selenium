The sponsor of the project was Oost NV (East Netherlands Development Agency). We choose this company based on its contribution to the local economy of The Netherlands and the promising future of renewable resources. The results of the project are: 1. A selection of countries that are interesting for Deep Water Energy 2. An overview per country of the most suitable regions for Deep Water Energy 3. A detailed description of opportunities for partnerships in the selected countries As a team we have shown: - To be able to work under time pressure - To have an entrepreneurial spirit despite our academic backgrounds - To function well in an international context",
