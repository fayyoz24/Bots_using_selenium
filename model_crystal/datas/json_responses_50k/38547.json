In this function I have looked carefully at the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement of our own parish, trying to make a number of improvements on our levels of cost, expenses and also our benefits. However, these are of a minor nature compared to the problem that has been building up in our Balance Sheet for the past decade.",

I worked for a number of months in Payroll, in Procurement (first Corporate Audit) and in Application Management Services (second Corporate Audit). In April 2010 I became a member of the GBS Compliance Team, in charge of Data Security and Privacy. I participated in 2 Business Controls Reviews held in Antwerp in the summer of 2011, where I acted as the co\u00f6rdinator, responsible for receiving Requests For Information, chasing their answering, timely posting to the auditors and ad hoc status reporting. Currently I am responsible for the Risk Assessment process covering some 300 active AMS and Consulting projects at each point in time.

Main goals were to achieve a 10% cost take out year on year and to have an ICT satisfaction score of 80% satisfied users. In the October 2007 satisfaction survey the Benelux reached this target of 80% (where the world wide score was 74% and the European score was 78%). Satisfaction contributors were the creation of a one stop shop for end user support (Olympus) and effective communication (newsletter, website, task id). In 2005/2006 I ran a project to replace company supplied home lines by a tax free allowance for employees. This project saved over 330,000 euros of one time charges and 500,000 euros of structural costs, while at the same time opening the home working programme for more employees. It was one of the main contributors of the 10% cost take out to be made annually.",

It had to be delivered at the end of the second quarter, although the requirements were not yet stable. Information protection, budget controls and privacy considerations were key in this project.\n\n1997: Merit Workbench For this project I did the requirements analysis, prototyping, education and roll-out of a Lotus Notes application to determine salary increases, bonuses and promotions for 750 employees. This system has interfaces with personnel data (incoming) and payroll (outbound). It had strict controls and a full audit trail. The application was in production within 4 calendar months. It was developed as a one-man-project at cost of only 400 net man hours.\n\n1996 - 1997: Human Resource Manager's Workbench\nIn this project I did the requirements analysis, prototyping and pilot implementation of a Lotus Notes database queried by people managers using their laptops.
