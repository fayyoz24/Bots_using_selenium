    "summary": "I'm an entrepreneur specialized in human rights, access to justice, development and innovation. I'm a connector, a team builder, and a creative individual, passionate to solve the worlds' biggest justice problems. I thrive in setting up new programmes, organisations and businesses, and I do so through design thinking methods.\n\nI have set up the Amsterdam Law Hub at the Unversity of Amsterdam - an innovation space for co-creation of legal and justice solutions. As the Director I connect and translate academic research and talent at the Law School to impactful businesses and NGOs to improve access to justice. As part of this role I have also designed the award winning elective course Justice Entrepreneurship, which I teach every spring to selected LLM students.\n\nI also founded SEMA - a social enterprise leveraging technology to generate real-time citizen feedback reports about police services, courts, immigration offices and health facilities (a.o.) in East Africa. SEMA was proud to receive the International Anti-Corruption Excellence Award from UNODC and the ROLAC Centre in the category of innovation in 2019. Through SEMA over 250.000 citizens were able to give feedback on public service delivery in Uganda, leading to measurable improvements at 67% of the public offices where our citizen feedback reports were delivered. Although the organisation is fully run by an excellent Ugandan team, I still sit on the board of SEMA and continue to give strategic advice.\n\nAs a professional consultant, I advise on ODA development, budgeting and (impact) evaluation for international organisations and social enterprises. \n\nAlthough I'm a European, I'm inspired by African culture and I continue to build bridges between Europe and Africa.",

To date SEMA has rolled out its services in Uganda at police stations, magistrate courts, public health clinics and municipality offices. Our system has been used by over 200.000 citizens and is procured by 3 different government entities. A Kenya pilot has recently started and we are testing how citizen feedback data can be used to incentivise (local) governments to make measurable public service improvements.\n\nI've set up SEMA as an entity and grew it from an idea to an impactful organisation based in Kampala with 14fte and with over 500.000 EUR raised in investments, grants and procurements. I've been involved with SEMA as a full-time CEO based mostly in Kampala between November 2018 and November 2020. Ever since, I support SEMA one to two days a week with strategic development, research and impact measurement and fundraising.\n\nFor more information visit www.talktosema.org",
