    "summary": "As of October 2017, I work as Senior Function Developer at the Innovation Site Eindhoven of Philips Personal Health, striving with my colleagues to bring new and exciting solutions to the market, solutions that matter to Philips customers. As a Function Developer, I am leading projects to develop new technologies for our business that start with customer insights and can be reliably produced. For this activity I am utilizing my experience of more than 25 years\u2019 in the fields of ideation, research, engineering problem solving, patent related work and technology planning.\n\nI am passionate about problem solving, and particularly about supporting and guiding teams in their quest to identify and solve technical and consumer challenges. One of my specialties is the linking of creative engineering knowledge to the legal aspects of intellectual property. I have the role of patent coordinator for the Philips Mother and Childcare IP portfolio. In this role, I assist and stimulate our IP generation, help to formulate our IP strategy and lead related activities such as circumventing competitor IP.\nI firmly believe in, and practice, structured problem solving techniques such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving).  As an accredited TRIZ trainer (MATRIZ Level 4) and practitioner, I have trained and certified hundreds of colleagues at Philips and in other companies. I am an active member of the European TRIZ Association and of the International TRIZ organization MATRIZ. I speak regularly about TRIZ and other aspects of systematic innovation at international conferences, and am regularly involved in teaching TRIZ and creativity to secondary school children and adults in the region of Eindhoven. \n",
