Corbion N.V. seeks to apply this approach globally, optimizing crop-region combinations for maize, wheat, soy, sugar beet, sugarcane, and oil palm. The project aims to maximize yield, reduce emissions, and address environmental, social, and economic impacts. \n\nAfter reviewing 176 sources, regenerative agriculture measures showed positive effects on greenhouse gas emissions. In Indonesia-Malaysia, using cover crops and organic fertilizers in oil palm fields can reduce emissions by up to 68% and 86% respectively, while biochar increases soil organic carbon by 13%. In Europe, cover crops and crop rotation in maize fields decrease emissions from 27% to 92%. Biochar increases soil organic carbon up to 7%.",
