    "summary": "Willing to rellocate anywhere,\n\nI am an American Master graduate with a degree from Leiden University, one of the top universities in Europe. I have studied topics related to political science, economics, crisis and security management, and cultural interaction (working with individuals with diverse backgrounds). I am fully fluent in English and Spanish  - both native languages for me. I am also competent in French, and can hold simple conversations in both Dutch and Japanese. \n\nAs part of my Bachelor's Degree, I was asked to act as a consultant to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy of the Netherlands. Beyond this work, I produced, organised, oversaw and managed podcasts in collaboration with dozens of people, as well as noteworthy guests, each with distinct perspectives. Beyond this, I volunteered as a student mentor, to actively engage with new students and to assist them in acclimating to new and challenging surroundings.\n\nOn my free time, you will find doing creative writing, reading, and doing arts and crafts.",
