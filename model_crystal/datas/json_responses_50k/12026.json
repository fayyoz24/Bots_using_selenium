    "summary": "I love building connections and serving those around me. I've worked in fast paced global environments and teams where my multi-cultural background and languages come in handy- I'm half Spanish and half Brazilian and grew up living in various countries in North and South America. I was an enterprise Account Manager at Adyen, where I was responsible for managing Google among other Enterprise companies and where we were successful in growing the account by more than 15x, expanding their payment into 10+ new markets. I love building relationships with clients, getting to know the nuances of different markets and anything to do with business strategy. Community and culture building is a big part of my life and I've always organized various community art events in both my personal and professional life. I was instrumental in shaping the culture at Adyen and organized events to help leadership connect with teams.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I studied meditation and yoga under a Master teacher and worked as an english teacher at a school for under resourced girls in the slums of Northern India. Later I spent time learning Sintropic Agriculture/Agroforestry and Reforestation techniques with the intention of regenerating soil.",
