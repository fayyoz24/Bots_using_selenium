This project had two major challenges that were successfully achieved. \n\nThe first was a creating a sync with Esize procurement software. ANWB buyers automatically had to be logged into the ANWB Brandstore through SSO (Single Sign On) via Esize, place their desired order and then needed to return back to Esize for completing their order.\n\nThe second challenge concerned a new feature for our Brandstore platform. This involved making it possible for multiple users to purchase together at the ANWB Brandstore so that they can enjoy volume discounts.\n\nIntroduction of the ANWB Brandstore was very successful and new features will follow later this year.\n",

Because this dealer has sales in business vans, there was also a need for body-to-fit vans. This type of vans have not a normal loading space, but one that is based on the needs of the customer. For example a VW Crafter that is suited with a bigger loading space and a tailgate. These activities are sourced out to special body-to-fit companies. My partner and I wrote a business case for how to do these activities within the company itself. This business case included the adjustments that had to be made in the workplace, the studies that employers had to follow for working with tailgates and cranes, a market research of the sales of these special vehicles in Noord-Holland and a full financial overview included the future pricelist for customers. Our study showed that the return of revenue was within 2 years and that for every vehicle sold, 20% more profit could have been made. Unfortunately due to the beginning of the crisis in 2009, the company was not willing to invest in this project. I think that still at this moment there are opportunities for this project at automotive dealer companies.",

Their workplace was fitted with 30 people who were divided in 6 different groups working on 5 different brands. (VW, Audi, Skoda, SEAT and VW business vans). Due to the complexity of the tasks it was very interesting and a challange to see if there could be made a significant change that could boost the workplace efficiency. Because this would not only be beneficial for the company itself, improvement of efficiency would lead to better turnover, but also would be beneficial for their clients, less work on their car would mean lower costs for repair and maintenance.    \nBy conducting a MMO I was able to improve their workplace efficiency with 15%.  The biggest change was made at the transition between the workplace and the warehouse. By chancing the process of providing the engineers with parts, the company was able to reduce the average waiting time from the engineers with 8 \u00e1 9 percent.",
