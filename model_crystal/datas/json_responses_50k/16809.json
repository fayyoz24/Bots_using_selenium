    "summary": "I am Tobias van Krieken, living in Oirschot, The Netherlands. Oirschot is known as the gateway to De Kempen (a region famous for its nature and tourism). Oirschot is surrounded by nature, ranging from natural pastures and forests to dunes. I've always been passionate about these surroundings, so this is where you will find me, outdoors. I have been interested in nature conservation since I was young, so at an early age I decided that this was something I would like to explore further in the future.\n\nOn July 10th 2015 I graduated as an Applied Biologist with the specialization Ecology. The wide variety of subjects discussed in the study will definitely contribute to my employability at different projects. I\u2019ve experience with land- and aquatic biology, from the use of camera traps to monitor wildlife, to analyzing water parameters. \n\nI hope my knowledge will contribute to the protection of endangered wildlife and flora. My passion is to preserve the natural world and take nature conservation to the next level. I like to work in the field, both on my own as in a team set-up. Besides the field work that I love, I also like to inform people about their natural surroundings and inspire them about nature (conservation).\n\nIf you have any questions regarding my interests, experience or personal information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nAbout me: Theoretical knowledge, hands on approach, independent but also a good team player, well informed on current developments, easy to get along with, open-minded, can translate scientific research into field management strategies and fieldwork, can inspire people to preserve nature, loves the outdoors, likes to travel; meet new cultures, natural environments and people",

The methodology includes the use of drones, ADCP and a RTK-GPS. Data is being analyzed in ArcMap, which includes the use of georeferencing tools, an interpolation analysis, and a cut-fill analysis to map erosion and sedimentation. We\u2019ve also used a NDVI analysis which maps the density of vegetation on riverbanks.\n\nThe monitoring of morfodynamics is important to understand the processes that take place when a stream is restored from a channeled state, to a more natural formation. When knowledge about morfodynamics is acquired, it is easier to intervene in the stream when some parts of it are not developing as expected. Knowledge of the morfodynamics can also contribute to a better carried out restoration of streams in the future.",

I deployed a wildlife camera at different locations and analyzed the results to see if the camera delivered extra and/or more results in a cheaper manner then with conventional  monitoring (manual inventarisation by an ecologist in the field).\n\nNext to my own study on camera traps I participated in a lot of different projects regarding the appliance of the Flora- en faunawet (Flora- and fauna protection law). When there is a possibility one is going to influence the existing nature (with the presence of protected species) on his property, by constructing a building or such, one has to take the Flora- en faunawet in consideration. In general this means you have to hire an ecologist to give you advice on possible violations of the Flora- en faunawet. In this case I had to do a literature study on the area (look for suitable habitats and the presence of FFW species), go to the actual location and analyze the area, and after that come up with a conclusion about any possible violations that could take place when one is going to carry out the plans. All of this had to be included in a report for the client. The research included bat research using bat detectors, but also locating the nests of the house sparrow in residential areas.",

Next to my own research, I participated in the general research that COTERC performed on the different species of sea turtles that came ashore on Playa Norte. The tasks I had to perform were triangulating the turtle nests, measuring nest- and egg depth, counting the eggs, measuring the carapace size of the turtles, determining the health of the turtle and noting the ID-number. I have written a research proposal and final research report about my findings of the hatch- and emerging success in the green sea turtle nests. Neither the number of eggs, or the vertical position had a significant effect. It's worth to mention that the vertical position, and then especially the vegetation rich area, did have an effect, although not significant.\n\nApart from the sea turtle research I participated in studies on the morphology of the caimans, the abundance and locations of mammals and reptiles in the forests and the presence of certain shore bird species.",
