In this 3 day conference, I represented China in the Global Inequalities Commission. We discussed how to shrink the digital gap and reach universal education. The main concern we encountered was how to help the developing countries without falling into 'neo-colonialism'. This is an issue that China itself faces today, as it has been accused of debt-trap diplomacy."
