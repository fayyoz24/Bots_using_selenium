    "summary": "I am a passionate senior Business Consultant with over 24 years of experience in IT Service Management who has developed from Service Desk employee to Team Manager, ITIL Process Manager and Service Management & Business Consultant. Experienced in understanding and translating customer needs into appropriate (technical) solutions that match the existing process designs, which has resulted in more than 15 successful ServiceNow implementations. I am familiar with development working methods and collecting best practices and have compiled them into a best practice library to ensure quality and consistency throughout implementation projects. As a Scrum Master I am used to facilitating and leading a team to successful results. I am also perfectly capable of speaking in front of larger groups and getting a message across.\n\nWith my enthusiasm, humour, drive, and service- and result driven mindset I can bring every job to a positive result. Together with a team or on an individual assignment, I am at my best as a trusted advisor where I can help customers achieve objectives in the most efficient and effective way possible and build a relationship with my customers. In an employer I look for a place where people work together to achieve objectives and where an organizational chart is subordinate to delivering value. With each other and for each other!",

Our scope includes managing the existing environment for Dela Belgium and driving the migration of the application management departments from Belgium to ServiceNow. Additionally, we are migrating the Dela Netherlands environment from TopDesk to ServiceNow, which involves integrating with TopDesk and Jira. Furthermore, we are currently working on implementing ITOM, CMDB, and CSDM functionalities within the ServiceNow platform.\n\nMy responsibilities encompass gathering functional requirements and translating them into both functional and technical requirements. I provide leadership to the DevOps team, deliver training sessions, and support the product owner. Ensuring alignment between user needs and the technical capabilities of ServiceNow is a crucial aspect of my role. By closely collaborating with the team, we ensure an efficient and effective implementation of ServiceNow across Dela. I also guide the team in tackling technical challenges and offer support for incidents and change requests.\n\nI take pride in contributing to the successful management and ongoing development of the ServiceNow environment at Dela. It empowers the organization to optimize IT service management, streamline processes, and enhance collaboration among various departments. I am excited about the continuous growth and improvement of our ServiceNow implementation and look forward to achieving further successes in my role as a liaison between users and technology.",

These apps streamlined information gathering, approval workflows, and data capture, ensuring compliance with regulations. By centralizing and automating these processes, we achieved greater efficiency and accuracy in contract management. The apps facilitated in the retrieval of vital information and gathering all necessary approvals while also generating comprehensive reports for regulatory compliance. \n\nThis project enhanced my business consultancy, teamwork, and implementation skills. I learned how to communicate and collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams, and I experienced the importance of continuously striving for improvement and optimization of business processes.\n\nBeing involved in this project has been a privilege, and I am excited about the opportunities it has created for the Volksbank. I look forward to leveraging the knowledge and experience gained from this project to tackle future challenges in digital transformation and process optimization.",
