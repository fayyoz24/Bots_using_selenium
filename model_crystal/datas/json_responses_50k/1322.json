    "summary": "I am a researcher with a special interest in renewable energy systems. Currently I am a PhD candidate at the Energy and Sustainability Research Institute Groningen and KNMI where I get to familiarize myself with climate modelling and research the effect of future changes of climate on the changing European energy system.\n\nDuring my master Sustainable Energy Technology at TUDelft I found my main interest and talent in process engineering and graduated on the design of a fresh water condenser column that utilizes a heat recycle from an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion pilot plant. After graduating I started working for the knowledge institute Deltares, where I got to do applied research into district heating networks, aquathermal energy systems and ATES on topics ranging from cost key figures, to surge studies to control and optimization. This allowed me to combine my passion for sustainability and water with my affinity for process engineering. I enjoy anything that comprises heat and mass transfers and contributes to solutions in renewable energy. In my work, I appreciate challenges and problem solving. \n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I enjoy working-out, cycling, learning new skills and traveling to more challenging regions in the world. I\u2019m motivated to do developmental work and use my skills to find innovative solutions for the ever-growing energy and fresh water problems. If you\u2019d like to learn more about me, please get in touch.\n",
