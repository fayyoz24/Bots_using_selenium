            "description": "The Top Management Conference in 2010 was the first time that our entire executive population met in China. This TMC was about DSM's new corporate strategy, part of which deals with DSM's ambitions in high-growth economies.  By taking the TMC to China, we not only sent a strong message to our executives, but also gave many of them their first hands-on experience in China.  With only three months notice from the time the city was definitely chosen, the project team had to prepare compelling content and a great experience for 400 executives of DSM in China. Although the meeting content was strongly focused on the new strategy, we ensured that our executives also had lots of time to experience China by taking them on \"field trips\" around Shanghai. In groups of 20-30, the executives traveled to 21 different locations (each group went to one field trip), including visiting the Shanghai harbor, universities and research labs we are partnering with, traditional Chinese medicine workshops, tea markets, cooking schools, environmental education programs in local schools and much more.  One group even travelled to Nanjing and had dinner with the mayor of Nanjing. For the first time, via our corporate television new show DSMTV News, all employees worldwide were able to follow the action with nightly postings of new episodes throughout the week that featured not only what happened at the meeting each day, but also showcased local Chinese customers and employees. Local Chinese employees served as volunteers during the event, and several also hosted dinners at their home, inviting groups of 5 or 6 executives into their homes to enjoy a typical Chinese family dinner.  On the last night of the meeting, we finished on a beautiful rooftop terrace along the Pudong river, with the neon boats and the lights of Shanghai in front of everyone. The meeting was very welll received by both the executives as well as employees, based on surveys and comments that were posted on our DSMTV site.",
