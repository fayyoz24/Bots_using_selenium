The OWee is all about making new friends, finding your place in Delft and most of all starting a study as well prepared as possible. It was a huge challenge to get this done, when the corona crisis overwhelmed the organization. As board of this organisation, we had to adjust our plans all the time. In the end, we completely redesigned the OWee into a program of three digital days and ten physical days, so that 3000 beginning students could kickstart their first year. As Secretary and Head of Participants of the OWee Board, I was responsible for all registrations, programming and communication regarding the participants. In addition, I was in charge of the event signing.",
