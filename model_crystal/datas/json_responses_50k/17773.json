    "summary": "An International Relations undergraduate currently pursuing a Master of Arts degree in Sociology. I possess strong qualitative research and data analysis skills that I have used in my academic and professional careers to study questions of human experience and social configurations. I also have advanced oral and written communication skills that I have leveraged to focus specifically on the sociology of gender. My work experiences include organizing and moderating gender issues-based conferences  at a global scale, along with public speaking through conference participation. I'm seeking to build an extensive publication repertoire in the Sociology of Gender and Race while also contributing my skills to organizations that need informed coordination of gender and race sensitive events, corporate event planning as well as generation of inclusive content. \n\nLeisure Interests: Shotokan Karate (Black Belt 2nd dan) I Bharatanatyam (Indian Classical dance) I Current Affairs and Literature I Songwriting and Music Composition I Cake Decoration",
