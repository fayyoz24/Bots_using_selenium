    "summary": "My name is Saramijn, an enthusiastic and curious history student at Leiden University. I have a wide range of interests, although my primary focus is on social history, including women's and LGBTI+ history. In addition, I like to focus on European politics, about which I not only followed a minor, but for which I also worked in various positions within the European interdisciplinary student forum AEGEE. Within this forum I focused on topics such as Equal Rights, Civic Education and intercultural exchange in a broader sense of the word. I would describe myself as open-minded, creative and inventive, and I like to express these qualities in my work, study and hobbies. I can work independently, but I also have a lot of experience in working in and managing teams.",
