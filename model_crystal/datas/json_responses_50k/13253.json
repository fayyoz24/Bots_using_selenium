    "summary": "Somebody once said to me on hearing that I worked in marketing; \u201cOh, you make people buy things!\u201d  Are you kidding? I can't make anyone do anything.\n\nBesides lacking that particular skill, it seems I have too much of a conscience.  I find myself increasingly doing business with brands & teams that are conscious of their effect on communities and the planet. \n\nIn the past sustainability was the preserve of eco-warriors or governments.  Our planet was on the sidelines, with companies ticking minimal CSR boxes.\n\nThe reality is that it\u2019s time for businesses to respond to consumer needs, and integrate doing better into their business practices and product innovation. Design for the win-win-win.\n\nI bring my understanding of existing business, brand and marketing practices, and then add the new and essential element - sustainability.  The aim is make it feel like a natural part of the ongoing brand narrative and consumer expectations and needs.\n\nHow do we do this I hear you ask?  For me it's always been about what makes people tick.  Understanding the science of marketing, people, and culture to allow us to provide solutions they need.\n\nHaving studied languages and linguistics, I began an ethnography journey, which continued through 25 years of marketing, branding and strategy.  It\u2019s that fascination and experience that helps look for the need behind the behaviour - especially at moments of \u2018crunch time\u2019, when a brand needs to pivot.  \n\nI work with you to look at the various inputs and research that helps us decide \u2018This is interesting.That is useful.That's bullsh*t. Who needs that?!' Stick that & that together to create a marriage of structure, creativity, data and instinct that lets that \u2018human-ness\u2019 comes through. \n\nI also don\u2019t buy over-simplification for the sake of it. I'm all for essentialism - taking the ingredients we actually need to work something out. If that\u2019s seven vs five, then so be it - we don't get to ignore things because it makes it neater. The best businesses are those that solve these inconvenient truths.\n\nSo, I work with honesty and partnership.  Together we select what is working and leave it be, and get to solving what isn\u2019t working. Then we work out what to do when. Contrary to current belief, you don\u2019t have to spin all those plates right now.\n\nThe real work comes by solving actual needs that arise from the business, the consumer and the world we live in.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to integrate brand and sustainability into your business plan, brand foundation and consumer stories, then do connect me on here, or email philjackson@mail.com",
