            "description": "Carri\u00e8re Premi\u00e8re is a platform that connects university BA and MA students with experts in the field of one's interest for a future professional realization. Through the format of a walk-along day, a student is given the chance to experience a day that is hosted by the professional and hereby he/she can form realistic expectations about a desired career path.\n\nThe first year of the project was a pilot conducted in cooperation with the faculty of Geosciences of Utrecht University. The team achieved its goals, due to which the project was continued for a second year by a new team of students from the Young Leaders League.\n\nEvaluations from participants:\n- A student:  \u201cIt is a very strong concept, the best form of career orientation apart from an internship\u201d. \n\n- A professional: \u201cIt was a very nice feeling to be able to help a student prepare himself for his career. The difference between a student\u2019s life and a professional life is so big\u201d.\n",
