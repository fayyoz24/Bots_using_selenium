Arup provided multidisciplinary services to this bridge designed by Benthem Crouwel Architects and executed by Mobilis.\n\nPalace Bridge connects Den Bosch\u2019 historic city center with the Palace Quarter in the south of the city. This new crossing over the railroad tracks creates a fast and social connection, which opens opportunities for further development of the Palace quarter.\n\nArup provided the Program of Requirements, 3D-frame calculations and constructive preliminary design and was responsible for the lighting design, equipment, foundations and optimization of design, construction plan and construction method.\n\n\"The Palace Bridge has become an emotional connection that transcends belief with its primary functionality. The districts are not connected through a simple puncture, but programmatically enriched with an elevated park and recreational area that actually attracts visitors and users. The Palace Bridge fascinates both professionals and local residents. The corten steel has a human scale, enhanced by the tight detailing as is only possible in steel. Technical solutions, such as the heated surface to prevent corrosion increasing road salt, are commendable. Performing the steel truss, which spans 45 meters, above deck creates not just structural expression, but also a logical divide between the different traffic flows. A winner par excellence\".\n\n\u2014The National Steel Award jury\n\nThe National Steel Award was founded in 1971. The Dutch Building with Steel foundation recognizes projects with this award bi-annually. The nominees for 2016\u2019s election were projects that were delivered and/or opened in 2014 and 2015.",
