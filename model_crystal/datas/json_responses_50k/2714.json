    "summary": "As a Principal at Fenix Leadership, I partner with high-end private equity and venture capital firms and family offices in Europe to optimise human capital processes and create value and growth for their portfolio companies. I leverage my expertise in leadership development, team effectiveness, and organisational design to enhance the performance and alignment of the management teams.\n\n13 years ago a big realisation moment happened. I realised that everyone I know, including myself, is going to pass away one day. From that moment I started asking myself - what do I want to do with this time that I am alive? These life questions brought me to become a practising Buddhist for 4 years and learn from various life philosophies. The process of gaining more self-knowledge and awareness of my relationship to life, was a tremendous gift. It introduced joy, peace, direction, and clarity into my life. \n\nI am passionate about facilitating individuals, teams, and organisations in expanding their awareness and building flourishing organisations. With a background in engineering & technology entrepreneurship, I have co-founded and led multiple companies and initiatives that aim to connect, empower, and inspire people.\n\nI am the son of Ilonka (entrepreneur & investor) and Jaap (writer). I grew up in Netherlands, Hungary, and England. \n\nCheck out our company website- https://www.fenixleadership.com\n\nAnd my personal website - https://zeegerscholten.com/",
