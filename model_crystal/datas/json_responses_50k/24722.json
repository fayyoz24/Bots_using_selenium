I present data to the design engineers for device improvement. I also maintain cohesive test software to characterize hardware subsystems. I work to streamline characterization efforts as the team moves between different devices. And I work with an international team to debug any issues with the device or GUI. I also work with Spotfire to create data analytic programs, which help identify potential outliers that could be issues. I also work with test equipment not currently incorporated into our test automation system to determine the best way to on-board the technology to make for an easy transition to characterizing the device with this new technology.",

Once the customer chose the sensing technology they felt fit best, I worked with the applications and marketing team to get the customer help with the new sensing technology. I learned how to build a power tree and created one for a customer. I also worked on independent study projects.  I built a interrupt dependent I2C interface MSP430FR4133 with CCS.

I also helped to create a validation plan for the upcoming fixture. Working with a reliability engineer, driver engineer, and design engineer, I came up with the plan I thought best for validating the fixture in all potential outdoor conditions.",

It still requires a person to run the inspection, but all data they find will be recorded for further use. Working on this project taught me about Visual Basic in Excel and how to work on a manufacturing team. I also created a user interface for the manufacturing team that allowed them to break down their data more comprehensively.",

I presented this research at the IEEE Nanotechnology Material and Devices Conference 2012. I also learned to program with Mathematica to create code that could create a cubic crystal lattice structure. The program allowed for the lengths of the sides and the angles between the sides of the structure to by manipulated. Once the user created the structure he or she wanted, the program would find the area of specific planes within the structure.",
