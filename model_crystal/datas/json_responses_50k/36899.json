    "summary": "If I were asked to choose one trait that best describes me as a person, it would be my strong passion for and genuine interest in people. Whether it\u2019s at work or in life, my focus is on being the best I can be and helping others do the same, as only then, and with confidence, comes the power to achieve full potential.\n\nMy personal strength lies in connection \u2013 bringing people together by facilitating dialogue and creating a common understanding. By doing so, I am able to bring about change and deliver tangible business results. I am not afraid to take on new challenges and more often than not I find myself being a driving force to success. \n\nI consider myself a strong advocate of diversity and inclusion. I believe that inclusive societies not only benefit individuals, but enable companies and economies to flourish. That\u2019s why I am committed to being an active leader in Shell\u2019s LGBTQ+ network, ensuring that LGBTQ+ staff are accepted, valued and given equal opportunities to develop.\n\nI also have an unquenchable thirst for learning, in any form or shape: be it books, people, or travels. After growing up in Mexico, I moved to the Netherlands in 2007, and over the years I have gained broad international experience through work and study placements in several countries. Through my work with Street Child and the visits to Sierra Leone and Nepal, I have been able to witness true responsible leadership first hand, supporting thousands of children off the streets, back to their families and to school.",

When becoming members to UEBT, companies must adhere to a series of membership obligations, including the continuous reporting on a series of biodiversity indicators. These indicators provide both UEBT and member companies with insight into the scope of the application of the UEBT standard, as well as the potential impact on biodiversity.\r\n\r\nBased on this research, the team identified several ways in which the indicators developed by UEBT can be integrated with the internal reporting practices and systems used by member companies, while keeping the administrative burden to a minimum. In addition, the team provided practical recommendations to UEBT on how to create a system of indicators which is practical and easy to use, in order to facilitate companies in consistently adhering to UEBT standards and at the same time support their own operations and decision-making processes.",

            "description": "As chairman of Shell\u2019s LGBTQ+ employee resource group (ERG) in the Netherlands, I was responsible for leading a diverse team of 5-10 volunteers. Having developed a new strategy, our network\u2019s objectives focused on: 1) providing support and development opportunities for LGBTQ+ employees, 2) raising awareness of LGBT+ issues in the workplace and providing advise to HR and senior management on how to address these, 3) representing Shell externally as an equal opportunity employer, and 4) contributing positively to the LGBTQ+ communities in the locations we operate.\n\nDuring my tenure as lead of the network, our membership base grew from 250 to more than 1200 members, including more than 800 allies after the successful introduction of the Ally programme in 2016. We secured the support from various senior leaders in Shell, including our CFO Jessica Uhl who became global executive sponsor of the LGBTQ+ networks. As part of our internal and external awareness campaigns, my team carried out various initiatives such as the lighting of our Amsterdam offices in rainbow colours, the painting of the rainbow flag on the storage tank at Pernis refinery, a global social media campaign in 2017 for Coming Out Day, and an award-winning campaign in which we transformed four of our Retail stations around Amsterdam for Pride in 2018, a first for our industry."
