    "summary": "Since I was born I was fortunate enough to have lived in multiple places: Dubai, The Netherlands, Miami Beach, St Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my and Budapest. During my time in high school I developed a passion for hospitality, which is why I decided to study at Hotelschool The Hague, where I obtained a diploma in Bachelor Business Administration in Hotel Management.\n\nDuring my studies I was part of an international community with students from over 50 nationalities, which is why I am familiar with working in an international environment. Here I learned about the basics of hospitality and I applied my knowledge strategically during several case studies. In addition, I participated in an intensive leadership training program in the Ardennes in Belgium, where I experienced/experimented with different management styles and approaches. This experience prepared me to work in a leadership role, managing several teams in the school's facilities. \n\nTo prepare for a career as a hospitality professional, I had several (part-time) jobs which were mostly hospitality-related. During my studies I did two internships, where I gained a lot of knowledge and experience, but more importantly had a lot of fun. I developed my communication skills: English, French and Hungarian, and also other soft skills. Moreover, I was challenged to provide Hotel Christopher and the Budapest Marriott hotel with advices on how to improve certain business processes. I improved my time management, used data analysis to come up with management recommendations and contributed to improving customer satisfaction.\n\nAt one point I felt that I needed to chase my dream of obtaining a Master's degree. And so I did: I can proudly say that I graduated with distinction and obtained my Master's degree in Human Resource Management at the International Business School in Budapest. Finally I was awarded by The University of Buckingham as \u201cthe Best Graduating Student in 2018 of a Master\u2019s Program\u201d.",
