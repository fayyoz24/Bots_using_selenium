    "summary": "'Health for all' is one of my biggest dreams.  I dream of living in a world where everyone has access to good quality healthcare and at an affordable price. Furthermore, I wish that Health becomes a matter for all governments, civil society, and communities. We all over the world, working in solidarity to improve healthcare for everybody. That is the reason why I have always been passionate about medicine since childhood.  I was learning hard natural sciences during my high school years. Moreover, this passion motivated me to work hard to enroll in medical studies. That is how I came to be selected for the military medical school in Senegal.  Since then, my Health for all journey started. \nAfter graduation, I worked in several positions as a clinical medical doctor. I loved my job because I took care of the people who came to my office to seek Health.  There is nothing comparable to the feeling of having treated a patient successfully and seeing him smiling again. Then, I was working hard to deserve this smile and be a brilliant doctor. Becoming an excellent doctor drives me to enroll in a specialization in infectious diseases, given that I was working in developing settings where these diseases were prevalent. Moreover, infectious diseases contribute considerably to the global burden of diseases.  \nHowever, after ten years of clinical practice experience, I realized that Public/Global  Health is unavoidable in solving communities' health problems, as illustrated with this quote, 'Prevent is better than to cure.' This is one reason I enrolled in a Master's in Global Health in the Netherlands. So far, I have worked in developing settings and managed diseases vertically or horizontally. However, after starting this master's, I widened my view on health problems and realized that they might be better tackled holistically by using more integrated approaches. \nAlthough I always worked with many stakeholders and managed teams during my clinical practice, this was in a medical professional environment. Working in a global health environment allows me to collaborate with other stakeholders playing a crucial role in Health. I can act now in the curative and preventive aspect of health and tackle complex issues leading to health inequality such as finances, environment, politics, culture, religion, and gender. I am now happy doing this because I can bring different parties of a complex problem together in a research project, manage and lead an excellent collaboration to achieve 'Health for all.'  ",
