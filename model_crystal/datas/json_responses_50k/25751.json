    "summary": "\ud83d\udd35 Founder of Competa IT - nurturing the careers of ICT professionals since 1997\n\ud83d\udd34 Agile practitioner - active in academic research and Agile ICT4D initiatives\n\nCompeta IT was founded in 1997 as a spin-off from Shell Research where I worked as a Systems Architect. Early in my career I had been lucky enough to work for a few superb managers who gave me the opportunity to develop my interest in IT and advance my career. While working at Shell I realised that the companies who need ICT resources, and the companies with the most interesting IT projects, are often not the best at managing IT careers. Competa IT seeks to balance the two sides of the equation. We match client's demand for ICT resources by provided access to motivated and trained ICT professionals. We grow the skills and careers of talented ICT professionals by giving them access to the most interesting projects in the market.  For more than a quarter of a century colleagues at Competa IT have helped top brands including government, financial, engineering, and retail giants deliver great software and leading IT projects.\n\n\u26ab  Contact is welcome, but *please* not from recruitment consultants or pension advisors.",

African developers got access to mentors and an insight into how the software industry works in Europe. This gave them a head start in finding a job and accelerated their career growth in Kenya.\n\nIn 2020 CodePamoja transferred to our Kenyan partner DewCIS.",
