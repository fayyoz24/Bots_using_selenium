    "summary": "I\u2019m passionate about companies that try to make this world a better place and I love building organizations. During the last 18 years I have combined both in various roles as COO, Managing Director, Chief People & Culture and Strategic Advisor in small and medium sized companies. My job responsibilities are broad and include everything from (daily) operations and organizational development, to strategy and people and culture. Working in a start- and scale-up environment requires a strategic vision and a hands-on mentality, two things I luckily possess. I am used to working in international environments and speak Dutch, English and French fluently.",
