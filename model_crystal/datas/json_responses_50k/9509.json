    "summary": "Raphael Rodan is an award-winning theatre maker and storyteller. His training as an artist lasted over 10 years. Apart from the regular drama school, he had private lessons with the Israeli theatre master Hillel Neeman, and an extensive immersion in the Meisner technique for acting at the Actors Temple in London. Since he had moved to Amsterdam he had created a few hit storytelling shows like: \u201cWhen Abel met Cain\u201d about the duality of man,\u201cThe kingdom of Fire and Clay\u201d about the connections between Iran and Israel, and the winner of Amsterdam fringe 2017 \u201cMy Father Held a Gun\u201d, about the nature of war. His work has received international recognition, playing in theatres and festivals all over Europe, including a prestige run at the National theatre in Brussels. His latest shows were funded by the AFK, the Amsterdam Funds for the Art. \n\nApart from writing and performing Raphael also teaches storytelling, In 2014 together with Farnoosh Farnia and Sahand Sahebdivani, he created The Mezrab Storytelling School. In no doubt one of Europe's most dominant schools, working both with ancient and personal stories and examining the connection between them. The school is using unique and original techniques developed by its team. Apart from that he teaches regularly in the ATD, Amsterdam\u2019s theatre school. \nSince 2018, together with Sahebdivani, he has been working as the Artistic Director of the Amsterdam Storytelling Festival. The vision of the festival is to link the ancient art of storytelling with today\u2019s most current burning questions.",
