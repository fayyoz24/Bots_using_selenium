Today Klarna is one of the biggest banks in Europe and offer payment solutions to 60 million customers, for 100.000 stores in 14 countries. \n\nDuring my time at Klarna I worked at the Merchant support where I was the first contact for the stores using the Klarna payment solution.

My tasks mainly included social support to these children. During the day the children went to a public school and in this time the orphanage instead worked as a school for other younger children, age 3 to 6 years, from very poor families in the surroundings. I worked as English teacher to these children during the week days. The volunteer work was organized by Aid India (via Volont\u00e4rresor AB) and I was very impressed by the engagement the founder of the orphanage showed towards the children. He truly succeeded with making them feel loved and belonging. This was an amazing experience."
