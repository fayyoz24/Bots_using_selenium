The Master's Thesis is in the Non-Destructive Testing in Production department. I had multiple tasks:\n\n- Non-Destructive Testing on Metals and Composites with Ultrasonic Testing: detection of volume defects and porosities\n- Development of a new method of analysis with ultrasounds: TFM (Total focusing method)\n- Study of the microstructure of additive manufactured Titanium\n- Study of defects formation in Titanium made with Additive Manufacturing (Arc welding and Cold Metal Transfer)\n- Correlation between the manufacturing data of current and voltage with Python with the defect formation in order to detect earlier defects during the process. This will allow cost reductions and time savings\n- Study of the influence of the heat treatment on the mechanical properties of the Titanium\n- Image analysis through Python and MATLAB to increase image quality\n\nDuring this internship, I am as well responsible of the partnership between Airbus and the EEIGM. This include different taks:\n- Team management with the 7 interns\n- Recruitment of the future interns\n- Proposals for improvements of the partnership",
