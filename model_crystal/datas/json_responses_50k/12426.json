    "summary": "I am an ambitious student who is always looking for opportunities to improve herself and push herself out of her comfort zone. I am a dependable team player with communication and organization skills who has a track record of being reliable, efficient and able to handle multiple projects or tasks at once. I have built this track record through my extra-curriculars such as co-leading the Student Council in highschool, being Secretary General of the European Law Students' Association (ELSA) Groningen and participating in the 30th Willem C. Vis International Commercial Moot Court Competition (Vis Moot). \n\nAt ELSA Groningen I was able to improve upon my leadership and problem-solving skills and was able to experience what it was like to work remotely in a team while I was away on exchange. Among other administrative tasks, I took on the responsibility of drafting documents such as contracts with our note-writers, our online store's Terms and Conditions, and the Internal Regulations of our association. Prior to that experience I was also an academic tutor and note-writer for NEXUS, a student association affiliated with the University of Groningen. Recently, I participated in the Vis Moot, where I have learned how to write a persuasive memorandum and greatly improved my oral advocacy skills, while developing a passion for commercial law and arbitration.",

I was assigned the role of 'scribe', being in charge of taking minutes at each meeting and keeping the team accountable to the tasks set in those meetings.",

The Company is constantly developing their products with the aim of helping legal teams adapt to the advancement of AI technology. ClauseBase is their powerful legal drafting suite comprising of six different tools operating at different levels and paradigms and is accessible in different software enrivonments. ClauseBuddy is a plugin where users are able to built clause libraries with the aim of being able to easily automate contracts using these libraries. The plugin is equipped with an AI drafting function which gives clause suggestions according to the user's prompt. \nAt ClauseBase, my main task was to create a clause library for a variety of M&A agreements. This process included conducting keyword research on the most searched M&A clauses and agreements, building a folder structure based on this research and collecting clauses from various documents in a library using ClauseBuddy. \n\nAs a result of this internship I primarily:\n\n- created multiple clause libraries across a range of commercial and corporate contracts with a total of 900 clauses using ClauseBase's contract drafting software ClauseBuddy;\n- produced a research report on the legal nuances of drafting a material adverse effect clause, with a sample size of 100 clauses;\n- drafted articles on the influences of GPT on legal drafting, which were published on the ClauseBase Blog.",

Our team placed 2nd runner up at the pre-moot hosted by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In the official rounds from the 31st of March to 5th of April, I was an oralist representing Maastricht University. I spoke on the merits of the dispute, arguing on the applicability of the CISG to drones pursuant to Article 2(e) and the CISG's application to issues of fraudulent misrepresentation pursuant to Articles 4(a) and 35. Our team placed 27th out of 370 teams in the General Rounds, advancing to the elimination round of Top 64. As an individual oralist I scored in the top 20th percentile.",
