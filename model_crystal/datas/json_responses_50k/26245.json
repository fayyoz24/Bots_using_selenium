Our task was to handle a large influx of volunteers contacting the charity following their viral media campaign. We developed an app to handle processing and selection of volunteers and an algorithm for matching volunteers with elderly citizens who are seeking to combat their loneliness through a regular interaction over the phone. The app protects privacy of the volunteer and the elderly person by matching them based on sufficient distance between their addresses and re-routing the calls through a third party, thereby hiding their phone numbers from each other.  My main input for this project was assessing the feasibility of solutions via statistical means and figuring out how the different modules in our code will fit together. I presented our project in front of an audience of 300+ people comprised of investors, charity representatives and competing teams.",

The\nfield, Q_p, can be obtained, for each prime p, by completing the\nrationals with respect to a non-archimedean metric induced by the so\ncalled p-adic norm. Under this metric, the distance of two rationals\nis p^(-n), where n is the highest power of p that divides the\nnumerator of their difference. In this talk, we review the\nconstruction of Q_p, its arithmetic and note that certain operations\ncan be performed more easily than in the Real number system. Next, we\ncover unramified extensions of Q_p and demonstrate their\nimplementation in a Python based language called Sage. We conclude by\ndiscussing some technical detail of the native parent-element\nframework for introducing new algebraic structures to Sage.",
