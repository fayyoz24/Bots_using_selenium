Definitions from all DSMs are described, and the motivations behind the changes between DSMs are considered, alongside arguments from a collection of philosophers. The conclusion is that the components \u2018Spectrum\u2019 and \u2018Disorder\u2019 in \u2018ASD\u2019 risk inciting stigmatisation and suggest a more uniform expression than autism actually has. Thus, an alternative definition must be found. ",

The aim of the project is to help children with a Dutch language delay to improve and to encourage a love for books and reading in them.\n\nIn my first year I worked with a 3.5-year-old bilingual girl and in my second year a 4-year-old boy. Both had had large Dutch language delays and little to no interest in books when we started. I would visit them weekly, read books to them, and play language games with them. When we finished the project, both had made valuable progress in the Dutch language and developed a larger interest in and enjoyment of books."
