    "summary": "Devoted young architect with a persistent motivation to use his research and design skills to change the living environment of people for the better. Design projects with a strong focus on the scale level that is at the interface between architectural and urban design have my special interest. Currently I am mostly working within Dutch contexts on these scale levels at KCAP in Rotterdam.\nI have notable field experience within the international urban development practice in Venezuela (Car\u00e1cas) and Colombia (Medell\u00edn). With regards to these contexts I am especially interested in slum upgrading projects and urban strategies aiming at inclusive cities. Next to that my focus lays on projects that ask for a strong focus on (urban historical) research and a multidisciplinary approach. Next to the mentioned Latin American cases I worked for instance on research with regards to public markets in Zambia with Cityf\u00f6rster Rotterdam. Furthermore I worked on projects in different European countries, from the France (Marseille), to Switzerland (Montana) and Spain (Alicante with Marc Koehler Architects and Architecten Cie.).  ",

The students envisioned a cinema which could also serve as a cultural hub, with space for art, music, debate and social gathering in their capital city. We provided them with a concept design that enable them to see this dreaming coming true and become materialized. Taking in account the local building techniques, cultural expressions and the context brought us exciting challenge. We poured all this inspiration into an elemental, minimalistic and at the same time expressive building design that is ready for the future. \n\nAlso see: https://www.ewbnl.org/ewb-netherlands-liberia-art-house-theater/"
