    "summary": "After working for almost three decennia in the world of television, I have shifted my activities to the broader cultural world. It already moved that direction in 2009 when I co-founded Comedyhuis (Utrecht-based comedy-collective, responsible for the yearly Utrecht International Comedy Festival), but since early 2019 my fulltime focus is the cultural branche: theatre and other stage venues are now my territory. With an immense network of artists and agencies, I can book the most interesting shows, therefore compiling adventurous line-ups on a variety of venues. So don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you need help to fill the performance calendar of your theatre, music venue or otherwise.\nPS: Besides booking acts and shows for your venue, I\u2019m also experienced in developing stage productions and events that will lift your cultural organization to the next level. Plus making connections with third (local) parties to establish productive collaborations and to mobilize new audiences.",
