    "summary": "I am a Software Engineering Manager with broad range of experience in E2E systems integrations, software development and delivery of large programs. \n\nHaving 15 years of experience in Technology, I can see how better to foster a collaborative engagement among key stakeholders to ensure the success of the company goals and initiatives.  With my passion for user-centered design, education, psychology, and well-being, I help individuals and teams to reflect, learn and adapt.\n\nIn my current role, I lead a large multidisciplinary group to deliver B2C and B2B web services at Sunrise-UPC / Liberty Global. Prior to this, I led startup tech ventures of ETH Zurich and National University of Radio Electronics (NURE) research labs which led to co-authoring 4 research papers.  In addition, I was an invited speaker at universities.\n\nMy  drive  is  to  create  an  environment  where  autonomy,  mastery,  and  the  sense  of  a  purpose  enhances  the  teams motivation, creativity, and efficiency.",
