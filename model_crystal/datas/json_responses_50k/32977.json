    "summary": "I really enjoy being active within associations such as my sports associations or my study association. In recent years I have been active in several committees and boards where I have learned a lot about working in teams. I always try to look at issues from a different angle and try to motivate people to substantiate their choices. I also really enjoy trying to reach a good compromise in discussions.\nIn computer science I am very interested in data sciences and artificial intelligence in particular.\nIn my spare time I'm an active athlete and I also enjoy riding my motorbike through the country.
