    "summary": "Greetings,\n\nMy mission is to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world, while also creating tools and experiences that bring joy and happiness.\n\nLike many, my fascination with programming began as a childhood hobby. Starting with simple games and websites, I was immediately drawn to the combination of problem-solving and technology.\n\nNow, years later, I am still coding.\nAnd I still love it.\n\nAs a passionate problem-solver and inspirational team player, I'm dedicated to using the latest technology to improve people's lives. My strong focus on maintainability and quality helps me create robust solutions for the world's ever-evolving needs. Although my background covers a wide range of areas, I have honed my skills in Python and Rust to become highly proficient in these languages.\n\nIn my spare time, I am passionate about exploring the world and immersing myself in different cultures. I have lived in both Sweden and Japan, which has given me unique perspectives and experiences. So far, I have travelled to over 25 countries and plan to visit many more. Exploring new places and meeting new people helps me to broaden my horizons and inspires me to approach challenges from different angles.\n\nThank you for reading my story. Take care!",
