    "summary": "On leaving Europol in spring 2012 I ended 30 years of formal employment in the British Army, the British Police, the UN and the EU. Considering myself too young to retire, I embarked upon a second career as a self-employed consultant.\n\nDuring my working life the world has changed dramatically and so has international cooperation in law enforcement. There have been enormous changes in intelligence-led law enforcement, especially in emerging and post-conflict states. I have witnessed all these changes. Many of them affected my daily work. Some of them created real challenges. A few of them I even directly shaped myself.\n\nIn parallel, in emerging from conflict, many of these same States have to call to account those responsible for serious human rights and criminal violations committed during that time. My previous military experience, and my more recent human rights education thus provide the complement by which my law-enforcement experience becomes applicable in this field as well.\n\nThis experience, and the skills & knowledge I gained from it, is the stock with which I now trade; I am always seeking new work opportunities where I can bring this stock to market, including through my Linked-In network. \n\nMy aim is to have satisfied clients who return with future business, and who refer me on to their own contacts.",
