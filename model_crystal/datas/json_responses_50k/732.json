I love reading books \ud83d\udcda about business, entrepreneurship, and management. \n\nVery passionate about: Finance\ud83d\udcb8, Automotive\ud83c\udfce, and food\ud83e\udd58 . Three industries which may seem completely different, but which are all undergoing massive changes. This wave of innovations and new ideas, which are flowing into these fields, really are what attracts me. Personally, in fact, I am always on the outlook\ud83d\udd0e of new and creative ideas, which may come from the combination of different, and apparently unrelated, subjects. \n\nAlways open to suggestions for books or to have a conversation in all the aforementioned areas, so in case you have a good book or would like to talk, feel free to DM me! \n\n\n| Management | Consultancy | Finance | FinTech | Business Developer | Business Analyst | Financial | Innovation | Idea | Design Thinking | Manager | Starter | Junior | Analyst | Implementation | Strategy | Organization | Consultant",
