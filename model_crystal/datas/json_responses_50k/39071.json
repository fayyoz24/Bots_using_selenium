Founded by TU Delft students in 2009, RiskID has grown steadily establishing a strong customer base in the Netherlands and is expanding soon to UK and Germany.\n\nAs part of the Master in Management course at RSM, we worked as consultants for RiskID to develop a strategy for its expansion to the United States. The project included detailed internal analyses of RiskID followed by extensive research and analysis on the risk management software industry in the US. The result was a comrehensive market entry strategy for RiskID including selection of the entry mode and distribution, marketing and pricing strategies. We also advised RiskID regarding the competencies and resources it should develop in order to succeed in the highly competitive US market. Guidance on the practical steps to be taken to establish a firm in the US was also provided.",
