    "summary": "I am an International Business Leader with 17+ years of experience, including P&L responsibility since 2013. I thrive when optimizing businesses for the company's Ebitda - not just for the department\u2019s KPIs - across departments and cultures. I achieve my goals by combining mind & heart, data & empathy. This leads to engaged and diverse teams which are very motivated to deliver on transformational strategies.\n\nI have sound experience in key disciplines (Sales, Operations, Product Management, Innovation) as well as in the Global HQ (7+ years) & Country roles (8+ years \u2013 US, NA, Nordics, EMEA) dynamics at Philips and Bugaboo. I'm a strong Consumer Goods professional with a Master of Science focused in Industrial Engineering and Management from the University of Twente. \n\nI have a strong track record of success in adopting new knowledge, whether it's new disciplines (From Product Management to Sales to Operations, a.o.), market conditions or cultures (From Dutch to very feminine Nordics to very masculine US).\n \nMy cross-functional and intercultural experience has set me up for GM and MD type of roles in scale-ups or mid-size international businesses.",
