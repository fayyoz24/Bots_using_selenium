While participating as a researcher within two contrasting projects and shadowing the conduct of the initiatives, the necessary insights were collected in order to conceptualize the concept of diversity. The approaches bred different types of collected data, thereby consolidating diverting strategies through which to create an inclusive environment. More specifically, by contrasting two case studies and positioning itself in-between the tension of divergent methodologies, this research explored how the method of approaching diversity can influence the representation of diversity. This therefore also influenced the insights that constituted the outcome of the strategy taken. Altogether, this research reflects upon the enabling and constraining effects of approaching diversity in that respective manner.",

This was not only dependent upon the countries\u2019 local political and social environment, but also on the refugees themselves and other stakeholders (e.g. companies, civil society). It quickly became our goal to cover all angles of this aim and constitute a critical and utilizable advise as to how to realize this.\n\n I was very enthusiastic about my role as designer. This mainly sprung from the fact that I was attracted to the individual freedoms and space for creativity of this task. Apart from conducting all design-related efforts for the group, my  other biggest efforts constituted the PESTL- and case study analyses. This also allowed space for deepening my knowledge into the refugee situation in Sweden and France, while working intensively together as a team to reach fine results.\n\nAltogether, this project enhanced my teamwork competencies, design skills, consultancy skills and expanded my research and academic analytical skills/critical thinking.",

I chose to create a strategy plan for the company.\n   (The following goals were central:\n                        * Increasing the reach of the organisation to groups that are currently not engaging in its \n                         activities, and implementing those strategies\n                        * Suggesting new manners in which the organisation could generate more involvement of \n                         its current members and of the international students)",
