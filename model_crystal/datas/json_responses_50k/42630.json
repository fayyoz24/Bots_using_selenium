    "summary": "I currently work on the Single Cell team at the Metabolomics and Analytics Center within Leiden University, under the supervision of Dr. Ahmed Ali. We are exploring both the mass spectrometry tech development and the biological benefits of single cell metabolomics. \n\nI earned my Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering.  I worked on developing an ultra sensitive protein quantification assay under the guidance of Dr. Abhinav Bhushan in the Microfluidics lab while completing my course work.\n\nPrior to attending graduate school, I earned a Bachelor of Scinece in Materials Science and Engineering and began working as a metallurgist at Finkl Steel. While at Finkl Steel I worked with both the Heat Treatment department as well as the Melt Shop to identify areas of improvement in the process and product.  I helped the teams keep track of quality indicators and hit goals each month.  At the same time, I worked on failure analysis, submitting reports both internally, and externally to customers. \n\nWhile working full time, I had the opportunity to work with one of my professors from IIT and co-instruct a project based class.  While doing this for several semesters, I realized this ignites much more passion, and decided to begin my graduate studies, which ultimately started a redirection in my career path.",

Within this project, the team was developing an integrated system, allowing people with disabilities to open doors remotely. PathPass consists of a Door Opening Mechanism, installed on the door frame, which provides the necessary power to open the door, and the Portable Devices, which are operated by the disabled individuals. There are two kinds of portable devices according to the user's needs and/or preferences, the one is a smartphone application and the other is a pressure pad device, which is attached on the disabled user's cane, wheelchair or crutches. These Portable Devices generate wireless signals which transmit to the receiver of the Door Opening Mechanism. \n\nIn the PathPass project, I had the position of the project manager. Apart from this, I was a member of the team which was developing the pressure pad device. More specifically, my duties included the project management of the team, the research and development coordination, keeping the deliverables within deadlines and within the pressure pad team, the initial research of patents, regulations and similar products, the conceptual design and finally the design of the assembled mechanism.\n\nThe official name of this project is IPRO 497/351, which occurred during the Spring 2014 semester and its coordinator was professor Kevin P. Meade.",
