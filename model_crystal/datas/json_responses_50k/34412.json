    "summary": "Gert D. Buitenhuis was born at Zeist on September 5th 1943 and grew up in a family where music was part of the daily walk of life. His grandfather as well as his parents played in a local band which became the surrounding where Gert, at an early age, took the first steps on a path through music.\n\nHe studied at the Academies of Music at Utrecht - piano and clarinet, and Tilburg - conductor. His teachers were, a.o. Herman Strategier and Rocus van Yperen.\n\nIn the early sixties Gert Buitenhuis joined the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy. For twenty years he was the solo clarinettist and concert master. Later he became producer/arranger in which capacity he prepared several performances of the Band for Radio and Television.\n\nHe joined the Band during performances abroad and also on the occasion of official State visits of both Her Majesties Queen Juliana and Queen Beatrix.\n\nIn April 1986 Gert Buitenhuis was appointed Principal Director of Music of the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy.
