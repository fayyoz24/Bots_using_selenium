Heavily involved in (Pre-)Sales activities and the growth of our organization. Working together with IFS (www.ifsworld.com) as platinum partner, also involved in joint (pre-)sales activities for large accounts. Member of the Eqeep Group management team. Hands on involved in implementation projects as senior (business) consultant as well as application specialist / solution architect.\n\nIn this job I introduced a new way of demonstrating the IFS Field Service Management Solution from a pre-sales perspective. This was noticed by IFS that included me a lot in their FSM sales cycles as senior pre-sales expert. \n\nBig part of our offering was also Cloud related. IFS offered Azure cloud, but we made it possible to select different cloud options and strategies, allowing our client to choose either public or private cloud using AWS or Azure. We partnered with Arvato Systems (Bertelsmann Group) including Managed Services. This was received very well, and this lead to the fact that IFS started working more closely together with Arvato as well.",
