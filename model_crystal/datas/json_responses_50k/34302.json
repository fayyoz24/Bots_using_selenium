Prof. Dr. P.W.P.J. Grefen, a specialist in information systems and currently a board member of the European Supply Chain Forum, was the main supporting professor.\nThroughout the week, the teams  worked on a case-study provided by Portbase, a Dutch company specialised in logistics\u2019 information for the Dutch seaports. One of these is the Rotterdam harbour, the largest seaport in Europe, which was visited during  one of the final days of the event to see how everything works in reality. ",
