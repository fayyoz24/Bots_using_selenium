From scratch we build a new Sitecore 9.0 (and later upgraded to  9.1) SXA platform currently hosting 55 websites build on the Framework which was designed during our other projects.\n\nDuring this project (or actually a longterm devops team) we've build several solutions for our customer all based to collect leads. \n\n - A connection to an external API that fetches the cars and private lease prices where customers can select a car and request a price indication (www.autoabonnement.nl/aanbod). \n - Another connection to a HR system containing vacancies (jobs.vwpfs.nl) \n - And one of the last features is an external party that pushes occasions into our platform which we have to process and show on our website. The biggest challenge here was the performance. Using a Queue, Azure Functions, Azure storage and a CDN we managed to build a high performance processing mechanism, offloaded from the Sitecore platform so that we have an optimal use of the resources (https://www.xllease.nl/zakelijke-lease/financial-lease/aanbod).",

The reason this takes that long is because the application runs in the context of SharePoint so every deployment requires a SharePoint deploy as well. \n\nThe main task in this project will be detaching the application from the SharePoint context and just use the web services (lists.asmx) for fetching content. With this change, a new version will not require a SharePoint deployment and the application can be deployed just using relatively simple copy scripting.\n\nNext to detaching from SharePoint, the SharePoint infrastructure will also be renewed so it will be easier for content-editors to manage the content and next to that less SharePoint installations will be required.\n",
