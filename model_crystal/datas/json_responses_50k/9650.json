    "summary": "Design should make a difference in this world. I believe designers should take ownership in every phase of building a product. With a background in visual communications, I developed a critical perspective and a passion for aesthetics, I complement that with diverse experience in research and strategy, and a technical mindset. My experience includes a deep understanding of CX, leading complex unification projects from research and concept to delivery, and designing an end-to-end femtech fertility check experience. With strong opinions loosely held, I appreciate being challenged by my colleagues. I am most fulfilled when part of a multidisciplinary team and my creativity is typically triggered when interacting with users, the main source of my inspiration.",
