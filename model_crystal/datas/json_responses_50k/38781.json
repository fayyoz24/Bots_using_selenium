            "description": "Urban living labs have become a popular phenomenon in today\u2019s cities. The Living Lab approach would provide real life research with its multiple stakeholders in a co-innovating inclusive setting, crucial in creating metropolitan solutions with impact, that will be adopted smoothly and swiftly by all involved, and thus help achieve prosperous living environments that are more liveable, sustainable, resilient and just. But what exactly are urban living labs? That often remains unclear. For this reason, Kris was charged by AMS institute to conduct research and develop a methodology to facilitate systematic achievement of the living lab goals and ambitions in practice.  \nBased on extensive theoretical research, a quick scan of 90 sustainable urban innovation projects in Amsterdam and in-depth case studies of the innovation- and replication processes of nine urban innovation projects in Amsterdam, the defining characteristics and methodological components of urban living labs have been identified, along with conditions, general recommendations and tips associated with the successful implementation of these features. These are synthesised in a final 'Living Lab Way of Working, that can guide actors in what to think about in which stage of the process, while offering advice on elementary questions such as for example how to set up a project, how to formalise the made agreements, how to achieve inspiring co-creation sessions and how to manage an innovation collectively through a suitable legal organisational form. Finally, recommendations are made to ensure that the evaluation, refinement and dissemination activities in the living lab are conducted with success, to allow an overarching learning mechanism in the larger urban innovation system, realising the full potential of living labs.

            "description": "In recent years the concept of mixed-use has emerged as a popular planning tool for urban planners to develop sustainable urban areas. In practice however, we see that the physical interpretation of the concept of mixed-use and the urban area development process employed for mixed-use areas varies greatly from project to project, with the effect that many (re)developed urban areas are not achieving the full sustainability potential of mixed-use development. In this project, Kris focused on determining the product (urban form) and process (development approach)- features that achieve the most sustainable long-term end-user behaviour in the area. By synthesizing the existing, dispersed knowledge on sustainable urbanism and urban area development and by studying two development approaches in running urban area development projects in practice, a cohesive framework of aligned recommendations on urban form and development approach has been made, that can serve as a guideline for designing sustainabile mixed-use urban areas by using it during the development process to oversee the impact on urban sustainability of proposed interventions and guard sustainable decision-making. For her important research findings and well extremely executed practical and theoretical research Kris received the graduation results of a 9/10 and a 10/10, with which she finished her master studies in Management in the Built Environment Cum Laude. \n",

The large-scale mixed-use redevelopment of the area was put on hold due to the 2008  financial crisis. In the absence of large investments, private development, research, culture, and innovation were actively encouraged as a bottom-up experiment. In the aftermath of the development of sustainable self-build homes (private commissioning) and the circular creative workplace De Ceuvel in the area, the ambition for a \u201ccircular\u201d Buiksloterham expressed, because awareness grew that in order to deliver truly sustainable solutions, more integration, more relaxed regulations, and a mandate for sustainable intervention and experimentation in the area were necessary. In March 2015, more than 20 partners \u2013 including the municipality, knowledge institutes, housing corporations, companies, and residents \u2013 signed the manifesto to endorse this ambition, making Buiksloterham officially a living lab for circular development. In 2015, Kris joined the municipal project team of Buiksloterham to work on the very complex development of this area for half a year. \n\n",

High-rise development is planned to the rear of the A\u2019DAM Tower, the elongated section known as the Strip. It will offer elegant towers with business accommodation, apartments and a hotel. Squares, shops and other public functions in the ground-floor plinths of the towers will ensure a metropolitan bustle of activity at street level, as well as attractive vistas through to the Oeverpark\u2019s waterside greenery and the IJ waterway itself.
