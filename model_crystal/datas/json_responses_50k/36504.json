    "summary": "Master student in European and international affairs, dedicated to social equality, passionate about gender dynamics. Currently working as Head of Mission for Diversity & Inclusion at AXA France.\n\nI aim at obtaining a Master's degree in International Governance and Diplomacy at Sciences Po Paris, with a focus on Gender Studies. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's in European Studies from Maastricht University. I have built my expertise through a multidisciplinary approach, covering disciplines such as international relations, policy making and analysis, law, economics, and history. My interest has grown towards tackling inequalities through a partnership between state and non-state actors at all levels.\n\nNext to my studies, I have participated in associations and projects aimed at promoting student wellbeing and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, I have gained experience in the organisation of, e.g., electoral campaigns, awareness campaigns, fundraisers and networking events. This encompassed team management and social media management.",

Following the elections, the party remained the only one representing students in all councils of the university. Compared to the previous student elections, the party was the only one to gain votes (from 17% of the vote share to 26%) and council seats (from 21% of the seat share to 28%), despite the lower turnout in almost all faculties and across the university (on average, -5%).",

We prepared the trip by raising funds, gathering supplies from firms and individuals, and learning about serving local populations abroad. In Benin, we met locals to learn about them and life in Benin, and we brought the supplies to local schools, children's home and orphanage. The trip allowed me to learn on several levels about the country and its people, especially as I got to meet people with whom I still keep contact today. While I think the format of the trip was not ideal, the trip had the merit to be based on openness, humility and service."
