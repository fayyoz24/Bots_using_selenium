In cooperation with the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and IDH, I coordinated multiple development projects in West Africa and Latin America regarding sustainable cocoa and chocolate on the Dutch market. I aided in the management of the Dutch Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (DISCO) where I coordinated the efforts of six teams spread across six countries on their KPI\u2019s, maintaining intensive contact, providing advice, drafting reports, analyzing data and preparing overviews for stakeholders and key audiences.\nMy role included the organization of the yearly \u2018Chocoa\u2019 sustainable cocoa and business conference, with more than 50 international speakers and 7,500 visitors. For Chocoa, I also organized the European Markets Academy and Cocoa Export Training programs for our clients.
