Sustainalytics\u2019 research is used by investors to integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment processes and decisions. The Advisory services makes sure the clients are actually using and benefitting from the available insights and research. As a result, the team sits at the very foundation why clients work with the company and why the market for ESG is growing at a such a fast pace.\n\nWhen Alexander started, he created the notion and clear benefits -for clients- of dedicated client Advisory teams. Soon, the team is considered a growth team. During the process of establishing this, a true scaling up of the company's growth ambitions could be realised by servicing an ever increasing number of clients. The team consisted of 6 client advisors at Alexander's start in 2010. An active hiring strategy and team structure was designed during the growth journey. On average, the team grew by 8 members per year. The team is consistently considered to be very robust. The next step for Alexander was to create efficiencies and processes to service more clients better with their ad hoc, bespoke and also recurring needs. This resulted in more refined specialisations and benefits for the company and robust outcomes for clients.",
