This association solves that problem for many. \n\nI know you know English, but building a wildly profitable business in a language that is not your mother tongue is a whole different ballgame. Together with an entire global community, you will find this is a safe space, but too one that can have massive value to you and your business.\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES:\n1. Online business is the way forward in the near future. \nIt should not come as a surprise that the digital era means companies had to join in and digitalize.\n\n2. English is the chosen language in the international business world, Innovation, and Digitalisation. English, not Mandarin, not Spanish, English is the language of innovation. First of all, because standard QWERTY keyboards are made for the Roman alphabet and\u00a0can\u2019t accommodate\u00a0the 2,000+ Chinese characters considered necessary to achieve even basic literacy in Mandarin. And the global use of the QWERTY keyboard has lead to programming languages usually use the Roman alphabet too. In addition, the\u00a0top 10 programming languages\u00a0in the world are English-based. Fifty-six percent of all online content\u00a0in the world is in English.\u00a0\n\n3. There are more people in the world learning English than there are native English speakers. All over the world, there are roughly 375 million native English speakers while estimates show\u00a0more than 1.5 billion people\u00a0around the world are trying to learn English.\n\n4. Native English speakers fail to be understood in English and they miss out on international job opportunities. Companies around the world are choosing English as their official corporate language. But when it comes to \u2018international English\u2019, research shows that native speakers are not masters of the world\u2019s global language.",
