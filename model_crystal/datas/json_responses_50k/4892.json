In addition to using a mix of secondary and primary sources, I also reached out to the British flying community for interviews and further information. This required strong interpersonal skills, to source interviewees and encourage them to participate. In all I had eight interviewees and an additional three people who gave information but didn't wish to be filmed. \n\nThis was a challenging project, which pushed myself to think creatively about history and the narrative I wanted to tell. I gained much from this experience and though I had doubts along the way, was ultimately satisfied with my end result.",

The collection includes books, visual documentation, and folders pertaining to gliding, hang-gliding and micro-light flying competitions. My focus was on the books of this collection. I used Adlib Museum Lite software to record the 1023 entries.\n\nThe storage of the collection is complex, being housed in a private house's spare room on shelves and in boxes. As such, I devised a logical shelf marking system on my own that can be understood in the future. \n\nI have enjoyed overlooking a broad scope of flying history and hope my work will serve to preserve Ms Welch's collection for the future.",

Numbers for the centre ranged from 100-120 students at one time, mainly originating from Italy or China. I led a team of six activity leaders to carry out the program. \n\nOf great importance was administrative work to ensure bookings for travel and attraction entrances were correct, and creating the weekly rota for the activity staff. Flexibility was important as changes could arise at the last minute which often necessitated alterations to bookings and staffing. \n\nCreativity was needed to offer a range of options for the many students. I identified our activity staff's interests and skills, and designed the activity program when possible to highlight their strengths. \n\nOur activity program received positive feedback from the students both in person and in anonymous surveys.",
