    "summary": "I am always looking for a healthy balance between technological innovations and market needs. My technical-commercial background helps me to explain complex issues in an understandable way. \n\nI get excited and happy when I can achieve predefined goals with a team of people. This can be in the professional field, but also outside of it. I strongly believe in the power of sharing success stories as well as setbacks in order to learn from them and reach a higher level.\n\nCreativity runs like a thread through my life. Everyone has received creativity from their earliest childhood, many have lost it along the way due to imposed structures of society, but it is still present in everyone.\n\nI found my creative \"trigger\" during my 6-year education at the art academy and it has only made me richer, also in my current job! I can recommend everyone to look for it if he or she has lost it!",
