    "summary": "\nAs a physicist, I enjoy the fundamental science, and as an engineer, I equally challenge myself in transforming these beautiful concepts into useful applications. In both academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as disciplined and detail-oriented.  \n\nThis combination makes me suitable for the research & develop positions in the field of technology.\nI started off my industrial venture as an electrical engineer, dealing with high voltage equipment. This was the first place where I learned the very aspects of team management and applying theoretical skills to large production scales.  Since I was equally fascinated towards the science behind these things, I took a bold step and moved to the Netherlands to pursue my research masters in nanoscience, which seemed to have answers I was looking for. I continued as a Ph.D. researcher in experimental physics, where I worked on realizing a new analogue of an electronic transistor: a \u2018spin\u2019 transistor. \n\nWhen not working, I love to exploit my kindle, go for running and spend my evenings in cooking something healthy \uf04a. \n\nMy specialties: \n\nElectronics and electrical engineering: lock-in and operational amplifiers, electrical noise characterization, feedback-controller design, 33kV and 6.6kV circuit breakers and power transformers. \n\nCircuit-simulation: Mentor graphics, Pspice.\n\nLaboratory skills: Nanodevice fabrication, electron beam lithography, cleanroom processing.\n\nInstrumentation: Labview. \n\nDocumentation: MS office, Latex, HTML.\n\nProgramming and data-analysis: C, Java, Matlab. Currently, I am learning Python and using it for the instrumentation.\n\nIf you find my personal and professional details interesting, and have specific suggestions/recommendation or even you just want to chit-chat, give me a shout here. You are also welcome to send me an email at s.omar@rug.nl. \n\nFor more details on my projects and publication, visit my official-homepage: https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.omar/\n",

            "description": "Graphene has received a lot of attention for spintronics due to its theoretically predicted long spin relaxation time and length even at room temperature. However, the experimental values are still orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted by the theory. One of the possible explanations is the effect of enhanced spin-flip process due to the presence of impurities in graphene. It is an open question whether the impurities affect the spin transport in a similar way as the charge transport, or if the scattering mechanisms in both processes behave differently. It has been show that the nature of the scatterers and their effect on electronic transport can be studied via 1/f noise measurements. Similarly, measuring low frequency fluctuations of the spin accumulation can unravel the role of impurities on spin transport and help to understand the mechanisms for spin relaxation. In this work, we  study the 1/f type noise associated with electronic spin transport in graphene and conclude that the source of these spin-dependent fluctuations is the  underlying spin-relaxation processes. Alternatively,  the 1/f noise also serves as a complementary tool to probe the spin signal due to spin transport",
