I take part in promoting the program via the website as well as social media including Facebook and Instagram, where we recently started a project called \"A day in the life of...\". Once a week one of our mentors, who is also a current student, is able to take us on a journey through their day of life at their university from across the world. This allows the potential applicants to get an insight into the university life from a perspective of their peer, instead of simply reading a standard brochure, hopefully making the difficult decision of which university to go to at least a little simpler.",

The current project faces the issue of how the disregulation of immune responses can lead to auto-immune or inflammation-associated diseases, allergies and more. Particularly focusing on the role of CD4 T cells and how the cross-talk between TGF\u03b2 and EGFR affects their function at different stages of immune response. \n\nI regularly perform mice genotyping using PCR and Western Blot to determine strain of mice. I also had the opportunity to practice RT-qPCR technique.",
