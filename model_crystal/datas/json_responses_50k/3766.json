    "summary": "My work is directed towards unleashing sustainability in the hospitality and tourism industry trough education, training and applied research.\nMy main area of interest is on the interrelationship between personal values and attitudes on one side and action taken at company level on the other side. I have done research on youngster preferences for sustainable produced goods; on youngster attitude towards sustainable tourism; on sustainable leaders\u2019 value set; on the role of personal leadership in small enterprises in the process of change towards sustainability.\nPeople say I am able to explain difficult and complex matter in easy to understand terms. It is always a joy for me to disseminate the knowledge acquired trough research. In this, I have more than 15 years experience.\nThe book 'Three Levels od Sustainability' that I co-authored with George Curiel is a bestseller.\n\nSpecialties: Research on values and attitudes.\nTraining and consulting on CSR issues as e.g. integration of CSR in a company HR policy.",

I developed also workshops in basic and advanced ethical skills.\nFrom 1999 on my interests evolved towards CSR, sustainable development and leadership. For Stenden master programmes I developed a course on CSR and sustainable development called Sustainable Value Creation and a training in personal leaderhip called Personal Value Creation. These courses are consistently ranked high by students.\nIn 2014-15 the master curriculum was reviewed and geared towards hospitality. I took charge for refiewing the sustainability module.\nIn 2015 I developed together with colleagues Niels van Felius and Femke Vrenegoor the minor 'Future proof hospitality: the CSR challenge.",
