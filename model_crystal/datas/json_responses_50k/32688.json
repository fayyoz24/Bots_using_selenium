This product could be used by any person to perform the administration tasks in Solaris and implementing it in a small scale sector. The product covers the implementation of the basic administration tasks and also few other advanced features of the Solaris (NIS, NFS etc.). The final product is a java GUI application which runs on a windows machine connected to Telnet/SSH at the background which communicates to the server. This sophisticated tool creates an easy way of using Solaris and performing our tasks in a better way.",
