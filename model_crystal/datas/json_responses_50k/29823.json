    "summary": "Playing games has never been enough for me. \n\nIf I would describe myself in one sentence, I would probably say that I am a curious and adventurous person, yet, I would never happen in a real-life game adventure, as I like to overthink ((pre)calculate) and come up with hundreds of scenarios to modify basically everything in my life. \n\nIn game context, that translates to my favourite RPG role being mage support, who, combining calculations, cunning strategies and strong aid skills, indirectly turns the tide of any battle. \n\nHowever, I have always wanted to influence the experience more than just what is possible. And that is how I met design, specifically game and UX. \n\nIn my opinion, the game and the development role have a lot in common - empowering the user, via different strategies and scenarios, to experience a win (which takes different shape in every situation) in a unique way. \n\nThus, my game and UX design approach is a combination of rational design (calculation and analyses) and situational design (user/player experience and psychology). \n\nI value designs that combine both, as they are both intuitive and innovative, thus excelling above the rest. \n\nIf you spent a few minutes reading this, I would kindly invite you to present me with a few more minutes and check out my work, I am always open to dicussions and new experiences!",

The main game dynamic is utilizing gravity holes to control a character from point A to point B.\nIn this project I entered a premade team, since I wanted to test my adaptability skills, as if I was hired in a new studio. My responsibilities included game systems design, level design, UX/UI and game prototyping. During this project we had a very limited time, so planning was key. We managed to finish almost everything we planned in a good quality. The biggest takeaway from this project is that game and level design are a highly iterative disciplines. Unless you are a magician or industry veteran, you will most probably have a few pitfalls in your design, which you might not be able to see. For this reason, testing and analyzing is crucial. During this project, I did multiple tests on the levels, constantly iterating on these, and even so there were still things that could be done better.",

It was the first time I took the initiative to be the team leader, coordinate the work of all roles and make sure the final product is polished.

            "description": "Gemancer is a solo project, developed for the Game Design course (Saxion UAS) in Flowlab. It is a 2D platformer, in which you have to utilize a special power \u2013 earth wave, at your advantage, to explore the Devil\u2019s Throat cave, collect gems and use them to power the teleporter, to return to the overworld.\nSince it was an individual project, I did visual scripting, game systems design, level design, UI/UX and some asset design. In the process of development, it was my first time planning it all by myself and doing visual scripting. The latter provided an interesting challenge, since my visual scripting skills at that time limited the difficulty mechanics I could implemented. Exactly this made me think outside of the box and think of a simple, yet interesting and rather innovative core game mechanic, like the earth wave. \nA main takeaway from the project is how too much freedom, given to a certain dynamic, makes it harder to understand and use correctly. Feeling of freedom is a powerful aesthetic, which can make an experience enjoyable, however it can also make it confusing, if not dosed properly. In this game, I gave too much freedom to the use of earth waves (every earth chunk that the player can bump into), which made the puzzles a bit intimidating. Still, it was refered as unique and innovative by both my teacher and classmates.",

            "description": "DominAnts is the first game projected, completed by me and a few other students for Saxion UAS. It is a turn-based strategy tabletop game for 2-4 players, in which every player controls an ant hive. The main game dynamics are gathering sugar cubes, to build an army of ants to gather even more of the former, or to upgrade it to fight other hives. The player who takes over all other players\u2019 hives becomes the winner.\nMy responsibilities were game systems and manual design. It was actually the first time that I (professionally) tackled a game, consisting of multiple complex systems \u2013 gathering, combat, troops, takeover and special events system, each with its own set of mechanics. A main takeaway for me from the project is how a change of a mechanic in a given system has an impact on other systems and general game experience. For instance, during the testing phase, one of the main problems that we encountered was the game taking too long to compete. To solve it, we analysed a few factors \u2013the map being too big, too harsh resource system, players \\ not taking initiative to fight. One of the measures we took was adding 3 startup upgraded troops for each player, with the intention of shortening the initial grinding to build an army. During the latter playtest, however, we realized that not only does it fulfil the task we had in mind, but also inclines players to take more aggressive actions, because they feel threatened by these more powerful troops (and therefore want them eliminated).\nLooking back on it, there are a few pitfalls in the overall design of the game, like e.g. the too complex combat system, which needed a ton of explanations in the manual and proved that it is hard to decide on the outcome of given situations. Overall, however, I am happy with how it turned out overall and that I managed to learn the importance of game systems early on.",
