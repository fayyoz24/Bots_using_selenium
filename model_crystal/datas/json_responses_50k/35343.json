    "summary": "I am 3rd year BSc student of Nanobiology at Delft University of Technology and aspire to become both theoretical and laboratory Neuroscience researcher. I am fascinated by the way different scientific fields join forces in order to elucidate how exactly specific brain functions and behaviours arise. \n\nI have also a great interest in higher education as I strongly believe that innovative ways of communicating academic material is necessary to prevent misconceptions and inspire students further for their chosen field. With this intentions I helped to develop open-source educational materials and worked as teacher assistant. \n\nI am always eager to learn about the most recent research and am open to new connections- particularly related to research internships!",
