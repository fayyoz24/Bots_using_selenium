    "summary": "My name is Angelo Emmen and I am currently working as an Agile coach. \nI see myself as a driven, pragmatic and experienced Agile enthusiast and I am getting enthusiastic with assignments where I can add value for people and work on continuous improvements. I am getting energized in fulfilling the pivotal role between business and IT. To succeed in improving teams and organizations I believe that Agile is a great way in achieving that goal.\n\nI have an extensive experience with development and implementation projects national and international. I started to work within scrum development teams as BPM developer, analyst and tester. At the same time I often fulfilled the role as a certified scrum master for one or more development team(s). After that I fulfilled the role as a certified product owner in getting requirements from the business and translating them to user stories, managing the backlog and the stakeholders. Besides that i have also l knowledge and experiences with working with scaled agile teams (SAFE/ LeSS/ Scaling Politie Model). \n\nThese experiences I currently use in my role as an Agile coach, by coaching teams, the product owners and the organization where I am assigned.\nBy working together with the teams and the organization in a transparent, structured and pleasant way, I manage to increase the team results and continuously improve processes in the organization.",
