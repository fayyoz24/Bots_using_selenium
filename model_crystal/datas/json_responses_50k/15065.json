The goal is to distribute the product, and in a second step an entire product line, to upscale specialty and department stores throughout the United States & Europe. The distribution was strategically limited at launch, to coincide with the niche positioning of the brand. Cross-promotional opportunities will be utilized as part of the marketing strategy, to create the intrigue and demand for this fragrance.\nThe concept captures the essence of the Norwegian resort city, \u201cKristiansand\u201d, in terms of scent, package and advertising. Kristiansand has been referred to as the \u201cNorwegian Riviera\u201d, an appeal that will be stressed to consumers. The goal is to tailor the fragrance to be an international success in both Europe & US. \n\nKristiansand is a Scandinavian-American hybrid that will gain attention quickly due to its originality and sex appeal. As the brand begins to take off, the distribution will increase accordingly.\n\nKristiansand New York offers today a 50ml & 100ml men\u2019s fragrance. Both co-founders \"Britt Ross & Elisabeth Steen\" are very proud of their country and have strong ties to it. To pay homage their country they hold close to their heart, they decided to name their product line Kristiansand, after their home town.\n\nSince the HQ of the brand is based in New York, the city's name is always set under the Kristiansand word mark. The heart of the Kristiansand scent captures a bold Norwegian aroma with a subtle uniqueness that keeps you wanting more. \n\nThe inspiration comes from the incomparable uniqueness of New York, which has enhanced both Britt & Elisabeth's lives since their move to the city and is reflected in the fragrance. \n\nDrom Fragrances\u2019 perfumer Pierre Constantin-Gueros created Kristiansand New York with careful detail in Drom\u2019s Tribeca NYC studio.",
