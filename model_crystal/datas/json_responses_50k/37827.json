    "summary": "Niels Terpstra is Assistant Professor in Conflict Studies at the Centre for International Conflict Analysis and Management (CICAM), Radboud University. His research focuses on the dynamics of civil war, political violence, insurgency, and terrorism. He is particularly interested in governance and legitimation practices of non-state armed groups during and after civil war. Furthermore, he is interested in foreign policy, particularly the political and strategic dimensions of peace- and state-building missions. \n\nNiels has published in the journals Small Wars & Insurgency, Civil Wars, Peacebuilding, Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, and Modern Asian Studies. He co-edited a special issue with Nelson Kasfir and Georg Frerks on \u2018Armed Groups and Multi-layered Governance\u2019, published in the journal of Civil Wars in 2017. Niels has field research experience in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Germany and the Netherlands. Niels has taught courses on Conflict Analysis, Conflict Management, Peacebuilding, Conflict and Governance, and co-coordinated the UU Summer School on Contemporary Conflict and International Conflict Management. Niels\u2019 dissertation on \u2018Rebel Governance and Legitimacy in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka\u2019 investigates how the Taliban in Afghanistan have governed territories under their control and how the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) governed in Sri Lanka. Moreover, it investigates how rebel governance affects civilian compliance with a rebel group and what this tells us about legitimacy, authority, and state formation processes. \n\nOver the past years, Niels was also involved in advisory and evaluation projects for the Netherlands Ministry of Justice and Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, peace organization PAX. Amongst others, this included the evaluation of the Dutch Police-training Mission in Kunduz, Afghanistan, an assessment of the Dutch government\u2019s strategic narratives during the war in Afghanistan, the development of a Human security survey, a study on terrorism and the state of emergency in Western Europe, and the crime-terror nexus in the Netherlands. In 2018 Niels was invited by the US Embassy in the Hague to participate as expert in an IVLP program on (counter)terrorism in the United States. Furthermore, Niels has appeared on BBC Radio, NPO Radio 1 and in several Dutch national newspapers. In 2013, Niels received the J.C. Baak MA thesis prize for research on the enhancement of peaceful societies, awarded by the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities.",

Enduring violent conflict has broken down most Afghanistan\u2019s training infrastructure and put the country down into one of the least developed in the world. One of the important factors holding Afghanistan\u2019s development on hold is the absence of a well-educated and well-trained labor force. Most of the population lacks the skills and trades that the country needs to be able to grown economically. A better-trained youth will ensure higher levels of productivity and will support greater social mobility.\n\nIn cooperation with my Afghan partners of CPAU I worked on a proposed project and designed the methodology for participatory research-projects for youths in Khandahar and Khost, Afghanistan.",

Security issues regarding the withdrawal have, so far, dominated discussions about the country\u2019s future. Parallel to this transition, however, the economic transition will take place. With billions of dollars in international aid decreasing over the subsequent years, Afghanistan will have to find a way to sustain its own economic future better than it has been doing over the past decade. Moreover, only the fact that PRT\u2019s are closing throughout the country will already generate tens of thousands unemployed people. As our previous research has pointed out, the inability to make a livelihood can be a main driver of local violent conflict between communities. Hence, a responsible economic transition will be one of the major opportunities to support the security transition as well.\n\nIn cooperation with my Afghan counterparts of CPAU I developed a research proposal for funding.",

The basis of the report was an extensive literature review and synthesis. The report was commissioned by the IOB, the evaluation unit of Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. The report served as expert background to the IOB's post-mission evaluation of the Integrated Police-training Mission in Kunduz province, Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2015-2016 Toon Dirkx and Niels Terpstra carried out a study on strategic narratives surrounding the engagement of the Netherlands with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. This included an analysis of political discourse and media discussions along a timeline of key events. The report was commissioned by the Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr in Munich. The narrative analysis informed a synthesis report of five countries and was part of a larger project under the name \u2018Lessons Learned Afghanistan\u2019, carried out by the Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr in Munich.",

This to provide contextually sensitive feedback on the impacts of Dutch IPM interventions and communication with the Dutch parliament and public. In particular I have produced a case-study research on legal awareness and access to (in)formal justice mechanisms in Kunduz. I spent 1,5 months of field work in Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and Kunduz in early 2013.",
