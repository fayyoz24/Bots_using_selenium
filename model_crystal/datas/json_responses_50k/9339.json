    "summary": "I\u2019m Helena (they/she), an interdisciplinary social science researcher currently pursuing a Research Master's in Societal Resilience (Big Data for Society) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I am also working as a research intern at the Verwey-Jonker Instituut. Under the supervision of prof. dr. Serena Does, I am contributing to the project \"Amsterdam All-Inclusive\". Additionally, I help run the R Programming Helpdesk at the Department of Communication Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. \n\nMy research interests include intersectional issues such as accessibility/disability rights, racial justice & decolonization, LGBTQIA+ rights, and educational equity & inclusion. To explore these topics, I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods including in-depth interviews, literature review, archival research, and data & text analysis (e.g. social network analysis, topic modeling, supervised machine learning techniques). \n\u00a0\nI received a Bachelor of Science\u00a0in Literature, Media, and Communication from\u00a0the Georgia Institute of Technology\u00a0in Atlanta in 2020. With\u00a0concentrations in Media and Social Justice,\u00a0I focused my studies on (global) media and cultural studies and design (graphic,\u00a0web, and\u00a0user interface/experience).\n\nI am an Atlanta (US)\u00a0native, though I am currently based in\u00a0Amsterdam (NL). I am both a US\u00a0and Swiss citizen, so I am authorized to work in both the US\u00a0and the EU/EEA/Schengen Area. I have lived, studied, and/or worked in the\u00a0US, the Netherlands,\u00a0Austria,\u00a0China, and\u00a0Spain. I am proficient in\u00a0Chinese\u00a0(Advanced/C1),\u00a0Spanish (Intermediate/B2), German (Novice/A1), and English (Native).\n\u200b\nCheck out my current and past projects on my portfolio website and see my full CV.
