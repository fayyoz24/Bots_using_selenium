As they say, difficulties are opportunities to better things \u2014 whether that be DAG-based solutions, sharding, DPOS or gossip protocols. To help us in this, we were fortunate enough to be joined by researchers and developers from some of leading educational institutions in the world, who demonstrated that there is more to on-chain scaling than simply increasing block size.",
