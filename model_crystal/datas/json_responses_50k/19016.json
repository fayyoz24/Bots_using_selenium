    "summary": "Ton works as the portfolio lead of the Tech Academy within the Capgemini Academy. With an extensive background in the Data Management domain and being a certified trainer, Ton knows how to deliver high quality data trainings. Not only is he delivering training himself, he is also coaching other trainers in the tech domain. Next to that he makes sure that the portfolio on Cloud, Security, Software Engineering and Data trainings fits the markets needs. Before this job, Ton successfully followed two studies at the Technical University of Eindhoven: Industrial and Applied Mathematics and Science of Education and Communication.\n\nThe mathematical study has given Ton many mathematical skills. As a result of his study, he also knows how Data Analytics and Data Science works, giving him a broad perspective on the complete data domain. Besides the mathematical study Ton has done an educational study. Therefore, Ton knows how to explain (complex) things to people and how to motivate these people. Combining his studies and working experience, Ton combines strong analytical skills with strong communicative and didactical skills.",

Now, Argenta is working on a new integrated online software application for the front and back offices. With this application, they can work online with client information and transactions. They can both create new data and modify existing data.\n \nFor this software application Ton writes test scripts using the business rules, high level analysis and stories. By writing test scripts for various complex parts of the application, e.g. Graydon, he was challenged to combine various aspects within the project. Also, he wrote test scripts for less complex parts. Using these test scripts he is now able to execute User Acceptance Tests in a critical way. During these User Acceptance Tests he logs defects in a concrete and understandable manner. Besides, Ton presented parts of the application to the office holders, helped writing the manual and tested data cleanings and migration using SQL.\n\nThe concrete and understandable way of writing test scripts helped other testers to test the application without any knowledge of the system. Both the results of these tests as the tests executed by Ton himself will be presented to the client. During this project, Ton has learnt to put into practice what he learned in courses about Testing. Also, he got familiar working in a SCRUM environment.",

At the start of the project there was no method in literature available yet to obtain exact solutions.

Using this module, children are stimulated to think about the basic principles of building algorithms in an interactive way. Also, they make a first step with programming on a calculator.\r\n\r\nThe evaluations of both the teachers as the students, the module turns out to be a success. The students are able to work with the module individually, have fun and are able to program easy to rather difficult algorithms.
