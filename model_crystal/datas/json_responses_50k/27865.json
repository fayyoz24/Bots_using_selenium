Our project involved imaging the Crab Nebula and gathering information on the rotational period of the pulsar at its center. For the latter, we were able to use the Dwingeloo radio telescope in the Netherlands. We presented our research at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The Dutch Physics Society helped to fund this project.",
