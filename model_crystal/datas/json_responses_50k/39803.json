    "summary": "Media and communications professional. Trinidad & Tobago and British citizenship.\n\nAfter graduating in Classics and Geography at a London University I worked as an English Teacher in the Czech Republic for a year and a half. Upon returning to the UK I continued as a language trainer while at the same time developing my career ambitions in media production.\n\nIn 2000 I obtained a Masters Degree in a Journalistic discipline. It was during my studies that I began working professionally at Granada Television in Manchester. \n\nSince this initial start I have worked in documentary film, web video, live television, corporate communications and digital marketing in a variety of technical and organizational roles. These include working on the broadcast of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea, being a crew member for three seasons of the UK 'Lost Treasures' historical documentary series, writing and producing documentaries for the Discovery channel, working within the marketing department of the Boots Pharmaceutical company in the UK and several years of Audio Visual operations with the United Nations.\n\nIn addition to these roles I have also worked within education and training for private industry, colleges and universities as a subject lecturer. Courses taught include broadcast journalism, media production and presenter training.",
