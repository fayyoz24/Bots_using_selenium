    "summary": "Zahira Mous holds a Master of Fine Arts in Dance and a Graduate Certificate in Women\u2019s & Gender Studies from The University of Oklahoma (US) and a Bachelor of Theatre in Education from Noordelijke Hogeschool Leeuwarden (NL). Zahira is the director of dance theater company Project Zahira with a home base in Amsterdam, the dance education outreach program Changing Lives Through Dance, and the founder of the non-profit Healing Arts Foundation.\n\nZahira has shown her choreographic works and facilitated her dance improvisation & embodiment workshops internationally in the United States, the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Greece, and most recently in Palestine. She has also been invited internationally as a jury on dance competitions, such as the Oklahoma International Dance Festival, Solocoreografico (USA edition), and AmsterDans (NL). \n\nAs a choreographer, Zahira has been greatly inspired by the late German choreographer Pina Bausch. She creates works that seamlessly merge dance and theater. With an interest of creating empowering experiences, she derives from her dancers\u2019 personal stories. Overarching themes of (the search for or the peeling away of) identity seep through Zahira\u2019s dance theater works - with an emphasis on social awareness regarding gender identities, gender (in)equality, and women empowerment. \n\nZahira works with professional performers as well as with people that seek emotional freedom in life. Her aim is to facilitate healing through dance; via her professional dance productions, such as Soul Famine (2022), Reclaiming the Goddess (2019) and Who am I without my Story? (2017) as well as dance education outreach programs, workshops, and retreats. Zahira developed her own method called SIT in Motion (Self-Integration Tools) - a healing practice of movement & creativity, in which the participant is invited to listen to the wisdom of their body through dance improvisations, guided meditations, and creative assignments. People leave the workshop feeling more alive and connected to themselves with new personal insights. Zahira also developed an alternative choreographic composition method called ART in Motion (Artistic Regenerative Tools).\n\nwww.zahiramous.com\nwww.projectzahira.com",

I've been reevaluating my role as a writer, especially as a 'dance critic,' as I feel that interviewing people involved in a performance or production create more of a body; hence I'm more interested in writing reports and reflections than 'critiques.' During the pandemic I got to do a series of interviews with people in the performing arts who struggle with their mental health. I've also written an article about a dance company in the Netherlands who sets an example of a company that has a white infrastructure in the executive side of things. And recently I got to write about the Becoming Community that is changing the theater landscape in terms of (more) inclusive programming and creating cross-overs, not only in performance disciplines but also in blurring the lines between audience and performers. Decolonize and 'ungatekeep' the arts world.",
