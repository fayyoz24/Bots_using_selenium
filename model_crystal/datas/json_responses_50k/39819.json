The vision is to address water and sanitation issue with innovative and market driven approach. In our AQGRI+ station, we have a unique integration of simplified and proven technologies to use the wastewater to produce three-valuable products; nutrient-rich irrigation water, high quality compost, and fish (by-product). We also offer service to municipalities an innovative and low-cost solution for the enormous wastewater problems where it usually gets discharged to river bodies causing water pollution and sanitation problems in developing countries.\n\nSee article: https://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/11743-deltas-2014-aqgri-wins-climate-business-challenge-award-for-water-re-use-stations-in-vietnam.html",

I gathered and connected networks from outside to support the completion of the event. I worked closely with the President of the event to coordinate activities for other event organizers and participants, so that we could see the event running successfully. \n\nThe result of the event was better than expected. We generated more money than expected and thus was able to donate more."

Together with my partner, we aimed to provide access for the kids to greater knowledge through availability of books surrounding them. \n\nI developed networks to obtain books from outside source and made sure that there were enough books to fill the library, while my partner focused more on developing the reading programme. I improved the existing condition of the library by repainting the wall and organized the furniture in such a way to make a small comfortable library. The library is right now still being used by the students, with more books being donated, and its size being already extended, showing that the project is still running and even developing. "
