    "summary": "ING has a brilliant team in Manila Philippines that create and maintain the OnePipeline. I'm the lucky guy that has been asked to lead this team as a Product Owner. OnePipeline supports the ING developers journey with a) InTheBox and b) OnePipeline. \n\nInTheBox provides a local developers environment on a Macbook Pro containing kubernetes, kafka, elastic, prometheus and many more to enable the developer in developing and testing containerized applications.\n\nAfter committing the created application OnePipeline comes in in building, scanning and deploying the application on Azure or in house ICHP container environment.\n\nThis is again a switch to a whole other area. I have stepped out of the Elastic environment, just like I've stepped out of other areas. Once you're the expert the fun is gone. MS Azure is a whole new area for me. Another great opportunity to learn new things and extend my knowledge and network.  ",

This user is logged into Elastic with a Basic Authorization header which contains the user and a fixed password. The authorized users with their roles mapping is inserted upfront. This setup saves license costs (Elastic or Search Guard) that can go over Euro 100k per year.\n\nThe proof of concept was implemented within 2 weeks.",

So I check if we can login/logout, check the Linux files system space, ping all the machines within the configuration, check if all RSA WTD tasks are up and running, check if the Java Unlimited Policy has been removed (again), check all TCP/IP connections between the processor and the RSA WTD tap systems, check if Mitigator-0 is still running even when the schema is pushed without errors!, check for RSA WTD failed tasks and restart them automatically after 15 minutes (always works!), check if we have double traffic (1 of the 2 taps should be switched off). \n\nAnd when something fails (every now and then) I get a mail on my phone.\n\nThe RSA WTD tap systems contains a script that checks every minute if the processor is moved to the DR location or back. In that case the SilverTap needs to restarted, otherwise TCP/IP will keep trying to connect to the previous location, leading to no connection. This script also switches the taps (we have 2 taps in every data center) weekly and keeps one SilverTap switched off that should be off. RSA WTD switches SilverTap on after every push. So we have all taps within the configuration (for pushes) and we see them working regularly.",

            "description": "The initial implemented single Elastic node cluster is extended to a 4-node cluster (1 master, 3 workers) in 5 steps. The 4-node is not optimum, we're working on it! First step is moving the communication of the single node from localhost to $HOSTNAME, so the implementation of the cluster can be done without further disruption. Second step is to install the worker nodes and test the transport layer by adding them as coordinator nodes. Third step is adding them (restart) as worker nodes. At that moment Elastic will balance the indices over the 4 machines and for the first time we saw a green health. Step 4 is adding cluster routing allocation, excluding the master node. This will empty the to become master node. Step 3 and 4 took a whole day and production just went on without issues. The fifth step is to restart the to become master node with a true master node yml config.\n\nWe already had File- and Metricbeat implemented. Added to that is Heartbeat for monitoring the Elasticsearch instances and Kibana. Secondly we use Auditbeat for software assurance. The Auditbeat config file contains 8.5k directory entries (use find to define) of the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and all Beats) software and configuration. On issues its clear which files have been changed or better there isn't changed anything. Remember you can use Auditbeat (for free) even if you do not have an Elastic stack. Just let Auditbeat write to an audit trail file or even better to Kafka to move the alerts to another platform.",

I expressed my disbelieve and two day later I received a plastic bag full of floppy disks. Three days later I saw a working concept. It was amazing.\n\nAfter hearing my experience with the C language, the developpers (Jan Jaeger, Roger Bowler, Greg Smith and others) invited me to implement compression. I tried to understand the IBM manual, but found it for the functionality unusable. So, together with the help of Mario Bezzi's test programs and lots of hours reversed engeneering I finally had a working solution. The implementation has evolved and (performance) improved throughout the years.\n\nSomething similar happened for the crypto part. Implementing was a tough task, but it was the best opportunity in studying all down to earth cryptographic details.\n\nBesides compression and crypto I have implemented many features like the Hercules Automatic Operator, coloured OS messages within the Hercules terminal, the UTF translate feature, a feature for capping the processors, many performance upgrades and many, many more.\n\nI stopped developping in November 2012, but every now and then someone out there is asking to implement new features or repair bugs. Normally I can't say no!",
