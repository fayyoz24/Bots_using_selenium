    "summary": "I am a podcast host, writer, community manager and devoted reader focusing on psychological literacy, black feminism and belonging. \n\nI have global experience living and working in Kenya, South Africa, Slovakia and the Netherlands. My passion for understanding human behaviour led me to a degree in Social Sciences with a focus on Psychology and Sociology. \n\nMy bachelors thesis researched the impact of racial micro aggressions on minority students at predominantly white universities. Fighting for social justice and equity has always been at the forefront of my life, and so I work towards creating communities where marginalised people can be in communion and support one another.\n\nLet's connect to explore how I can support you to share your story, host your next event, be a guest on your podcast, write an article for you and chat about what you're currently reading!",
