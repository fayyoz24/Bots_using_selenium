Rib is driven by both the vision of the artists and the will to challenge the institutionalising conditions for the production and presentation of contemporary art. Since its inception, Rib has employed an evolutionary logic instead of a thematic succession; exhibitions, collaborations, recurring (online) residencies, long-term projects and off-site interventions all interlock to animate this living organism. Founded by Maziar Afrassiabi in 2015, Rib is housed in a former butcher shop in Rotterdam-Charlois.\n\nhttp://www.ribrib.nl/"
