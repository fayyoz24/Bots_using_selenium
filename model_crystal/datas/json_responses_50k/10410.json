    "summary": "Hello! I'm Ren\u00e9 Stoop: a Young professional with a BBA (International Hospitality Management) and a Master degree in Strategic Marketing.\n\nI am really interested in social media, mobile internet, mobile apps and the technology behind it because it enables people to communicate in an easy way, while it provides marketers tools to reach out for their customers and become more productive.\n\nDue to my specialization in Strategic Marketing and a background in the hospitality industry I prefer to work in a dynamic and vibrant market with a huge emphasis on innovation, creativity and teamwork. \n\nI can describe myself as someone who challenges himself all the time and who is willing to work hard to achieve his goals. I like to take the initiative and I am able to perform well under high pressure, because I stay calm and relaxed even when problems or setbacks occur. My calmness enables me to get everything into the right perspective and therefore problems and setbacks are challenges for me which I always will overcome and solve in a proper manner. As a result I am able to respond quickly to dynamic situations in which I prefer to work. \n\nI am also highly motivated when working in a team and I am someone who emphasizes the value of cooperation and a good team spirit, while placing the same importance on the group's performance as I do on my own. I truly believe that if you can\u2019t share, you can\u2019t multiply and I always keep in mind that no matter what I have accomplished, there was someone who helped me!\n\nSpecialties: Social media marketing, social network marketing, online marketing, strategic marketing, Internet Marketing, Team player, motivator, creative, analyzer",
