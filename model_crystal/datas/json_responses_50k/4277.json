Had the opportunity of developing two projects in this fields, one of them in the modeling of a continuous Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) unit in AspenPlus, where all the components of the process were designed and implemented, also the elemental analysis of the chosen feedstock (sewage sludge), the products and by-products obtained, and the respective energy balance of the whole process.  Aspen Plus is a powerful tool that allows you to easily process petroleum therefore an optimization had to perform for the processing of biomass.\n\n\nThe second project was on hydrotreating biocrude. It was divided into two parts, a kinetic model and experimental work, with the purpose to obtain biocrude without heteroatoms. The modeling part consists of two packed bed hydrotreating with the purpose of estimating the kinetic parameters of deoxygenation and denitrogenation for a two-stage upgrading of biocrude produced from HTL. In the model, several parameters were changed, such as temperature, pressure, hydrogen to oil ratio, hourly space velocity and the dimension of the reactors. \nIn the experimental procedure, it was used micro-batch reactors to hydrotreat HTL miscanthus biocrude, under different temperatures. After the hydrotreating, the oil and the respective byproducts were characterized using the following equipment: Gas chromatography (GC-Gas) CHNS analysis, Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).",

The reason why I joined this company was because of a project being developed in Brazil, needing someone that would speak the local language to translate it and work as a bridge between Brazil, Denmark and India ( Datacenter of expertise). My job started with organizing all the information in the many files, creating an Excel with a short resume of each PDF file, with the title and directory. Afterward, translating the main information required from the data analysis. I was in contact with people from two opposite sides of the world ( Brazil and India) and at the same time working with a team in Aalborg around this project. \n\nDuring this job, I learned how to prioritize and manage numerous tasks, the ability to work independently and define/describe process guidelines for my supervisors.",
