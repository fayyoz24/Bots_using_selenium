    "summary": "So you are interested in CX... \n\nSo am I. For over 23 years I have been actively engaged in Customer Experience (CX) and the Net Promoter Score (NPS), working and living in various countries for various international companies. It is truly fascinating to me. From the overarching CX or Loyalty strategy that ties the business goals, to the analytical and robust design choices to make for implementation, to cleverly setting up the organisational structure to prove value and drive change. And I\u2019m passionate about what lies beyond the inherent functional logic. I believe that what sets a truly succesful CX/NPS Programme apart is it's incredible potential to involve, engage, inspire and enthuse the organisation and its employees. To make it their own story, their own initiatives and their own pride. Leading to a buzzing customer centric culture and a boost in customer loyalty.\n\nAs one of the just a handful of officially Recognised Training Providers (RTP) in the world by the Customer Experience Professionals Association (CXPA) I host popular CX and NPS Masterclasses all over the world from Dubai to Delft, Manchester to Moscow and Seattle to Singapore. Helping companies to grow, shape their CX roadmap and ambitions, and prepare them for the official CCXP Exam, and help them challenge on Loyalty as a strategy and truly mastering NPS.\n\nWant to find out more?
