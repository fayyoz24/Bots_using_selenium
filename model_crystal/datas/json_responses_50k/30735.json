            "description": "In the RSM STAR Case Competition, teams from 12 highly ranked universities from all over the world compete with each other by presenting the best solutions for two real-life business cases. We have collaborated with Brownies&downieS for our 10-hour case and with Nike Europe for our 24-hour case. \n\nIn one year, we (a committee of six students) organised this entire event next to our full-time study. Together, we created the event from scratch, and we have devised activities such as a presentation workshop, fancy dinners and tours through Rotterdam and Amsterdam. These activities took place next to the 10-hour and 24-hour case and presentations. \n\nOur organising work was evaluated with an overall 9.8/10 by all people involved. \n\nI was responsible for the planning of the (social) activities during the 7 days of the event, the locations, and the food and beverages. This included creating a detailed minute-by-minute script for 80 people (participants, faculty supervisors, RSM staff, volunteers, and fellow committee members). For my work as a member of this committee, I have received a Certificate of Recognition from the Erasmus University, to show the importance of this work to the university."
