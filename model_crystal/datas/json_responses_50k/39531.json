    "summary": "A global citizen with experience in living and working in a great variety of countries (India, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, South Africa, and Greece) and culture. Rich academic experiences at top universities around the world (TU Delft, ETH Zurich).\n\nI am always up for a challenge and try to accomplish it with the best possible results. As a result, I have been awarded scholarships at the university level. Working with diverse cultures and people has imbibed me with a unique perspective to look at problems and build solutions around it. I enjoy working in teams and it has developed my open style of communication and strong interpersonal skills. \n\nMy learning curve has always been steep as I am not afraid to fail but I learn from my mistakes. This attitude has given me immense exposure and makes it easy for me to lead the project and teams. It also has made me stress-resistant. I am a strategic thinker because I can build clear strategies and always remember the bigger picture.  ",
