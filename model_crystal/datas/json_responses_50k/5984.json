When defining the research boundaries, various ports of departure and/or routes in the North Sea were assumed, together with a fixed position in the Baltic Sea. \nVarious frequently occurring vessel types (read: various lengths and widths) were specified for use in the calculations.\u00a0\u2028\u2028The various reasons were analysed based on inquiries made at various shipping companies that frequently use both routes. After completing this research, the results were used to make a decision model that can be relatively easily used to choose a route. \nVarying parameters, including the current fuel price, the expected delay in the canal and any forecast delay due to poor weather can also be easily input.\u00a0\n\n\u2028\u2028More information about this project can be requested from one of the team members, free of any obligation.\n",
