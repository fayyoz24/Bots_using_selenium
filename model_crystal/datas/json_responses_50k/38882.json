    "summary": "My goal is to become the new \u2018Great Communicator\u2019. Why? Because I see a lack of proper communication in todays organizations. Communication is \u2013 mistakenly - seen as a luxury as opposed to an essential part of a good function organization. I see a lack of attention to not only internal but also external communication, i.e. your business proposition and your marketing strategy. I find that, with a little bit extra attention to your external and internal communication strategy, you can gain so much more.\n\nHow I think I can help? I have gained extensive experience in the field of communication by working for several (international) companies. Through my role as a liason between the customer and internal management, I have learned what the customer wants. And through everything I have learned while obtaining my Masters in Business Communication and Marketing, I know how to communicate with the customer while never losing sight of the organization\u2019s business proposition and marketing strategy. Good result is not only measured by numbers, but also by customer satisfaction.\n\nOn top of that I add an extra personal flavour, because it all starts with that and people tend to forget that.\n",
