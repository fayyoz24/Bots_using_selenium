Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, I am committed to optimizing our bank's risk assessment processes, creating a secure and sustainable financial environment.\n\nOn a daily basis, I focus on enhancing statistical credit risk models and employing ML techniques to predict critical metrics such as Probability of Default and Loss Given Default. These efforts contribute significantly to reducing the risk of taking on new clients and ensuring we have adequate capital reserves to handle unforeseen circumstances.\n\nBeyond my core responsibilities, I am proud to be part of the pioneering Climate and Environmental Risks (CER) initiative at ABN AMRO. This groundbreaking project involves incorporating relevant climate and environmental risk drivers into our model development, ultimately enhancing their discriminatory power.
