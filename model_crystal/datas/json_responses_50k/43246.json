This evaluation allowed me to identify areas that required regular maintenance and establish a baseline for future inspections. By documenting the current condition of each component, I was able to prioritize maintenance tasks based on their importance and potential impact on guests' experience.\n\nNext, I developed a detailed schedule outlining the frequency and scope of maintenance activities. This plan takes into consideration both routine maintenance tasks, such as HVAC system checks, plumbing inspections, and electrical system testing, as well as more specialized maintenance requirements for specific areas or equipment. By implementing a proactive and regular maintenance schedule, we can detect and address potential issues before they escalate into costly breakdowns or guest inconveniences.\n\nFurthermore, I implemented a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) within Hotelkit and along with the Product owner to be able to streamline maintenance operations. This system allows for efficient tracking of work orders, scheduling of tasks, and documentation of completed maintenance activities. By leveraging technology, we can ensure that maintenance tasks are carried out promptly and that records are easily accessible for future reference.",
