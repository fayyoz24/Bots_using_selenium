    "summary": "Hi, I'm Willem. Below you'll find my CV, but allow me to preface it here. My work experience is rather eclectic, because I'm curious about many different subjects and love to learn new skills. Though my education is in biomedical (neuro)science, I am now very happy to work in the field of mental healthcare, on the side of prevention and early intervention. In between I worked as a chef, administrative assistant and creative entrepreneur. I have also always been involved in performance art and queer activism.\n\nI am someone who is social, outgoing and culturally engaged, but at the same time scientifically trained, knowledgable and thorough - basically, someone who loves both people and data. I am at my best when I can talk and interact with others while also creating structure and applying rigor in areas where this can be most difficult, like metal health. I especially love taboo subjects such as drug use, sex and LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nI am strongly motivated to help create a world where everyone can be themselves, with all their strengths and weaknesses acknowledged and celebrated.",
