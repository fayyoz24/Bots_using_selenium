With a special interest in innovative solutions, I supported our business to be the first in anything they did. For every digital initiative of the Ahold brands in the Netherlands, I\u2019ve worked closely with product owners, UX\u2019ers and Marketing to oversee the customer journey. I was also part of the team that realised frictionless payment in the AHtoGo stores. Together we designed the customer journey in order to build the MVP. I have closed the gap between marketing and IT, by educating marketing on IT/E-com topics. Together with E-com I\u2019ve developed a way of working whereby the marketing process has been integrated within the existing agile (scrum) way of working of IT/E-com.",
