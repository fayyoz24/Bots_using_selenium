During the Covid-19 period there was a small delay in completion of the course but by the end of June 2020 I\u2019ve managed to finish this course. During the meantime I started in April with online surveying on the river Waal within the Netherlands. We had to measure the depth of the river and assure the government a passable clearance depth for inland shipping. Spots which were to shallow had to be removed by dredgers within the fleet and afterwards had to be remeasured. PDS2000 and a seabat t50-r were operated. This project has ended for us per October 2020.",

The problem of this task was the size of the area 4119km\u00b2 and within New-Zealand they use a different system from addressing rural buildings. They measure the distance from the start of the road towards the entry of the property. Then they divide that number in meters by 10 and give the last number an even or uneven number depending whether the entry is on the left or the right from the view of the road. Often there were clusters of building which needed some more detail compared to the overview map. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be clear which building had which number. The data was acquired using the data from the measuring institute of New-Zealand and self-acquired information. This data was processed using QGIS and afterwards designed into a MapBook using Adobe Indesign.",

Specially using the game Minecraft as it was quite popular among young people during this period. Minecraft is a sandbox game which basically means that players can modify it to their own preferences. There is a huge community behind the game which develops their own modifications and share these online. I\u2019ve researched and selected the best of these based on educational value. Finally made a report of my findings and presented this to the company.",
