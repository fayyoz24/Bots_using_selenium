I oversaw dealer agreements, kept them up to date, and handled escalated issues to improve efficiency. To prevent fraud, I changed the incentive system for dealers. I achieved my long-term financial objectives via cost-cutting, budgeting, and planning. I investigated potential areas for improvement, addressed, and resolved customer complaints, and simplified processes.\n\u2022\tExecuted wind-up and searched for buyers of customer base of 11000 MMDS and 3000 DTH customers as well as sold for almost \u20ac500k to raise 2x revenue.\n\u2022\tImproved and simplified customer service, reduced time to answer by 50%, lessened number of complaints by 25% by reforming bonus system for dealers, decreased fraud by 20% and saved cost by renegotiating existing contracts up to 15% on monthly costs.\n\n\ud83d\udcccMy takeaway: life can change in an instant, one day you are hired to build a successful business and then the next day you might need to learn how to sell it. Job well done! \u2705",
