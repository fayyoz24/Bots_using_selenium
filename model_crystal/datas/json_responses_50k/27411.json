    "summary": "I am a passionate science student with a special interest for physics. Ever since I can remember, I have had an insatiable thirst for knowledge, driven by my unending curiosity. It would literally drive my parents insane at times. Following a scientific path was a no-brainer in that respect.\n\nThe experiences I made during my degree at the Maastricht Science Programme (MSP) strongly shaped me as a scientist in terms of my ambitions, my love for discovering the unknown and the importance of a community.\n\nI am currently enrolled in the Master's programme Advanced Matter and Energy Physics (AMEP) at the University of Amsterdam which has already had an immense effect on my mathematical, computer science and analysis skills.\n\nI have a special interest for applications of Quantum Mechanics in technology and have unbounded excitement for fields such as Material Design, Surface Science, Bose-Einstein Condensates, Lasers and Photovoltaics.\n\nI find laboratory work fun as it allows for a very intimate interaction with the natural world. Upon graduating from my current degree, I envision to work in an industry based research environment. Eventually, I would like to start my own sustainable technologies company.",
