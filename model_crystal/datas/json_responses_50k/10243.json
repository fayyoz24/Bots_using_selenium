    "summary": "I am passionate about bringing projects from research or proof-of concept product to commercialization and manufacturing, about establishing and collaborating in alliances. Currently I work for surgical robotic company. During my PhD training at CCA-VUmc and then continued to work for a small biotech company, I was engaged in managing several clinical projects related to biomarker discovery, molecular diagnostic assay development/validation and targeted therapy. My work allows me to have extensive experience within global and multicultural environments (eg. Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, USA, Taiwan, Singapore, China, and Indonesia).\n\nWhen I was in Indonesia, I was involved in several international research projects, including the development of a bird flu pandemic preparedness portfolio, high risk HPV screening, virus tests related to infectious diseases and cancers. \n\nSpecialties: Skull base surgery, cochlear implantation surgery, microsurgery, biomarker discovery and assay validation, molecular diagnostics, serology techniques, in vitro bioassays for anticancer drug screening, and technology transfer.",
