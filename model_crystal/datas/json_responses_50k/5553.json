                    "description": "Fox Sports gave me the opportunity to continue my professional growth as a Tech Lead alongside six amazing developers. Our goal as a\u00a0team was to\u00a0maintain and improve the foxsports.com.au website. Its complex architecture offered great exposure to a variety of tools and technologies. Just to name a few, infrastructure wise we used AWS, Akamai, Kubernetes, Jenkins and the Atlassian Suite. On the software side, we had React, RxJS, Node, Express, Storybook, Webpack and Mocha.\n\nA fair amount of my time was dedicated to ensuring a great team composition and development. I was involved in the team's\u00a0evolution every step of the way, from reviewing job applications to the sad goodbyes. My main focus was mentoring and helping developers thrive by assigning them to the right tasks and advising them on the best tools and tech. As needed, I would conduct hiring interviews, lead on-boarding, give specialised training and establish new or consolidate existing practices and procedures. In return, my teammates helped me hone my technical skills while my manager mentored me on soft skills.\n\nA key aspect of my role was to create and maintain a good, strong connection between my team and our collaborators from both within and outside the company. It entailed extensive interactions with Product Designers, QA Engineers, Product Owners, Backend Engineers, Mobile App Developers, DevOps Engineers, Stats Engineers and 3rd party liaisons. A couple of months in, a considerable\u00a0improvement in communication with the design team was already visible. This allowed us to introduce a Design QA step in our process which significantly reduced delivery time.\n\nOut of the many achievements the web team had during my time at Fox Sports, I'm particularly proud of reducing the time needed to deliver a custom Match Centre from an average of 2 months to 2 weeks. This was accomplished without sacrificing\u00a0code quality and we even managed to expand test coverage by adding visual regression.",

This consists of  1 on 1 training sessions where I presented the tech stack we are using.\n\nDeveloper: most of the work I've done at Datawave as a developer consist of building JavaScript applications using most of the modern technologies/frameworks/tools available (React/Redux, NodeJs, ES6, NPM, Webpack, Grunt, Mocha). I've worked on both frontend and backend tasks.\n\nOne of the most relevant projects I've worked on is EDA, an application created for the University of New South Wales (UNSW). This was a project started from scratch where I:\n- interacted with the client to understand the requirements and help translate them into features and actionable user stories;\n- decided on the appropriate technologies that will be used to build the project;\n- wrote technical documentation for the project describing how the communication between various internal and external modules will happen;\n- wrote API specs using Swagger;\n- set up the local, dev, stage and prod environments and created release protocols;\n- implemented the project - frontend using React/Redux, webpack and backend using a nginx reverse proxy, nodejs with expressjs and mysql;\n- integrated the project (using REST APIs)  with LDAP for authentication, Jira and Moodle to import/export data;\n- ran checks to ensure that there are no security breaches and that the project passes penetration testing;\n- post-release support.",
