This is what makes our program unique from many other scholarship programs. \nAll students are assigned a mentor to walk with them during the time they are in the program, and possibly beyond. \nMy role has been Mentors Coordinator, including mobilizing mentors, training them, developing mentorship curriculum, and general oversight. \nThe Jubilee Scholarship Fund is a program of Nairobi Chapel, Kenya.
