    "summary": "My name is Fabio Tagliapietra; I have more than 19 years of experience working in the space business as a systems/software engineer and operations engineer. I graduated with a Master in Astronautics from the University of Padova. After internships at Carlo Gavazzi (Milano) and Delta Utec (Leiden), I worked for 2 years as a Spacecraft Operations Engineer in the German Space Operation Centre (GSOC) \u2013 working primarily with the unmanned missions run from there. I then joined Terma, firstly I have been working as an operations engineer located at the ATV-CC (Automated Transfer Vehicle Control Centre) in Toulouse. Here the emphasis of my responsibilities was with the simulation and training aspects. One of my key responsibilities was the Joint Integrated Simulations involving CNES, DLR/GSOC, NASA/Houston and RSA/Moscow. Then I moved to the ERA (European Robotic Arm) project where I have been responsible for the operations preparation, ground system development and testing and system engineering. From January 2019 I am the System Engineer for ERA. From January 2022 I am Mission Services System Engineer for the Lunar Gateway. I have 19 years of experience in spacecraft operational environments, 17 years in areas involving manned space (ATV, ISS, ERA, Gateway).",
