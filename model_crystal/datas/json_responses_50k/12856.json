A.o. by the the development of a strategy to involve, join forces, establish relation- and partnerships and raise funds with corporations, corporate foundations, (high) networth people, families, trusts and the Lottery. The foundation provides primary schools with funds the teachers can use to help and support groups of children and/or individual children whose families or caretakers lack means and support, suffer from a lack of self-esteem and prospects for the future. It\u2019s a small, dedicated team \u2013 5 paid staff members  partly with fixed term contracts-  and the board members and a network of volunteers work along as well. Within this fast growing team, which strives for and succeeds  in doubling the amount of primary schools, teachers and related suppers,community and social workers  it works with I contributed to also doubling the funds raised and being provided and pledged anually. During the COVID-pandemic we managed to create a lot of recognition and positive free publicity, also leveraging the outreach, media&communications and events budgets and capacity of our strategic partners like the ABN AMRO Foundation.",
