    "summary": "I am a deeply curious researcher, strategist and designer, motivated to create the regenerative conditions needed to support more loving and just relationships with our environment and each other. \n\nI thrive in interdisciplinary, collaborative teams focused on addressing complex socio-economic and environmental issues through the design and implementation of programs, policies, organisational models and systems.\n\nMy 7+ years of experience in research, strategy, project management and policy development roles have developed a breadth of skills and knowledge that enable me to holistically drive systemic change agendas. However, through my recent work and studies in art and design (+ other personal projects), I have come to value the impact of affect - of stories and experiences - in shifting ecological perspectives and changing human values and behaviours towards the regenerative. \n\nMy creative strengths therefore emerge at the nexus between my \u2018doer\u2019 and \u2018dreamer\u2019 personas. I hope to continue co-creating with fellow pragmatic optimists who share a vision for a more loving and just world.",
