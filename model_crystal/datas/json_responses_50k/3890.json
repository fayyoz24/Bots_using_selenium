No two people alike.\n\nI believe my coaching is crucial and paramount in the forthcoming times of Individuation. We are entering into an age of deeply Individualistic Self Empowerment, whereby the social securities, structures and support systems in society are slowly but surely falling away. It is a time for people to learn to know their own uniqueness in order to stand on their own feet, within the context of their own partnerships, and small and/or large businesses.\n\nMy coaching background is in the expertise of NLP, Spiral Dynamics, Myers Briggs Type Indicator, Ned Herrmann left/right Brain Dominance, and some professional experiences with 360 Degrees Feedback and Family & Organisational Constellations, and foremost now with the transformative work of Human Design, which gives me a broad, varied and deep base of knowledge and expertise to work from for your (individual & team) coaching.\n\nI have currently added the profound, transformative and deep work of BG5 (the business adaptation to the awareness work of Human Design, which has been tested and emperically proven for over 20 years now) to my repertoire. I know it is the next breakthrough in human & business consciousness and awareness.",
