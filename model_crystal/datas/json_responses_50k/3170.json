This type of fusion centre cooperation platform aims to improve Europol\u2019s intelligence picture on migrant smuggling and to consolidate its support to partner law enforcement agencies, with a focus beyond EU borders on source and transit countries as well as on sea facilitated primary and secondary movements.\n\nThe ICH in particular makes effective use of assets and structures already in place, such as existing cooperation with Frontex and INTERPOL as a bridge to third countries. The ICH aims to initiate or further develop cooperation with less-traditional partners not immediately connected to the law enforcement environment \u2013 for example, military forces deployed as part of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations, such as European Union Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR Med) and the European Gendarmerie Force (EUROGENDFOR). Enhanced cooperation and improved information and intelligence sharing will contribute to detecting and selecting High Value Targets (HVT) more easily and setting up of Operational Task Forces (OTF).\n\nJOT MARE and the establishment of the ICH are Europol/EMSC-led operational action embedded in the Operational Action Plan (OAP) 2018 on Facilitated Illegal Immigration (approved in COSI on 1 December 2017) as part of the EU Policy Cycle 2018-2021.",
