    "summary": "As a digital storytelling intern at The Recursive, I focused on the vibrant and innovative ecosystems in Southeast Europe, shedding light on their respective tech developments, and sharing stories about the future economy in the region. I applied my creative writing skills to produce engaging and informative content for the online platform, reaching thousands of readers and generating positive feedback. I also collaborated with the editorial team and other interns to brainstorm ideas, research topics, and edit articles.\n\nI graduated from Erasmus University Rotterdam with a bachelor's degree in communication and media studies, where I gained a solid foundation in the theories and practices of media, communication, and culture. I also participated in the Marketing & Innovation Committee at MAEUR, the largest marketing association in Europe, where I coordinated the day organization of a successful event that attracted hundreds of participants and speakers. Through my education and extracurricular activities, I developed my interpersonal communication, teamwork, event planning, and project management skills, as well as my passion for learning and innovation.",
