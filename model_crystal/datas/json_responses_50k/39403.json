    "summary": "From a young age onwards, I have been ambitious to become acquainted with different countries, cultures, and experiences from people from all over the world, and to address social, economic and environmental injustice. Besides trying to travel as much as I can, I thus volunteered in the Philippines and did a research internship in Tanzania. Additionally, my studies, the internships at Kinder Donations and the Clingendael Academy, and my work for UNICEF, provided me with the crucial knowledge and skills to be able to contribute to adressing the global and societal challenges the world is facing. I am driven to make a positive impact everywhere I go, to constantly take initiative, to come up with pragmatic and innovative solutions, and to always push myself to make the most out of my abilities. Having recently graduated from the advanced master Governance & Development where I followed the track \u2018governance, peace & conflict\u2019, I am currently looking for a challenging and inspiring job. Either in the International Relations or Development field, as long as I can extensively contribute to the work the organisation is doing, and simultaneously keep developing myself. \n ",

This provided me with practical experience with working and doing research in a developing country.\n\nAdditionally, I met an amazing woman just outside the university campus who provided food, shelter, and a safe place to play for around 80 orphans. During these six weeks, I went as much as I can to her house to help and play, while collecting money for much-needed health insurance, medical instruments, and school uniforms.",

At Clingendael, I also voluntarily joined sessions for diplomats, among others on security negotiation and cooperation.
