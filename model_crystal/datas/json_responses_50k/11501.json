    "summary": "As a seasoned Senior Systems Engineer at Philips, I bring strong technical leadership to the table, overseeing the implementation of full product life cycle management for systems to ensure quality and compliance. My key areas of expertise lie in translating user and business requirements into product requirements and managing the complex details of system decomposition and design trade-offs. I challenge the feasibility of potential solutions and lead technical reviews to ensure our products meet the highest standards.\n\nPrior to Philips, I held a key role at Sioux Technologies, where I honed my leadership skills by leading a Team of up to 10 engineers during key Validation & Integration phases. I successfully aligned Team\u2019s project planning and technical progress, coordinated team efforts during the design phase, and led kick-off meetings, PDR, FMEA, and CDR sessions with stakeholders. \n\nMy approach to Systems Engineering is defined by a unique blend of technical competence, strategic thinking, and strong interpersonal communication. I value teamwork and believe in the power of collective intelligence to solve the most complex technological challenges. My ambition is to continue leveraging my skills and experiences to drive innovation, contribute to a smarter and more sustainable society, and inspire the people I work with.",

It trains graduates from Automotive related disciplines to become the professional system designers and architects that the industry needs to conceive its new, innovative products and who can participate in and/or lead the multidisciplinary teams that realize these.\n\nThe program is devoted to deepening, broadening and reinforcing Automotive related technological knowledge and competencies, as well as personal and professional skills. This program with a unique structure consists of 4 educational blocks followed by a 10 months individual design project in industry. In each of the 4 blocks about half the time is spent on lectures, workshops and training, and the other half on a project, solving a real-life problem from one of the industrial partners. The lecturers, who mostly have an extensive experience in industry and who cover the theory on topics such as systems architecture, design, and problem solving, return as coach during the projects to help translate the theory to practical solutions. Each project is selected from another domain and addresses another technological area to both provide multidisciplinary exposure and enhance cross-domain thinking. The lectures are in part general, in part tailored to the problem domain coming up. In this set-up the trainee gets the opportunity to experience the different roles that make a good team.",
