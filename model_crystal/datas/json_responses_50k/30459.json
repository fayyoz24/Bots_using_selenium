The final year project in non-linear optics was titled \"Frequency up-conversion in nonlinear crystals\". In this project a full three-dimensional geometrical computer model was developed to calculate the required condition for two individual laser beams for successful frequency upconversion in various non-linear crystals. The program allowed for employment of any wavelength and positiononing of the lasers. The model was later on successfully verified experimentally.",
