I joke. It was a lot of fun and made easier by the great crew and Lloyd being effortlessly funny on camera. \n",

The campaign stars a number of the UK's top athletes making personal pledges for 2012. It then encourages everyone else to join in on Twitter, by announcing their own goals via the hashtag #makeitcount.\n\nCreated by Wieden + Kennedy London and AKQA, the campaign includes a series of posters shot by photographer Adam Hinton, which show the athletes at the most intense (and at times painful-looking) moments during training. Each athlete's pledge is then written on top of the image. These vary from the straightforward \u2013 \"Don't dream of winning. Train for it.\" from Mo Farah \u2013 to the stark: Paula Radclliffe's poster simply states that \"nearly isn't enough\". In addition there is a series of online films, directed by Joe Roberts, expanding on the theme.",
