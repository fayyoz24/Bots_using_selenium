The house was build in modern samurai style back around 1910\u2019s. Next to the main house, there is an outhouse where silk worms were kept in the past. In front of this outhouse, there was a 1700m2 rice field which were not in use and ruined because the neighbor old couple could not take care of it any longer. And all these fields and houses are shouldering slowly decaying mountains.\n\nI have studied sociology before and the central theme of my art practice is \u2018interconnectedness of the universe\u2019.\n\nWhat if I would be able to reanimate these decaying mountains, fields, houses into a vital spirited Satoyama* where people live closely to the nature?\nThat would become a great piece of art which would embody the very essence of \u2018interconnectedness of the universe!\n\n** Satoyama is a Japanese term applied to the border zone or area between mountain foothills and arable flat land. Literally, sato means village, and yama means hill or mountain. Satoyama have been developed through centuries of small-scale agricultural and forestry use.",
