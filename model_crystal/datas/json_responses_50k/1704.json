    "summary": "I am the Disentangler: I am a creative and experienced problem-solving consultant who ensures that problems and undesirable situations for all kinds of organizations are effectively untangled and resolved, so that they can move on.\n\nThis makes me unique and difficult to fit into a box. I adapt to any organization and any problem or project that is difficult, needs to be untangled, and where different thinking and non-standard solutions may be needed to move forward.\n\nwww.deontknoper.com\n\nAs an independent consultant I have worked all over the world as a solver in different situations. Sometimes it concerns financial situations, government projects or stalled technical projects at multinationals. And sometimes it's about rides, amusement parks and illusion effects in shows. What binds all these projects together is that they are complex situations that I have untangled and solved.\n\nIf your situation needs more than a project manager or consultant, it's time for the Disentangler.\n\nI use my creative way of thinking as a service and have developed my own specific methodology to solve complex problems. I have a reputation for finding out-of-the-box solutions and I am asked all over the world for complex cases. I am inspired by difficult issues and untangling and solving them has become my service. By looking at your situation in my own way, I find a way out that others have not seen.\n\nOver the years, and with the help of many experts, I've developed my own process and software tool to deal with everything you deal with.\n\nI will solve your problem: erikvisser@deontknoper.com. \nLet me know what's on your mind and we'll figure it out together.\n\n Erik Visser\n- The Disentangler-",

                    "description": "I am a creative and experienced problem solver who ensures that problems that organisations encounter are untangled and solved effectively so that they can move on for all kinds of organizations.\n\nI have a lot of experience as a problem solver for leisure and entertainment, from technology to master plans, but I have also worked on start-ups and financial issues.\nBecause of my creative background and because my experience is so diverse, having worked on over 100 projects, I often see solutions where others don't.\n\nI love you to tell me what is holding you back, and I will solve it for you.\n\nTogether with a number of experts, I have developed a formula with which I can quickly and effectively understand complex situations and change them to a positive result. This can be within an organizational project, but also, for example, a financial situation, problems with design, starting up a company, or a technical problem. And I now offer my expertise as a service all over the world.\n\nMy strength is that I think differently than most people. I can think just as well in a world of unicorns and dragons, as in a world of money and technology.\n\nAll this has given me a strong and varied experience. Compared to others, I will definitely stand out for my not so standard history and character, my unique way of thinking about solving problems and dealing with big projects. I think of solutions.\n\nAnd I think if you have a problem, we can solve it together.",

I have come up with techniques such as a new kind of circular LED screen for a simulator in Dubai, but also helped develop complete attractions and amusement parks, such as Mount Sumeru, and The Red Chamber in China. My expertise became finding creative and technical solutions. But I'm also good at making master plans. For example, I made the master plan for Jazzland (US), Adventure World (Poland and Peru), Discovery Land (Pakistan). And I have extensive experience in presenting ideas focused on different stakeholders, so that we sometimes have three or four versions of a presentation. I have been in charge of several large-scale projects with large budgets. In order to be able to deal with these kinds of large projects, I have made a software program myself together with an IT wizard, which is perfect for complex matters, and which partly works based on principles such as Lean or Scrum so that the connections can be made easily for me. , and tracked. Confidentiality is extremely important for all these types of projects. Here too I have gained extensive experience in international transactions, dealing with international regulations and complex logistics.\nKeywords: Technical, Design, Construction, Management, Imagination, Business Reviews, Reports, Leadership, Out-of-the-Box, Lean, Scrum, Inventing, Framework, International, Payments.",

This ranged from gliding illusions to appearing engines. For various theater shows I made rundowns and quesheets, and worked on the effects. The most famous illusionist in the Middle East, Afzaal Afridi in Pakistan, I have recently helped twice with a touring show called 'The Fantasists'. In addition, as a project manager I made a number of hybrid and effects shows for amusement parks, such as a large fountain show in Xi'an where the spectators stood between the fountains, and a fountain show with actors and large puppets in Vietnam. Linked to this, I have devised an own IP for organizations, characters and identity, with which stories can be conveyed more easily. Three of my shows have won an international award. \nKeywords: Creative, Design, Project manager, Logistics, Master planning, Solutions, Purchasing, Construction, Magic, Fantasy, IP, Identity.",
