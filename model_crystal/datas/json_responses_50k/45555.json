    "summary": "An enthusiastic and driven person with the motto: \"Everything has something positive\". By combining different fields of knowledge, I am able to solve problems easily and create fast, good and creative concepts. Whenever I have something in mind, I will implement it to a succes. I can be characterized as an innovative and entrepreneurial person with a clear vision for future trends. I am an initiator / generator of ideas, but I need good people around me to make these ideas reach their full potential. I am convinced it is important to use the power of every person in the team to achieve our goal. I stand for sincerity, honesty and attach great importance to appreciation. I am allergic to: \"We always do it like that\" because this hampers progress. Standing still is moving backwards!",
