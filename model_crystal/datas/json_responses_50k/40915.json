    "summary": "Nigel Browne as Information Manager is responsible for the upkeep of the IHS library collection and content provision required to support course development and implementation. He also maintains contacts with external libraries and information networks, manages the subscriptions of (on-line) journals, and arranges access to the ever-increasing number of publications that become available digitally. He advises course coordinators on the availability of relevant publications, sources and references that may be of interest to their courses and thematic interests, manages the acquisition of new publications, and assists in assembling materials for thematic readers. Since January 2014 he has also been involved in helping to develop a Resource Hub on the internet for the EU Transformative Social Innovation Theory (TRANSIT) project, a project for which IHS is responsible for Communication and Dissemination. The Transit project ended in December 2017 and it is archived at http://www.transitsocialinnovation.eu/ Since then I have developed a number of further knowledge products on the IHS website including the SDG 11 Resource Hub (see: https://www.ihs.nl/en/resources/library/sdg-11-knowledge-hub) and four sections of the COVID-19 Resource Hub (see: https://www.ihs.nl/en/resources/covid-19-resource-hub). The section on Journal Articles is the section that receives the most regular updates listing the latest articles reflecting the social, economic and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on cities and towns in low-income countries in particular (see: https://www.ihs.nl/en/journal-articles-covid-19)",
