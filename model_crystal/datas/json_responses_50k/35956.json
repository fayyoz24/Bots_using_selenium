South America was my next destination, I visited Peru, Argentina, Uruguay and Chille and I love South America. I moved on to New-Zealand and Australia and my last destination was Asia. I started my Southeasth Asia trip in Singapore and ended up in Cambodia via Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. After this I had the pleasure to visit Japan before going back to Europe. When I came back I stayed with a friend in London and decided to apply for a job in London to also get experience working and living abroad and of course London is amazing. I initially was planning on staying for a few months and ended up staying almost 2 years.  While I was in London I worked for Lego in a customer advisor role for a few months and for a Media Company as a language specialist. My English is at professional level now.",
