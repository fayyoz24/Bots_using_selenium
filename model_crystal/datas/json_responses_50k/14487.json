Currently, I have 20+ years experience with the drug regulatory process from different perspectives. As the reguIatory affairs field is constantly evolving, I regularly face new challanges and learn new things. \n\nSpecialties:\nRegulatory Affairs (CMC)\nQuality\nCompliance\nRegulatory filings worldwide (EU, US, Japan, China, Emerging Markets)\nRegulatory procedures (national, MRP, CP)\nRegulatory strategy\nChange Control (post-approval changes)\nCompliance\nProject management\n(Organic) chemistry\nDrug Master Files / CEP\nAPI (Small Molecules)\nSterile products / parenteral products\nAseptic manufacturing\nComplex innovative products\nDifferent dosage forms\nPolymers (blends, membranes, permeability, extrusion)",
