    "summary": "I aim to develop scientifically grounded, effective, sustainable solutions and strategies to address violent conflict and climate crises toward sustainable development goals (SDGs). I focus on climate action's human and cultural dimensions, especially the interaction between values, norms, sacred worldviews and climate action (SDG#13) and peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG#16). Societal challenges such as climate crises and violent conflict involve human behaviour to understand and address them. Understanding the inescapable moral makeup of human persons and the deep moral and spiritual underpinnings that structure human culture and pattern human behaviour and action is crucial. Values, norms and (sacred) worldviews remain central to people's decisions and actions. Studying them, therefore, allows me to pursue the fundamental principle informing my research vision of developing appropriate strategies to address societal challenges. The research I undertook under the (NWA-Idea Generator) in the project titled 'Invoking the Sacred: Towards Alternative Approaches Against Climate Conflicts' showed that the sacred relationship the communities I studied have with their natural environment shapes how they respond to conflicts involving the environment. I am a Climate Security Research Associate at the Consultative International Group on Agricultural Research, where my role is to mainstream values and worldviews in climate security research and practice.",
