This Dutchman combines the beautiful simplicity of the blues with the vivid storytelling of folk. His repertoire consists of original work, but also traditionals shaped to his own style and sound. In between songs he'll gladly share all the great stories and adventures that surround his music.\n\nHe plays solo or with his band 'The Gone Wrong Kings' consisting of his lifelong friends Max Sombroek, Jelle Himmelreich, Frank Ensink op Kemna and his younger brother Peter Ankon\u00e9. The extra punch they give to the music is undeniable and the on-stage chemistry pulls the audience into this group of friends, to jam out together.\n\nErik lives in Amsterdam, but plays all across The Netherlands from dusty old caf\u00e9s to big festivals, from living rooms to major venues. As the stage, not the studio, is his favorite playground, be sure to spot him in his natural habitat.",
