Any public or private middle/high school can join. As a student and committed member of the GIN I took action with our GIN group at the International School of Bremen to organize projects to raise awareness of the global issues taking place in this world. Our GIN Group at our school held a conference where we raised awareness about international fishing, ocean pollution and other ocean threats. We attended GIN Conferences in Milan and Luxembourg."
