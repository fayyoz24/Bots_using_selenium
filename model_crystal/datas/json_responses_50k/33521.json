My expertise lies in data-driven analysis, marketing automation, and data visualization. Proficiency in tools like Excel, PowerBI, and SQL has empowered me to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and contribute to informed decision-making.\n\nMy ability to bridge the gap between business and technology, translating intricate customer needs into clear insights, has been a key asset in my career journey. I have a proven track record of success in agile product development, collaborating seamlessly across diverse teams, and fostering innovation in decision-making processes.\n\nAs I transition into the role of a Business Analyst, I'm excited to broaden my skill set, including delving into Python, while maintaining a strong commitment to continuous learning. My aim is to bring my knowledge and expertise to the world of business analysis (ideally in a marketing or procurement setting) and to create value through data-driven insights.\n\nBeyond my professional life, I wear many hats: from a freelance photographer and graphic designer to a creative writer and a language enthusiast. My passion for sports, travel, and gaming adds a unique perspective to my life and work. It's these diverse experiences that fuel my creativity and drive.\n\nIn everything I do, whether it's a new project, volunteering for charity organizations, or mentoring individuals in their career journeys, my ultimate goal is to make a positive impact and leave a lasting impression. I'm deeply committed to giving back to the community, using my skills to effect meaningful and lasting change, and helping individuals reach their full potential through mentorship.\n\nIf you're seeking to expand your network with a dynamic and innovative professional who's passionate about making a difference, I'd be thrilled to connect with you.

Our job was to create a comprehensive study of omni-channel solutions, and the impact they are expected to have on the shopping experience of customers. \n\nThe team first established the context for discussing the existing and potential solutions by providing an overview of 1) the personal luxury goods market, 2) the available channels and 3) the consumer decision journey of luxury customers. In the follow-up, we compiled several omni-channel solutions from fashion companies that are in different stages of this change process, while also identifying the key actions that industry players have to take and pitfalls they have to avoid in order to become successful in this competition.\nLastly, we created a short case, in order to demonstrate how omni-channel solutions can be woven  into every step of the customer journey to improve the consumer experience. To establish the case, we employed desktop research, and conducted in-store interviews with major chains in Milan, such as Gucci, Burberry, Prada and Versace, as well as with luxury hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental and the Seven Stars Galleria.",
