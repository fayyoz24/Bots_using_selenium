    "summary": "I am a Bioprocess Engineer with experience in process design, optimization and cost engineering. I am motivated to work in innovative projects that are sustainable and economically driven, involving a multidisciplinary team. \nI just graduated in August 2016 from a two year post-graduation in TU Delft as a PDEng trainee in Bioprocess Engineering. I also finished my one year individual project at BE-BASIC (The Netherlands) that consisted in the design of a sugarcane biorefinery for jet fuel and succinic acid production in Brazil, from milling to oil hydrotreating. My work included Aspen process simulation, equipment design, economic evaluation, feedstock logistics and LCA analysis. In the first year, I was part of a team working for ECN (The Netherlands), where we designed isobutanol valorisation processes, at full and pilot scale as well as their economical evaluation.\nPreviously, I worked two years in CQFM (Portugal) in polymers synthesis for wastewater treatment. During my master thesis I worked in polymers and coatings surface analysis at Cork Supply (Portugal). \nDue to my multidisciplinary experience I\u00b4m able to work both in upstream or downstream processes and apply my skills of equipment and process design, modelling and simulation, scale-up/scale-down, techno-economic evaluation and statistical data analysis.",

These technologies included sugarcane milling, bagasse pretreatment, ethanol and farnesene fermentation, lignin/ bagasse fast pyrolysis and gasification Fischer-Tropsch and auxiliary sections (wastewater treatment, co-generation and hydrogen steam reforming). Selection was done based on minimum selling price, GHG and NREU emissions.\nIn the 2nd phase of the project I designed in detail the bagasse pretreatment, including a section for acetic acid and furfural recovery sections. The design includes process simulation with Aspen/ SuperProDesigner, heat exchangers network after heat integration, equipment design and cost engineering.",
