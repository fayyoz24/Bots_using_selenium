I have more than 20 years\u2019 experience in automotive journalism, I was the editor-in-chief & product owner of Autonavigator.hu from 2011 till the end of 2022 when I resigned. During this time I attended test drives several places of the world and built up a profitable site. I was a well-known specialist in Hungary, but focusing on my sons\u2019 future, in July 2022 we moved to the Netherlands with my family, so that\u2019s why I gave up my job in Hungary.\nAlthough I was not the proprietor, I developed the site as if it was my own. I was not only the editor-in-chief and a journalist but I was the managing director of the site, responsible for the developments and involved in sales activities. As an automotive and communication expert, I formulated the PR articles and was also the spokesperson of the company. Throughout the mentioned tasks I could develop my time management and team-leading skills. \n\nExpertise: PR, content, people and project management, team leading\nKey areas: automotive market and product side, Wordpress content management, photography",
