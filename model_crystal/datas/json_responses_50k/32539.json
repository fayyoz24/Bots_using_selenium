This point was not widely known and outreach needed a big boost in order to update the eligibility criteria for companies coming for recruitment. Moreover, B.Arch is a 5-year course while B.E. courses in other departments are 4-year courses, which the collaboration in the final year with other departments within the same faculty equally challenging in terms of communication.",
