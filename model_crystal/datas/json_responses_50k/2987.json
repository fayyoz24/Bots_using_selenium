    "summary": "I am a firm believer that if you want something, you need to go for it. This also means you have to give your full 100% to achieve what you want. \n\nWhen I just finished my Master's I decided I wanted to start working for a multinational company and be able to move to a far away country after a few year to experience the life of a working person abroad. For this I chose Avanade. At first it looked like my ambition to go far away wasn't going to work out, so I decided to go to China on my own to study Chinese (this is a hobby of mine :)). After this small break I again applied myself to be allowed to be transfer abroad, and this time it worked out! I truly enjoyed my time in Los Angeles and learning about all the differences between the US and the Netherlands both small and big. \n\nAfter a bit over a year, however, I decided I wanted to be closer to my family and friends in the Netherlands (a 9 hour time difference makes staying in touch difficult) and so I moved back to the Netherlands. With this transition back, I also decided it was time for me to broaden my experience in IT away from ERP systems and consultancy. I also wanted to find a job that I can honestly say I love instead of I like. In this search I work for both Nationale Nederlanden and Hogeschool Rotterdam for a short time, until I found that job that I can say I love at Hogeschool Utrecht. \n\nAt Hogeschool Utrecht I am a teacher and coach for the Open ICT bachelor program. In this work I get to guide students into becoming IT professionals. The program is structured in such a way that students work in teams on real projects. We work with SCRUM and every two weeks the students have to show their progress to either their internal Product Owner (i.e., a teacher), or their external Product Owner from the company that facilitates their project. Next to this, I get talk with every student I coach at least once every two weeks in a one-on-one session to discuss their progress and check how they are doing. Next to coaching, I also am part of two Guilds, Backend and Computer Engineering. These Guilds are the knowledge centers for the roles that students can choose in our program, where we share knowledge and review work.\n\nMy interest in the Computer Science domain are relatively broad, but a short list of topics that interest me is:\n- Cloud\n- Home Automation\n- Game Development\n- Game AI\n- Robotics",

I did this first as a developer (first project), but quickly (second project) grew to lead integration developer. In this role I worked with Azure DevOps on Hybrid SCRUM projects. Dynamics 365 for operations has a specific programming language (X++) that is very similar to C# in which I performed development tasks. Next to X++, I also used Azure functionality (Azure Functions, Logic App, Azure Service Bus, API Management, API Gateway, ARM Templates) to realise integrations from D365F&O in the cloud to on premise systems.",
