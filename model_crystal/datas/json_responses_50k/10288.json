    "summary": "Helping people become confident communicators. It's my passion.\n\nI've trained over 1000 people, their feedback and reviews often mention:\n\n\u2705 A safe environment, grow your confidence and expand your comfort-zone.\n\u2705 Overcome nervousness, learn to prepare well and to improvise on the spot.\n\u2705 A lot of practice, with clear feedback and fun.\n\n--> Want to thrive in your presentations and job interviews?\nJoin the 6-week course: Confident Speaker Course. \n\n--> Want to get better negotiation results?\nJoin the 6-week course: Confident Negotiator Course.\n\n\u2018Wow, I never knew that I could improve and enjoy my public speaking skills so much.\u2019\n\nThis is why I do what I do. And oh boy, do I love it. \n\nSo often I receive similar feedback after hosting a workshop. It fills me with joy to see the people I train stand tall and be more confident when presenting or negotiating.\n\nThe world has changed. In today\u2019s global economy, online & offline presentation skills are critical skills to have. Many of us struggle with presentation anxiety, forgetting what they have to say mid-speech, and being put on the spot. Similarly, many of us struggle to negotiate. Afraid of the confrontation and lacking the right tools. All of us benefit from better communication skills.\n\nDo you want to improve your communication skills? \n https://www.presentthing.nl/\n\nOther fulfilling stuff I do:\n- Course Tutor and Administrator for Responsible Business Leadership (Rotterdam School of Management). Training and coaching 22+ tutors each year.\n- Started and running a book club since 2019, passion for acquiring and sharing knowledge (goal: reading 3 good books per month).\n- I spend one day per week doing voluntary work and/or making surfboards.",
