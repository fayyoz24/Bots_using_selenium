Specifically, it studies the role that positive emotions have on the choice of food in individuals that are ego-depleted. Previous literature has found that self-control is a limited resource and as more acts of self-control are performed, this resource is depleted. Ego-depletion is a state where the self has used up the available resources and is left with less self-regulatory strength. It was hypothesized that inducing positive emotions to individuals that are ego-depleted will restore the ability for self-control and lead to choices of healthier food. To date, no systematic investigation has considered the effect that positive emotions could have on decisions where self-control is one of the main variables. This thesis aims to fill a gap in the literature by studying the possible effect that positive emotions have on the choices of food in individuals that have used up their self-control. The data was collected through a 2x2 factorial design experiment. One-Way and Two-Way ANOVA was used to analyze the results. There was an indication that when exposed to positive emotions healthier food is chosen. However, the interaction was very small and not statistically significant. It is suggested that the study is replicated in future research with more respondents and improved design.\n",
