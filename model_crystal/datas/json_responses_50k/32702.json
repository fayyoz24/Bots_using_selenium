We achieved an F-score of 0.82 for botnet detection and a score of 0.8-1.0 for botnet fingerprinting depending on how representative the training set was;\n- Developed classifier to detect credit card fraud in real-world data. We compared the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests classifiers to detect the fraud. Random Forests performed the best as a black-box system, while the results of Decision trees were easiest to explain to a client of why their transaction was classified a certain way. We also used SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets.\n- Developed an anomaly detector to detect attacks on Secure Water Treatment Systems. We used two methods and compared their results: First, we used the highest PCA value of the signal to explain the 'normality' of the system and the lowest PCA to explain the 'anomalies'. Second, we used ARMA model for the time series analysis of the signal and used the residual values that exceeded a threshold to detect anomalies. We found that PCA provided a higher-level view of anomalies on a a system-level, while ARMA was able to detect subtle anomalies that occurred at individual sensor level. ",
