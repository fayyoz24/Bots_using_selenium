Via the website of the foundation people can see which dogs are available here or in the country we rescued the dogs. In local families we keep the dogs to examine the behavior, how the act and what kind of family would fit with the dog. The health of the dogs is key in this, the goal is to make only  one successful adoption per dog. This to avoid more stress for the dogs. People that want a dog, get a visit to check both environment and people to be as much as confident as we can be that the dog will fit in. http://hondenzondertoekomst.nl"
