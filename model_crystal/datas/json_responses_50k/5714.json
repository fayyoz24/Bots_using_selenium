One such bottom-up, participatory process was the development of a Regional Framework for Development in West Uganda. The support to the setting up and growth of the organic agriculture sectors in Tanzania and Kenya included the development of value chains and stimulating Private Public Partnerships and tailor made capacity building of partners in these areas. I\u2019ve set up evaluations and gave presentations at workshops, conferences and seminars. Support to organic and fair trade agriculture involved also support to IFOAM at the worldwide level and to training organizations at the local level. \nI greatly enjoyed designing and facilitating tailor made trainings in quality management systems with training organisations, networks and producer groups to empower them in participating in value-chains.",

Part of the responsibility was to contribute to policy development on sustainability issues and translate these to specific policy for Africa, strategic development, building up of a portfolio, initiating studies, workshops, and campaigns. One of the topics was genetic modification and I initiated a series of workshops and studies to support the lobby and awareness raising on socio-economic and environmental effects of genetic engineering, as well as capacity building activities with networks and organisations on biodiversity and local variety seed systems. Biodiversity initiatives in Eastern and South Africa were added to the portfolio.\nAt that time (2001-2003) I became a board member of the Dutch Platform Gene Technology (NPG). Environment and economy policies of Hivos were merged and the focus on inclusive commercialisation of agriculture increased. One of the activities was to organize a strategic workshop on commercialisation of the organic agriculture sector in Zambia and one spin-off was a Private Public Partnerships (PPP) with Woolworths in South Africa. After a fact finding mission a long term strategic plan for development of value chains in the context of the Black Economic Empowerment programme, involving smallholder farmers producing organic food for Woolworths was established. \nIn addition to my work as Sector Specialist Environment, I coordinated EU projects for Bureau Africa.",

Other activities, such as raising awareness on environmental and development issues as part of the UNCED process in the Netherlands, and organizing meetings were added. I was involved in setting up workshops and awareness raising activities on food security, water and multi-functional land use (FAO, World Water Forum II) and expert meetings. \nIn 1993, I acted as an interim Sector Specialist Environment at Oxfam Novib.\nAs coordinator Sustainable Land Use, I was involved in the negotiation for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and mitigating the effects of Drought (UNCCD). I organized an NGO workshop in Geneva, leading to the set up of the international NGO network on desertification: RIOD. The aim was to contribute effectively to the UNCCD by bringing in issues of concern to civil society. I was in the steering group, organizing advocacy and lobby activities, workshops, donor meetings, media events and Open Dialogue Sessions in the Conference of Parties (COPs), publications and media kits. During that time I gave many presentations of the subject. One of the workshops was on gender mainstreaming and strengthening the role of women in the implementation of UNCCD, which led to become a co-writer of a training manual on gender mainstreaming that UNSO/UNDP used to give training in many countries.\nBesides board member of RIOD (international and EU level), I was elected as a board member for ELCI (Environmental Liaison Centre International), and as a European representative to the IFAD \u2013 NGO consultations.\nI was invited to join the official Dutch Delegation to UNCCD and was added to the Rooster of Experts of UNCCD.",
