    "summary": "'How to develop solidarity alternatives to counterbalance the dominant neoliberal and capitalist systems that are part of our daily lives and nestle into our bodies and clothes, artistic practices and even education?'\n\nLenn Cox is a community organizer, designer, educator, programme maker and karateka. Graduated in 2020 from the ArtEZ MA Practice Held in Common, where she initiated and co-created the manual Collective Wandering: Hanging Out with Our Everyday Ecology. Cox explores solidarity economies by immersing herself in self-organised learning-working-living environments While engaging her clothes as correspondence, to carry the exchanges and stories she collects as a topic of conversation. Fashion, for Cox, is an embodied and relational practice rooted in everyday life. As educator and community organizer she initiates spaces and projects that facilitate collective learning.\n\nCox is the co-founder of SHIFT, a nomadic 24-hour unlearning school, and initiated in 2019 the z o m e r k a m p collective in which she explores and practices what it means to have a collective practice at this moment in time. As linen steward, Lenn learned how to grow, process and craft with a group our everyday textiles and garments by hand, with commoning as a guiding principle.\nCox lives in Arnhem (the Netherlands) and works wandering.\n\nKeywords: social ecology, collective care, relational activism, intentional communities, alternative fashion practices, solidarity economies, collective wandering\n\nInstagram @lenncox",

Each day we will organise workshops and interventions there facilitated by artists and designers: Tina Lenz, Cultural Workers Unite, De Voorkamer, and gruppe tag. Each workshop can be attended separately, or you can register for the entire week.\nhttps://bureauruimtekoers.nl/akademie/agenda-akademie/\n\nDuring the Akademieweek we create space to explore and experience the role of the artist within the context of gentrification. Because, how do you work as a participatory maker within these systemic challenges? How do you interact with all of those stakeholders and avoid that you become their instrument? And above all: how do you work together with residents, while they might have something else on their mind?",

An assemblage of six women[2] which sprung from a need for more commonality in our professional practices and lives, wondering how to expand from I to We. Each of us has their own art and or design practice, based on a fashion background. Further common ground for the collective is that we all work in the field of education, in various forms. \nz o m e r k a m p explores what it means to have a collective practice at this moment in time. In the cultural field, which is indicative of society at large, we experience the urgency for skills based on love, care and cooperation, rather than burnout and competition. We share the insight and tools we assemble as a collective by hosting programmes and in the act of facilitating.\n---------\n[1] The publication is available among others via: WALTER books, San Serriffe, Warehouse, Framer Framed, rile*, Well Projects, Page Not Found, NAi Booksellers and Lenn Cox \n[2] Aliki van der Kruijs, Melanie Bomans, Sanne Karssenberg, Niki Milioni, Rosanne van Wijk and Lenn Cox",

                    "description": "In the spring of 2019 I began immersing myself in different self-organised communities and collectives in and around Europe. After experiencing various collective practices, I wanted to share them and created the publication[1] It is not a manual in the traditional sense, with linear instructions or guidelines; rather, it is a hopefully engaging collection of insights, moments and encounters, experienced during my continuing artistic research. The intention of this manual is to inspire and support kindred individuals who are in search of an alternative rhythm of learning-working-living, sharing multiform co-production processes of self-organisation concerning our common everyday lives.\n\nAccompanying my own contributions, I have invited various practitioners who resonate with me on a personal and professional level to respond to our shared experiences, in relation to their respective practices. With contributions by Tigrilla Gardenia(Damanhur), Sepideh Ardalani(MASSIA), Jessica Gysel(Girls Like Us, Mothers & Daughters Bar), Tomboys Don\u02bct Cry, Lucas Meyer(Sanctuary Slimane), Katerina Tarnovska(Asgarda), Alya Hessy, Lucie Chaptal(we made together), Marlies van Hak, Aliki van der Kruijs, Guusje de Bruin, Melanie Bomans, Niki Milioni, Rosanne van Wijk, Sanne Karssenberg and Femke de Vries. Graphic design by Heike Ren\u00e9e de Wit.\nThe result is a textual and visual gathering of conversations, testimonials and observations, from essays to poetry, from clothing to recipes. I recognise the realisation of this publication as an extension of my curatorial nomadic practice, in which I initiate collaborative projects and co-facilitate spaces of collective care. This manual is such a space. I see it as a living document, an ongoing conversation. An open invitation to go on a collective adventure with your own everyday ecology.\n\n[1] The publication is available among others via: WALTER books, San Serriffe, Warehouse, rile*, Well Projects, Page Not Found, NAi Booksellers and Lenn Cox",

For each new edition SHIFT invites a progressive practitioner as a tutor to develop a 24-hour scenario for one or more participants. The enactment of design around the human body is a core theme. During those 24 hours, design performance, research, collaboration, experiment, feedback loops and trial-and-error playfully take place. SHIFT creates a dynamic network through online registrations of editions.\n\nSHIFT is a Parallel Playground / Bypass / Network of Workshops / Tool / Nomadic Academy / Interface / Exploring 24hr School / Historical Undergarment (according to Siri)\nPlaying Pilots",

Working closely with companies and individuals from multiple disciplines she creates intuitive visual stories, inspired by what lies ahead and what is grounded in history. She has worked on several ventures in which she has taken on the role of an exhibition maker, curator, art director, tutor, collector, connector, sparring-partner and creative organizer.  info@lenncox.nl",
