    "summary": "How will the world's Arctic ecosystems change in a rapidly warming climate? I investigate relations between permafrost degradation, vegetation succession and climate change in the remote lowland tundra of north-eastern Siberia and  Svalbard. Key processes I study are extreme summer rainfall events, small scale thermokarst and resulting vegetation succession processes. I teach in various ecology courses and the Plant Ecology & Nature Conservation Group of Wageningen University and guide students through their theses, assignments and internships. \n\nI'm passionate about environmental research and solving all kinds of puzzles. I have previous experience working on diverse topics such as LiDAR remote sensing data and isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and also in my current project I enjoy combining different angles of approach to get the most complete insight into complex processes.\n\nMy current work mostly includes:\n\u2022\tTeaching in various ecological disciplines (from field ecology to modelling and GIS)\n\u2022\tSupervision of BSc/MSc theses, internships and group assignments\n\u2022\tDesigning and carrying out geo-ecological field experiments and monitoring\n\u2022\tEcological data analysis, statistics, machine learning \n\u2022\tGeographical Information Systems & Remote Sensing data analysis\n\u2022\tDendrochronology on Arctic dwarf shrubs\n\u2022\tWriting scientific articles and casually experimenting with different outreach format (blogs, videos, art)\n\nI also do longsword fencing as a hobby. It's really cool, but nothing like what you see in Game of Thrones. \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Runa-Magnusson",

During the past decade, numerous researchers have reported trends of shrub expansion under warmer conditions in tundra ecosystems. However, we also see increasing manifestations of abrupt permafrost thaw, such as thaw ponds and slumps.\n\nOur overarching aim is to determine (1) whether lowland tundra ecosystems show a net decline or expanse of shrub vegetation, (2) how this is related to abrupt permafrost thaw and (3) to what extent this is caused by extreme summer precipitation.\n\nI combine remote sensing analysis, long term monitoring of vegetation and abiotic conditions in permanent plots at the Kytalyk field station and manipulation experiments in the field. I use techniques such as land cover classification on time series of very high resolution satellite data and dendrochronology to study trends in shrub expansion/decline. I use permanent plots and mixed model approaches to study development of vegetation in thaw ponds and association with abiotic conditions. Lastly, I use an irrigation set-up to study the effects of increased summer precipitation (as is currently anticipated by climate models for the Arctic) on permafrost stability.",
