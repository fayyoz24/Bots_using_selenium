    "summary": "Filemon Lim , performance artist, was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. He studied at Codarts - University for the arts in the Netherlands. He finished Cum Laude and received the Prize for Art.\nMukarno is a unique figure in Contemporary Art. The use of of his own body is one of his trademarks. The performance arts demonstrate in their own way his original ideas and his strife for intense expressiveness, in a language that does not refer to tradition. Each piece has a strong economy of Means and a strict control of Form. Means and Form are use by Mukarno in an elementary and powerful way.\nHis works are performed on International Music Festivals as: Gamelan Festival in Yogjakarta, Indonesia, El Segundo Festival International de M\u00fasica Cl\u00e1sica Contempor\u00e1nea in Lima, Peru, Rotterdam Music Biennial, Internationale Studienwoche f\u00fcr Zeitgen\u00f6ssische Musik 2000 in Lunenburg, Germany ,Internationaal Gamelan Festival Amsterdam (IGFA) and Musica Eterna Dubrovnik.\nHe cooperates frequently with artists from other disciplines such as choreographers, dancers, and performers. As well as music for theatre and motion pictures.\nSpectacularly was his Art Installation with the title Dejeuner sur l\u2019 herbe, a cooperation with the artist Wim Salki witch was exposed in Gotheart Kunstforum in Cologne, Germany.",
