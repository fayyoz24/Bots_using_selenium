We will address all five solutions specified in the application requirements, working in all of the basin\u2019s landscapes and focusing on improved water management in the main economic activities of the basin: agriculture, cattle ranching, and wildlife-based tourism. A single, well-coordinated initiative will enable the basin-scale interconnection of knowledge, policies, institutions, markets, and good practices that is required for structural poverty reduction, sustainable economic growth, and ecosystem conservation. It will also provide a platform for the engagement of new partners (Kenyan and international) and a systematic expansion of activities that further benefit the basin and its people",
