    "summary": "(For English please see below)\nAls strateeg en organisatievereenvoudiger\u00ae heb ik een interdisciplinaire focus. Ik ben op mijn best in complexe, nieuwe en/of veranderende (internationale) omgevingen, omdat ik graag zaken vereenvoudig. Door mij als bedrijfskundige te specialiseren in het professionaliseren van bedrijfsvoering binnen zowel profit als non-profit, gedij ik ook goed in (politiek) bestuurlijke omgevingen. Ik overzie snel complexe zaken en krijg mensen gemakkelijk mee in veranderingen door de logica van gedrag te laten inzien, waarmee ik zorg voor duurzame goed onderbouwde praktische oplossingen in plaats van een dik adviesrapport. Met een hoog EQ werk ik professioneel en diplomatiek, maar menselijk en met humor. Zowel verbaal als schriftelijk ben ik sterk en kom als creatieve snel-denker ook vlot tot concrete besluiten.\nEigenlijk is dit vakje veel te klein voor een goede beschrijving van mij. Meer informatie is te vinden op: \nwww.delcour.nl/cv\n(lees ook over mijn passie voor vereenvoudigen)\n\nAs a strategist and Firm simplifier, I have an interdisciplinary focus. I am at my best in complex, new and/or changing (international) environments, because I like to simplify matters. By focussing on the professionalization of business management itself within both profit and non-profit, I also thrive within (politically) administrative environments. I quickly oversee complex issues and easily win people over to change by showing them the logic of behaviour, by which I provide sustainable and well-founded practical solutions instead of a thick management-report. With a high EQ my approach is professional and tactful, but always humane and with humour; i.e. good stakeholder management. I am strong both verbally and in written form and \u2013as creative quick-thinker\u2013 come up with prompt specific decisions. \nActually this box is too small for a proper description of me, more details about me at:\nwww.delcour.nl \n(also read about my passion for simplification)",

To change this situation a better insight in all the financial flows was necessary. The three separate financial flows that ROC Zeeland used in the execution of teaching were utilized as one. This did not give enough and/or correct management information for a positive execution of all programs. Besides the disentanglement of the financial income-flows \u2018earmarked funds\u2019, \u2018subsidy funds\u2019 and \u2018commercial funds\u2019, there was a great financial risk as ROC Zeeland was not able to give account for the received funds, possibly resulting in repayment of large parts of those funds. After disentangling the funds and having scrutinized the financial risks, new policies were framed, the digital financial data needed to be computerized into automated systems and was linked to different operating digital platforms. New and complete management information as a result helped to interpret the financial risks and enabled giving account for separate financial flows. \u2028This complicated wide-ranging financial project, was executed to the satisfaction of the Executive Board of ROC Zeeland.

For Intergraf, this means that we work closely with our counterpart trade union, UNI Europa Graphical & Packaging, and the European Commission on social issues which affect our industry.\n\nIntergraf and UNI Europa Graphical, with the support of the European Commission, established a European sectoral social dialogue committee in 2013. Before this date, the social partners had regular meetings and exchanges of information and cooperated in the past in various ways. Since beginning social dialogue, we have intensified collaboration, working together on various projects and joint initiatives. Importantly, the European sectoral social dialogue of the graphical industry will tackle subjects of importance to the sector as a whole, but will not interfere with the autonomy of the national social partners in determining terms and conditions of employment in their national contexts.\n\nIntergraf members and other stakeholders are invited to join two Working Groups and one Plenary of the graphic industry's European Social Dialogue Committee annually."
