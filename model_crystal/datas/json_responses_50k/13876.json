I also took on responsibility beyond my role and became lead advisor to an international client in one of my team\u2019s largest assignment.\n\nAssignments included, amongst others, the following:\n-\tStarting out with being a supporting economist, I was asked to become lead advisor to an Irish local authority in a complex state aid investigation by the European Commission (EC) regarding a waste-to-energy facility in Ireland. I assisted by managing communication with the EC, writing response documents to the EC, conducting economic and financial analysis as well as facilitating in negotiations with the aid recipient on amendments to the project agreement. In result, the aid was approved by the EC and the project allowed to be realised; \n-\tAn economic analysis of a Dutch hospital merger with the purpose to show that it would not substantially reduce competition between the hospitals . Result: the merger was approved by the Dutch competition authority; and\n-\tA review of a guarantee scheme by the Dutch Ministry to small- and medium-sized enterprises for compliance with European state aid rules. Result: the scheme was approved by the EC; \n\nThe analysis conducted by me was always perceived by colleagues and clients as being of high quality. Clients said that they liked my pro-active way of working and out-of-the box thinking to help them achieve the desired outcome.",
