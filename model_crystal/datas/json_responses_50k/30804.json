She performed her PhD-study at the Department of Nephrology of the Leiden University Medical Center in Leiden and the Laboratory for Immunological Research of Schering-Plough in Dardilly, France. She defended her thesis about functional modulation of human dendritic cells in kidney transplantation cum laude in 2002. She continued her research on regulation of human dendritic cell function and development at the Department of Nephrology in Leiden and focussed on dendritic cells as potential tools and targets to prevent allograft rejection. In 2006, she became group leader and staff member at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam. Since 2013 she is appointed as associate professor. She was leading a research group on the immunology of viral hepatitis, especially chronic hepatitis B, and virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Her research group aimed (1) to determine the immunological factors and processes involved in viral clearance and persistence and development of virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, and (2) to develop effective immunotherapies to cure chronic viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Main immunological and molecular processes that are studied include viral antigen presentation, virus-host interaction and regulation of antigen-specific T cell responses, in which dendritic cells play a major role. She published many research papers and several book chapters, received many research grants, including the prestigious VENI and VIDI grants from ZonMW/NWO, and received several awards during her scientific career.",
