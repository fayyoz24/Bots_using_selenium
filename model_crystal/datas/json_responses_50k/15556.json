    "summary": "How to conceive new products, services or businessmodels? How to introduce self-organisation or create an agile and innovative mindset in your organisation? And what role plays leadership in all this? As Ynnovator, I help companies and organisations to boost their innovation & innovative capacity. \n\nI firmly believe that continuous change, adaptation and improvement is mandatory for companies to survive and thrive in the current dynamical environment. My ambition is to help companies and organizations to become full-fledged innovators. The ultimate goal is to get innovation into their DNA. \n\nMy special interest is bio-inspired innovation, also known as biomimicry, bionics and biomimetics. It is an out-of-the-box innovation method that uses nature as its source of inspiration for breakthrough technical and organisational innovations. Nature has been puzzling for almost 4 billion years with all kinds of challenges ranging from locomotion to strategy, from sustainability to logistics and from teamwork to climate control. And found out how to make it work.\n\nSpecialties: Innovation, innovatie, bionics, bionica, biomimicry, biomimetics, bio-inspired innovation, bio-geinspireerde innovatie, creativity, consultancy, management, coaching, leadership.",
