    "summary": "I am a historian working in the field of gender history and the history of the body. My current project studies forensic experts' embodied performances: their emotions, dress and epistemic virtues. I am interested in how ideals of what it means to be an expert were embedded in gender, class and sexuality norms in Great Britain, 1920-2021. I also research how this influenced knowledge-making practices. My previous projects also focused on the history of the body and gender but I applied this lens to dance culture. Here my passion for history and dance were united. In addition to being a historian, I am also a dance teacher. In my dance classes, I apply my knowledge on gender and its impact on embodied experiences.",
