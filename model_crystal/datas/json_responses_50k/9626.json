    "summary": "I am a Mechatronics R&D Engineer until recently working at Cadac Group, a leading provider of software solutions for design, engineering, and construction. I have over a year of experience in developing and integrating innovative mechatronic systems for various industries, using software development and cloud computing skills.\n\nMy passion for knowledge, understanding, and science drives me to explore the unknown, experiment, learn new skills, and creatively solve complex problems. Furthermore, I have a unique background in 3D computer graphics, animation, and concept design, which I acquired in Israel while working on my own short film. I also have a professional diploma in CGI and a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering with honours. I aim to fuse science, engineering, storytelling, research, and a dash of magic into one bright spark of light.",

Almost everything is imported or self made and you will not find any other shop like it in Israel.\nWe have an immense variety of costumes, masks, props, makeup and so on - All in professional quality and grade. During the year, we work a lot with professionals, event runners actors and entertainment production companies and help them bring that magic to life.\nDuring the holiday season, Purim / Halloween, the shop holds its largest selection and the doors are fully opened to the public.\nOne of the things we pride ourselves over is the personal attention / touch / service that we offer our magic-seekers. So many people arrive, that at some point, in order to maintain a pleasant experience and service at the shop, we must close the doors until customers are done and space is available again.\nAs a result, queues of up to 300 people or more can form outside of the shop.\nWhile exhausting, I also highly enjoyed helping my family at the shop. I served as an extension of my parents and got to use my creativity to help our customers transform into their hearts' desires, even if the costume was not readily available! That is one of the shop's strengths! We have so many different props and accessories, that with a creative approach, you can solve any problem and fulfill anyone's dreams.\nApparently I was good at what I did, since many customers came back year after year looking for me, even after I couldn't come and help anymore. It's nice to know that I managed to create a positive experience for so many people :)\n\nWhile I would have loved to go and keep helping my parents at the shop every year, since moving to the Netherlands, starting to study and becoming a father - my yearly adventure at Effect sadly had to end.",

In animals and in human ingenuity. \nPrior to this study, I have spent most of my earlier life busy with creating and using my imagination and creativity to make things come to life. I self-taught myself a large array of CAD / CGI software for over 7 years and once out of the army, sought to develop my skills further and take things to the next level.\nThat's where IAC came in. I wished to create world and creatures and quite literally blur the lines between our world and the veil of magic many of us do not often notice.\n\nDuring this study I sought to learn, keep up with the college tasks, research, explore and learn as much as possible. Use the staff and class' knowledge to expand my horizons. Take any small task and make it Orribly Gigantic ;)\nI often broke the conventions and achieved things that my teachers / staff thought to be unrealistic or night impossible.",
