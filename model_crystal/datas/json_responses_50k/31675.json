Each of these roles principally required the management and development of talented individuals to achieve stretch goals for continuously improving quality, speed and cost performance of the breweries. Through these roles I learnt how to manage ever increasing numbers of employees but mostly how to lead and develop people using SABMiller\u2019s People Way and high-performance culture methods. I also learnt how to work with my teams to improve processes and operational practices by implementing Lean, Six Sigma and World Class Manufacturing techniques.",
