    "summary": "I am an astrophysicist looking for new challenges in technology and space in the Netherlands. I'm very excited about the real-life applications of my work, and I seek social impact.\n\nI have a BSc and a MSc in (astro)physics with heavy research and teaching experience. My PhD research involved studying the Universe through cosmological simulations. I have used a variety of numerical, analytical, and theoretical techniques to study black holes. I have worked on model optimisation, both analytically and numerically. \n\nI am also a co-founder of Astro Burgas, an NGO focused on bringing astronomy education closer to high school students from places with limited contact to astronomy institutions in Bulgaria. We organise educational and popular events, workshops, nigh sky hikes, and more.",

It affects the cosmic large-scale structure, from which the imminent generation of sky surveys (Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) aim to constrain the cosmological parameters. Baryonic feedback is thereby a major nuisance, creating biases and uncertainties. In this project we develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model in order to propagate a series of astronomical informations into the cosmological inference, in order to remove Baryonic feedback as good as we can.\n\nSupervisor: Dr Elena Sellentin",
