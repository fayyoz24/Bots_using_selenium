    "summary": "I have worked in every layer of IT skill from electronic hardware and chip design with Texas Instruments, to IT operations management and systems development and at Logica, and most recently as a Solution Architect for high performance data management systems at Dell-EMC. \n\nIf you have issues to solve but don't know where to start get in touch.\n\nAreas that especially interest me are technical documentation and documentation management, IT process design, and education in any area of IT from hands on building and coding to project management and IT processes. \n\nI have a degree in Applied Physics for the generalist basics, and an MBA that helps with a holistic view of a given issue.\n\nI enjoy coding and hardware design general. I am currently busy with a number of microcomputer and Python projects. I wrote a clone of Space Invaders for Android in Java. Go to https://www.chisholm.nl/invaders/invaders.html# to see game play in the Android studio emulator, and to get the code. \n\nSetting up my website is my current personal project. It is crafted from HTML, CSS, and Java Script, take a look at: https://www.chisholm.nl/\n\nI work and speak in English and Dutch. I write in and translate to English. I would like to learn more about DITA.",

I provide technical consultancy solving and troubleshooting customers' elusive problems. My current \"Big\" design project is a \"Big Data\" collection and analysis system using 288 Isilon NAS nodes.\nI design around all of the major platforms supplied by Dell EMC, including the traditional Symmetrix/VMAX/PowerMax and VNX/Unity products, and the newer scalable products like, Isilon, VxRail, ECS, and XtremIO. I design for data continuity using VPLEX, and RecoverPoint, and SAN infrastructure with Cisco and Brocade products. On the storage related software front I design environments using ViPR, ViPR SRM, ControlCenter, Smarts, and NCM; for example, recently I designed the Monitoring and Reporting for cloud and traditional IaaS environments at a major Dutch Bank.\nI am internally Dell EMC accredited as a performance guru for VMAX, Unified, VPLEX, ScaleIO, and RecoverPoint systems.\nIn addition to the technical aspects of my work, I created the service delivery processes, documentation system, and macro powered MS Word templates used for service delivery in The Netherlands. I also led training sessions for the delivery team in Word and Visio to optimize their use of the templates.\nA large part of my work is requirements discovery and technical writing in the form of System Requirements Specifications, Solution Designs, and Health Check Reports.",
