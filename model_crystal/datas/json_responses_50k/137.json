    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4bHey there, great to see you here!\n\nMy life goal is to inspire people and help the world to be a better place for everyone. It sounds cheesy, I know, but it's true. :)\n\nProfessionally, I encourage others to get one step closer to their best version, by exchanging experiences and guiding professionals to a brighter future in the Netherlands. \nIn my private life, in 2018, via my Instagram page, I created a project called \"Brasileiras na Holanda\", where I organize encounters of Brazilian women living in the Netherlands, helping them to meet each other and to create a support network in the \"tulip and windmill\" country, so far we have already had 15 meetings, and many connections were created. I am proud to say that I have already connected over 200 women through this beautiful project.\n\nI was born in Brazil and since I moved to the Netherlands, in 2014, I have been working as International Recruiter. I have also lived in NY, the US, for a while, and it was a blast! * Yes, I love travelling (and living) around the world and eating my way through the places I visit. \n\nI thrive in rapidly growing, innovative organizations, I\u2019m passionate about providing the best recruiting experience for candidates and hiring managers in an end-to-end recruitment process.\nHands-on experience with international databases, focusing on the desired project result. \nI enjoy bringing in and executing new ideas, as well as working on improving existing processes in order to elevate positive results.\n\nMy Bachelor's degree is in Tourism Management, but recruitment took my heart, so here I'm! \n\nI speak English and Portuguese at a fluent level, advanced Dutch and intermediate Spanish, so I guess I can cover a lot!\ud83c\udf0e \n\nCharacteristics:\n\u2736 Communicative\n\u2736 Positivity\n\u2736 Engaging people \n\nFull-on yellow energy! :) Ah, because of my passion for social media, over the last six years, I have been in charge of the social media channels of the companies I worked for.\n\nDutch nationality\nInternational | Recruitment | Business Development and Strategic Marketing | Lead Generation | Innovation | Customer Focus | CRM | Passion|  LATAM | Team Worker | Flexibility | Candidate journey freak!",
