    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn profile, \nMy name is Pelle van Keulen, currently I am living in Leeuwarden. \n\nI am a student at NHLStenden University of Applied Sciences pursuing a Bachelor of International Hotel Management degree. Before Leeuwarden and NHL stenden I did havo at Thorbecke scholengemeenschap in Zwolle. \n\nI am attending NHL stenden, because I knew I wanted to do Hotel management school. When I first came to the school, it gave me a really good feeling. Nice and friendly people and what a big school. I knew for sure now that I wanted to attend NHL stenden. \n\nI am trying my best to get my propaedeutic. I am applying all the things that is have learned the past year, to get the best result out of my study time. Quitting is one thing that I don't do, so I keep 'fighting' till the end. \n\nBut looking at the future, my career interest is to have my own restaurant or catering company. Currently I work at a catering company called Stern. I got a leading role and I learn a lot of having a own company. So this is really a ambition that I have in mind.\n\nIf you like to have a little chat or have coffee one day to disguss some things, send me a message and we will figure some out.",
