    "summary": "As an International Account Manager at YoungCapital B.V. my primary focus is connecting reputable companies and organisations across the UK and Europe with new talent. Listening to, understanding, and supporting my clients is the foundation of my day-to-day work. \n\nIn my academic research I am concerned with leadership in the modern age, in particular how factors such as globalisation, virtual technology, and cross-cultural exchange effect project management. I developed theoretical understandings of leadership during the attainment of a distinction in my master\u2019s degree in project management. As for practical understandings of leadership, these were most profoundly developed during my time in the management team at Nike in Amsterdam, and while leading volunteer project teams in the Fiji isles. \n\nI am always working to enhance my knowledge and understanding, and I believe the future will ask for informed leaders capable of building genuine relationships in an ever complex and inter-connected world.",
