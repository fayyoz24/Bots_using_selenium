    "summary": "As a Researcher in gender, peace, and conflict studies, I have developed a deep understanding of the complexities and challenges of conflict resolution, negotiation, and sustainable peacebuilding. With a passion for interdisciplinary research and a commitment to social justice, I am eager to apply my expertise to the academic and corporate worlds.\n\nMy research has taken me to conflict zones in sub-Saharan Africa, where I have conducted fieldwork and engaged with local communities analysing patterns of violence and identifying opportunities for sustainable peace. I have published research outputs in edited volumes, blogs, and forthcoming articles in peer-reviewed journals. I also frequently present my research at leading international conferences and workshops around the world demonstrating my ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and compelling ways. My research also earned me an invitation from the Maltese Ministry for Foreign Affairs to develop Malta's first National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) which was launched in October 2020. I am currently an Academic member of the Oversight Committee for the implementation of the NAP.\n\nBeyond academia, I am also interested in applying my research to the corporate world, where I believe that conflict resolution and peacebuilding can play an increasingly important role in global business. With strong analytical and communication skills, as well as experience working with diverse stakeholders, I am well-equipped to contribute to corporate social responsibility initiatives and develop innovative approaches to conflict-sensitive business practices. I am passionate about helping organisations navigate complex challenges and achieve their strategic goals.\n\nLet\u2019s connect and explore how we can work together to drive success.",
