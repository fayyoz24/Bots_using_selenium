    "summary": "My name is Byron Passaportis. I was born and raised in Harare, Zimbabwe and have since lived in multiple countries in my pursuit of fresh challenges and excellence in the field of finance.\n\nI am currently an associate in the Private Equity department at FMO - the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank. FMO empowers entrepreneurs to build a better world by creating long-term value by investing in the private sector, addressing climate change, reducing inequality and supporting (in)direct jobs. The company's values are closely aligned with my view of the future of investing - where value and sustainability will no longer be considered mutually exclusive goals.\n\nI believe that a sound understanding of valuation and the principles of value creation are essential for all individuals in the financial industry. I have developed a keen interest in valuation, value creation, global financial markets, and economics during my studies and through practical experience. My goal is to build on my knowledge base and grow into a specialist in my chosen field.\n\nAfter leaving Zimbabwe in 2015, my journey continued at the University of Cape Town, where I graduated with a degree in Economics and Finance, awarded with distinction. I then completed a Master of Science degree in Finance at Tilburg University, also awarded with distinction. In May 2021, I passed Level II of the CFA Program on my first attempt.\n\nOutside of my professional life, I enjoy playing and watching almost all sports and maintain that exercise is an essential ingredient to a well-balanced lifestyle. I am socially outgoing and highly value my personal relationships.",
