    "summary": "As part of my study for chartered accountant, I gained a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of accounting principles and practices. This knowledge was further enriched by a detailed working knowledge of US GAAP and IFRS when I led the US GAAP to IFRS conversion project on European level at Sara Lee Corporation. \n\nAs business controller and independent auditor, I developed good analytical skills and learnt to be critical and persistent. My responsibilities frequently include the preparation of clear and concise reports to different levels of management. \n\nI have experience in the design and implementation of financial related IT systems and learnt the importance of having a solid understanding of the underlying business processes before changes were implemented. \n\nWhile working on the disposal of the Household & Body care division of Sara Lee Corporation, I provided accounting and reporting advice, both internally and to buyers such as Unilever and P&G, on various separation / integration topics. I have led the project to design the closing statements (key in the financial closing of the disposals), obtain sign off from buyers on the process and information to be provided, provide guidance to local accounting teams in the preparation thereof, and participate in the negotiation process to reach agreement with buyers on the final settlement. With this, together with the accounting support given during smaller acquisitions, and working on purchase price allocation projects, I gained experience in different aspects related to M&A activities.\n\nKey words:  Business control, financial planning & analysis, business planning & control, accounting and reporting, budget and forecasting, MS Office, Hyperion, SAP BPC, Dutch GAAP, statutory accounts, SEC reporting, offering memorandum, change management, SOX, control and process management, sparring partner, Big 4 experience, Chartered Accountant, internal control, planning & organization, project management",
