    "summary": "Janna el Isa works as independent curator and artistic director of The 21st Century Museum. Some of her most recent curatorial projects are NEW SUNS | Kahlil Joseph RE:INTERPRETED at Bonnefantenmuseum and Black Presence at the Sugar Palace at Mauritshuis. \n\nWith her curatorial agency she works on innovation, representation and inclusivity in cultural institutions. She revisits the notions of art, identity and heritage; cultural citizenship, ancestral lineages and collective memory as they are reproduced through our art institutions from a decolonial perspective. Through her work she aims to curate new paradigms and discourses; inclusive institutions, programs and exhibitions in which specifically young local audiences from a diversity of backgrounds can recognise themselves.\n\nAs a curator she creates embodied art experiences; bringing together the visual and the sonic, words and movements to create multidimensional art worlds in alignment with our 21st century arts and culture, representing our current times and consciousness. \n\nShe currently works on a series of interventions in major art institutions in which she holds space for diasporic notions of art, culture and hybrid heritage, of which New Fashion Narratives: Diasporic Dutch Identities and Our Pride is Intersectional x Amsterdam Rainbow Dress at Amsterdam Museum are examples. In 2018 she will further develop the Black Presence-series in public art institutions, creating space for and discourse through diasporic perspectives in Dutch contemporary art. \n\n/ visit for more information about past, present and future projects | jannaelisa.wordpress.com",

Within the field of both visual and performative arts she has a strong connection with local communities through her background in the urban arts and culture scene. Her work as curator is dedicated to create space in institutions for inclusive programs in co-creation with local artists and creatives. This bottom-up approach starts at the experiences of local audiences, creating content in which the global societies, diverse communities and urban realities of the 21st century are represented. Her main focus with programs like Black Presence at the Sugar Palace (Mauritshuis) is to curate inclusive art worlds in public institutions in which people from different backgrounds can recognise themselves.",

Du Bois and Langston Hughes. The story of the Huiswouds shows that there has been a long tradition of black emancipation and political organizing in the Netherlands. Due to the involvement of the Huiswouds, Vereniging Ons Suriname became a hub for a political movement striving for the independence of Suriname as well as against racial discrimination and inequality in the Netherlands.\n\nDiscover hidden history!\nThe Black Archives uncovers this long-hidden story in an exhibit that features unique documents from the personal archives of Hermina and Otto Huiswoud and artworks by Iris Kensmil, Brian Elstak and Raul Balai.

A growing number of artists embodies this reality and develops a transnational Dutch art history, relating Dutch and European histories to transcontinental movements and art histories. With their bodies of work artists are challenging the modernist notions of the museum, the art historical canon and their implications of 'universality' - radically transcending these set-up borders, creating worlds in which a variety of worlds co-exist. \n\nFrom their positition in a transcultural Dutch society these artists provide useful contemporary perspectives on what it means to live in our twenty-first century globalised world, however, their work has remained relatively invisible and absent in Dutch art museums. This research aims to 'canonise', historicize and re-member these artistic bodies of knowledge that reflect our twenty-first century contemporaneity, while at the same time examining the museum as national 'keeper of memories' and how this institution relates to current notions of transnationality and transculturality. Furthermore, this research aims to create a productive curatorial and art-historical approach that displaces migratory aesthetics and diasporic subjectivities from the margins to the centre, as a response to our contemporary societal condition - 'seeking a now that can breed futures' (Audre Lorde).",

The exhibition included Lissitzky's artworks from the Van Abbe collection, juxtaposed with his contemporaries Alice Milligan and Maud Gonne, two Irish artists-activists who used their artistic practice to imagine the Irish state in the early twentieth century. All of these artists perceived their role as artist as being an active participant in the formation of the new world order.  The exhibition reflected upon the position of artists in civil society who envisage their creative practices as tools for social and political change. A contemporary narrative was provided through the work of Rossella Biscotti, N\u00faria G\u00fcell, Sarah Pierce and Hito Steyerl, artists who are all working with the concept of 'the state' as well. \n\nAnother important part of the exhibition were the archival material and books about Lissitzky, made accesible for visitors in the Reading Room. The books in this room gave visitors access to Lissitzky's ideas, encouraging them to actively use the material to dive in his ideas, enabling people to gain useful knowledge and draw inspiration from the material.",

Because of the Dutch colonisation this part of the world belonged to the Netherlands for centuries, nevertheless does its history nowadays not really seem to belong to the Dutch national historical canon. The proposal took one photograph from the Tropenmuseum collection as starting point to let the depicted people tell their multitudes of histories, entangling topics of postcolonialism and decolonisation, feminism and body politics, objectification and subjectivities, shared identities and micro histories.",
