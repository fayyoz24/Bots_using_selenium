Experienced in:\n\u2022 Project development to realize green hydrogen, ammonia (and ammonia derivatives like urea ammonia nitrate or calcium ammonia nitrate), methanol, DME and kerosene plants;\n\u2022 Project development to realize projects to convert municipal waste & waste biomass into valuable products like electricity and green molecules;\n\u2022 Guiding scientist to develop new technologies like solid oxide electrolyser development - SOEC for green hydrogen production (among other in Faraday-lab of TNO/Voltachem), oxy-fuel combustion using H2 instead of CH4 (HyAPC), metal powder oxidation to produce heat and regeneration with green hydrogen (Metalot), electrochemical low temperature CO2 reduction (TNO/Voltachem & Coval Energy) and high temperature SOEC CO2 reduction technologies (TNO/Voltachem and others), methane pyrolysis technologies to produce zero emission hydrogen and pure high value solid carbon (Ember), municipal waste & biomass conversion into valuable products etc. etc.;\n\u2022 Assessing best way to produce zero CO2 emission hydrogen (PEM, alkaline, SOEC & AEM electrolysis, methane pyrolysis, blue hydrogen solutions or municipal waste/organic material gasification) for specific user cases. Best solution depends on conditions on location, user case and possibilities to import hydrogen (or products);\n\u2022 Integrating chemicals, fertilizers, energy, steel, cement, waste processing and agricultural plant activities with the focus on reducing CO2 emissions while keeping/improving business case;\n\u2022 Advising companies in the value chain from renewable electricity to green hydrogen to ammonia/methanol/kerosene on energy transition topics and challenges;\n\nMaster (MSc) degree (drs.) inorganic Chemistry (University Utrecht) and a Bachelors degree Business Administration (Hogeschool Rotterdam). \n\nGeographic focus area Latin America, Africa and Europe (including Ukraine, Azerbaijan, etc.).",

Some of the advantages:\n- No CO2 formation in case ammonia or hydrogen is used as a fuel;\n- NO CO2 capture processes needed because pure CO2 is produced when using methane as a fuel;\n- Efficiency higher than conventional natural gas fired power plants or conventional oxy-fuel plants;\n- Low CAPEX, low OPEX;\n- No NOx formation;\n- Can be installed in existing natural gas fired power plants.\n\nCommercially available in 2027",

I dealt with the projects in sub-saharan Africa and Latin America.\n\nDue to the knowledge of both equity and debt capital markets of me and my colleagues the Stamicarbon project development department was able to access non-traditional funding and support the best capital structure for the projects we wanted to develop.\n\nNext to my project development role, within Stamicarbon I also dealt assessing new technologies (to be acquired). As well I managed a project where Stamicarbon and other parties in value chain (metal producers, equipment manufacturers and ammonia licensing companies) to develop a standardized ammonia/urea plant concept with the objective to shorten the engineering and construction time of an ammonia/urea plant.",
