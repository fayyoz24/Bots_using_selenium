Through photography and film we will explore this unrevealed chapter of Che Guevara's life. How do Che's ideals of liberty, equality, justice and self determination resonate with Congolese people today? On our journey we will document the issues faced by the people of Congo and hear about their dreams for a better future.\n\n What have we done so far? We've been to Cuba! We have already made a self-funded research trip to Havana to investigate the origins of the story of Che in Congo and to help plan the Congo journey. During that visit we met with the son of Che Guevara, Camillo Guevarra (Director of the Che Guevara study center) who gave his authorization to work on this subject. We also interviewed five veterans, including the commander of the rescue team, Manuel Alvarez Montoya and Victor Dreke, Che\u2019s second in command throughout Congo. Victor Dreke gave us a book that was originally dedicated to the son of Patrice Lumumba, Guy-Patrice Lumbuba, to hand to him personally in Congo. We will honour this request!\n\nWe were also able to gather photographs of the personal belongings of the Congo veterans and photos that they took themselves during the mission - artifacts that have never before been widely seen! These photos, interviews and video made by the team were edited by Ben into the video 'CHE IN CONGO - The beginning'.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gyi7rZ3ix4\n\nWhat's the final destination of CHE IN CONGO? A beautifully crafted photobook, gallery and travelling exhibitions featuring the multimedia works, a set of magazine publications and film screenings at international film festivals. ",
