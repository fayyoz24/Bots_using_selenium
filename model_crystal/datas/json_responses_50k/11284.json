    "summary": "In the last 4 years I have acquired a diverse set of skills and experiences. I have worked as a sailing coach, a swimming instructor, a retail salesman, and a commis waiter in a restaurant serving international guests. I offer a combination of unique skills and competencies which I have developed through varied previous work experiences. I have developed strong sales and problem solving skills while learning the importance of collaboration and realizing my enjoyment of leadership. In all of my roles, I have worked towards organizational improvements, collaborative team efforts and attainment of key business targets.\nI am looking for work to support myself while I study at University. I am in my 2nd year of university at Erasmus University Rotterdam studying economics and business economics. I chose to study economics because I am fascinated with the way  different systems are interrelated. I found great success in classes about economic systems and problem solving.",
