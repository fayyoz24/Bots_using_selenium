    "summary": "Hi, my name is Dang Khoa Pham. \n\nSince I was young age I have had a deep interest in how biotechnologies can play a role in improving human life. We have invented automatic machines, understood the gameplay of natural physics, combined some chemicals to produce what we want. However, our body itself we still not fully discovered yet, the animals and plants we met from the very first step of human history have not been fully formulated yet. That is the role of biotechnology, which we can use to resist the limitations starting from inside us. Personally, I pay lots of attention to eukaryotic cell culturing, gene editing, and plant breeding, it would be great if I am positioned in one of those faculties.\n\nI have been trained to work with genetics, human immune cell culturing, pathogenic microorganisms, and plant metabolites. The experiences of part-time jobs serving food also showed me skills like time management, teamwork, and communication are very important. I am willing to spend the effort to learn new things, step out of my safety barrier and receive constructive feedback that you will give me. \u201cNo pain is no gain\u201d, is my favorite quote. If you feel any interest please contact me through direct message by Linkedin. \n\nThank you.",
