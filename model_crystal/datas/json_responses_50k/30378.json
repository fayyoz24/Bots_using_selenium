    "summary": "Who am I:\nI am a motivated and hardworking engineer who likes to puzzle, likes a challenge and who always had a great affinity with technology. Internships I have done in the Netherlands as well in other counties. Because of these experiences I learned working in an international working environment. I also have been active beside my studies, during these activities I learned working together as a team and taking initiative. Other competences are perseverance, communicating, solution-oriented thinking and I am stress resistant. During my studies I have worked as a supporting project manager/CAD draftsman. During this time, I learned the ways in a working environment and gained a lot of knowledge of the way it is done in companies. In addition, I am a sportive person and ones or twice a week I like to go for a run and twice a week I am playing rugby. ",

I can say: Goal accomplished. The way they work in south-Spain is very different than I was used to from back in the Netherlands. Aeroserv was already quite a modern company; they didn\u2019t have siestas anymore but used two shifts so they could keep the production going all day. At this internship I was mostly working in the workshop operating the water cutter and helping with the product finishing. The level of this internship was a bit under the level of my education but the experience was amazing. It was here that I realized that the way people do their job differs a lot all around the world. That is why I set my goal to get to know as many different work environments as possible during my education.",
