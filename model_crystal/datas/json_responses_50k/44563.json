    "summary": "I am a highly trained, safety-focused Geophysicist with over 10 years' experience in borehole geophysical (wireline) logging, proficient in providing (1) advanced wireline service data acquisition, processing, and reporting, (2) remote project & location management, and (3) health, safety, environment, and service quality leadership, for a range of operations including land, shallow water, and deepwater projects in the offshore windfarm and oil & gas industries. \n\nI have worked in many different types of environments from offshore geotechnical site investigations in the North Sea to extremely remote land exploration projects in east Africa for clients ranging from small independents to supermajors. My leadership and experience have honed my resourcefulness in finding creative solutions to complex problems, optimizing workflows, and meeting target objectives with a first time right approach. I have spent my career working in multinational, diverse teams and I thrive in this type of setting. \n\nMost recently, I have been capitalizing on the skills and knowledge that I acquired in the oil & gas industry to spur the development of wireline logging in the offshore windfarm industry in support of the energy transition, which is one of my key motivators. While my role is still technical in nature, there are significant commercial, project management, and line management components to the job which have sparked further personal development. I am curious by nature with broad interests and always keen for new challenges. \n\nLOGGING SERVICE PROFICIENCIES:\nDistributed Sensing: Silixa DAS and DTS\nNuclear Logs: HGNS, TLD, QCNT, QLDT\nResistivity Logs: AIT, HRLA, HALS, QAIT\nSonic Logs: DSLT, DSI, MSIP, QSLT, PSSL (Geovista)\nFormation Pretesting, Fluid Analysis, and Sampling: MDT, XPT\nPercussion and Mechanical Sidewall Coring: CST, MSCT\nMagnetic Resonance Logs: CMR, DMR (Vista Clara)\nFormation Image Logs: FMI, FMI-HD, ABI (ALT)\n(Ultra) sonic Cement Evaluation: CBL, USIT, IBC\nSpectral Gamma Ray: HNGS\nExplosives Services: Plugs/Packers\nVarious other services such as correlation tools (GR, SP, CCL), \ninclinometry tools (GPIT-C/F), and caliper tools (PPC)",
