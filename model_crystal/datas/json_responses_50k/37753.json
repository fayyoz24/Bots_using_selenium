Evaluate the entire supply-chain system to identify the underlying causes of mismanagement and leakage. \n2. With guidance of the existing workflow process, review clearing and forwarding procedures undertaken by UN agency's contracted clearing and forwarding agencies in respect of UN agency's supplies to proceed through customs formalities.\n3. Review transportation systems/procedures (loading, handling, security, offloading, etc) followed from sea port/ airport to warehouse and/or to implementing partners. Identify risks and recommend measures required to mitigate those risks.  \n4. Undertake field visits to undertake stock takes at District Stores, Peripheral Health Units (PHUs), Community Health Units (CHUs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), District Education stores and UN agency's supported schools with the aim of establishing utilization of UN agency's  and Free Health Care supplies in line with agreed upon distribution plan.\n5.

It started with providing scholastic materials, and developed into payment of student school fees and teacher salaries in 2011 and 2012, with funds received from friends and family in Europe. \nMid- 2012 the foundation \"Nurture the Child\" was founded to formalize the project in the Netherlands. We sponsored 145 children in 2013 and the first pupils have graduated from secondary school in 2019. \nIn 2020 we are sponsoring 70 pupils in primary and secondary schools in Kampala.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aivg7vADfok&list=PLtuSMgWraQtRfIqP8G2rCIaXl8uwNV_u_&index=26\n"
