    "summary": "I am working at KCAP Architects&Planners since 2005,  and joined as a partner in 2018. I\u2019ve build up broad experience in conceptualizing and leading projects in the field of urban design. I am involved in mixed urban development projects, waterfronts, transport hubs, brownfield developments, transformation of industrial area\u2019s to mixed urban districts and event area (re)developments.\n\nI was project leader of winning competition entries like Bay of Pasaia in San Sebastian and Zhangjiang Science and Technology City in Shanghai. The winning competition entry and development plan for FredericiaC in Denmark was awarded with the Excellence on the Waterfront award and published in the Blauwe Kamer yearbook Landscape Architecture and Urban Design of 2014. \n\nBesides my role within KCAP, I'm guest professor and lecturer at conferences. \n\nBorn in Belgium in 1978, I completed the MSc in Architecture and the postgraduate Master of Urban and Strategic Planning at the Catholic University in Leuven. During my studies I worked at AWG-b0b Van Reeth architects in Antwerp.",

The urban plan provides the local communities with space to grow and possibilities to extend their identity and exploit their diversity. The growth is concentrated around public transport hubs. The different character zones are unified by a public space network around the docks and along green boulevards. Within this robust structure, a sensitive network of public spaces is formed, allowing current and new inhabitants to enjoy the water for leisure and recreation. Around the bay, new landmark buildings such as a cultural centre and a maritime museum will become regional destinations. Clusters of new economic activities will generate new employment in a broad range of sectors.",
