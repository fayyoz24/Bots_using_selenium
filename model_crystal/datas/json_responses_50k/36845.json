This involves integrating an improved quality approach into a cycle of collecting and using data and other program information continuously. The mechanisms for rolling out this new approach to Programmatic Quality Assurance And Improvement by the Global Fund are currently in the planning stages.",

Now they are being used by nonprofits to combine information about  monitoring & evaluation and management of resources in real-time.\n\nThe PR Management Dashboard provides Global Fund Principal Recipients (PRs) with a mechanism for collecting, consolidating, and visualizing periodic data on grant performance from the PR itself and its subrecipients (SRs).  The dashboard displays financial, general management and programmatic indicators at grant and implementer levels to enable PRs and SRs to use data for decision making to improve grant performance.  \n\nThe new PR Management Dashboard was co-financed by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), and SAP SE.   All three organizations provided technical experts to develop the dashboard, and SAP provided free software for both the development and pilot phase of this initiative.  The tool was piloted in English, French & Spanish languages and in six countries between January and August 2014. It was presented to a select group of consultants in October 2015 during a one-week program hosted by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance in Brighton, the United Kingdom.",
