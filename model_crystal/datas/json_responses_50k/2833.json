    "summary": "I am a geoscientist working for the TNO Advisory Group for Economic Affairs (TNO-AGE), part of the Geological Survey of the Netherlands (GDN). In my present role I evaluate and advise on license applications and production plans for geothermal energy systems and storage plans for CCS, in particular for effective use of the subsurface and for potential seismicity and containment risks. I am also working on global and EU-scale geothermal resource assessments and I am involved in the ThermoGIS project to map the geothermal resources in the Netherlands (https://www.thermogis.nl/en).\n\nFrom 2017-2020, I have worked as a UU-postdoc for GEMex, an EU-funded project on volcanic geothermal systems in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB).\n\nI have studied Earth Sciences specializing in petrology, geochemistry and structural geology. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in energy technology and the future of energy supply. After my studies, I completed a PhD on geothermal modelling and resource assessments.",

The joint effort is based on three pillars:\n\nResource assessment at two unconventional geothermal sites, for EGS development at Acoculco and for a superhot resource near Los Humeros. This part will focus on understanding the tectonic evolution, the fracture distribution and hydrogeology of the respective region, and on predicting in-situ stresses and temperatures at depth.\n\nReservoir characterization using techniques and approaches developed at conventional geothermal sites, including novel geophysical and geological methods to be tested and refined for their application at the two project sites: passive seismic data will be used to apply ambient noise correlation methods, and to study anisotropy by coupling surface and volume waves; newly collected electromagnetic data will be used for joint inversion with the seismic data. For the interpretation of these data, high-pressure/ high-temperature laboratory experiments will be performed to derive the parameters determined on rock samples from Mexico or equivalent materials.\n\nConcepts for Site Development: all existing and newly collected information will be applied to define drill paths, to recommend a design for well completion including suitable material selection, and to investigate optimum stimulation and operation procedures for safe and economic exploitation with control of undesired side effects. These steps will include appropriate measures and recommendations for public acceptance and outreach as well as for the monitoring and control of environmental impact.\n\nThe consortium was formed from the EERA joint programme of geothermal energy in regular and long-time communication with the partners from Mexico. That way a close interaction of the two consortia is guaranteed and will continue beyond the duration of the project.",

In addition, such precision wells would reduce any potential environmental impact.\n\nNew research methods will be tested in well-known geothermal systems, both in continental sedimentary systems in Europe and in high-temperature systems related to volcanism where one might expect supercritical fluids, as in magmatic areas, such as in Iceland and Italy.\n\nThe IMAGE project will develop a reliable science based exploration and assessment method to \u201cIMAGE\u201d geothermal reservoirs using an interdisciplinary approach.\n",
