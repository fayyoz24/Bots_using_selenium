    "summary": "I'm Joeri Smits, a highly skilled web developer with a strong background in computer science and a passion for innovation. Currently serving as the Head of Development at Webbio, I lead the technical advancements within the company. My expertise lies in various programming languages, including JavaScript (specifically TypeScript), PHP, and frameworks like NestJS, React.js and Next.js.\n\nProficient in a wide range of technologies such as Amazon Web Services, Databases, Front-end, Backend, I excel at solving complex architectural problems and implementing cutting-edge solutions. I have successfully contributed to noteworthy projects and have been involved in the development of high-traffic web systems.\n\nIn addition to my technical skills, I am a collaborative leader who strives to empower and guide the entire team. I value the opinions of my team members and foster an environment of open communication. During my tenure at Webbio, I expanded the development team from a single developer to a cohesive unit of 15+ skilled professionals. I also led the successful implementation of ISO9001 and ISO27001, resulting in substantial revenue growth.\n\nOutside of my professional role, I have a strong affinity for aviation. In my free time, I hold a private pilot license and enjoy immersing myself in aviation and flight simulation. Additionally, I am a co-organizer of Nimma.codes, a meetup group for professionals in the Nijmegen and Arnhem region, where we gather every last Tuesday of the month to discuss and explore interesting topics related to software engineering.\n\nAs a results-oriented professional, I am constantly seeking new challenges and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in web development. My strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and broad expertise enable me to deliver effective solutions and make a positive impact on an organization's growth and success.",

We used Bluetooth beacons to determine the position of the traveler relative to the train. The application itself was written in Java on Android.\n\nWe received some very positive feedback from the Dutch Railways, as we presented the project at the Dutch Railways Innovation Lab.",
