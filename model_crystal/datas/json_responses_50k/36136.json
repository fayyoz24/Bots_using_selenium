    "summary": "I consider myself lucky to be able to combine a gift of languages with a keen interest in other people and their cultures. I am available as a part-time secretary/executive secretary in the Utrecht/Amsterdam area for a position that offers variety in daily tasks, such as scheduling, organising, preparing and minuting meetings or conferences. I enjoy working independently but I can function equally well in a team of enthusiasts, provided all goals are set and tasks have been well devided. \nOrganisations that pursue socially responsible goals or companies that feel strongly about People Planet Profit-principles have my special interest.",
