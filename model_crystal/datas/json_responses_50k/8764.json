    "summary": "During my career I have held numerous finance and accounting positions which have exposed me to various industries (incl. Tech, Retail, Telecom and Public Sector). Furthermore I have experience with team management, financial statements, KPI reporting, accounting cycles, budget management, financial modeling, database analysis, customer research and analysis of Marketing & Sales activities. In recent roles with Amazon I have managed finance teams and worked with senior management across the EU (Business VPs and Finance Directors). Below are some highlights from my career that further justify me as a great candidate.\n\n\u2022\tGraduated in the top 5% of my class from an international MBA and was the sole student selected by BMW to receive a fellowship to earn my degree. \n\n\u2022\t6.5 years experience as a Senior Financial Analyst managing employees, creating financial statements and forecasts, analyzing customer behavior, controlling marketing & sales performance, and analyzing workforce efficiency. \n\n\u2022\t2.5 years experience as a financial controlling manager coordinating with a project team and other departments in order to support IT projects aimed at developing and launching new mobile technology products.\n\n\u2022\t4 years intensive work as both an accountant managing a $1.7 billion dollar fund and as a financial statements analyst. Working two roles simultaneously taught me how to schedule my work to meet deadlines.\n\nLast, having worked for Amazon, I understand how to work in a faced paced tech environment that constantly demands solving problems which inherently have much ambiguity. Using data and analytics to make decisions in such an environment has been one of the keys to my success.",
