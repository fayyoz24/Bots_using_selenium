The calculation included in this website is only usable in the Netherlands. \nSince 2014 it has become very interesting for consumers to buy PV panels on their roofs. The interest is much higher (~7%) compared to a saving account. The disadvantage is a high investment. \nThis website even includes a yield calculation which incorporates changing rules regarding net metering (in Dutch 'salderen') in 2020. \nYourPV is entirely analytic, contrary the most, if not all, competitors. This makes the engine very technical and consequently, gives very accurate results.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/YourPV/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/yourpvnl",

The gauges were placed throughout the dunes (From Heemskerk to Bloemendaal aan Zee) and were emptied every two weeks. The shallow groundwater was sampled by bachelor students. The day after, an lab analysis was conducted. The EC, pH, alkalinity and anions -with the use of an Ion Chromatograph - were executed myself. The cations (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) and ammonium (Aquachem) were performed for me. Finally, all information was placed in Hydrogeochemcal (Excel Program created by Pieter Jan Stuyfzand, also my first supervisor) for data analysis and management. The research goal was to understand spatial correlations in the dune area and to seek for an effect of intervention that took place in the dunes.",

The second part of this course was from 5 of June until the 28 of June. During this period the students conducted research in a tributary of the Rio Boco river system. The Rio Boco flows into in the Rio de Aveiro. There are four main tributaries which had to be investigated by four to five students. The river of interest here is the Rio do Tabua\u00e7o. Four main topics were investigated: Water quality and pollution, Water balance, Geology and hydrogeology and River discharge. The latter subject was my research area. This river has been studied for six years now so information has been gathered in wet and dry years. The research goals of this research were: set up a rating curve, give the maximum contributing areas, give numbers of base and peak flows, give an EC routing curve and determine the nutrient losses.",
