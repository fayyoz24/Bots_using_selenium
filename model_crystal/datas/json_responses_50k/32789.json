By using our technical knowledge and combining them with data collected from extensive surveys and logical reasoning, we were able to suggest practical solutions to improve the overall safety and accessibility of the traffic junction. In addition to this we also suggested and designed innovative elevated pedestrian pathways, a new traffic signal system and mechanical parking systems. The project received acclaim from both the professors and also from the engineer at the Public Works Department of Thrissur.  ",
