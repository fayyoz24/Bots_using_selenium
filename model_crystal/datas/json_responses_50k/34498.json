    "summary": "I am very passionate about ensuring that all the students that I work with, regardless of their background, race, age or ability are able to fulfil their greatest potential. \n\nWorking as a Learning Support Assistant at The British School in The Netherlands has been an incredible and thoroughly enjoyable opportunity. I am skilled in forming meaningful relationships with children and giving them the time to be heard, reminding them that they are capable of doing anything they set their mind to. \n\nMy strengths are in Drama, Computing and my ability to speak the Dutch language. My experience includes working with children aged 3 to 16, specialising in Key Stage 2. \n\nI am a very experienced child minder and tutor along with being an extremely involved member of classroom support with my experience of working as a Teaching Assistant as well as a Learning Support Assistant for children with special needs.",
