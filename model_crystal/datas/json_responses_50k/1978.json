Providing free menstrual products is twofold: it contributes to a more inclusive environment at UM, as it will help to break down the period stigma and support people who have difficulties affording menstrual products. Period products are basic and essential healthcare items. Therefore, we believe it is necessary that UM provides these free of charge for those in need.\n\nWith the D&I grant, we will carry out a one-year pilot study in the 2021/2022 academic year. This includes providing menstrual products in selected restrooms at several UM faculties. One problem is that menstruation is often deemed shameful, aversive, and unclean which contributes to a vicious cycle of silence: the menstrual taboo. Our initiative aims to effectively break this silence by - next to providing menstrual products - creating an educational campaign on the menstruation stigma. This will include workshops and discussions on the menstrual taboo, the need for increased awareness on menstruation, and the issue of period poverty. A monitoring and evaluation component is also part of the project, aiming to identify the long-term implementation possibilities at UM.",
