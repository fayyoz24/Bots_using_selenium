By synchronizing each telescope using a network of atomic clocks, the team created a virtual telescope as large as the Earth, with a resolving power never before achieved from the surface of our planet. One of their first targets was the supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy \u2013 its mass equivalent to 6.5 billion suns. After painstakingly analyzing the data with novel algorithms and techniques, the team produced an image of this galactic monster, silhouetted against hot gas swirling around the black hole, that matched expectations from Einstein's theory of gravity: a bright ring marking the point where light orbits the black hole, surrounding a dark region where light cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull.",

Such spectra are obtained by counting individual light particles as they reach the detector with a spatial probability distribution that depends on the particle's energy.  I research the statistical analysis of this data with the help of self-developed physical models of radiative transfer in highly ionized plasmas.  This involves solving numerically the non-linear, time-independent integro-differential equations and systems of linear statistical equilibrium equations in order to determine the conditions that give rise to the observed data.\n\nImportant skills used and developed in this role include: physics, applied mathematics, programming (Fortran, C, IDL, Perl, Mathematica, Haskell), data visualization (IDL, gnuplot, Mathematica).",
