    "summary": "As a highly motivated professional with a strong background in addressing environmental disasters and conflicts, my passion for education and commitment to making a positive impact has always been the driving forces behind my career. I have dedicated myself to teaching and gained valuable experience in environmental education, which has further fueled my desire to contribute to academic life and education-related activities. I am also intrigued by administrative tasks, such as providing office support or assisting teachers, and I am open to exploring opportunities in an intellectually stimulating atmosphere or the business sector.\n\nWhat truly excites me about pursuing new challenges and roles in the Netherlands is the opportunity to work with diverse teams in international settings. With fluency in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, and ongoing efforts to learn Dutch, I possess the language skills necessary to effectively communicate and collaborate within multicultural environments. My aim is to bring my expertise and experience to a university, school, library, or organization with interests in Brazil or Latin America, leveraging my diverse background to foster growth and success.\n\nLiving in the Netherlands has had a profound impact on me, filling me with a deep sense of gratitude. As a mother of a two-year-old boy, my career objectives have shifted, and I am currently in a transitional phase, seeking a fulfilling role that allows me to strike a balance between my personal and professional life. While I hold a high degree from Brazil and have gained some experience at a local university, I fully recognize the importance of learning the Dutch language to fully integrate into the local culture. As a result, I am actively seeking part-time positions that provide me with the opportunity to learn Dutch and immerse myself in the vibrant local community, as these elements are essential to realizing my aspirations. Additionally, I am available to offer consultancy services, providing specific reports, analyses, or advice on environmental matters for organizations, including NGOs.\n\nOverall, I am driven by a deep sense of purpose and an unwavering commitment to personal and professional growth. I am eager to seize new opportunities and contribute locally, while also cherishing precious moments with my family.",
