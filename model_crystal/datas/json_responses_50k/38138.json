    "summary": "Over the past three years, my primary interest in creating a sustainable power source for rural settlements has shifted towards stock trading and business analysis. I plan to further my skills by understanding business and data analytics in my next position.  I have an intense interest in the web 3 (cryptocurrencies and NFTs) field especially trade signals and company research in addition to the fact that this year I am planning to teach myself smart contract coding on solidity and the Monte Carlo machine learning method in Python.  One of my past time activities is researching companies, stocks, and jargon. Furthermore, I know Python and Matlab languages and with my coding knowledge, I am currently developing a cryptocurrency trading bot with Python with the aid of trading view, Strategy Quant X Probuild, Metatrader, and SQ Algo.\n\nDue to my upbringing in Zimbabwe and the leadership positions I held at St Johns College, my organisational skills, time management and problem solving ability are strong attributes of mine.    Furthermore, the vast workload received when reading as a BSc in Applied Physics has allowed me to heighten my research analysis skills. My degree also requires many verbal presentations and due to my involvement at high school in the prestigious Toastmasters Society and Model United Nations (public speaking and debate), I have confidence when speaking and have learned how to concisely convey the main points of an assignment to a large audience.\n\nPenultimately, my interest in Applied Physics and Renewable Energy has given me a unique insight into technologically innovative companies. I have learned to understand how their technology works and if their predictions about future breakthroughs are plausible or not such as NEOMs new solar-sustainable desalination unit to be built in Saudi Arabia.  Additionally, I have been extensively examining crypto projects which has broadened my knowledge in web3 marketing, tokenomics, and NFT utility.  By reading 'Statistics for Business and Economics ( Paul Newbold et. al) and ' The Business Model Book' (Adam J. Bock and Gerard George ) I can build a strong foundation for my fields of interest.\n\nFinally, due to my strong work ethic, quick learning, and time management, I believe this makes me a highly competitive candidate for my areas of significance and other fields that may require these skills.",

                    "description": "Sub-Sahara Capital is a Zimbabwean Hedge Fund with  shares in 20 Southern African companies.  During my internship with them I shadowed the Chief Software Engineer at Cash24,  a forex and crypto trading company in addition to international remittances, where I was taught the basics to JavaScript so I could help him find bugs in his code for the companies app.  Additionally,  I spoke the Founder of Selby Enterprises, the largest horticulture exporter to U.K and Europe including Albert Hein, where we discussed how I could encode a system incorporating  NFT\u2019s to speed up their quality control and verification of the farm\u2019s produce when packing the goods in their main warehouse.  This system would improve the overall efficiency their warehouse exporting system.\nFurthermore, I gleaned as much information as possible from my fellow superiors about commodities and how to correctly invest and analyse companies needing funding. Additionally, I was tasked with researching and comparing all the cloud storage systems currently available in the open market which suited the size of the business. My main interest was in the decentralised cloud storage systems, however, since they are still young technologies there was no incentive to switch to them. \n Although I have completed my internship as Sub-Sahara Capital, I am still invested in developing a cryptocurrency trading bot using Python and tradingview for one of their profile companies.  I hope to finish this project by late 2023.",
