Technical secretariats are organized by location and thematic group and oversee the administration of FHERA. The advisory board was convened with experts to provide counsel to the core panel. \n\nThe aim of the Initiative is to provide a forum for robust intellectual inquiry, research, and knowledge generation that will serve as a foundation for informed dialogues, policies and action by individuals, communities, and countries to shape the future of health and economic resiliency, in line with the vision for Africa 2063. \n\nThis will be achieved through convening a) core panel of experts from academia, practitioners, and policymakers, to lead thinking around the priorities for intervention, b) relevant thematic task forces and technical secretariats to undertake analyses and synthesis, and c) disseminating the key \ufb01ndings of the Initiative through peer-reviewed publications in The Lancet and strategic public communication engagements. Through these actions, the Initiative will in\ufb02uence the actions of global, regional and national actors to shape the emergence of a better future for health.\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fhera/about-us/core-panel-members/"
