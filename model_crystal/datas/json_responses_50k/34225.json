    "summary": "Advisor or project leader in multi-disciplinary inclusive development approaches, specialised in connecting economic development and ecosystem management aimed at climate resilient livelihoods, a healthy environment and food security. Based on values of equality and solidarity and a natural drive to search for opportunities for improvement, I'm dedicated to support better living conditions for the most vulnerable living in fragile areas. \n\nThe key challenge for me is to promote sustainable economic development while strengthening ecosystem resilience. For this we need to work across silos and connect different disciplines. Considering the impact of economic actions in the wider landscape, and vice versa, considering the impact of landscape restoration on the livelihoods of local people, will allow selection of the best investment decisions with sustainable impact. \n\nI strongly believe in the power of collaboration and support multi-stakeholder participation for sustainable, inclusive and context-specific solutions. I stand for building on local capacities and subsidiarity. While local people own their development process and drive the change, together we can achieve more and strengthen each other\u2019s capacities.\n\nExperienced in leading multi-disciplinary teams to develop projects and approaches, implement projects and learn from practice. While delivering results, I promote qualitative improvement in process, approach and deliverables.\n\nI'm analytical, but also pragmatic and able to translate theoretical concepts into applications.\n\nFields of expertise: rural livelihoods, disaster risk management, climate change adaptation, conflict risk reduction, ecosystem-based adaptation, adaptive programming, institutional development.",
