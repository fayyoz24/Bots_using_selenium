I have worked with stem cells, DNA, antibodies, bacteria (and bacterial vectors), I transformed plasmids with GFP protein. I also perform calculations such as for buffer preparations or initial rate of reaction.

Confocal microscopy was used to characterize the subcellular localization of tagged receptors and fluorescent microscopy was used to analyze the success of P2X4 transfection into HEK293 cell line. The pHluorin-tagging and Flexstation III quantifying fluorescence changes in real-time were used in two experiments. First, to test if maximum ATP concentration (100 \u00b5l) or Ivermectin influence P2X4 expression in transfected HEK cells. Second, comparing P2X4 transfected cells and un-transfected cells and the amount of calcium flow into the cell using 3 different ATP concentrations (100 \u00b5l, 10 \u00b5l, 1 \u00b5l). Whole-cell patch clamping was used to measure the effect of different drugs/ inhibitors on p2X4.
