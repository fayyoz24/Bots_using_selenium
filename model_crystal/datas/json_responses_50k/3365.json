    "summary": "Having grown up in an international environment in Dubai and speaking multiple languages, I have a passion for interconnection and human relations. I am an excellent and versatile communicator who is seeking opportunities in PR, media and digital consulting, marketing, and advertising. \n\nMy degree from UvA in Media and Culture, universally ranked as first in its field, has prepared me for a master\u2019s in corporate communications and digital media, equally at the UvA. I hope to pursue an opportunity in which I can put forth my creative assets while learning from and interacting with a large group of people. Choosing a minor in Macroeconomics has enabled me to challenge myself and acquire a multitude of quantitative tools, allowing me to gain more agility across a variety of disciplines. ",
