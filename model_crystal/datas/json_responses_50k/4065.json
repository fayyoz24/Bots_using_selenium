The creative direction was to design without limitations, and to bring newness to the denim arena. \n\nJason\u2019s knowledge in denim washes was exciting; I learnt a lot from him about washes and fits - the ageing process from Virgin to Vintage. Authentic washes, details and the best denim mills. \n\nThe distribution at that time was the best global denim retailers and concept stores, with a large following in Japan where we would travel and design exclusive capsules for our own stores and wholesale partners including Isetan and Beams. \n\nWhilst designing and creatively directing the women\u2019s apparel, I learnt a greater understanding of running a fashion business. \nWorking in a small, family run company meant that there needed to be a can-do approach, willingness to do more than just design; to play your part in the brand direction and it\u2019s path for success. \n\n\u2022 Leading the design direction for the Women\u2019s collection. \n\u2022 Researching and creating seasonal themes and colour palettes, through relevant primary and secondary research. \n\u2022 Design and creative direction of four collections per year covering all product categories.\n\u2022 Fabric research, sourcing and print development. \n\u2022 Sourcing and maintaining close working relationships with suppliers, with extensive travel.\n\u2022 Cast and style look books, and campaigns in collaboration with the Denham Art Director. \n\u2022 Merchandising showrooms and market launch presentations of the collections to international agents and retail staff. \n\u2022 Managing special projects for international wholesale and retail markets including collaborations.\n\u2022 Retail buying of non-DENHAM product including jewelry and footwear.  \n\u2022 Partnering with the collection developer, and women\u2019s designer to produce the collections on time and with accuracy.\n\u2022 Selection and development of more junior team members.",
