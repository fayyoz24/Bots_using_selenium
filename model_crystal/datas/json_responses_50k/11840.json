We connect startups, businesses and investors by organizing events and training programs.\n\nPresent Your Startup is inspired by the TV-programs Dragons\u2019 Den & Shark Tank, but with an innovative twist. The concept is an initiative by Val\u00e9rie Vallenduuk, lawyer-partner of Vallenduuk Advocaten, who asked herself: How can I connect startups to investors? In 2014, she created Present Your Startup. Since then, the concept has grown more and more. Nowadays, Present Your Startup is also active internationally in Cura\u00e7ao and New York."
