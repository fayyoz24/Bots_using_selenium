    "summary": "My name is Elena. I have graduated  at Sumy Teacher Training University , Ukraine, Bachelor in Psychology and Linguistics (English), I received the diploma with honor. My native languages are Ukrainian and Russian. My diploma is recognized in the Netherlands by DUO of the 1-st Degree \"Teacher of English\".\nI had internship at Esdal college in Borger. I am following the language course of Dutch B2 level.\nI had experience of working in the international medical company \nFrom 2009-2010 I used to be hired as a  manager there. This work was very exciting for me because besides communication and business correspondence, which were daily activities, unexpected issues related with shipment or certification of the product emerged.\nI   collected and translated documents for the Certification of medical instruments. (Certificates of Origin, power of attorney, I SO certificates). Cooperation with the designer about making company catalogue was also my responsibility. Tight deadlines and challenges motivated me and gave clear understanding of fruitful cooperation and achievement of the result.\nI am strongly motivated person to be hired due to my willingness to achieve better result.\nI like to participate in the challenging projects also if they require tight deadlines.\nI am familiar with Asian and Slavonic cultures and their approach to work. Our European partners shared with their experiences which lead to fruitful cooperation within each project.  \n\nBeing a student I had a great opportunity to be an athlete of the University archery team. With chances to participate in competition and communicate with different athletes and cooperate with wise coaches.\n",
