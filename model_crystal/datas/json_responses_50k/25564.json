    "summary": "Making an impact by assisting financial clients in managing the ESG disclosure demands and data challenges, thriving for a more transparent and greener financial sector. By 'thinking ahead' I believe FSI's can become catalysators in fighting climate change and protecting our nature. Climate change and nature loss are interconnected challenges that can only be solved if they are addressed in tandem. With my enthusiastic and hands-on attitude I encourage and assist financial clients in retooling their finance to natural capital, making Nature-positive finance a realization.",
