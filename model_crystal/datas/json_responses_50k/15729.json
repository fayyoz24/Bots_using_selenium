    "summary": "I am currently the Team Lead Enhanced Experimentation and Reactor Operations within the catalyst R&D area for Shell. Within this role I lead a team of 23 people in total (Shell staff and contractors), where we develop new catalyst and test these as well against current commercial reference material. The main areas we work in are: Hydrocracking, Hydrotreating, Dewaxing and Aromatics specialties. This based on core support, but as well related to the energy transition related activities. \n\nAdditional to my role, I develop tools myself and through others based on the MS power platform that are used within the VP-ship. This is part of the digital strategy. \n\nDuring my Bachelor degree in analytical chemistry at the Hogeschool Leiden, I did my internship at Shell and after this internship I have decided to join Shell in 2009. My first roll was within catalyst preparation, followed by a testing role at microflow scale. \n\nI live nearby Amsterdam in the Netherlands, where I live with my wife and two children. My free time I like to spend on running and on watching a variety of documentaries and series.\n",
