    "summary": "One month of PC hardware shop putting PC's together in 1993 - I still setup my own PC's.\n\nTechnical Support for Symantec's Norton branded Tools range until 2003 as well as the Symantec and Visual Caf\u00e9 Product range upto version 4.0 plus quite a few dead products (software taken over from Central Point, Fifth Generation Systems, Symantec's own Q&amp;A and ACT!).\n\nI got my Java JDK 1.1 Programmer Certificate from Sun at the time I did Visual Caf\u00e9 support and haven't stopped programming in Java since then - usually small stuff, though.\n\nAt NetApp I extended my knowledge on Networking, Fibre Channel (Brocade Certified 4Gbit Fabric Professional) and of course the Filer product and it's offspring of external software to support its functionality.\n\nSpecialties: Storage, Fibre Channel, Java, DOS & Windows.\nProblem solving (in general).\nCommodore and Apple fan (it bites, I know ;-).",
