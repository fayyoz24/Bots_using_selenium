In this project, together with the team I analysed the different processes that were to migrate whilst doing some research in order to understand the problems and pain points of the previous platform as well as the necessities of the users. Keeping in mind the newest design but at the same time the familiar functionalities of the old one, improving its usability and accessibility and ultimately, the user experience. \nDuring the project I created the wireframes and the high-fidelity prototypes, while collaborating with the team and making the changes that came along the way.\n\nTools: Axure RP, Sketch, Abstract, Zeplin.",
