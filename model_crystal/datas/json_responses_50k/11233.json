    "summary": "A recent Communication and Media graduate with more than 2 years experience in Creative writing,  Copywriting and Social Media Marketing. Looking for a new opportunity in the field. \n\nDuring my studies, I have written for 2 student magazines and worked as a marketing & communication intern. I like to transmit ideas of people, business, and organisations through words, be it in blog, interviews, or social media posts. \n\nWriting combines two of my greatest passion: my endless curiosity and my desire to share it with the world. I pursue this dream further by creating my own blog: ongiantshoulder.wordpress.com, where I share my thoughts on any question that bugs me in feminism, politics, culture, etc.\n\nI also excel in research and data skills in my university education, which gives me the ability to explore new subjects or areas of interest on my own.\n\nIf you're interested in my work, please visit: https://traminguyenthi2101.wixsite.com/portfolio",
