    "summary": "In the last 9 years I\u2019ve developed my career working in the medical device manufacturing industry. Throughout this time I have worked in various functions, departments and on over 100 new product introductions.\n\nI\u2019m specialized in coordinating new product launch preparation and product lifecycle magement projects for the EMEA region. By combining my thoroughness with the ability to manage multiple projects of shifting priorities and strong communication skills, I have had a significant contribution to bringing healthcare products from manufacturer to the consumer. \n\nI\u2019m most proud of the projects that resulted in launching new, innovative products that can truly change people\u2019s lives by bringing healthcare in their focus. I gain my energy from these projects and do not shy away from complex problems and challenges.\n\nIn my non-professional side I love spending time with my daughters, reading, exploring gastronomy and bing-watching Netflix shows.",
