    "summary": "Back in the 1990's, I started out in the developing ICT sector and maintained employment there till well past the turn of the millenium. Then in 2004, I re-evaluated the path I was taking through life and decided to change careers and enroll myself as a student of Mechanical Engineering and Control systems at the Technical University Delft. I continued working part-time during that time frame and completed these studies in 2009. \n\nThen I've restarted my professional career as a teacher of Mechanical Engineering and Control Systems at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht and have since moved to a new teaching position at the Hague University of Applied Science. \n\nAdditionally, I've started a business in privately offered (post-grad) courses and as a designer/projectleader/consultant in the field of mechanical engineering and mechatronic systems in particular. I'm absolutely thrilled with these new opportunities and the wide range of (in-depth and hands-on) activities that it entails. It is indeed lovely, if not inspirational, to be the master of your own fate and to work with people who are trying to advance themselves through education.\n\nSpecialties: I've found both in my professional career as well as my private activities that I'm most valuable in developing new projects and technologies with typically long term implications or societal relevance. I enjoy the visionary aspect in these endeavours as well as the trail-blazing character combined with the building of a robust organisation. I am very meticulous with respect to achieving enduring results and may sometimes be accused of being less interested in \"just\" short-term gains.",

The initial function of this company was to house the activities related to the course \"System dynamics and modern control engineering\" as developed for the Mikrocentrum Engenia post-grad education program. However, I'm expanding my activities to other education organisations as well as performing design work and project management assignments in the field of mechanical engineering and especially mechatronic systems and control engineering. Customers include among others, LIS Leiden ( Instrumentmakers School ), SRON (Stichting Ruimtevaart Onderzoek Nederland, Space Research Netherlands), VU Amsterdam (University Amsterdam) and Mikrocentrum - Engenia ( Branch Organisation Precision Engineering - post grad courses)\n\nThe company name refers to the equation Q x Q = Q^2 where the Q's stand for Quality and Quintessence. Carefully combining both in a product or service in equal measure maximizes the usefulness of the total to more then the sum of both or any other product of equal sum (cost). Indeed, (Q-i) x (Q+i) < Q^2 for any value for i. Therefore, optimal balancing of these two factors should be the main focus of any endeavour and hence the name of the company is also its motto.",
