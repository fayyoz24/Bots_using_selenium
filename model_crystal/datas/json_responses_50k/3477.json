    "summary": "How can you explain something difficult in the easiest way possible? \n\nI am planning to graduate with a double master's degree in Life Science & Technology and Science Communication. I think that combining these two fields of research is important because the language used in science is too difficult to understand for the average person. That is why I have chosen to follow both an engineering program and a program that teaches me to convey what I have learned. \n\nNext to studying, I am active at D.S.R.V. \"Laga\", the student rowing association in Delft. Laga has given me the opportunity to develop my soft skills, for example, a sense of responsibility and leadership during my time as president of the WRC. As a committee member of the Laga Business Club, I have learned to maintain professional contacts, collaborate, and take initiative. I enjoy finding a different challenge and learning something new every time.\n\nBesides that, I like being active. I used to be a rower, but for the last few years, I have focussed on triathlon. I train every day to achieve my goals, two of which are the half Ironman in Luxembourg and Maastricht. In the time that remains I like to read.",
