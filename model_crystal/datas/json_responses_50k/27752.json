    "summary": "I am a Design and Development engineer. I have experience in conducting research in the field of mechanical- and Aeronautical engineering. As a mechanical design engineer, I have realized multiple projects with each of the following 3D CAD-and FEM applications as  CATIA, Solidworks, Autodesk Inventor, ANSYS (CFD), Matrix Frame. I am also familiar with FDM 3D printing, Composites, Epoxy, and Office. I have conducted research on the structure of the Silicon detector unit made out of Carbon Fiber-Epoxy which may be used in the LHC  (Cern) commission by NIKHEF. Recently I designed and manufactured by means of 3D printing a Wing (span 1,5 meter) for Catalina scale model aircraft Commission by Leapfrog.\n\nCurrently, I am working as a mechanical design Engineer at IV-Infra. \n",
