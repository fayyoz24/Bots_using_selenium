Because of our success, the trip has since been offered again.\nIn the months leading to our trip, we prepared research reports on various topics from interpersonal relationships, to environmental issues, and gender equality and presented our findings and questions to the Karmapa throughout our daily meetings. \n\nOur incredible experience resulted in the publication of the book The Heart Is Noble: Changing the World from the Inside Out, written by the professor and Buddhist nun, organizers of the trip. Through his words, the Karmapa offered us a path for participating in a global community that is based on compassion, interconnectedness and inter-cultural cooperation.",
