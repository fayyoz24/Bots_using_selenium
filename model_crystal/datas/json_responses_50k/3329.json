    "summary": "POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTALISM\nThe importance of technology, sustainability, innovation and economic development.\n\nM+R interior architecture is a international design office founded by Hans Mar\u00e9chal. Our fields of activity often involve complex assignments such as converting and designing offices, restaurants, hotels and shops. Among our design skills and core activities for building and exhibition architecture we are also involved with revitalising existing buildings and monuments in particular. The architects from M+R determine the form and content of each design assignment on the basis of the programme of requirements. \nCreativity, functionality, sustainability and ergonomics are translated in a well thought-out manner into a unique final product with an identity of its own. The starting-point is usually a conceptual approach to the design task, for which a total plan is developed, with a sharp eye for details. \nThe power of a strong design is vision, innovation and the quality of realisation.\n\n\u2018Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere\u2019\n\nWe attach a lot of value to the integration of technology and its possibilities. Light architecture is also a speciality within the firm, seeing as light in particular makes an important contribution to the quality of life \u25cf\n\nSpecialties: SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIVE ARCHITECTURE | INTERIORS",

In order to achieve this, there is chosen for a flexible working environment; an open structure with flexible workplaces. These are divided into three domains on the three floorlevels. Because of this choice for a flexible work environment the entire program is realized within the available square meters and, so saves Koopmans on the accommodation costs.\n \nThe existing office building with a traditional office format and a central corridor area has become a total metamorphosis.  The Office is on the inside completely stripped; for the realization of a pleasant working environment, the lighting, acoustics and climate has to be optimum; There are new acoustic ceilings, there is a sustainable lighting plan with daylight control and the cooling and heating by means of ceiling induction units is settled. As floor covering is chosen for a special carpet; This one has a good feature for absorbing ' fine dust ' and reduces noise.\n ",

This building complex consists of three office towers that are connected by a floor. Three separate entrance units and parking spaces are located under this floor.\nM+R has developed a completely new office concept in close collaboration with the stakeholders and users of BDO. The building concept took shape in the various inspiration and co-creation sessions initiated by M+R on behalf of BDO. The first floor of the building is a large open space where the reception, meeting rooms and the work, eat and meet restaurant are housed. An important part of the concept is the large staircase annex seating tribune that is placed in the middle of the floorspace with which the upper office floors are connected. This tribune is also the place for presentations to large groups of people. This is a large opening between the 1st and 2nd floors therefor is a new steel construction designed. \nThe meeting rooms are equipped with \"state of the art\" audiovisual resources that contribute to the new way of working. In addition to the meeting rooms, this floor will have various different places for consultation, all in a healthy green environment with lots of plants.\n\nThe work floors are set up with the work concept of M+R, specially developed for BDO; a meandering landscape with working areas; collaborative spaces; quiet areas, meeting areas, etc. \nA proven concept that has already been successfully rolled out (and copied) in several places. Sustainability is always central at M+R projects, for this project sustainable (bio based and C2C) products are applied and parts of the existing furniture are reused.\n\n\n",

Volatile designs that quickly get you tired are not for us.\n\nDurability\nM+R interior architecture creates interiors for public spaces such as theaters, airports, libraries and innovative work environments. Some of them date back to when M+R was just founded, more then twentytwo years ago. Quality and sustainability are returning themes in all our designs. We use high-quality, sustainable materials that we use in a circular manner. We want to prevent the customer from becoming restless and wanting to change after a few years. Volatility should never be the basis. The office projects we design should still feel like home after years. Important factors in this are atmosphere, climate, acoustics and ergonomics.\n\nInternal and external: one story\nIf our team starts a new project, we will start a conversation with as many future \"residents\" as possible. Before we make a design, we would like to hear all wishes, requirements and information from both stakeholders and users. Like what is the environment in which they feel most at home? This, together with the environment, forms the basis for the design. We have extensive experience with characteristic, often monumental buildings. We always first enter into a relationship with the building and its surroundings. An interior must match and respond to the outside. Internal and external must tell one story.",
