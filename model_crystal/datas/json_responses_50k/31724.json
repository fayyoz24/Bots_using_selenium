    "summary": "As a native of South Africa, I am passionate about improving the country's healthcare system and promoting better lifestyles. My future mission is to gain a global understanding of chronic disease prevention and implement tailored strategies in and around South Africa. As a PhD student with a background in the field of global health and health economics, I understand the importance of health economics in healthcare delivery. It helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions about resource allocation, cost-effectiveness, and policy development, ultimately optimizing the use of resources, improving the quality of care, and enhancing patient outcomes. In the face of challenges such as rising healthcare costs and disparities in access to care, it is clear that change is necessary.",

This certificate was awarded to me at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS), in the Hague as I completed a minimum effort of 80 hours within 6 months of social service work (MDT). \n\nDuring the beginning of the COVID\u201919 outbreak  in Europe, I wanted to offer a helping hand and contribute within the community of the Hague (where I was writing my thesis remotely), by being a health host in elderly homes, organizing \u201cConnect together day\u201d for international youth in the Hague to reduce loneliness among the youth, grocery shopping for the vulnerable who feared infection etc. Additionally, I assessed visitors controlling the HMC+ hospital through questionnaire and the measurement of the temperature. I grew personal development, social context and knowledge of my community.\nhttps://vimeo.com/447394958  - (see if you can spot me in the short promotion video \ud83d\ude09)\nWebsite: http://www.haagsehelpers.nl/",
