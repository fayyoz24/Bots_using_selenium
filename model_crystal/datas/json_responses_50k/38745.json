    "summary": "ARTIST STATEMENT\nRobert van de Graaf (b. 1983, the Netherlands) is interested in the connection and relation between the mystical in this world, in all its manifestations (the sea, the sky, nature, human built environments, light and darkness), and the sense and the dimension of the spiritual world and our soul. \nIn his exploration he is seeking the mystical hidden in this world which he translates into metaphorical paintings. The artworks express a complicated interplay of visual impressions and an emotional and spiritual reflection. They give substance to his ongoing journey to seek meaning in life.\n\nWith his work Van de Graaf questions human destiny and how we as human beings can develop ourselves and grow on a spiritual level. He wishes his artworks to stimulate an opening towards personal deepening, both for himself and the viewer. The artworks aim to elicit a gaze back at the viewer, a reflection of feelings, crossing the line from observation to introspection.\n\nVan de Graaf draws his inspiration from religious and spiritual stories, mythology, mystical places and the philosophy of life. His poetry, written during or before the creative process, also has a direct influence on his work.\nHe transforms his inspiration into contemporary interpretations while richly referring to artists through all times of art history such as Caspar David Friedrich, Anselm Kiefer, Joan Mitchell and the old masters.\n\nThough primarily working on his oil paintings, he is also using drawings and watercolours during the creation process. The oil paintings are layered, densely merging his diverse range of mark making, the expressive use of colour and studied compositions. His mark making, using brushes and palette knives, is moving from energetic gestural marks to very delicate ones, wishing his mark making to create a language which speaks directly to the heart and soul, not only to the ratio and mind. Throughout the different stages of the work he is adjusting in working speed, working from fast directed intuitive outbursts to precisely observed slower additions. \nThe paintings are often large in scale and balance between the figurative and the abstract, giving a certain freedom to the viewer.\n\nVan de Graaf received a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Architecture (Technical University Delft) in 2009. At an early age he enjoyed an intense private painting and drawing training (1996 - 2001) by the Dutch artist Erica Meyster (1949 - 2006).\n\nVan de Graaf experiences the process of creating as inner battles, freedom and faith.",

            "description": "The series is inspired by transition periods in life. Moving from darker, difficult periods into the lighter ones, navigating through life to find your own path and the inner spiritual transitions to restore the connection with our souls. These transitions often lead to breaking points in life, crossroads, difficult necessary choices and the need of letting go of the negativity from the past. The paintings are abstract symbolic translations about these transitions and processes. These abstract metaphorical translations are staged on the island Patmos (Greece) where the beauty of the earth seems to touch a glimpse of heaven. The inspiration is semi autobiographical, but this given is not of any importance, as Van de Graaf thinks that themes like spiritual processes, depression and letting go of the past are universal themes which concern a lot of people around the world.",

            "description": "'Silence and The City'\nSeries of oil paintings (17), watercolor study drawings (14) and oil stick-drawing (1) \n\nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe series \u2018Silence and The City\u2019 is inspired by New York City and the search for contemplation and inner silence in everyday life, about finding meaning in life and the connection of the spiritual world with everyday life. \n\nEvery individual\u00a0is confronted with a universal question how to find meaning in\u00a0life. Van de Graaf feels a strong connection with the vibrance of New York City, but is also aware that searching meaning in life is sometimes harder when life is going that fast. The contrast between contemplation and the busy city life of New York City in a normal setting has been a great inspiration for him. He admires the ability of the city to be a melting pot of all kinds of people and really fell in love with the city. \n\nVan de Graaf draws inspiration from both the time he lived in New York City, 2006 - 2007, and his trip to New York in September 2017 and November 2019. When he was walking in New York City he was struck by moments of silence by different kind of places he documented. This documentation has been the starting point of this series.\n\nHe was struck by the beauty of the contrast between the oldest buildings in New York City, amongst others its churches, and the (modern) high rise buildings next to them. He experienced these silent places in the city like little islands of silence within the busy city life.\n\nVan de Graaf is using several (architectural) metaphors in his paintings to express these themes. An example are the crossroads in the paintings which he uses as a metaphor for important moments in life when the choices of the turns you take determine directions in life. In this series he also introduces the square shaped canvas because all sides are equal and no direction is determined by its shape.",

In September 2018 and September 2019 Robert visited the island Patmos in Greece where the Cave of Saint John is situated.\n\nThis series is inspired by the person Saint John, by his holy Cave and the (spiritual) journey of life. The artworks research how he lived in solitude in his Cave with his pupil Prochoros and could receive his visions from Heaven. Van de Graaf is particularly interested in Saint John\u2019s connection with the spiritual world. The artworks are a modern translation on a theme which refer to the inspiration of the old masters as El Greco\u2019s \u2018The Vision of Saint John\u2019 (1608-1614).\n\nIn some paintings Van de Graaf tried to transmit the Heavenly light which revealed herself through Saint John in a deep state of contemplation where other paintings focus more on the philosophy of life and the search for meaning in life.\n\nHis research, documentation and experience form the starting point of this series. \n",

In this series he tries to blend together his imagination and passages from the Revelations while keeping  some freedom of interpretation for the viewer. Every painting is inspired by different passages of the Revelations.\nThe apostle Saint John was banned to the island Patmos (Greece) where his spirit was touched by the Spirit of God to write down the Revelations. St. John dictated his visions to his pupil Prochoros who wrote down the visions. The pictures are seen through the eyes of Prochoros, who was the spectator of St. John and his visions. \n\nThe Revelations remain a mystery as the texts are very hard to fathom. Van de Graaf interprets the Revelations as a comment on modern society and a warning towards the fragility of the earth and mankind.\n\nDuring his gallery research trip to New York in 2017 he visited the \u2018Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine\u2019  in New York City (Amsterdam Avenue at 112th street). From that moment he decided to dedicate at least three series to the Revelations and St. John the Divine. \n\nPlease visit my website to see all the paintings of the series.",

The sea and the beautiful Dutch skies are also an ongoing source of inspiration for him. Every day he absorbs its beauty and colors because he is living and working next to the sea. \n\nThese paintings are both referring to themes of the old masters, as to give his own modern translation and interpretation of his historical subjects. With every painting there is a sort of story board with references to biblical passages and references to paintings of the Old Masters as Rembrandt\u2019s \u2018The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\u2019 (1632).\n\nIn these paintings he is working towards a balance between figuration and abstraction.\n",

                    "description": "BIOGRAPHY\nRobert van de Graaf (1983, born in The Hague, the Netherlands) is a Dutch visual artist living and working in The Hague, the Netherlands. \n\nVan de Graaf received a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Architecture (Technical University Delft) in 2009. In 2005 and 2006, he worked as an intern in architecture in New York City. At Steven Learner Studio he worked on several art-related projects.\nSince 2012 he is devoting himself entirely to his career as a visual artist. He has since produced a large body of work, consisting theme-based series of artworks which are exhibited in numerous online and physical exhibitions.\n\nHe also enjoyed an intense private painting and drawing training at an early age (1996 - 2001) by the Dutch artist Erica Meyster (1949 - 2006).\u00a0\n\nVan de Graaf is interested in the connection and relation between the mystical in this world, in all its manifestations, and the sense and the dimension of the spiritual world and our soul.\nIn his exploration he is seeking the mystical hidden in this world which he translates into metaphorical paintings. The artworks express a complicated interplay of visual impressions and an emotional and spiritual reflection. They give substance to his ongoing journey to seek meaning in life.\n\nHe draws his inspiration from religious and spiritual stories, mythology, mystical places and the philosophy of life. His poetry, written during or before the creative process, also has a direct influence on his work.\n\nThough primarily working on his oil paintings, he is also using drawings and watercolours during the creation process. The works are layered, densely merging his diverse range of mark making, the expressive use of colour and studied compositions. The paintings are often large in scale and balance between the figurative and the abstract, giving a certain freedom to the viewer.\n\nHis art is held in private collections through the Netherlands, the United States and France.",
