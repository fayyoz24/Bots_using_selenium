    "summary": "Hey there, just so you know, there's a real person behind this profile! And I consider myself as the lucky generation! \ud83c\udf40 Why? I will tell you.\u2028\u2028\n\nWhen I first started out, I saw myself as a third-generation immigrant in the Netherlands and that influenced the way I saw things and what I wanted to achieve. I felt like I had a responsibility to make up for all the struggles that my family had gone through in the past. \u2028However, I realized that this mindset was holding me back and limiting my potential. \u2028\u2028Now, I like to think of myself as part of the lucky generation. Of course, I still draw on my family's experiences as a source of inspiration and motivation, but I don't let that define me or hold me back from reaching for the stars!\n\nSome examples of why I consider myself as fortunate, I:\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\u00a0- Did my Master in Barcelona and graduated with a 9,1 for my thesis\n\ud83d\udcb0 - Started as a trainee at ABN AMRO\u2019s Application and Digital Innovation department\n\ud83d\udcb0 - Worked as a Product Owner with the founders of DEGIRO\n\ud83d\udcb0 - Conquered the European market with Woolsocks (Live in 7 countries already)\n\ud83c\udf0d - Explore the world with loved ones\n\ud83c\udfc6 - Play Golf, Football, Padel or go to the gym when I want\n\ud83c\udfb7 - Take parties when needed (Amsterdam summer is the best)\n\ud83c\udf4f - Am in good health!\n\nIs it always a straight line, well you know the answer. But it builds character!\n\nI'm always open to grow my personal and professional network. Feel free to connect via LinkedIn.",
