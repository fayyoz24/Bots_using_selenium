In doing so I've learned the following:\n- Many different NLP libraries such as Spacy, NLTK, SimpleTransformers\n- Popular back-end Python libraries Flask and Gunicorn\n- How to build a Neural Search Engine\n- How to do manual text processing, clean data, process documents of any file format\nAfter that I was working with Simran, and that was the time where I got more advanced experience in Python:\n- I learned how to train a Keras model to get word vectors, clustering and visualization techniques, dimensionality reduction techniques\n- I learned how to make ingenious use of trained word vectors from transformer networks based on BERT\nAnd more broadly, I learned to think ahead when developing anything, and the benefits of having a highly structured codebase. I learned the importance of communication and how to have efficient and effective meetings. I also helped a lot with the ideation of new functionality for our customers and helped as much as I could to turn the ideas into a software plan that can be developed and deployed, which happened many times throughout my time there.",
