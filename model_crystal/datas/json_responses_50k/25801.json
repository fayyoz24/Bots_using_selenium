    "summary": "I have 8 year\u2019s of experience in the Additive manufacturing of Metal matrix composite for aerospace, defence and biomedical implants applications. Still i am continuously improving my skill in additive manufacturing. Aluminium, copper, steel are the materials on which I am working from past several years.\nMy research experience is focus on material characterization techniques like HRTEM, Surface profilometry, Raman Spectroscopy, Mechanical testing, APT, XRD, X-ray CT, Tribology, EIS etc.\nI also worked on direct ink writing technique for the development of flexible electronics.\nAs a researcher I am always looking for good collaborations in additive manufacturing domain.\nOther than my research skills, I am also a first generation entrepreneur, hold the Managing Director position at Mcube 3D Printing Pvt. Ltd. With my extremely dedicated team at Mcube 3D we are working on bringing the laboratory scale technology to ground level for improving the life style of common man. In order to do so we continuously collaborate across the globe and also invest in other tech based companies.",
