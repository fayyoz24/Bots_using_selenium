    "summary": "I am a talented, highly organised and enthusiastic fashion all-rounder and am seeking my next opportunity in the industry.  I graduated with 1st class honours in Fashion Design with a 2nd major in Marketing in 2020 and was identified as one of the top 5 emerging fashion designers by the Australian Fashion Council at that time.  Since graduation I have interned and worked for Iris van Herpen in Amsterdam.  During my 6-month internship I was exposed to all facets of the atelier and was subsequently employed to lead and manage the new interns as well as to head the textile and technique development.  In this role I worked alongside Iris, the atelier team as well as fabric developers, artisans and other collaborators.  \n\nWhilst I love working three-dimensionally, I also have a great passion for sport and travel, being fortunate enough to have visited 27 countries, of which i\u2019ve lived in 4 and studied in 3. Primarily driven by my desire to understand the lives and actions of others as I believe insight is one of the few ways we can move forward in a harmonious way.",
