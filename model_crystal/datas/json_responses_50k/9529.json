    "summary": "After 14 years of working as a conflict resolution professional and 22 years as a trainer, coach and lecturer for different organisations, I decided to start contributing to others through my own company Mediacio.\n\nThroughout my career my passion is to understand and work with the deeper motivations and needs of people in their actions, decisions and \u2018stuckness\u2019. It is my intention to facilitate trauma-informed processes in which people can learn, develop and heal. And in which they feel they can take ownership in the steps they want to take.  \n\nI strongly belief that everyone can learn how to deal with (inner) conflicts and their underlying emotions, we just weren\u2019t taught how. When you know its principles, dynamics and the specific root causes of the situation you are in, and you dare to look and feel inside yourself and really listen to the other, the keys are there to create change.\n\nMy expertise:\nMediation and conflict transformation | international negotiation and mediation | diplomacy | women & youth peace and security | leadership development | change management | trauma healing | breath work | intercultural dialogue | education management | peace education\n\nI work through:\ntraining | conflict coaching |  life coaching | mediation | group facilitation | Technology of Participation (ToP) | ACT coaching | trauma & breath work methods \n\n#transformation #conflictresolution #changemanagement #leadership # lifecoaching #training #mediation #negotiation #traumainformed",

For the last 14 years I have been working within both the training & development as the peacebuilding field, as a lead trainer & lecturer, life and conflict coach, mediator, and dialogue facilitator.\n\nConflict is usually looked at as something negative. But it can also be seen as a chance to alter a situation into something new.  That is, if you are willing to broaden your perspective and look for alternatives to where you are now. Together with the other or on a deeper personal level. It could open up possibilities you did not think of before if you dare to touch the difficult issues. Through training sessions, in-depth analysis of the situation, mediation and/or group facilitation I support people in their search for opportunities of change and creating peace. In both the international conflict  and security field (peace negotiations/mediations, national dialogue processes) and the Dutch society.\n\nFurthermore, I work with those that are 'stuck' in a conflict situation or in their daily life. With the help of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), Polyvagal Theory, Focusing, Breathwork and participatory TOP methods of ICA, I help people in learning how to deal with the obstacles that they are facing in a  more flexible way (acceptance). Through conflict coaching I help to focus on objectives they want to reach. By uncovering what truly drives people, by being in contact with underlying feelings and thoughts through trauma-informed life coaching, we work towards acting with commitment towards objectives and improvement of life.\n\nHave a look at my website to learn more on what I could bring to you: www.mediacio.nl (soon also in English).",

Yet in conflict resolution the importance of the stakeholders\u2019 negotiation and mediation capacity in achieving a successful outcome is often underestimated. Enhancing the right skills and knowledge of parties involved in peace processes can greatly increase the chances of success.\n\nSince November 2014 Clingendael Academy started the multi-annual training facility \"Negotiation and Mediation Training as a Conflict Resolution Instrument\".

The main objective of the course is to gain a profound understanding of one of the leading theories in the field of genocide studies, Michael Mann's book in which he explains that murderous ethnic cleansing is the \u2018dark side of democracy'. Mann claims in his book The Dark Side of Democracy that there may be a correlation between the rise of democracy and the outburst of \u2018ethnic cleansing'. \n- The course is characterized by a multi- and interdisciplinary perspective: we encourage students to study murderous ethnic cleansing from different academic perspectives, e.g. history, sociology, psychology, law, and political science.\n\nBeta-Gamma Bachelor Academic Skills\n- First year students of this bachelors program learn the elementary skills that are needed within their academic studies. A whole semester I taught them the practical abilities of academic writing, argumentation/debating and communication competences, interview techniques, how to present papers and an academic poster, and how to pose critical questions.",

Praten, respect opbrengen voor elkaar, kan een oplossing brengen.\u201d\n\nBeterburen is een stichting die bemiddelt in burenconflicten zodat klachten tussen buren weer bespreekbaar worden en er naar passende oplossingen gezocht kunnen worden."
