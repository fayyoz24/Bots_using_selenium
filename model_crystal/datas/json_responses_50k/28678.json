    "summary": "I am an Aerospace Engineering graduate from the Delft University of Technology who wants to analyze and develop aircraft and the control systems and drive them. Ever since I went flying in my grandfather's Cessna, I've been interested in aerospace and to develop this interest into a career. Non-conventional aircraft represent a unique, challenging, and engaging field. I want to ensure that these aircraft not only become realised but do so in a safe, practical, and sustainable manner.\n\n- During my education I learned how to create dynamic designs following KBE principles.\n- I also learned how to create feasible designs that adhere MDO requirements.\n- My hobbies include avid sci-fi and fantasy reader and hobby writer.\n- I'm eager to learn about new, emerging technologies and commited to developing sustainable solutions.",
