    "summary": "You're looking at a full-stack AI Engineer with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and a passion for creativity. With my experience in Data Science, I love to apply Machine Learning models from a practical point of view \u2013 think of developing Proof of Concepts by leveraging the latest research in AI to solve critical business problems. Since AI is more than the models we train, I've diversified my skillset with hands-on experience in backend development, cloud engineering and frontend design to allow for scalable deployment. I specialize in creating innovative end-to-end solutions that utilise Computer Vision, Signal Processing, (Chat)GPT and NLP, ideally collaborating with Scrum. If my profile piques your interest, don't hesitate to send me a message to learn how we can help each other :-)",

With my role as a software developer I help out implementing and improving Docker containers, writing bots that collect data and transform this into practical and usable formats. Given the nature of CSIRT-DSP, I am continuously learning all about Cybersecurity in practice.\n\nI have also worked as an Implementation Manager for the Province of Drenthe, where I coordinated the rollout of new laptops to provincial members while supporting the Servicedesk. I created a structured implementation plan, proactively modified the laptop configuration to fit better with their preferred user experience, and coordinated the rollout to fit perfectly into the members' schedules. Additionally, I provided training and created information materials. The laptop rollout was successful with fewer questions than expected, and I gained valuable project management insights.\n\nIn software development projects at Sogeti, I served as a Scrum Master and Python developer for a Brain-Computer Interface project using Machine Learning algorithms, where I carried out a significant refactor to improve cohesion in the codebase. I also focused on the back-end for a web application project that helps Eritrean refugees learn the Dutch language and culture. In this project, I assisted in finding and interviewing new talent, provided project explanations, and wrote documentation, including a step-by-step guide to running the project. I also converted the back-end to Docker containers and deployed a test version through an Azure pipeline.",
