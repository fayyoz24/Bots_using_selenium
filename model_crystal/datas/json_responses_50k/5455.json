    "summary": "Hello.  I\u2019m Matthew and I have a passion for building brands.  I mean I really love it, I get great pleasure from creating and implementing bold strategies that inspires consumers to respond in a way which makes brands grow.\n\nI do have a certain way of going about things.  I believe curiosity and creativity should be at the core of all strategy.  I know there\u2019s always a way to solve a problem or to get people more excited about the brands I/we champion.  I encourage curiosity and creativity at all levels of an organisation and celebrate great ideas, wherever and whoever they come from.  \n\nIn order to win, I focus on getting the best from all collaborating partners whether they are within my team, within my organisation or external.  This means listening to their ideas, allowing them to change my mind when they have a better point of view and making sure everyone is engaged and motivated to make the most of opportunities.\n\nIt seems to work.   Together with numerous happy, productive humans, from all different parts of the globe and with a vast range of skills and experiences, I have witnessed a lot of brand growth, sometimes exceptional growth.\n\nI really like people.  I\u2019m told I\u2019m fun to work with.  I also love dogs!\n\nWith regards to technical Marketing skills, I think I\u2019m relatively good at the following:\no\tBranding\no\tCreative development\no\tAdvertising and Communication\no\tMarket Research\no\tFinancial Analysis\no\tNew Product Development\no\tBusiness Model Creation\no\tDigital and e-commerce\no\tInnovation and new product development\no\tPortfolio Management\no\tChannel Management",
