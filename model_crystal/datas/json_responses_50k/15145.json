The 2020 Award has three categories: Public Outreach, Press and Media Relations, and Online and Social Media.\n\nThe problem of plastic pollution in the oceans has received extensive media attention. However, there are a number of pervading myths, which could lead to ineffective policies. The winner in the press and media category, ERC-funded TOPIOS project led by Erik Van Sebille, has actively engaged with journalists, policymakers and the public to bust some of these myths with the aim of improving the quality of the public discourse on solutions to plastic pollution.\nThe centrepiece of this public outreach effort was the creation of a website that provides concise answers to the seven common misconceptions about plastic pollution in oceans. To ensure dissemination and wide reach, the project approached a range of international media with a single and clear message: debunking these myths. The effort resulted in impressive media coverage, including prominent media outlets such as Le Monde, Science and National Geographic. The Jury commended TOPIOS\u2019 approach of having a single, clear message, which not only had a considerable impact in the media but also engaged policymakers at the international level.\nMarine plastic pollution is a major environmental problem, however, only about 1 % of all plastic that has ever gone into the ocean has been mapped. The other 99% is \u2018missing\u2019. Having a better understanding of the whereabouts of this missing plastic is important for making effective policies to tackle this problem. The main aim of the TOPIOS project is to create the first three-dimensional map of all the plastic in our oceans.",

            "description": "The amount of plastic in our ocean is exponentially growing, with recent estimates of more than 5 million metric tonnes of plastic reaching the ocean each year. This plastic infiltrates the ocean food chain and thus poses a major threat to marine life. However, understanding of plastic movement and its budget in the ocean is inadequate to fully establish its environmental impact, prompting the EU and G7 to recently make marine litter a top science priority.\n\nIt is now recognised that the amount of plastic entering our ocean is several orders of magnitude larger than the estimates of floating plastic on the surface of the ocean. More than 99% of plastic within our ocean is therefore 'missing'. This project will make breakthroughs towards closing the plastic budget by creating a novel comprehensive modelling framework that tracks plastic movement through the ocean. Building on well-established previous work to follow generic water parcels through hydrodynamic ocean models, this project will modify these 'virtual' parcels to represent pieces of plastic by, for the first time, simulating fragmentation, sinking, beaching, wave-mixing and ingestion by biota.\n\nThe new parameterisations that underpin this modelling will be based on field data and new coastal flume wave tank lab experiments. The simulated plastic particles will be tracked within state-of-the-art hydrodynamic ocean models, in order to compute maps of pathways and transports around our oceans and on coastlines and in biota. This numerical modelling will be used to evaluate a broad suite of scenarios and test hypotheses, including where the risk to marine biota is greatest.\n\nThe results from this project will inform policymakers and the public on which countries, for example, are responsible for which part of the plastic problem, crucial for mitigation and legal frameworks. It will also inform engineers on where and how to best invest resources in mitigating the problem of plastic in our ocean.",

In addition, the CMS provides a Lagrangian descriptions of oceanic phenomena (advection, dispersion, retention) and can be used in a broad range of applications, from the dispersion and fate of pollutants to marine spatial conservation.",
