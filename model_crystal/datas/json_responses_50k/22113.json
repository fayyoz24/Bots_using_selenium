    "summary": "Specialized in policy-based analysis and research on topics ranging from reconciliation, conflict and violence, rule of law to political engagement and voting behaviour. I have worked on projects in over 15 countries, including Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Poland among others. The combination of my anthropological training and hands-on experience within these countries, has allowed me to develop a deeply-rooted cultural sensitivity to different social-political contexts across countries. I have strong analytical skills, and ample experience in analysing and reporting on situational developments on the ground and how these match up with broader political strategic perspectives in international relations. My research work is geared towards translating broader insights into practical and feasible policy recommendations. In addition, I have extensive experience in collaborating with various stakeholders including members of international and national organizations, civil society, academia and people in the field.",

Including 33 countries, my research examined people's emotional responses to human rights violations committed by their country, and how their perceptions of potential reconciliatory strategies (apologies in particular) map onto existing transitional justice frameworks. The overall objective of this research project was to understand whether apologies offered by states for injustices and human rights violations can be considered a universal reconciliation tool, or whether a tailored approach based on cultural variation is more appropriate. The project aims to provide actionable insights concerning the effectiveness of political apologies as a means to address human rights violations, vis-\u00e0-vis or in combination with various other transitional justice measures.\n\n\u00a7 Designed and conducted four independent studies - an online survey (N=345), a field survey (N=1,358), indepth interviews (N=284) and an experimental field survey (N=533) across eight countries: Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Netherlands, Poland and the United States. Designed and conducted a large-scale (online) survey study (N\u224811,000) across 33 countries in 15 languages. \n\n\u00a7 Based in the Netherlands, I regularly travelled to the core study countries as I was responsible for managing collaborations with local partners and managing 70+ research assistants. Work included drafting collaboration agreements, subcontracts and other related documentation, conducting in-field training sessions, and ensuring regular reviews of work conducted. I also coordinated the contract with the survey provider Dynata and regularly contributed to wider project budget management and review.",
