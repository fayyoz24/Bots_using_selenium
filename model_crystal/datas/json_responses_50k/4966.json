    "summary": "I use models and simulations to make better decisions about unclear, expensive, and risky planning problems. As an operations scientist at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), I apply my skills to a variety of decision problems in the public domain. Concurrently, I am a researcher at the Applied Mathematics group of Wageningen University (NL), focusing on innovative methods of modelling and quantifying resilience in complex agri-food systems. My expertise includes agent-based modelling, system dynamics, data analysis/visualization, project management, group leadership, and written and oral communication. I see myself as a goal-driven individual with an eye for the big picture who tackles adversity with structured thinking and strategy.",
