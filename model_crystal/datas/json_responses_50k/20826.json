I was chosen to help the company with organizing events in this camp during the camp shifts for kids. I worked with different teams of 3-6 assistants (or \"Junior Organizers\") and 5-10 senior organizers. We were supposed to work every full day from the beginning to the end of the shift. The shifts, in general, took approximately 5 days, but I have also worked for a 2-week-long one. For me, it was an invaluable experience of working in team under stress and pressure. The work required a lot of stage performances and communication with administration, team members and children aged from 6 to 17. Unfortunately, due to my studies in The Netherlands, I had to give up this job. However, I will be forever glad for the amount of experience, friends and emotions this place has given to me and, probably, I will be able to work for them during our summer breaks.",
