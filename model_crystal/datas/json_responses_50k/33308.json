Unfortunately the downs eventually started to dominate and this led to my being found to be unfit for work.\nUnfortunately not the way I wanted to say goodbye, and certainly not at this moment.\n\nRemains for me to thank everybody, colleagues, former colleagues, customers and Customs for all the great years!\n\nI hope to recover in the future: knowledge and experiance cannot be taken away",
