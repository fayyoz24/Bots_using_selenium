    "summary": "\nSocial scientist with a background in social work. I have a profound knowledge, expertise and research experience with hard to reach and marginalised populations who are disadvantaged and excluded by and within society and societies at large due to racism, stigma and taboo.  \n\nTrained in quantitative and qualitative research methodologies I have a preference as a methodologist to use qualitative research methods and to work collaboratively with research participants to be able to 'talk with them instead of about' because of a strong believe that this will generate relevant information. Nevertheless I am keen to use quantitative research methods with the corresponding scientific computerprograms. \n\nExpert in bridging gaps between theory, policy and practice. Disciplined and committed either by working independently and collaboratively. Thinks 'outside the box' and 'beyond disciplines' \n\nAcademic research interests include: (sexual) citizenship; (contemporary) feminism; meritocracy; cyber (enabled) crime; sex work; sex workers rights movements; sexual commodification; sexual consumption; the intersections between gender-race-sexuality; work&life balance. \n ",

In this study the roles are turned and it are not the men who seek sexual encounters but the women. Women who defer in age, sexual orientation and marital status seem to have common demands and desires. Describing and analysing the demands and desires of female clientele of gigolo\u2019s - questioning \u2018why\u2019 they book a gigolo - contributed to important insights concerning the sex market and the dichotomy between male and female sexuality.

                    "description": "This PhD position was part of the Network for the Advancement of Social and Political Studies (NASP), based at the Graduate School in Social Sciences of the University of Milan, Italy. I was enrolled at the department of Social and Political Sciences within the group of Sociology and Methodology when carrying out a doctoral dissertation titled: 'Consumerism, Moralism and the Law; \nGovernmentalities and spatial displacements of men who pay for sex in Sweden and the Netherlands'. This doctoral dissertation critically explored the conceptualisations of paying for sexual services within academia, policy and society and the influence of a regulation and partial criminalisation on the narratives of heterosexual men that pay for sexual services. \n\nFor abstract please see the file attached",
