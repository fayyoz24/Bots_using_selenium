    "summary": "I have a passion for writing, and I love each step of the process: the planning, the research, the writing, and the editing. It is exciting, not only to have the ability to explore a new world on paper, and to evoke a certain sense of atmosphere or emotion, but also to make the words come together in beautiful patterns. \n\nI enjoy video editing for a similar reason. Video clips are like sentences: one can cut away parts that obstruct the flow and alter the length of the segments to quicken or slow the pace. The video clips can come together and tell stories through different perspectives and moods, just like a written text can. I particularly love to fit videos together with music and make them harmonise. \n\nTeaching is another thing I enjoy doing. While working as a teacher in an elementary school, I loved to use PowerPoint in creative ways to keep the pupils engaged. It was also very handy tool for visualisation when I worked as a substitute teacher in adult education. Although teaching is not synonymous with storytelling, it has a similar aim. As with writing and video editing, teaching aims to capture an audience. It is important to make the content engaging and relevant to the students so that the information sticks. Albeit through a greater range of methods (e.g., more active student involvement, like group work) and on a more personal level, by aiming to understand what each individual student needs in order to learn. As people learn in different ways, I believe variation and differentiation are key for everyone to experience accomplishment. \n\nI am an empathic, creative and open-minded person who looks for the best qualities in people. I am also very internationally oriented. Through studying in the UK, volunteering in South Africa and Mauritius, working as a teacher in adult education, and now living in The Netherlands, I have actively been seeking out international environments. I love to get to know people from different cultures and believe there is a lot one can learn from one another.",
