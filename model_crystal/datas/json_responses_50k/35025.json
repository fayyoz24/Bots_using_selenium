    "summary": "I\u2019m Menzo van Wijngaarden (1991) and currently working for Vertom.\n\nI finalized a 3-year vocational education in logistics at the Scheepvaart en Transport College, followed by a 3 year Bachelor in Logistics and Economics at Rotterdam University of Applied Science. After which I started my pre-master at the Erasmus University where I came to the conclusion that it wasn\u2019t difficult, at least the pre-master courses I followed, but the pre-master courses didn\u2019t satisfy me, it didn\u2019t trigger the passion in me. So I decided to drop out and start working. What does trigger the passion in me? Entrepreneurship, sustainability, innovation and logistics.\n\nRecently, I finished a specialized shipping course at the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers and currently, I'm following a 1 year leadership course at Deen.\n\nI love to travel, it all started with a 3 week trip to Africa (Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, and South Africa) in 2009. In 2010 I had the chance to go to Horsens, Denmark where a 6-month internship to finalize my vocational education took place at DSV Horsens. In 2010 my family and I went to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. During this trip, I got so inspired by Malaysia that from the moment I got back, I started to contact Malaysian universities to try to arrange an exchange university in Kuala Lumpur. I managed to arrange this and in 2012 as part of my bachelor's I studied for 6 months in Kuala Lumpur. The last couple of years I interrailed throughout Europe, visited Sri Lanka, Cuba and went by train from Rotterdam to Beijing (Transmongolia Express). \n\nIn my free time, I train for Triathlons (Swim, Bike and Run), try to eat as much as possible plant-based, gardening, read a book, and spend time with my family and friends.\n\nI would describe myself as eager to learn, taking the initiative, decisive & active, organizer, assertive & dynamic, directed & accurate, self-willed, talker, friendly, business approach, and commercial. Sometimes I can be too enthusiastic and I have to learn to become more of a diplomat.",
