    "summary": "I love Marketing B2B SaaS products. I hate to market myself. So here are seven quick things about me and my work. In, out, saves time because time is money.\n\n\n1.) Created & managed campaigns end to end. And by end to end I don\u2019t mean awareness to lead, I mean from awareness to paying customers (our goal). Some of the hyper-growth SaaS companies I\u2019ve worked with are Trengo, Kovai.co, and Ozonetel. I\u2019m a bit of an explorer myself!\n\n2.) Being an active member of Peak Community (help become a Future CMO). I am a proud member of the LinkedIn Virtual Marketer\u2019s Club, and have been in various growth focussed programs.\n\n3.) Paid Channels/Platforms love using - Google Ads, Microsoft Ads, META, LinkedIn, Quora & Capterra. Paid Channels I\u2019d love the opportunity to explore are - Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, and other customer acquisition channels.\n\n4.) A bit about my personal life. Nowadays, I spend time on books, Audible, podcasts, and Cycling (welcome to my late \u201920s). Looking back I was just playing games and partying.\n\n5.) Being a graduate of Commerce, I was all over the place (customer support, sales, documentation.. etc). Thanks to my keen interest in good commercials (Center Fruit, HAPPYDENT) pushed me to explore Marketing without any prior background. It\u2019s safe to assume I\u2019m a capable marketing professional since you\u2019ve made it here.\n\n6.) This says the highlights of my experiences. I help the business grow its revenue while trying to get more bang for the buck. Let\u2019s see more of how I\u2019d achieve that. I don\u2019t expect you to believe everything I say without any plan of action.\n\n7) Contact me for this\ud83d\udcde. Don't forget to send your email and phone number.",
