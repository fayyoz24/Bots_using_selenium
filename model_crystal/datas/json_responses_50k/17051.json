    "summary": "I am experienced in complex design projects ranging from urban planning and architecture to the technical details. In all my projects sustainability is key not only in terms of materials, energy, transport and awareness, but also from the social aspect as the interaction between humans and the built environment is crucial.\nI am always motivated to work on projects ranging from urban planning to sustainable consultancy; in recent years I gained extensive experience in sustainability from the scale of renewable energy integration in the landscape to new neighbourhoods and how to augment sustainability in the already existing buildings.\n\nSpecialities :\n- sustainable design (energy & materials)\n- passive house (renovation)\n- integrated design\n- project management\n- site supervision \n- energy loss calculations (thermal bridge / EPC / PHPP)\n- technical and architectural detailing\n",

Together we carried out a comprehensive energy study on the existing and future buildings. We monitored the water and energy consumption to design the most sustainable and custom-made system. \nThe new building is biobased with massive wood walls (CLT), woodfiber-insulation, Fermacell and ecological paints. The outside wood cladding is made of the 15 cedars that had to be cut to build the new building, two fallen oak trees are used for the balustrades. \n\nIn all projects I was responsible for the sketch design, technical design, building permits, supervision on site and project management. All decisions were made in close collaboration with the monks. \nMost projects are developed with the help of the monastery's volunteers working under my supervision. The projects of a bigger scale were done by professional companies under my guidance.",
