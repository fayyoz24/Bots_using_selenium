    "summary": "I am a young person with a mindset focused on engineering challenges related to chemical and metallurgical processes. Further, I like working with a team on getting to a solution for complicated and interdisciplinary challenges. I also get great joy out of helping other people further their understanding of topics. Finally, I am an energetic sportsman who does not give up until the goal has been achieved.\n\nI have studied Sustainable Metals Processing at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. There I have done my Master's thesis in the Research Group for Metallurgy and the topic of my thesis was: \"A study of industrial steel making dusts: melting behavior and interactions with refractory bricks\". I have also worked a summer job in the Research Group for Metallurgy working on a literature survey on reactivity of coal in ilmenite smelting and the available experimental methods. \n\nBefore moving to Finland and doing my Master's degree there, I have gotten experience as a teaching assistant for the course General and Anorganic Chemistry given as part of the Bachelor Molecular Science and Technology at the TU Delft and University of Leiden. I have also worked for about half a year as an Amanuensis at the Laurens Lyceum high school in Rotterdam. ",
