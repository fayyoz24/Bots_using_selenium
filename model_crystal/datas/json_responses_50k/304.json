            "description": "This book project enquires the rise of domestic public engagement in diplomatic affairs, which has altered the conventional wisdom on two-level games between diplomacy and domestic politics. The informal political sphere has become more important, people as the smallest units of society have greater agency and the domestic public has become a more important factor in diplomatic considerations. This multi-disciplinary project aims to further open academic research to the home dimension of diplomacy. Contributors will explore the multi-faceted nature of state-society dialogues, different theoretical approaches that can be applied to this emerging phenomenon, and to what extent diplomatic practices and foreign policy are shaped by state-society relations.

It is inspired by scholarship on queer IR and gender and diplomacy, and motivated by the lack of a sexuality component in the literature on diplomacy. Our research points toward a strong relationship between sexual orientation and diplomacy, as a result of both the personal identity of the diplomat as well as a range other factors. The project and its conclusion speak to wider discussions about foreign policy, change in diplomatic practice and organisational diversity and inclusion.",

            "description": "This research project has been commissioned by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs has led to various publications, including an article for GLOBAL POLICY (September 2018) and an op-ed published by EURACTIV (2017). Government policies supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) do not prevent friction, lack of mutual understanding and cultural clashes with the private sector. We argue that this relational issue is a neglected concern, albeit readily recognized by practitioners. In discussing public\u2013private relations, this project points to a theoretical and practical challenge. Apart from analysing relevant literatures, we have benefited from varied data collection with input from policy makers, diplomats, business representatives and consulted experts across cultures.",
