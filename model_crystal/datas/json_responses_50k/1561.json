It is a competition in which each CanSat must meet the traditional requirements of volume and not exceed 350 grams of mass along with others related to the flight time and to budget. In addition to measuring pressure and temperature and transmit this data in real time. Apart from this, the CanSat should play a secondary mission of free choice. Proposals for this mission are used to select the teams that will launch their CanSats on board a rocket that ascends to 1000 meters, where it opens and drops the two CanSats which are inside.\n\nOur team, DsanG, studied the evolution of blood flow during the acceleration of the rocket. To manage this, we built a small model of the human heart and blood vessels, programmed an Arduino to capture and transmit data and set up a Raspberry Pi to collect this data on a ground level.\n\nWinner of National (Belgian) competition in May 2018\nParticipation in the European competition in June 2018",
