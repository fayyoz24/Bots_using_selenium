    "summary": "HELLO \n\n\nI work with conscious leaders to unlock their human super powers and make them a force for good. I combine powerful techniques from tantra, shadow work, and meditation to hyper charge personal transformation.\n\n// WHY SHADOW WORK FOR CONSCIOUS LEADERS?\nThe positive impact of the companies we build are a direct representation of the level of awareness of it's leaders. Unconscious leaders make destructive companies. Conscious leaders can be an unimaginable force for good. My method to increase the level of awareness of leaders is 'Shadow Work'. In Shadow Work we will investigate what the hidden motives under your actions are. \n\nAre you an entrepreneur or leader in your field? Do you want to use your talents for good, and really feel you are contributing to the world? Let's talk.\n\n// MY BACKGROUND\nOver the last ten years I coached over 100 companies and individuals. Due to my background as Head of Growth of several tech startups like Peerby, Superbuddy and Vigga I am able to relate to the forces at play in the business world. \n\n// HOW I WORK\nI run a 2 month intensive 1:1 program for conscious leaders. In this program we'll dive deep into you. We investigate why you are here on this planet, find out what the obstacles are to live your full potential and work step by step towards full a unlocking of your inner strength.",

This creates a healthy, vibrant culture with excellent results.\n\n// MY EXPERIENCE\nOver the last 5 years I worked in leading growth roles of tech startups like Peerby, Vigga and Superbuddy (AH Rappie) and I saw it over and over again: a team thrives when there is a clear strategy, effective growth processes and a healthy culture. Based on my experience as a growth consultant for over 30 companies and the workshops I give in personal development and human connection I created a team coaching process focussed on maximum results and employees that are shining with happiness. \n\n// FOR WHO?\nI work with teams and individuals that embrace a lean approach and want to find bright shiny fulfilment in their work.\n- Founders & CEO's\n- Startup & Scale up teams (growth teams mostly)\n- Corporate innovation teams\n\n// HOW DO I ACHIEVE RESULTS:\nI coach teams on three dimensions:\n- Culture & Purpose: I facilitate Team Culture and individual Purpose Sessions. This creates a feeling of trust and inspiration.\n- Growth strategy: I help you to clarify the One Metric That Matters in your business. And craft the most effective growth strategy to reach your objectives.\n- Execution: I implement rapid Build-Measure-Learn loops in your team and I facilitate design, growth and validation sprints incl the setup of data tracking and metric tools.\n\n// HAVE YOU UNLOCKED YOUR POTENTIAL?\nI am really curious to hear how companies find the balance between results and happiness. I am looking for CEOs, Founders, HR and Innovation managers to talk to. \nDo you know somebody in this field? Please hook me up.\n\nThanks for now!\nSjors \n \nwww.thegrowthcoach.nl",

And yes, they brought together the kind of people that inspire each other.\n\nThe idea behind Socrates is that there is nothing beyond experience. You can read, discuss and analyse... it doesn't strike your deepest self unless you experience it yourself. Socrates aimed to provide the kind of experiences that make life better and more beautiful.",
