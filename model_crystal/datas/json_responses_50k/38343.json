    "summary": "I hold a BA in History and Politics from University College Dublin and am currently pursuing an MA in International Relations with a specialization in Global Conflict in the Modern Era at University Leiden. As a former competitive swimmer, I worked for nearly five years as a swimming teacher and coach at Catstlepark Swim Academy and SwimCamp Ireland, where I instructed children and adults and collaborated with two competitive swimming clubs. This experience strengthened my communication skills and taught me the value of teamwork.\n\nIn addition, I served as an Administration Officer for The Wheel, a Dublin-based charity, where I gained invaluable knowledge about the non-profit sector. I supported members with queries, provided technical assistance during online trainings, and managed booking and travel arrangements. I am proficient in Salesforce and also participated in the training of other Admin Officers. I am passionate about working in the non-profit sector and hope to do so in the future.\n\nCurrently, I am writing my Master's thesis, which focuses on Population Centric Counterinsurgency. I am using a discourse analysis to examine this topic.",
