            "description": "Sharif University of Technology\n\nThe project scheduling problem is one of the classic problems in project management that\nincludes a range of optimization problems. One of the limitations we face in project scheduling\nproblem is the resource constraint limitation. In many studies in the literature review,\nproblems are based on the false assumption that a resource can be transferred between\nactivities of a project or different projects without spending time and cost. The resource\navailability method in many fundamental types of research in the context of resource-constrained\nproject scheduling problem (RCPSP) is considered as resource investment problems (RIP);\nwhile in many real-world projects resources are rented for projects and the time to use\nresources will impact the final cost of the projects. In this thesis, we present a mathematical\nmodel for scheduling a resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem, taking into\naccount time and cost of resource transfers (RCMPSPTT). Resources\u2019 provision method for\nactivities is considered to be rented. The proposed model is a complex model (NP-hard) and\nits exact solution is possible only in small size problems. For solving the problem, two meta-heuristic algorithms, Genetic algorithm, and harmony search Algorithm are proposed\nand their performance is compared. According to the results, both algorithms could\nachieve acceptable performance. HS Algorithm represented better results in small size\nproblems compared to Genetic Algorithm. As the problem size increased, GA reached\nbetter results and HS performance decreased.",
