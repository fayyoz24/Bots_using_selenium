    "summary": "ABOUT ME:\nI like to challenge myself on a daily basis by really looking out of the box. As a frontend developer and architect I enjoy not to only use the technology, but to deploy it on a deep level, touching the core functionalities of the framework. Determining the course of the application, I consider why a specific framework or technology  has been developed and how it is intended. I\u2019m a fanatic in keeping up to speed with the newest developments, which enables me to make future-oriented choices concerning new technologies. I always bear in mind how choices of technology might influence the application and business at large: how it influences the user experience, performance and scalability of the application. Best practices of architecture are my priority, so the product can be easily build upon in the future. Besides my technological skills i\u2019m a team builder and leader. I have extensive experience with leading teams and team members located in-house and remote. In my view, a team is a fusion of efforts to believe in a mission and achieve its goals. \n\nKEY QUALIFICATIONS & SKILLS\n - Fluent in Javascript and Typescript\n - Angular, AngularJS, ReactNative, RxJS, Redux, NGRx, Material Design\n - AI, ML, Matlab, R, Python for DataScience\n - Deep understanding of architectural principles and patterns\n - Master in functional and reactive programming principles\n - Dedicated to optimizing UX and Performance\n - Profound knowledge of Unit testing and TDD (BDD)\n - Adept at CI & CD, from scripting into deployment\n - Version control: Git, Perforce\n - Agile scrum methodologies\n\nTO BE ACQUIRED SKILLS\n - Elm, DApp, Solidity (progress)\n - Haskell\n\nTO BE REFRESHED\n - C(++)",
