    "summary": "I'm an academicly trained performance dramaturge and researcher in contemporary dance and art. In my work I facilitate people and bringing their stories, desires and motivations on the table, I create learning trajectories for artistic research and I aim to develop future-oriented education in interdisciplinary art, design and performance: \n\nI design, develop, coordinate and teach in master education in art schools. \nI write, create narratives for emerging storytelling bridging abstract and hyperreal imageries. \nI facilitate artists and creatives in developing in-depth artistic research trajectories. \nI coach artists in positioning their work in the contemporary art field. \nI organize and customise process roadmaps for creative collaborations. \nI research, frame and articulate scripts for (visual) storytelling. \n\nover the past 12 years I have worked different roles in education starting as theory teacher, researcher, innovator and coordinator in professional art education. \n\nSince 2023 I've decided to vocalize actively for women's rights and gender equality as a public narrator and science-based activist. This has always fueled my dialogue and teaching practice, but became the center of my attention since 2021, when I lost my sister to femicide and the impact that has on my life. \n\nI'm currently redefining my personal position and narrative as well as exploring ideas for performative storytelling on the subject of gender equality and social safety. I join public debates motivated by my sister's story to protect women and children in intimate, toxic (binary) relationships. \nDeconstructing, destabilizing systemic beliefs and rigid gender norms are at the core of my message as well as creating stronger women circles for care, support and protection which is necessary to avoid institutional flaws in the existing patriarchal structured of Dutch traditions.   \n\nUnder the umbrella of my individual practice 'motionterritory' or Concept Store for Artistic Strategies, I have performed many dramaturgical assignments for choreographers since 2005. Currently I'm reconsidering my independent practice into a new direction. To be continued.  \n\nwww.motionterritory.com",

Due to Covid-19 will now be extended with one year until the end of 2022.\n\nThe project provides an opportunity to give artists from five partner countries (the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Cyprus) the experience of leading European dance dramaturges. Each year selected pairs of artists and dramaturgs from each country attend two of the four 10-day residencies. Each intensive will include a seminar with the participation of the wider art community and the last workshop in Prague will conclude with a final presentation of the outputs of the whole two-year project open to the general public.\n\nThe project responds mainly to the absence of educational opportunities in the field of dance dramaturgy and offers new experience in the form of international workshops led by experienced dramaturges: Guy Cools, Maja Hrie\u0161ik, Katalin Trencs\u00e9nyi and Anne-Marije van den Bersselaar.\n\nProject partners:\nTanec Praha (CZ) \u2013 main coordinator\nAnghiari Dance Hub in partnership with Marche Teatro (IT) - partner\nDansBrabant (NL) \u2013 partner\nDance House Lemesos (CY) \u2013 partner\nBora Bora European Dancehouse Network (DK) \u2013 partner",
