It is focused upon the violence inherent in this encounter, its different forms and origins. It seeks to provide an explanation of the conflicts which erupted in Africa after 1989 by developing a historical perspective over the long duree from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of the Cold War. It is essentially a political history of multiple processes (global, regional, local) and their collision and interaction, rather than individual experiences but it includes cultural, social and economic aspects. The main thread running through the narrative is provided by the British Empire in Africa but Belgian and Portuguese rule are also studied. Topics covered include pre-colonial African kingdoms, the \u2018Scramble for Africa; white settler culture and the colonial state; the origins of apartheid South Africa; the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya; the Congo crisis and the assassination of Patrice Lumumba; the rise and fall of 'white' Rhodesia; the end of the apartheid state; the genocide in Rwanda; the civil war in Sierra Leone; Mugabe and Zimbabwe; Somalia and the collapsed state; and the  \u2018Great African War\u2019 in the DRC.",

Topics include the conquest of Africa in the age of the so-called \u2018New Imperialism\u2019, the French and British Civilizing missions in Africa and Asia, the emergence of modern ideas of race, immigration, freedom struggles in Asia and Africa, and postcolonial cultural and political developments across the world. \n\n- Empire and Africa: This module is especially concerned with the end of Empire in Africa. After exploring the origins and nature of European empires in Africa, the course examines the impact of World War II on the British Empire and the end of British imperial influence in Kenya and Egypt. The course compares the British approach to decolonisation with those of the French, Belgians and Portuguese, raising the cases of French Algeria, the Belgian Congo, and Portuguese Angola and Mozambique. American attitudes to empire are also considered. Finally, the module covers the history of Italian and Soviet involvement in the Horn of Africa.",
