    "summary": "One of my passions is to meet new, inspiring people and that is why my surroundings consider me a natural networker. \n \nThroughout my career I have built up many international experiences in account management, event management and recruitment.\nI organised events all over the globe, ensured companies to find the best young professional for their company and guided young professionals in finding their desired traineeship.\n\nToday, I am working for The Student Hotel as Head of The Connector Program. Together with a team of 14 Connectors (Events, community & partnerships managers) we are positioning TSH within local networks and programs across Europe. \n\nTSH is a global community connected by one spirit - the student spirit: open, curious and unfinished.
