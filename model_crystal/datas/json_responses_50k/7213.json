    "summary": "My life's path has been a remarkable journey, defined by growth, connection, and the pursuit of personal fulfillment. As the founder and director of MIRJOY, I have dedicated myself to empowering individuals through the transformative practices for example of the Work of Byron Katie, Tony Robbins, Jeff Foster and so on. With over a decade of experience in questioning my own limiting beliefs, I have discovered the immense power of self-examination and its ability to unlock true inner strength.\n\nGuiding both adults and children, I have had the privilege of coaching individuals in the art of examining stressful concepts. Through tailored strategies and a range of empowering tools, I help them reconnect with their inner reservoirs of strength and develop a friendly mind that can navigate any challenge with grace and resilience.\n\nMy journey of education has been diverse, encompassing multiple degrees, including a Bachelor's degree in Economics. I have worked over two decades in information technology and helping people has been something I've always loved. \n\nDuring my time living in New Zealand, both in the vibrant city of Auckland and the breathtaking Queenstown, I experienced the beauty of cultural diversity and the transformative power of embracing different perspectives. It was in this enriching environment that I further honed my coaching skills and developed a deep understanding of the complexities that arise from cultural transitions.\n\nReturning to The Netherlands, I now reside with my family, cherishing the role of both a mother and stepmother. Through personal experience, I have gained profound insights into the challenges that arise in parenting and step-parenting, fostering a natural intuition for coaching (step)parents who may be feeling overwhelmed. \n\nMy personal journey has been one of continuous growth and self-discovery, and it is an honor to share the wisdom and tools I have acquired with others. Together, through the transformative practices offered at MIRJOY, we can embark on a journey of empowerment, embracing joy, and unlocking the boundless potential that lies within each and every one of us.\n\nJoin me at MIRJOY and let us embark on this transformative journey together. Contact me today to start your path to personal empowerment and fulfillment.",

It didnt take long before I wanted to be part of this as well. As a volunteer I help facilitating StarJam's monthly get-togethers.\n\nBesides the monthly get-togethers StarJam offers The Talent Expansion Programme, that is what the kids call CoolJam workshops. Workshops are held on each week during school term evenings. I am a relief tutor for the dance workshop.\n\nWorking together with the kids, helping them express themselves by dancing is truly beautiful and I very much enjoy it.\n\nCheck out http://www.starjam.org"
