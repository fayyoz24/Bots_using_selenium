Within this team I provide technical consultation and advice for Unilever and its contractors.\n\nUnilever's Global Foods Innovation Centre is a state of the art facility for healthier and sustainable food innovations. The building with high BREEAM ambitions fits in with the circular economy and is expected to open its doors in mid-2019.\n\nThe 18,000m2 Global Foods Innovation Centre consists of a Pilot Plant, a Food & Customer Experience and two floors of offices and laboratories. In the Pilot Plant, a mini factory, the pilot production of new products takes place in limited volumes. This Pilot Plant is linked to the Food & Customer Experience, where innovative ingredients and recipes for the development of new products are tested daily in various test kitchens. Employees, experts, students and consumers can get to know these innovations here or in the concept store and share their findings. Underneath the entire building is a parking garage that is accessible to both employees of Unilever and the University of Wageningen.\n",

This building houses part of the Faculty of Science. The building (approx. 19,500 m2 GLA) consists largely of laboratories and also has office workplaces and teaching rooms. The building is currently used by various research groups from the departments of Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences. \n\nThe faculty of Science has the ambition to form a Life Sciences cluster (LSC) in the DdW. A number of groups of the Centre for Biomolecular Research will move to the DdW.\nThe building will remain in use during the execution. This means that the work must be carried out in phases.\n\nFor one of the research groups of the Bijvoet Centre (Cryo-electron Microscopy) additional, technically complex facilities for Electron Microscopy (EM) are required.\nThe project has the sustainability ambition of obtaining the certificate belonging to BREEAM-In-Use, level Excellent.\n",
