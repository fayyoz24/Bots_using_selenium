I am passionate about building businesses from defining mission, vision and strategy  to execution through and with a team of professionals. Building a business to me means, among other things like keeping track of financial health and cashflow; to know your own business, know your market and customers business dynamics, strategic (team) planning, account penetration up to C-level and concise execution and monitoring. This needs to be done with a team that is well trained, passionate, coherent and acting in a professional manner. My favourite market segments are ICT, Retail, Logistics and Engineering/Manufacturing.\n\nPersonal competencies and character\nI am a sharp analyst of situations and characters, building overview and situational insight fast, to set the right strategy and prioritise actions. In doing so I am pragmatic and no-nonsense in order to get results, because success is what makes me \u2018tick\u2019. People describe me as highly motivated and committed, acting very thought through, decisively and very persistent. Towards team members and others I am direct but sincere, loyal and supportive but also demanding and sometimes somewhat impatient. The relationships I build, arise fast, but are long term relationships based on openness and honesty, without being naive.\n\nExperience\nGeneral Management as part of an MT\nCommercial Management (Sales and Marketing)\nSales management (direct, indirect, alliances, new & exising business, national & international)  \n\nI like working in a highly volatile and dynamic environment that is flexible but pragmatic and acting with respect for people.",
