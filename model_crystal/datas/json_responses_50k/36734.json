Also, the products chosen from Syngenta's portfolio for watermelon crops proved to be very good due to the resistance of the plants to the characteristics of the drier land where they were sown.\nRegarding the aspects related to the marketing and promotion of the resulting agricultural products of watermelon, we did this both through online channels and offline channels methods.\nThrough offline channels using traditional methods of sale in the wholesale or retail agricultural markets or directly to the customer in some minimarket chains in Bacau.\nThe promotion and marketing using online methods was done through various platforms and marketplace networks for agriculture.\n\nI also mention that over the years I have interacted with other vegetable crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers.",
