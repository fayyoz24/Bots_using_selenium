    "summary": "I have 11 years of experience in the retail and fashion industry in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands where I gained a lot of experience in brand management & development, human resources, and local marketing. Besides, I handled social media marketing for the start-up \u201cStrandmeister\u201d, where I increased brand awareness and conversions. \n\nI am known for my creativity, a person who is willing to work hard to achieve goals that are necessary to my career. I have a pleasure challenging myself; I am used to work hard and can perform very well under pressure. This ambition helped me to gain a lot of experience in the industry.\n\nI'm very interested in fashion and retail and spend my leisure time often with reading articles and books about this fast-changing industry.
