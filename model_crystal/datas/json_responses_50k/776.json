    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Eleonora Gallo, a visual and graphic designer with a passion for illustration, animation and videogames.\n\nI was born and raised in a small town in South Italy and my passion for drawing and designing developed as soon as I could hold a pencil. Our fridge was covered in drawings and blueprints of any sort for many years. Living in a rural area, I grew up loving nature with all its wonderful details, but I also craved for a more chaotic and brightly colored life, just like the one of a city.\n\nI graduated at the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano in Design and Art in November 2021 and I moved to the Netherlands right after to pursue my career and seek new and exciting opportunities.\nI\u2019m a versatile designer that can range through several different styles and is never afraid to face any challenge. During my studies and the projects I worked on I learned to work efficiently and to pay the utmost attention to details to guarantee the best possible result. All my skills and knowledge are applied interdisciplinarily across projects to heighten the quality of my works and to deliver unexpected and original results.",
