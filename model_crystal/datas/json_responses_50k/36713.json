    "summary": "I am a huge people-person, I love meeting new people and helping them. I am curious towards learning new things and exploring countries. \nFor the bigger part of my life I lived in Italy however I have been on the move ever since. I lived in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Canada and finally the Netherlands where I currently reside. The moving around has made a very open-minded and flexible person, able to adapt to every kind of situation and culture. \nHow am I as a person? a perfectionist, I love to learn new things and the rush a job can bring, everything I do is thought through, adaptable to new situations and in control are traits that define me.  Due to my moving around I speak several languages, but as you can imagine maths and I do not get along!\nAlways on the look for something new where I can learn new things, I like to take responsibility. You could also say I am a troubleshooter by nature. ",
