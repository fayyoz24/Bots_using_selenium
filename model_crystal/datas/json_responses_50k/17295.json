    "summary": "I'm a consultant with strong analytical skills who likes to create practical solutions. My contribution? Ensuring that People and Business get the best out of their collaboration. Focussing on\u27ad Learning, development, change and talent. \u260e06-11355410\n\nMy expertise?\n\u2705 Learning and development (L&D, Sustainably employment)\n\u2705 Coaching & training of behaviour and skills\n\u2705 Organizational development (Transition/Change/HR)\n\nIn anticipating tomorrow\u2019s challenges, I believe the added value of a company is created by employees. Strategic plans, technological implementations, new work processes..they are only successful if they are supported by employees. With the right attention to culture, behaviour, willingness and ability to change, companies can stimulate continuous development by employees. And more importantly, by doing so, companies can work on meeting the requirements for the future of work.\n\nWith the knowledge I have gained from my Human Resources study and my Master's in Business Administration, (Change management track) I'm able to focus both, on the 'softer side of the Business', such as the human change processes, leadership styles and cultural aspects, as well as the 'harder side of Business\u2019 such as financial and operational processes. This enables me to communicate with people on various business levels about the challenges of the future.\n\nWhat defines me?\nMy boundless curiosity, sharpness and willingness to ask difficult questions, enables me to quickly get to the bottom of things. With energy, enthusiasm and sincere interest in colleagues and clients I gain trust and create relationships. This attitude also enables me to intervene and provide critical feedback in a respectful and resolute manner. \n\nWhen I\u2019m not working?\nI like to challenge myself in running competitions, wine & dine with friends and love to sing on weddings, other special occasion or just for fun!",
