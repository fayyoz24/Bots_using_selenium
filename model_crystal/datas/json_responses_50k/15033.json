While I am doing this, my focus is not just on Technology, but also on if not more on People and Processes.\n\nI am very successful in this, because when I propose changes, I always make sure that the people are behind these changes and really are looking forward to these changes and the continuous learning journey that they will embark on, so they will start to do and achieve great things together.\n\nMy main qualities are in making complex situations simple and clear from all kind of perspectives, so that all stakeholders understand the situation properly and everyone is onboard in making the right choices for all their stuff that goes in their (hybrid mixed) cloud, systems and applications. This way I enable organisations, so that they can become/stay the most optimal customer centric focused player in their market, be the main connected party in their market/supply chain, be a top data driven player, the most disruptive innovative player and do not shy away to start experimenting into the future.\n\nI have based my method on enablers around Cloud DevOps engineering, Software engineering, UX/UI designing, Data engineering and -science, AI driven solutions and all the great technologies out there.",
