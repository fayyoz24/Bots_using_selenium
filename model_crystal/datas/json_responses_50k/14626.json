The aim of my project is to address the development of an automated design optimization model and the degree of optimization of the obtained output of the model. The main optimization criteria are the material utilization, the material use efficiency and the sustainability of the design. The model will be developed based on the recently constructed 3DPC bridge in Gemert (Noord-Brabant, The Netherlands). The result of the optimization will be compared to the original design based on the two main criteria and the differences will be discussed. It is expected that the current design is over dimensioned and is not designed for optimal sustainability. Therefore, the optimized result is expected to show a more favourable behaviour based on the two main criteria.",

The project I will be working on is the construction of Phase 2A of the new container terminal for APM Terminals in Mo\u00edn, Costa Rica. The project is a joined venture of Van Oord and BAM International.\n\nThe scope of work for Van Oord consists of the construction of a 1.5-km rock breakwater, reclamation of an area of 40 hectares, including soil improvement works, and the dredging of the access channel and turning basin. BAM International will construct the 650-metre quay wall, as well as the pavement, associated buildings and all utilities.\n\nDuring my internship I will also work on a research for TU Delft. My research will be focussed on the sustainability of the construction of a container terminal. The goal of the research is to write a rapport about the sustainability of the process until now and to provide added value to the project. In my rapport I will answer two main questions:\n- Where can changes in the construction phase of the project help to effectively reduce the environmental impact, increase sustainability and provide added value to the local environment?\n- Are the proposed changes economically viable and therefore realistic solutions for improving the sustainability/reduce the environmental impact of civil engineering practices?",
