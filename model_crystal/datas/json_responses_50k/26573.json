    "summary": "My professional work encompasses project management and contract research. I work as a project manager on several projects for a large variety of customers, in the High Tech Industry (Optics). My projects range from small scale consulting projects (<50kEuro) up to larger research programs of multiple years (>2.5MEuro), with many international partners. \n\nWith a broad background in Mechanical Engineering (BEng) and Aerospace Engineering (MSc) I am able to quickly adapt to different areas of expertise. As project manager I have a strong drive to make all stakeholders happy, from customer and end-user to project team and our own organization.\n\nOn a personal level I am open-minded, flexible, internationally oriented and always open to new ideas and opportunities. \n\nMy previous work experiences have been with (in no particular order): Optical Metrology Systems, Free-Form Optics, Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC), Protection against (Military) Threats",
