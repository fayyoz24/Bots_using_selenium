    "summary": "For the past years I have been working as a senior account manager for iMailo. My responsibilities here range from managing current relationships, acquiring new business to the technical and design side of affiliate marketing. On a daily basis i am working on optimising campaigns, relationships and looking for the newest trends in the business.\n\nI started working at iMailo upon my arrival back in NL from travelling for about 6 months through various APAC countries. Having studied International Business and Management Studies at The Hague University of Applied Science I have always had a desire to learn about different cultures and experience them. The ability to fly around the world for all the different conferences is thus a big plus of working in the affiliate industry. \nPrior to travelling I acquired my first experience after graduating working a channel manager at Daisycon. Here I got a first impression of what working in the affiliate industry exactly entails. \n\nMy love for online marketing, however, started earlier. During my school years we mostly learned about offline marketing I tried to gain extra knowledge on the use of online marketing by writing my thesis on this particular topic. Writing this I used the experience I gained at LG during my internship and the courses I followed on online marketing during my study abroad in Canada helped in the process of writing this. \n",
