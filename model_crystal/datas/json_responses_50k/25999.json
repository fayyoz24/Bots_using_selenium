    "summary": "My passion for education is found in the growth and transformation that takes place in a school. I have been honored to help students grow throughout middle school and high school over the past ten years as a teacher and administrator. Not only do I teach content and concepts, I also inspire students and teachers to explore their passions, guide them to become critical thinkers, and help them make their mark on the world. As an educator, I have acquired an appreciation and respect for the transformation of curriculum and engaging students in all types of learning experiences. The importance of concept based curriculum and experiential learning is exciting to unfold when working with teachers, administrators, and especially students. Curriculum design and instructional mentorship as a principal have become my favorite ways to influence the transformation of a school. As an educational leader, I find value in growing teachers, inspiring students, developing school community, and opening doors of opportunity. ",
