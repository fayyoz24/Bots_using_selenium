The initial target group will be psychiatric patients, who\u2019s life expectancy is 25 years (!) less than the average population, mainly because of their lifestyle.\n\nHeartville is a blended healthcare solution that combines the benefits of a support group, social media and gameplay to help players achieve their personal lifestyle goals. Players will be grouped together in a real time social game where they are challenged to restore the ruined village of Heartville into a paradise. But there\u2019s a catch: to obtain the needed tools and objects tot build up your world, you need to fulfill your personal lifestyle goals. The social encouragement of your group as well as the short-term gratification of the game helps you to keep making the right choices.\n\nHeartVille is complementary to an existing and proven lifestyle coach program called \u2018TrafficLight\u2019. The development of the game will be based on scientific research and testing within a psychiatric hospital of GGz Central under guidance of Prof. Peter van Harten. After the initial development, the game can easily be modified to cater different target groups, such as obese adolescents or heart patients.",

It started in February 2008 in Dar es Salam (Tanzania) and ended in Cape Town (South Africa) in April 2008. \n\nIn each country a duo was formed containing of a European and an African Hip-Hop artist. Together they visited HIV&Aids related youth projects, gave workshops to local youth and musicians on how to use music as a tool of expression and education and gave a free concert where the local youth got a change to show their talent. They also recorded 3 tracks for the album and recorded a music video together with the media team. \n\nI was part of the media team that traveled along with the artists to capture all of the activities, and was responsible for video editing, tour photography and web design/maintenance. \n\nThe virus free generation hip-hop tour could be followed live on the website, which was updated daily from Africa with Photos, Videos (webisodes) and a Blog. I also created most of the print design for the campaign surrounding the european part of the tour.",

To accomplish this we chose to make the user interface controls almost completely sensor based (using infrared LEDs, augmented reality QR tags and an ultrasonic sensor), the GUI is a combination of the persons reflection in the mirror combined with floating elements projected around it, due to the nature of the specially coated mirror it\u2019s impossible to see how this effect is achieved, where the projection is coming from and where the edges are. A truly unique experience that is hard to describe.\n\nI created the interface elements and a total of 12 short content videos for the first prototype of the BUY? installation, the interface has 3 icons, each representing a different pathway the user can choose, Concept (Light Bulb icon), Production (Sprocket icon) and Social (Heart icon). Concept shows the idea behind the print on the shirt, where the idea originated and the designers opinion or statement. Production visualises the production process and the materials used. Social shows information about the people who bought the shirt, their lifestyle and their opinion about the product.\n\nI helped develop the motion tracking system (using AR in Actionscript), and designed the flyer/poster to help promote the project.",
