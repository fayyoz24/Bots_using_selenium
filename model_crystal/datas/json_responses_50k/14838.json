The replenishmentsolution will be integrated into the current Point of Sale solution and as such has direct access to the most up to date stock data. This stock data is then matched with the parameters which have been decided from the headoffice to give an automated order advice for each shop.\n\nFor the training of the current (1800+) and future shop employees working with the system an E-learner was developed. This E-learner could be accessed from either the shop or from home and gave the employees the possibility to work with the system before the implementation in the shops.\n\nMain goals:\n- Spending less time with the ordering system and more time with the customer\n- Better distribution of stock in all shops, both in quantity and quality\n- Ability to make quicker changes to assortments in the shop\n- First step for introducing further integration in the replenishment process\n- Preperation for disclosing shopstock on the website\n\nRoles:\n- Technical projectmanagement, Responsible for the succesful integration of the new system into our current system landscape without interupting the processes and systems already present\n- Lead tester, Writing of the master testplan and managing the correct execution of this test plan by colleagues for both the replenishment system and the E-learner\n- Rollout coordinator, Responsible for making the roll out as fluent and non interuptive as possible. Making sure colleagues get the information and support they need from the organisation.\n",
