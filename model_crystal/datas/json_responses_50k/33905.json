    "summary": "Hi! I am Paul, a motivated designer who loves to unravel complexities with a curious, playful, but pragmatic mindset. I love working collaboratively and interdisciplinary in the early phases of design and seek to involve people in every step. Whether this is building bridges internally, or doing user-research: What do they like? What are they like? What messy realities would we have never thought of from the comfort of our own desks?\n\nIn the past years, I have gathered experience in at different countries, companies & contexts: Customer service/experience, medical equipment, healthcare, creative facilitation, tech-enabled play, playful learning, installations, etc.). \n\nI have gotten excited about each and every one of these topics, and welcome new topics which bring our lives something positive!",
