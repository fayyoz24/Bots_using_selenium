Tweets were parsed for Gravity, Captain Phillips, Prisoners and the respective casts of the movie. Sentiment scoring was done to determine the overall sentiment about the movie and its cast. The predictions were compared against the box office performance data to test the goodness of fit. The hypothesis was rejected to conclude that social media could be used as a indicator to determine the box office performance of movies.\nR was used to parse twitter and Tableau was used to generate visualizations for the project.
