The model is used to monitor both the air quality in the Netherlands and the nitrogen deposition flux on sensitive N2000 habitats. It is also used to compute the contribution of individual projects to the nitrogen deposition flux. My work includes research on the uncertainty of nitrogen deposition modelling, research on improving air quality modelling in urban areas through inverse modelling and high resolution computations, and research on improving the modelling of deposition on coniferous forests. Finally, I supervise students in their graduation research and I help in improving bias-corrections of the OPS and LOTOS-EUROS models.",

The focus of my research was on water limited ecosystems and the way these ecosystems cope with the rapidly changing climate. My PhD thesis and associated peer-reviewed publications can be found in the section Publications below. My teaching activities included supervision of students performing scientific research and fieldwork (BSc level), and modelling (MSc level). Besides research and teaching I was PhD representative in the Utrecht Geo Graduate council, organised (guest)lectures in the department, I was minutes secretary of departmental group meetings and co-founded a blog to communicate our department's research to the general audience.",
