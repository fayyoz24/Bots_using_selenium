    "summary": "I am self-motivated to identify  that needs to get done before I am asked to do it. I have developed strong interpersonal skills that I can apply to anyone either a customer, someone on the phone or to my fellow co-workers.\n\nFurthermore, I possess a professional demeanor, and good communication and negotiation skills. My enclosed resume contains complete details about my skills, knowledge, qualifications and capabilities. I am able to take multiple tasks fairly easily and am able to learn new skills quickly and effectively. I consider myself a hard worker who is easy to get along with, I always maintain a positive attitude and truly enjoy being busy.\n\nAs funny as it may sound I gained most of my experience in sales working at a gas station as a student. I was working there for over five years, it was a gas station just by the border and most people were foreigners on their way home or going to vacation, so I offered to fill up their gas, check the oil level and send them in for some snacks and coffee so that they could make the most of their break. I was the girl who sold most cans of oil and windscreen washers to these customers. Later on I also worked for MG-SOFT, a leading supplier of SNMP, SMI and other network management application selling their products to businesses and individuals all over the world. It was a very challenging job as it required providing customers with very detailed descriptions of products and offering solutions that would best meet their needs. In addition, my latest job was working as telephone market researcher and although in this case there was no sale, the job was still very demanding as it required convincing people (financial executives) to take 15-20 minutes of their time to answer complex financial questions.\n",
