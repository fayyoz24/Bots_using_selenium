    "summary": "How my colleagues would describe me? A passionate team player who loves to network. I believe that together we can achieve more.\n\nGraduated in International Development Studies (MSc) in 2019. As a humanitarian professional, I have over three years of experience in the Middle East, focusing on the rights of underprivileged communities, especially migrant workers, who are often left behind. \n\nI have experience in startegic development and coordinating programs within (I)NGOs and community-focused foundations. I have gained in-depth experience in fundraising, project management, youth employment, migration, advocacy, communications, and diversity & inclusion. \n\nMy personal and professional values drive through a rights-based and solidarity approach, changing the power imbalance and providing agency to those in need.\n\nLinking the dots: migrant communities being left behind, an economical crisis leading to unemployment, a lack of access to basic needs, and on top of that a waste crisis created the idea of producing reusable diapers for WingWoman.",
