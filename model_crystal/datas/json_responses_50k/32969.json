Furthermore, battery storage was implemented along with an electrolyser, compressor and tank to produce and store hydrogen fuel on-site. The whole system along the dynamics of the components were simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK models combined with a separate economic analysis.\n\nIn order to control the frequency a grid was also connected to the system. Ultimately, by sizing correctly our system to match the demand, the grid contribution should go to zero. That means that the grid will neither support nor be fed with power and its only role will be to keep a fixed frequency. In other words, the grid will be used as an indicator that our system is completely autonomous.",

Photovoltaic systems are an emerging technology that can play an important role to our modern societies. This is an innovating method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into current using semiconductor material that exhibit photovoltaic effect. The importance of the above technology is maximized for a Mediterranean country with high irradiation level such as Greece. In that project was analyzed the  current state of development of photovoltaic applications in Greece and how can today\u2019s market be strengthened even while in an economic crisis. For this scope FIS analysis was applied as well as a Landscape and Regime analysis. \n\nThe main result of our research was that Greece has many prospect for PV installation and energy production from solar despite the economic crysis. Although, many changes and improvements should be taken off in order a huge increase in PV installations to be maintained, ",
