Powertex is compatible with paper, textile, leather, cardboard, fiberglass, wood, sand, Stone Art etc. Powertex will transform textiles into masterpieces. It is a remarkable adhesive. After being tested extensively for 6 months by crafters and artists.\nPowertex is very easy to work on canvas to exhibit 3 dimensional works. When using Powertex Transparent and a piece of fabric with motives on, the motives will remain in the original shape. To colour Powertex Transparent is very easy, just add Powertex color pigment of your choice. Statues and designs made with Powertex can also be painted with oil paint or a varnish mixed with power color pigments.\nPowertex is a liquid medium that is ready to be used straight from the container. Powertex can be brushed onto items or dipped directly into the product. Powertex remains flexible for quite a while (depending on temperature). Treated fabric can be draped, folded and manipulated into many different ways. Powertex takes about 2 weeks to cure although it will be dry to the touch within an hour or two.\nOld T-Shirts, sheets, kiddy clothes and especially absorbent fabrics are excellent for Powertex. If you want to make a garden statue, no problem. Just varnish once dry and it will remain as is, for many years to come. Powertex has undergone extensive testing and has been awarded the AP Seal which means that it has been found to be \nnon-toxic for adults and children.\nAvailable in the following colors:\nBronze, Green, Yellow, Red, Lead, Terracotta, Dark Green, Ivory, Transparent, Black and Blue.\nExamples of some of the beautiful pigments that can be mixed with Powertex transparent to create different colors.",
