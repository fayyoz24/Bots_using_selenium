    "summary": "My name is Judith, and I am a filmmaker and photographer bursting with creativity.\n\nThe main focus of my work is on audiovisual productions and photography, but I take a very broad interest in the creative field. As for the audiovisual productions, my passion lies with screenwriting, directing, camerawork and editing, so my interest stretches pretty much from pre- to post-production.\n\nDue to the fact that I studied at both a University of Applied Sciences, as well as at an Academic University, I have broad, practical knowledge of the creative industry as well as a deep, theoretical understanding of visual storytelling. This is something I apply to my work on a daily basis as to get to the best possible product suited for every project.\n\nI'm considerably skilled at Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop, and I know my way around Adobe After Effects and Logic Pro. Beside that I'm a fast student and always eager to learn. I love working with creative people, have good communication skills, work fast and am organised.",

The film is about a successful fashion icon in her early twenties who needs to convince a suicidal psychology student that life's worth living when he interrupts her suicide attempt.\n\nDuring the making of On The Edge I was responsible, amongst other things, for the screenplay, directing the cast and crew, the casting process, motivating and leading the cast and crew, making sure the film was coherent and to tell the best possible story within the budget available.\n\n'On the edge of a tall building stands Sophia (Nastassia Vuursteen), 23-years-old, owner of an internationally succesful fashion brand, and ready to end her life. However, her attempt to do so is interrupted by Kenneth (Yaron Mesika), a 23-year-old psychology student who's planning the same thing.'\n\nYou can find my work process through the link below.\nhttps://judithsshort.wordpress.com/",
