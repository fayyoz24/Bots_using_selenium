    "summary": "WASHINGTON (November 16, 2022) \u2014 WRI is pleased to announce that Rogier van den Berg has been selected to become the next Global Director of WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that Rogier will head our cities program,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO, World Resources Institute. \u201cRogier has been a leader in cities and urban design for his entire career. He brings tremendous experience, credibility and leadership to the role. Rogier has a clear vision to continue elevating our work in cities at this critical moment and the passionate energy to deliver it.\u201d\n\n\"I look forward to combining research and action in cities to improve people's lives and combat the climate crisis through transformative change,\" said Van den Berg. \"Working alongside the talented WRI Ross Center team and our partners, I am committed to ensuring that cities become equitable, resilient and low-carbon.\"\n\nVan den Berg will lead a global team of 500 experts in urban planning, mobility, energy efficiency, resilience, water management and more. Through innovative research, deep engagement with urban leaders, and global partnerships, WRI Ross Center\u2019s network of local and international experts puts cities on a trajectory toward more sustainable and equitable development.
