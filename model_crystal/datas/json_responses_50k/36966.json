    "summary": "Renzo Martens (1973) studied political science and art. He gained recognition with the films Episode I (2003), and Episode III: Enjoy Poverty (2008), which was televised in more than 23 countries. In 2012, Martens established the art institute Human Activities and its \u201creverse gentrification program\u201d in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Together with the plantation workers of Cercle d'Art des Travailleurs de Plantation Congolaise (CATPC), he employs artistic critique to build a new world \u2014 not symbolically, but in material terms. Together, they opened an OMA-designed White Cube on a former Unilever plantation in 2017. The work of CATPC has been shown in a solo exhibition in ScultptureCenter, New York, which was hailed by the New York Times as \u2018best art of the year\u2019, at the Mori Art in Tokyo, KW Berlin and in the 21st Biennale of Sydney. \n\nWhite Cube (2020), Martens\u2019 latest feature-length documentary film, shows how CATPC sets a new precedent: they successfully co-opt the concept of the \u2018white cube\u2019 to buy back their land from international corporations. The film premiered in Lusanga, DRC, and in institutions around the world.\n\nIn 2021, Martens and CATPC created the video series Plantations and Museums, followed by the launch of their Balot NFT as a radical new instrument for decolonization in 2022.",
