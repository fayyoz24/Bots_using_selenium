    "summary": "'Dare to be yourself in a world that 's asking a lot from you!'\nBringing quality to your work and your life is what drives me. It has been the key in all my work in very different positions. Integrity and authenticity are characteristics in the way I do this. \nFor me improving the way you perform is strongly connected with the courage to look at your personal growth and the determination to invest in it. In my view that's the only way to create enduring results.\nIn that sense I have worked with a lot of pleasure and succes with groups and individuals at:\nGemeente Nijmegen; Gemeente Arnhem; UMCN Radboud Nijmegen; COS Nijmegen; Lindenberg Nijmegen; NotarissenVianen; mulitimediabedrijf Industrielinqs; woningbouwvereniging Oosterpoort Groesbeek; IT-bedrijf Databalk Veenendaal; Mode Biennale Arnhem; Alfa Laval Nijmegen.\n \nSpecialities: \nCommunication with clarity, respect, and strength.\nPublic speaking with inner calmness and guts.\nPersonal effectivity and empowerment: more then tips and tricks. \nMindfulness yoga\nStress management.\nCarpetal syndrom prevention (RSI).\nMindfulness.",
