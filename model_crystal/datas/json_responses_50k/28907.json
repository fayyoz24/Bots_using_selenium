    "summary": "Hey! I'm Can, also known as \"Kenny\". I got myself into programming for game development in late 2018, and my passion has been growing ever since. Currently, I am the lead director and programmer for Games Unite. I specialize in both visual and technical aspects of games, like custom physics engines, client-server security, and many other complicated systems.\n\nI began developing games with one simple mission in my head: to become a pioneer for a growing, yet ambiguous, industry. This mindset has forced me to constantly improve, research and develop. I have picked coding as my main profession since I would like to believe it is certainly what pumps the hearts of video games, programs and everything that runs on logic boards. Being given the opportunity to play the role of such an important instrument; and for group projects, the trust of my teammates, make me very proud of what I am capable of doing.",
