Originally from California, I attended UCSC as a Math major while taking classes in art, creative writing, anthropology and women studies.\nMy artistic process is a delicate dance between intention and chance, as I allow the materials to guide me in the creation of my pieces. The texture of the paint, the way it flows and dries, becomes a major player in the story I am telling with each piece. The result is a rich tapestry of color and texture that invites the viewer on a journey through the imagination.",

With a small group of organizers and a ton of support from local organizations, we worked together to participate in the global march on January 21st 2017, which brought close to six thousand attendees in Amsterdam and Den Haag. Our second march, prior to the Dutch elections in 2017, sought to stimulate voters to select political agendas that emphasize equality rather than those parties that promote hate and fear. Our action on March 11th in Amsterdam drew twenty thousand people. \nAs we examine the current climate here in the Netherlands, Women's March will continue to work towards creating a strong message of unity with existing organizations to build a stronger society.\n\n- Initiated Women\u2019s March organization with connection to US National brand in the Netherlands.\n- Coordinated and project managed January 21st march in Amsterdam with over 4000 in attendance. \n- Created online presence, volunteer platforms and slack systems for organization.\n- Created marketing materials and promotional materials for March 11th Amsterdam march.\n- Managed liaisons with additional organization for March event. \n- Managed volunteers and additional PR efforts for March event with over 20,000 in attendance\n- Created statutes and additional structural systems for the Organization\n "
