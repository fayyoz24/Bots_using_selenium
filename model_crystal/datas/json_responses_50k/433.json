    "summary": "As a junior International Relations Officer, I am the connection between international students, Dutch students and my colleagues. I am born and raised in Germany and decided to study at the Aeres university of Applied Sciences in 2017. Getting really connected to the organisation, I was more than happy, when I got the chance to start working for the International Office. I know the struggles of our international students as well as those of the Dutch students. Giving students the chance to make experiences in an international environment is one of the most fulfilling things to do. To me, it is very important to help others making the same great experiences as I did. Seeing our students enjoying their study programme and everything we offer around it, is a great pleasure. \n\nDo you think about studying at Aeres University of Applied Sciences? Feel free to reach out!\nE-mail: k.koziol@aeres.nl\nPhone: 0031 6 43416674\n\nAbout International Office:\nYou work at a school? What do you do there? Teach? \nNo, we don't teach being the International Office, but we do everything around it!\nAs International Officers of the Aeres University of Applied Sciences, we have a diverse job and are responsible for three faculties. We make sure that international students register with us and help them with the entire application process. We organise introduction weeks for them, help them with all the steps of the visa application and make sure they are properly insured. Moreover, we guide students in their social lives and continuously work on the inclusiveness of the institution. Nevertheless, we are also there for our Dutch students. We support them in applying for scholarships and visas for their internships abroad or help them find the right institution for a minor abroad. Our colleagues can also count on us! For them, we arrange everything around travelling abroad so that they can focus on projects or guest lectures abroad. \nAs you can see, our work never gets boring! \"Never a dull moment\" might be our most commonly used saying.\n\n\u2018Talent voor groei\u2019, or talent for growth, is what we represent. Our roots lie in tertiary agricultural education. We focus on education and research, and on the sharing and applying of knowledge. This is our contribution to the development of future-oriented, innovative professionals. Professionals who are capable of making responsible decisions in a complex world, with a natural talent for acting in a sustainable manner.\n\nWe belong to the Aeres Groep, a green knowledge centre that focuses on education, research and various commercial activities.",
