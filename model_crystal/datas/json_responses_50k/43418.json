    "summary": "With extensive experience in global technical recruitment across a wide range of disciplines and industries, I have recruited professionals for research, product development, manufacturing, and other technical roles. I have also recruited for diverse industry sectors, including high-tech machinery and equipment, electronic systems, and devices. My recruitment expertise extends to (embedded) software development, automation, IT, mechanical engineering, electronics, and some non-technical areas such as supply chain, finance, and marketing/sales.\n\nSince early 2019, I have worked as a corporate recruiter, currently with Philips in the Strategic Priorities Capabilities team, and previously as the sole recruiter for high-tech scale-up, EFFECT Photonics. Before that, I held various positions in recruitment and account management, up to business unit management, at YACHT and other staffing companies. With a background in Physics and Management Science/Industrial Engineering, I have a deep understanding of the roles I recruit for. Having been an expat in Finland from 2012-2016, I also have empathy for the challenges faced by people moving abroad.\n\nI possess excellent organizational and planning skills, enabling me to effectively track short- and long-term goals. My logical, analytical, and critical thinking abilities facilitate identifying the root cause of issues and developing effective solutions. I take a proactive and long-term approach to problem-solving and rely on my intuition when working with people and making decisions. I have a holistic view of projects and systems, enabling me to consider various alternatives. I am a driven, dedicated, pragmatic, positive, and energetic professional.",
