            "description": "Generally, fins are utilised to dissipate heat energy. In this project, I tested the effectiveness of fins when employed in a cooking vessel. Due to the operational inconvenience of integrating fins inside a vessel, the aluminium fins were welded at the bottom of a vessel. In the project, I optimised the size and number of fins using the resistance equation. I developed four models with different spatial configurations of the fins. The final product exhibited higher efficiency and heated water to 90 degree Celsius faster (by 42 seconds) than an identical un-finned vessel. Due to the lack of a better fabrication method, air locked between the fins and the vessel during welding brought down the anticipated efficiency of the product.",

One of the objectives of this project is to provide humidity control of the air to the user. This is achieved by providing means to cool air by direct evaporative cooling, in-direct evaporative cooling, and two stage evaporative cooling. This system can also supplant the domestic air cooler as it caters to the different climatic conditions prevalent in India. ",
