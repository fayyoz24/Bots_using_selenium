    "summary": "\u00a1Hola, qu\u00e9 tal! Min\u00e4 olen Diego!\n\nI'm a world-class professional in international business and education. My education has taken me to different countries studying in Mexico, Finland and The Netherlands! Currently doing my master's. That has to count for something, surely.\n\nI've worked in various roles throughout my career, from being a foreign trade consultant to a marketing specialist, and now I'm living in Helsinki as a Planner of International Education. It's an exciting role that keeps me on my toes, and I'm constantly learning new things.\n\nOne of the things I'm most proud of is my ability to communicate across different languages and cultures. I speak English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and I even know a bit of Chinese. Furthermore, I'm currently learning Finnish, which is a whole new adventure in itself for a foreigner living in Finland.\n\nI'm a problem-solver at heart, with a degree in International Business, a major in Supply Chain Management, and a certification in Service Design. I have a talent for analysing complex situations and coming up with solutions quickly and effective. \n\nIf you're looking for someone who's passionate about what they do and always up for a challenge, look no further! Let's connect and see how we can work together.",
