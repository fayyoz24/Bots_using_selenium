    "summary": "My purpose is to enable more meaning and joy in the workplace through the disciplined pursuit of simplicity.\n\nAs a Digital Executive, I take a deeply human approach when engaging with people to allow their passion and professionalism to emerge and shine. My specialty is connecting the product development pipeline to clear and tangible customer value. In service to the engineering and technical teams that I am responsible for, I design a simplified business context that enables the most value to be created with the least amount of unnecessary tension.  Ideal organizations are Saas product companies with complex data management requirements that are shifting their product strategies.\n\n#digital #innovation #human\n\nAs a Business Designer, I guide leaders at various levels in companies to achieve strategic alignment within themselves and with their leadership peers. This is based on a disciplined approach to management team alignment based on the \u2018Simple Business Design\u2019 framework. This is particularly helpful for teams undergoing deep change such as strategic transformation and acquisitions or mergers. Ideal teams new or reforming groups that need to align and perform quickly at a high level of performance.\n\n#business #design #simplicity\n\nAs a Leadership Coach, I work closely with leaders and managers on an individual basis and as a key part of my Digital Executive and Business Designer work.  My deep conviction is that people have a fundamental need for love and simplicity in their lives.  My experience proves that people need support to engage creatively and constructively to hold difficult conversations within themselves and with the people near them.  Ideal clients are often technical leaders struggling to engage with their business peers and business executives struggling to engage their technical collaborators.\n\n#leadership #coaching #love",

On Friday night, teams draw a genre from a hat. They are then given a character, prop and line to include in their films. On Sunday night, in a wild dash to the drop off event, the film is turned in - and teams celebrate. The film is then screened at a local theater in front of an audience of filmmakers, friends and families.",
