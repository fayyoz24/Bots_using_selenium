    "summary": "I am an aspiring data engineer with a background in animal science. I have a Microsoft Azure Certified Data & AI degree at Techionista Academy, where I have acquired hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, data analysis, and data visualization using Azure, SQL, Power BI, and Python.\n\nFor a business case, I collaborated with a team to build a Lambda architecture on Azure for real-time and batch processing of data from the Vend\u00e9e Globe sailing event. We analyzed large datasets and created an interactive Power BI dashboard to reveal race dynamics and performance indicators. In addition, I have also presented my animal welfare expertise to national and international audiences, using behavioural science and empathy to help horse enthusiasts. My specialities were extreme fear and aggression issues. I have designed and taught three online courses on horse emotions, cognition, and positive reinforcement training, earning an exceptional average rating of 8.7/10 from over 400 students. \n\nI am now seeking a fulfilling opportunity to launch my career in data engineering, where I can leverage my skills and knowledge in Azure, SQL, Power BI. I am eager to learn from and contribute to a team that shares my values of innovation, collaboration, and social impact. You can reach me at suzydeurinck@gmail.com.\n\nLocation: Dordrecht - Breda",

This particular case, closely tied to the Microsoft PL300 exam, centered around the analysis of hotel reviews from the fictional website Techionista Holidays spanning the years 2015 to 2017. Our focus was on various aspects of the reviewers and hotels, including nationalities, traveler types, and hotel locations. This repository serves as a comprehensive repository of our work, analyzing a dataset consisting of a staggering 515,000 records pertaining to holiday trends.\n\nTechionista Holidays' managers expressed a strong desire to gain deeper insights into the different types of travelers and their feedback. These valuable insights can play a pivotal role in enhancing Techionista's Holidays website and their capacity to cater to the evolving needs of their users.\n\nObjective\nOur primary objective was to craft an all-encompassing interactive dashboard that offers valuable insights into different categories of travelers and their feedback. These insights would, in turn, be harnessed to enhance the Techionista Holidays website, ensuring a more tailored and effective user experience.",
