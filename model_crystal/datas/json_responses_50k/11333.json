    "summary": "\u201cWe think of our future as anticipated memories\u201d - Daniel Kahneman\n\nGrowing up in an expat family has provided me with the quality of easily adapting to new environments and has fuelled the desire to pursue an international career. I am an ambitious person who is keen to apply my enterprizing approach and collaborative spirit to support corporations with developing and driving their commercial strategy. \n\nI have a proven track-record in delivering commercial objectives; both in client-facing sales and in strategic support roles. I can effectively articulate messages, information and ideas to a diversity of people, both verbally and in writing. I have good presentation skills, I feel comfortable with influencing without authority and engaging senior stakeholders both internally and externally. I have change management experience and have supported transformations of underperforming departments. My understanding of shipping, logistics and supply chain management is broad, while I also possess specialist knowledge in niche fields such as dangerous goods and project logistics. I have strong analytical skills, which I have implemented in various tasks such as market mapping, gathering competitor insights, building value propositions through identifying customer and industry painpoints and being able to understand and adapt to macro economic influencers.\n\nMy personality is characterized by a winners mentality and enthusiasm to handle challenges as they come. I am a responsible, driven, result-oriented, self-motivated person, with a positive and entrepreneurial mindset. My creativity and sense of innovation allow me to think in solutions rather than problems; I am always ready and quick to learn new things. My networking skills are not limited by geographical and cultural borders and I recognize what it takes to build and maintain business relations. I am a team player, who appreciates collaboration to achieve joint goals in cross-functional settings.",
