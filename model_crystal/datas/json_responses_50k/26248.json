    "summary": "I am currently finishing a biochemistry PhD on the topic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I am an organic chemist, but my PhD has provided me with training in microbiology and enzyme kinetic assays. The topic of my research has been the development of bacterial enzyme inhibitors to combat AMR. I have developed a real passion for the topic during my PhD which has inspired me to take part in outreach activities to spread awareness and educate the public on the importance of AMR.\n\nDuring my PhD, I have taken every opportunity to take part in scientific outreach. The training I received has provided me with invaluable skills which I employed in a variety of different projects. I am trained to design outreach activities for schools and community events, covering everything from budgeting to health and safety requirements. I put this knowledge to use by helping various schools with projects on antimicrobials, after finding out the goal of their project I designed an appropriate experiment and provided them with the information needed. I am also organising a scavenger hunt activity using an app for Leiden European City of Science 2022, participants will hunt for QR codes to answer questions about antimicrobial resistance and receive a clue for the next code.\n\nIn my spare time, I have set up and produced content for various social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok. This has allowed me to talk about chemistry and my PhD research to a wide audience. Several courses I attended have provided content creation training, which has improved the quality of my output on these platforms.\n\nI am looking to start a career in scientific outreach and communication. I believe the courses I have taken and my background in scientific research will make me an ideal candidate for such a role.",
