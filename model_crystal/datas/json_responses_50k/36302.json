    "summary": "I was born in Shushtar, a small city in southwest Iran famous for its \u201cHistorical Hydraulic System.\u201d I moved to Tehran when I was 18 to study electrical engineering at the University of Tehran. I did my bachelor's and master's degrees there in the field of digital systems. In my master project, I focused on \u201chardware implementing of CNNs on FPGAs\u201d. In parallel with my master's program, I worked part-time at SAMIM Tech on the FPGA development of a Multi-Image Processor (MIP).\nMy PhD project concerns the application of DL for high-performance electron microscopy, in close cooperation with the Thermo Fisher company. This project focuses on using deep learning for image restoration tasks like super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, and segmentation of electron microscopy images. Currently, I\u2019m doing an internship at Plumerai as an FPGA engineer. We aim for more efficient deep learning to enable inference on low-power hardware. My HDL programming skills and deep learning knowledge have made me a good fit for this position.",
