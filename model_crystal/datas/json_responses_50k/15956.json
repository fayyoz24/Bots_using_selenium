    "summary": "Master software engineering student at the UvA living the dream of: waking up, programming for study or work, eating dinner and programming for fun. With an daily walk to get some fresh air. I successfully completed all my courses for my study on the first try.\n\nMy main interest is building systems which can be used to build new systems or showing data in new ways which help the user to achieve a clear picture of the situation.\n\nWhat I call production ready code: https://github.com/UvA-FNWI/ThesisFair\n\nExperience:\n- 7 year of coding experience of doing increasingly challenging projects\n- 9 months of leading a development team\n- I run all my projects via Docker\n- I configure all my servers via Ansible\n- See experience section for professional working experience\n\nThrough the years I've done quite some projects:\n\n17 years old\n- Javascript game engine with multiplayer support using only the HTML5 canvas API and socket.io. ~150 hour project\n- Pocket galaxy: A universe in your computer. For my high school research project I created an n-body simulation using newtons gravitational law. The real thing I researched was the best way to multithread in Python. The project was graded and guided by Robert Belleman who, at the time, was the program director of the Bachalor Computer Science on the University of Amsterdam.\n- Got invited to work at Voiceworks/Enreach\n\n16 years old\n- Offer student follow system to my school. Everyone loved it, even the director. But he did not want to buy a program from a 16 year old... (See QRC-LVS project)\n- More Python and F# web scrapers as my school moved to an even worse system which gave no overview at all.\n\n15 years old\n- Running Ubuntu on my Chromebook\n- Writing a reverse shell in Python with the raspberry pi as central command and control server. ~500 hour project (Never used maliciously).\n- Started working on QRC-LVS (See projects)\n\n14 years old\n- Making an app in Appinventor and writing a PHP API to communicate with.\n- Winning a capture the flag hacking contest and getting a raspberry pi as a reward.\n- Learning basic Linux shell and networking.\n- Writing a basic chat client in Python\n\nElementary school\n- Building an \"Operating system\" in Scratch.\n- Hosting Minecraft servers",

So I made sure the backend and frontend worked together. Kept an eye on the general schedule and investigated features to determine if we wanted to implement them or that it was too much work.\n\nApart from that I also led the backend team consisting of 8 students. So in the first week I made sure everyone of the backend was up to speed and understood the coding paradigma's we were using. I also structured the project whenever the code reached a point that additional structure was needed. After the first week I was mainly busy making sure everyone was working in sync, meaning working code which integrates and preventing git merge conflicts, and solving all problems the others could not crack.",

For example, students were failing because the teacher did not notice they were behind schedule by half a year. I wanted to improve by improving the student follow system.\n\nFirst I build web scrapers to extract my data from the site. Using that data I tried to make a better front end. However by adding just a little bit of extra information the system could be so much better. And thus I set out to build a completely new system. After a couple of rounds of talking to my teachers, fellow students and the board of my school I knew what the base requirements were. I then build a system which had all the required functionalities and offered it to the director of my school.  He loved it. But sadly he did not want to buy a program from a 16 year old...",

In this function I worked completely autonomously so people all over the company could suddenly ask something from me. This was really educational for me as well to learn how to handle that. Because of this I also learned how to \"move\" within a company.",
