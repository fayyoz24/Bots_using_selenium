    "summary": "I recently graduated as a social psychologist from the University of Groningen where I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Social Psychology. \n\nIn my podcast \"Climate Psychology\" I talk about the intersection between psychology and the climate crisis! My goals is to not onyl educate people about climate psychology but to also engage the audience in the topics and facilitate action. \n\nBuilding on my interests in behaviour change, sustainability, climate adaptation, environmental, and social psychology, I have pursued an internship as junior researcher at the Innovatiewerkplaats (IWP) of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. My project focussed on conducting research on engaging citizens in climate adaptative measures. As an end-product I developed an advisory report on climate adaptive measures and citizen engagement for the municipality of Groningen.\n\nFurthermore, until February 2021 I was in the in the Youth for Climate Adaptation (YfCA) team, which organizes the Climate Adaptation Youth Summit during the Climate Adaptation Week 2021. Within the YfCA, I was a coordinator keeping track of assignments and the main goals of the Youth Summit. Working with youth and being part of something big like this was an amazing opportunity. \n\nSince 2015, I have been an alumnus of the Foundation Bildung & Begabung that I have worked for as project manager of the projects \"Why is climate mitigation and adaptation so difficult for us?\" and many more. Working in the field of education and being part of a changing and evolving education system is one of my passions and I would not miss working with youth for the world. \n\nIf you are interested in my podcast, my experience or you just simply want to connect feel free to drop me a message!",

During the project, we dived into the depths of environmental and social psychology, as well as political and sociological concepts. In discussions, quizzes, presentations, experiments, films and a role- game, the youth acquired a basic understanding of the climate crisis and the socio-psycho-political challenges we are facing as consequences. Together we developed possible solutions on a personal, social, and political level and reflected on our lifestyle. \n\nThe aims of the project are the funding of personality development, cognitive and non-cognitive skills, creativity and key competencies. It helps the youth to recognize their own talents and opportunities and activate resources.",
