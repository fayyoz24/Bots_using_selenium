    "summary": "Visual artist \ud83d\udd35 creating #scriptedgatherings, #objects and #performative #lectures \ud83d\udd35 based on her research into #social #connectedness and #belonging \ud83d\udd35 #theI #theWe #theOther \ud83d\udd35\n\nA DESCRIPTION\nHow do I relate to the Other(s)? What is the role of the I? And when does the I play a part in a We? With her work, Cindy creates space \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 for these and other related questions. And invites the Other(s) to be a part of it. An interstice in the every day to investigate and experience the complexity of human relationships and positions.\n\nEvery work begins with a \u2018stepping inside\u2019. A community centre, gallery, studio, museum, website, drawing. This space is the stage for the gathering: a directed scene in which, through a meticulous interplay of space, scenography, human presence, and objects, everything is connected and each player is jointly responsible. \n\nIn her work, Cindy constantly facilitates and searches for the connection with the Other(s). This search for human connection is woven into every aspect of her work, from the process of creation and research to the final result. She has a multidisciplinary approach and, if necessary, masters new disciplines. A process of discovery and rediscovery, of creation and re-creation, of experience and realization.\n\nCindy translates her findings into compositions of abstract forms, colors, and sounds that she uses to shape the gatherings. By creating temporary shared spaces where We have something in common, she creates space to explore the dynamics of collectivity. Within the staged gathering, different objects \u2013 from socks, steel silhouettes, capes, and floor stickers to a piece of music \u2013 play a key role. That is, to mediate, seduce or invite. Like the flag of a club, the uniform of an organization, and other ritual objects.\n\nIn the complexity of our society, Cindy creates structure, offers a handhold, and sets boundaries, so all players can surrender to the moment. A collective yet individual experience. Space to consider and experience yourself, others, and the (un)written rules. And to ask yourself: what am I in the midst of all this?\u2028\n\nAlthough its form is constantly changing, the work is based on its own system and overarching framework that gains more definition and meaning with each piece. From this foundation, Cindy is working steadily towards a comprehensive exhibition that brings together past, present, and future scenes and players. \ud83d\udd35",
