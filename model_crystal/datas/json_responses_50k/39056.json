This was particularly challenging because it incorporated a change of website URL, which carried the risk of negatively impacting organic positioning.\n\nThe second challenge was to create a digital campaign to publicize the transition to the new name in all the markets in which we operated. This involved strategic planning for digital media, target audience segmentation, and channel selection. Additionally, I played an active role in the creation of the campaign concept and assets such as long and short videos, display banners, emails, as well as the design of the messages. I also had to coordinate agencies and teammates to ensure smooth execution of all planned activities.\n\nFortunately, I had the pleasure of working with exceptional teammates and agencies, without whom the project would not have been possible. The main challenge I faced was coordinating so many people involved in the project, managing approvals, and dealing with difficulties that arose throughout the project.\n\nIn the end, everything went smoothly, and the results were positive.",
