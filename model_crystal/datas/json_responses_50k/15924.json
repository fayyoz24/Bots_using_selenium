    "summary": "35 years of experience and still learning. I enjoy finding ways to apply and share that experience. Life moves on and I now have the time to return to business situations where I can do that.\n\nI bring extensive knowledge of contracting, procurement and project strategy both through direct delivery and indirectly mentoring, coaching and training.\n\nImportantly I don't see knowledge and experience as static assets - they need to be adapted and extended to new situations. I enjoy challenging assumptions and paradigms including my own.\n\nThis knowledge ranges from the petrochemical industry to Public Procurement of major projects.\n\nI maintain a keen interest in the changing world and the opportunities it brings.",
