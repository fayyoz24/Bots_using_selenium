    "summary": "Today, as the eCommerce (Business Development & Commercial) Lead within Unilever Global's Homecare Business Group, I lead a multi-functional team of 5 (comprising of R&D, Packaging, Retail, Digital Marketing, Finance & Supply Chain) to deliver business target on Amazon UK (Size:  GBP15M+ via both 1P & 3P, Growth: +20% YoY). \n\nMy remit & responsibilities cover optimising, ensuring the rigour & building maturity around all key P&L levers - Business Planning, New Revenue Streams (both Amazon oriented - Business, Fresh, Retail, Direct Imports & DTC oriented), Portfolio & Pack-Price strategy, Digital Marketing Strategy & execution & Business Analytics - with the single objective of building a profitably growing business (Results: +20% YoY USG delivery with 200bps margin improvement, always accretive to the category). Working with Amazon\u2019s Media & Retail teams & our Media execution partner, as a unit, our  focus is to ensure we have the right strategy which is deployed with speed to ensure Sales & Marketing ROIs are exceeded & the learnings from Strategy deployment are cascaded to other pockets of customer organisations for them to benefit.\n\nMy journey to Today:\nStarted with Unilever mid 2013 with the In-House Strategy Consulting. For 4 years, I led multiple Strategy & Execution engagements focusing both on Revenue Growth & Bottom-line improvement across multiple divisions of the business in multiple geographies, delivering high impact, change recommendations for both SMB and large businesses (EUR 10.0m to EUR 1.0B). These foundational years which provided ample opportunities to work across the breadth and depth of PnL topics & business organisations, in my view, have shaped me as a well-rounded professional and has always stroked my desire to always learn and challenge the status quo.\n\nStarting 2018, to build on all the capabilities I had developed in & out of Unilever, I made the conscious pivot to then non-traditional, fast growth CPG channels (DTC, Ecommerce, On-Demand Delivery)starting with the design & activation of Unilever\u2019s DTC platform (working Marketing, Sales, Supply Chain & Finance & consultancies). This now supports Unilever\u2019s On-Demand Ice-cream delivery business (> $100M) and other acquired DTC Businesses (Shea Moisture in the US and Grom in Europe). Thereon, I led the pilot to start Unilever\u2019s first homegrown DTC business for the Homecare category, reaching $500K in the first full year of operations before sunsetting it Q1 2021.",
