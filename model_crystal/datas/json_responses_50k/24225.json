    "summary": "Born and raised in a small village near Lviv, Ihor Shevchuk (pronounced, \"EE-hor SHEV-chuck\") was destined to use his voice for good. As a child, he took great pleasure in singing the folk songs and liturgical music of his country. Despite humble beginnings, Shevchuk devoted himself to perfecting his mastery of vocal music. Witnessing such passion, his family encouraged his efforts to pursue an education in the arts.\n\nKnowing the path to professional singing would be full of trials, Shevchuk was joyfully determined to perfect his craft. After graduating from the Lviv Music College Lyudkevych and the Odessa National Music Academy A. Nezhdanova, he began his career as a soloist of the Kyiv Children's Musical Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. In the same year, he performed as a soloist with the Ensemble of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Shevchuk\u2019s journey led to key performances throughout the country, and took him on subsequent international tours throughout Europe and Asia, including in Beijing, where he sang as part of a cultural exchange. In 2017, he performed leading tenor roles in opera productions at the Dnipro Academic Opera and Ballet Theater. In 2020, Shevchuk became the leading soloist of the Lviv National Opera.",
