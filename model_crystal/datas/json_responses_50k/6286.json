The authors aim to contribute to the literature by demonstrating the viability of \nprevious theoretical methods on designing and implementing a cross-sector collaboration. The \nresearch entails a case-study of the Humanium Metal, a combined effort between three NGO\u2019s \nfrom Sweden and El Salvador that involves melting down seized illegal weapons and \nrepurposing them into valuable products for consumers, to ultimately bring about social \ndevelopment in the conflict-prone communities in El Salvador. Through interviews with the \ninvolved actors of the NGO\u2019s and documentation of the initiative, this study focuses on the \nformation of a cross-sector collaboration, the building of internal and external legitimacy by \nNGO-business partnerships, and the practices that aim to assess public value creation. \nThis study provides insights on antecedent and linking conditions for the formation of a cross-sector collaboration, collaborative processes and structures that foster trusting relationships \nwith both partners and stakeholders, and an implemented accountability framework for the \nmeasurement of public value creation. The researchers close with a discussion of further \nsuggestions for relevant research.",
