    "summary": "Hello! I'm Hanna, a PhD candidate studying the societal and business case for preventing plastic pollution and managing marine litter with the Institute for Environmental Studies at the Vrije Universiteit. \n\nI wear many hats in teaching and research: as a lecturer, course coordinator, teaching and field work assistant, grant writer, Twitter contributor, EU project member and thesis supervisor. \n\nMy recent work has focused on solutions to (marine) plastic pollution, with focus on the circular economy, sustainable business and entrepreneurship. Earlier work included research on ecosystem services and community climate change adaptation strategies. I conducted field work research on Pacific small island developing states in Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \n\nI am curious about how innovative ideas, individuals and groups contribute to - or detract from - sustainability progress. \n\nLet's connect if you want to discuss marine litter and the innovative ways we can tackle the plastic soup!",
