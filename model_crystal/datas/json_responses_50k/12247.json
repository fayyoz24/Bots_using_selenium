MPCFlexParking offers a tailor made solution establishing optimized operation cost by balancing parking revenues and investment cost at any time and at any place as a flexible circular economy based 'green' parking solution, also proving its added value in combination with in-site commercial & shopping areas, top-roof leisure provisions or mid-layer storage boxes. Due to the over years  increasing exit-value of the aluminium component's basic material for investors a guarantee on  investment cost is for sure.",
