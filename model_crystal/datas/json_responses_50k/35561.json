We do this for (new) second home owners or/and private investors. \n\nWith Dutch and local architects we inspires with innovative development, construction and property management solutions. Our sustainable ideas and solutions are the trends of tomorrow. In a world where our space and energy are scarce, we tread new paths and open new markets. \n\nWe started in the middle of the real estate crisis, and we do not just say that things should be differently, we also do it. We connect residents, businesses, investors and community together in such a way that there is a win-win situation in the region. To do this we change the real estate process radically. We are moving away from the traditional sequential process and switching from the beginning to a parallel commercial, technical planning and decision-making proces. We use not only modern media, but we also introduce a new specialism, a consumer management. \nOur way of working requires close cooperation from the outset with the parties involved in the real estate process: the (new) owner, municipality, community, designer and contractor. All the necessary expertise and experience needed for real estate projects, from beginning to end, is present (DBFMO). \n\nThe following principles are paramount:\n\u2714 Consumer-focused development and construction\n\u2714 Craftsmanship and vision\n\u2714 Driven and ambitious\n\u2714 Creative and inspiring\n\u2714 Collaborative and involved\n\u2714 Sustainability and nature\n\n\"Where dreams come home\"",
