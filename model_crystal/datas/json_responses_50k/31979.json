Since then, three generations haven been passionately committed to the development of quality kitchenware at the most innovative technologies in the market. The result is a sublime quality bakeware based on an innovative Coil Coating technology that is central to a unique bake, serve and storage concept that is still manufactured in Spain. The new coating technology provides for the integral bonding of the coating to the steel casing of the baking tins so that a scratch-proof, flake-resistant and virtually indestructible non-stick surface is created, not comparable with the sprayed versions. This ensures that IMF bakeware will last much longer than standard non-stick bakeware. Besides the USP's the pricing is very competitive.\n\nMain tasks:\n1) Responsibility for all export markets except Spain, Portugal and (South of) France.\n2) Preparing the organisation to be ready for world-wide exports.\n3) Develop / adjust the product ranges (IMF including bakeware) for world-wide exports - 4P's.\n4) Create, develop and manage the Inchausti Martinez bakeware brand.",
