    "summary": "My name is Thomas, an enthusiastic and internationally oriented coastal scientist. I have just completed my PhD-thesis titled \"Computational Modelling of the Coastal Protection Function of Salt Marshes with Flexible Vegetation Cover\" at Swansea University, UK.  My passion is to tackle complex problems with a thorough approach to find well-thought solutions in the fields of coastal engineering, computational modelling and geomorphology. I believe that every problem has a solution, which can be found by systematic analysis, creative thinking and determination. \n\nAs a researcher, my qualities are an open mind and a drive to push boundaries. I have published in leading peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, A proactive mindset has helped me to open new opportunities by securing grants to supplement my research budget. These allowed for research visits to Japan and Germany to maximize success in my PhD. \n\nAs a hobby I like travelling. Different cultures and environments pose new challenges. I feel it enhances the mind with inspiration and creative possibilities. I experienced this myself during my internship in Canada, my participation in the Wetskills program in India and currently as PhD in the UK. My ambition is to absorb these experiences to constantly improve my personal and professional skills and apply them to help tackling marine problems around the world.",

I developed a new module to include the effect of vegetation flexibility, which was successfully applied to a real world case study.
