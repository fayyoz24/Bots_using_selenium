This year specifically, we needed to construct a new layout for the booklet, due to not including certain contact information anymore. In this layout a clear distinction needed to be made between students with a different starting year of their studies in econometrics. This year's Book of Faces had the theme \"Sports\", where every year shall be represented by a well known sport and esteemed athletes.",

Participants from over 20 nationalities joined the first edition of the DDWS.\n\nAs co-coordinator, I was partially responsible for setting up this new concept to the fullest. We made sure that there was cheap accommodation and catering available and that world-class trainers would be attending. My focus was more on taking care of the financial means by finding sponsors and partners for the project. Under this, I moreover set up a budget and realisation.",

Cicero and I functioned as its chairperson. However, I also served as vice chairperson for the entire society. As such, I covered the chairperson's tasks when they were not present. As a board, we managed to achieve the highest amount of members that Cicero ever had, exceeding 100 members.\n\nSecondly, I provided workshops to external parties and to our members. Moreover, I joined the \"Hear, Hear!\" committee, which produces five digital magazines per academic year, as a proofreader. Lastly, I was the supervisor for the tournament committee of 2015 and regulated our delegations for debating tournaments, together with the secretary.",
