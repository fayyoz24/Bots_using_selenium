    "summary": "I started my career in the arts as a volunteer and later on as an employee of the socio-cultural organisation Tout Maastricht (the Netherlands), a small independent network organisation and project office who promote cultural participation in the city, especially to those with a distance to culture. I worked on a variety of projects in the roles of Production Assistant, Project Coordinator, Administration, Communication and PR, and Assistant Project Leader. This experience has made inclusivity, representation of identity, and reaching a wider audience part of my main work ethos. My positions as Production Assistant, Project Coordinator, and Assistant Project Leader have strengthened my expertise in managing internal and external teams to ensure the best end result possible. \n\nThroughout my projects, Administration, Marketing, Communication and PR, and Production, have been a constant part of my responsibilities and I pride myself in the accurate and fast processing of data and information I am known for. My studies in English literature and Celtic linguistics have elevated my eye for detail and raised a keen curiosity for the endless possibilities of language and its connection with art and audience. I have therefore been asked at various times to assist projects in their marketing strategy (Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam), to edit and implement press releases and promotion material (Stichting DocFest), to handle logistics (Stichting Museumnacht, Winternights Festival) or to supervise communication and marketing (Maastricht aan Zee Festival). Providing a creative space for new voices is something I feel very passionate about.\n",
