    "summary": "I like learning about anything I have a remote interest in and indulge myself in it. Find out everything there is to know, try to work it out myself, read, ask others, then prove it to myself. Only to finally come across what is not yet known or worse: cannot be known. Then I repeat the process with another subject.\n\nI am a perfectionist. I love optimizing things. In fact I can hardly quit doing it, in real life (e.g. groceries), study or occupation, I'm obsessed with finding the perfect answer. There always is a perfect answer. Even if the answer is that there is no solution, or if it is proven that the answer is impossible to find, it must exist, somewhere. Such is my philosophy.\n\nI am a competitive being. I want to improve. I want to win. Once I commit to something I will do anything, I will do the research, I will optimize my preparation, I will overhaul my lifestyle if there is another percent to be gained. Nothing within my own power will stand between me and victory.\n\nI think about everything. I carefully observe and analyze. In groups, my strategy is to adapt to the people surrounding me. I believe the strongest bonds are created when you blend in perfectly. I follow the way of the chamaeleon.\n\nI am versatile and specialized. Find me something interesting, find me something in which I can excel. Tell me how I can be of use to you and I will soon be so.",

I have always been a proponent of this, as it furthers the development of certain important brain areas that I feel are neglected in the current school system, notably abstract thinking. There have been great results with it in the US and Russia. I volunteered to experience this project first hand. I was unfortunately heavily leashed by the principal and the chess teacher acted more like a grandfather than a teacher towards the children, keeping the lessons far too informal. There was no order in the class room and the children saw it more like an hour off where they could chit-chat while moving some pieces rather than a place to learn. This was also frowned upon by the other teachers at the school. Without any power to change the status quo I regretfully saw how the project would get terminated."
