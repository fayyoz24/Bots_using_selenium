    "summary": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffeHi everyone! \n\nMy name is Trudy and I'm a senior client success specialist and founder of the platform called Digital Dreamers Hub where I'm an online business coach.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Fun fact about me, in November 2016, I graduated with a master's degree in International Fashion Marketing thinking I would be pursuing a career in fashion. I could envision it! Little did I know that my career would be going in a totally different direction. \n\n\ud83d\udeebIn January 2017, I hopped on a plane to Dublin, Ireland to pursue a career in tech, with ZERO experience in the tech space. I got referred by a friend and since I was a new grad I thought, let's goooo!\n\nSo what happened next?\nLittle did I know that pivoting in the tech space would open so many opportunities for me.\n\n\ud83c\udfafWith the experience I gained working for Google, I started my freelance business helping small to medium-sized businesses with their online advertising presence. It was one of the best and most liberating experiences in my career.\n\n\ud83d\ude80It opened doors to working for a major online recruitment tech company which I'm currently working for right now and recently got promoted to senior.\n\n\u2753With all of these experiences acquired throughout the years, there has been a passion to pass on this knowledge. To be frank, I've had this passion for a long time but wasn't sure about the \"what\" and \"how\". \n\n\u2728November 2021, I had this AHA - moment to create a platform called the Digital Dreamers Hub where I share my knowledge on how people can get clarity on how to easily start an online service-based business in 2023. An online business that always leads with purpose. This comes from the mission that women shouldn't be choosing between time and money. They can have both in every life-defining moment.\n\n\ud83d\udce8Here are some resources you can start using;\n\n\ud83d\ude80Check out the podcast episodes: https://spoti.fi/3xY2WF9\n\ud83d\ude80Follow the Instagram page: @digitaldreamershub\n\ud83d\ude80Send me an email: hello@digitaldreamershub.com\n\ud83d\ude80Book a free call: https://calendly.com/digitaldreamershub/20mins",
