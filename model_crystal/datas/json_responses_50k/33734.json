    "summary": "I was born and raised in a small but ambitious and fast growing country Lithuania. Due to my eagerness to explore, challenge myself and learn new things, I always felt that the place was too small for me. So after my international studying experience in South Korea and The Netherlands, I started to work at Philips in Amsterdam. I worked for a global transformation programme where I got acquainted with process excellence and continuous improvement practices.\n\nLater I moved to shipping giant Maersk, where I was quickly promoted to form a new strategy for transformation department and take on a leadership role. This whole transition to a new industry and early leadership experience was tremendous for my personal development. But in the midst of my promising career, I decided to do something crazy. I quit my job to pursue volunteering with women in rural Uganda.\n\nMy career break year allowed me to take a step back and think about my purpose. This is when I decided to join Schuberg Philis in helping the company to materialise its \u2018Tech For Good\u2019 purpose. I help various clients across different industries in setting up business transformation strategies, execution roadmaps and build implementation teams delivering the maximum business value.",
