    "summary": "Ik ben een Senior Onderzoeker binnen de Sportmanagement onderzoeksgroep in de Centre of Expertise Urban Vitality and docent bij Sportkunde, beide aan de Faculteit Bewegen, Sport en Voeding aan de Hogeschool van Amsterdam (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences). \n\nAls kennisinstelling werkt de onderzoeksgroep binnen de quadruple helix aan 1) duurzame en inclusieve sportinfrastructuur 2) innovaties in sport en bewegen 3) wissel- en doorwerking onderzoek/onderwijs/praktijk\n\n-- \n\nIn 2023 I completed a PostDoc in public health policy research at Mitchell Institute for Education and Health Policy in Melbourne, Australia. As a Research Fellow I focussed on supporting health policy recommendations on the prevention and management of chronic diseases and risk factors with international and evidence-based research. I led the projects 'Australia's Health Tracker by Socioeconomic Status 2021', the 'Getting Australia's Health on Track 2021' and 'Enhancing the role of Health and Physical Education in Preventive Health 2023'. \n\nIn November 2021, I completed a PhD in the Sociology of Sport/Sport Management at the Institute for Health and Sport, Victoria University, looking into the use of urban public space for sport and physical activity in the context of multiculturalism. This research has been translated into recommendation reports for the public sector and peer-reviewed publications. \n\nResearch Gate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jora_Broerse\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4954-4802\nThe Conversation: https://theconversation.com/profiles/jora-broerse-1278240/articles",

International evidence suggests motor skills have been significantly impacted by missing out on PHE classes, together with community sport and social play. In collaboration with Australia's leading experts on physical activity and HPE, we look into the question how we can avoid a generation with lacking physical activity skills. The role of HPE as public health prevention is central in our approach.",
