    "summary": "Emotionally Focused Therapy and Personal Coaching - because intimacies, balance and happiness are important in life.\n\nMy strength is creating connection. That can be the connection between partners, or within one's self -- the connection between the body and the mind, and emotions.\n\nI focus on emotions because emotions feed our energy level, how we perceive and think, how we feel about ourselves and others, as well as impact our behaviour. \nBy focussing on emotions we also go to the pain which\u00a0is where healing can take place. It's different than feeling pain on your own. It is a guided process that helps you get through the difficulty so you discover what your next step is.\n\nFor more information see my website: www.creativeconnecting.nl or read about my education and training here on LinkedIn.\n",
