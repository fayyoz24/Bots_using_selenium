I am responsible for the implementation of the Helmond tasks within various regional and European projects in this area. These projects are often characterized by a high degree of complexity and participation of many public and private stakeholders. In addition to the implementation of the projects, I play an active role in identifying and taking up opportunities for new projects from my network and developing them into new project proposals. A clear link is made between the Smart Mobility program and the development and activities on the Automotive Campus.
