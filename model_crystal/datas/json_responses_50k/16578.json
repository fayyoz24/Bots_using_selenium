Powered by a crank it uses infrared to measure the body temperature on the forehead. Next to the high performances, the production requires low costs and is friendly in use. Even illiterates and deaf people could be using this device because of the coloured, symbolic and sound feedback.\n\nThe project is exposed at the Dutch Design Week and is published in TU Delft's Delta magazine.\n",
