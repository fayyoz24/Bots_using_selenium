We focus on how the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a subsystem of stellar-mass black holes (BHS) shapes the dynamical evolution of a stellar cluster and its observable properties. We are using stellar cluster models simulated with the MOCCA code to examine how the distribution of observable stellar populations exotica evolves in clusters in the presence or absence of an IMBH or a BHS. My work involves analysing snapshots from hundreds of simulated globular cluster models to find observable properties that can diagnose the dynamical state of the cluster and determine whether it contains a central IMBH or a BHS.\nThe project has identified apparent differences in segregation between clusters harbouring a BHS or an IMBH by correlating cumulative radial distributions of objects to the cluster's dynamical state. We show clear separations in binary populations depending on the central properties of the cluster and use developed scripts to analyse the formation of observed globular clusters.\nI have developed automated scripts to analyse data from over 250 stellar clusters, and this has provided me with valuable assets in handling large data sets, visualising, and correlating observational transients to simulated outcomes. During this project, I have gained knowledge and experience with stellar dynamics, stellar/binary evolution, high energy astrophysics and observations of star clusters. Next semester, we plan on submitting a paper based on the results of my thesis.",

Post-collision characteristics of remnants were investigated, allowing us to evolve these within stellar evolution codes.\n\nWe concluded the assumption of inelastic collisions to be inadequate for NSC stellar collisions. The resulting outcomes help us acknowledge the importance of stellar collisions on post stellar and cluster evolution in the galactic centre. Acquired results will be contained in an upcoming paper in cooperation with Dr. Ross Church.",

The project aimed to track the colonisation of suitable planets by one or several space-travelling civilisations, with probabilities for close encountering systems to develop intelligent life.\nI establish correlations between civilisation development time and the number of planets colonised.\n\nAs a result, I found that the spread of hypothetical civilisations strongly correlates with the distance between close encountering systems and the time for systems to develop suitable conditions for life. With a rapid development of life for surrounding planets, I show that the first developed civilisation can colonise planets faster than new civilisations develop.",
