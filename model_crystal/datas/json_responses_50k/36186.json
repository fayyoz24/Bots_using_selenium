    "summary": "A passionate, result orientated and driven by creativity: that is how my colleagues perceive me. My passion for working within the cultural sector has lead me to experience different languages, cultures, and ways of living. All of which has facilitated me to be open-minded, empathetic and flexible. My personal qualities are an asset to effectively navigate and manage the needs of clients in today\u2019s multicultural setting. My experience as a musician, organiser and more recently researcher and teaching assistant have aided me in growing my skillset which I would very much would like to apply in a career in the cultural, research or advisory sector.",
