    "summary": "As Video Services Production Director at a global tech-driven, design solutions-based company - I'm building a team, and building new processes to ensure we can provide the best production for international customers at scale.\n\nHaving previously worked as a Video Production Manager and Producer in content studios, agency and corporate, I like to be hands-on in the field as well as be up-to-speed with streamlining processes in my team.\n\nI adore being able to set foot onto a production and create epic digital content: whether it\u2019s a product shoot, lifestyle, events coverage or interviewing talent. I\u2019m the guy behind the scene making sure that everything runs smoothly - but if it doesn\u2019t, I have plans B through Z.\n\nTrust me to network at events and brainstorm new digital ideas as well as work within a team to produce high-quality original content on time, and within budget.\n\nMy expertise includes 360-degree media knowledge from content strategy, writing & editing, creative direction, video production, photography - to SEO and digital media. I can step into a content production process at any time when needed. \n\nI\u2019m high-energy and dynamic, just like the industry I work in. I like to get things done with fresh eyes and when I do it, I do it well. Teach me anything because I cannot get enough of learning and know that we\u2019re never quite reaching our limits. \n\nOne of my biggest strengths is that I am people-focused. Travel, events and liaising keep me ever-curious, charismatic and enthusiastic. I crave diverse environments that encourage out-of-the-box thinking and sociable behaviour. I am a great team-player and aim to be an inspiring leader. \n\nI value optimism, humour, individuality and dedication. I hate asparagus. \n\nGive me sticky-toffee puddling with ice-cream any day, suggest a good book, destination or activity and we\u2019ll get along like a house on fire! I like to keep active both in mind and body, and I enjoy finding hidden gems in life.\n\nOn that note, I leave you with the wise words of Dr Seuss: \n\u201cToday you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!\nYou have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.\nThe more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.\u201d",
