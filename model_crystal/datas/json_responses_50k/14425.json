    "summary": "Building for a sustainable future with our communities driven by renewable energies. \n\nWorking with multidisciplinary teams, working actively with all the pros and cons of all stakeholders large and small, are main ingredients in my preferred method to arrive at solutions. Solutions that are widely supported in society. Solutions that address the questions, being asked in the climate discourse in our 21st century. Solutions, that address the questions, not how to become guardians of the natural world, but how to preserve our place in the natural world, how to get back to being part of nature.\n\nBuilding multidisciplinary teams with members of all ages, backgrounds, vocation and experiences will bring one closer to answer the questions that matter being answered nowadays. Team members working respectfully with and with a genuine interest in all other individuals and groups, people knowing how to act within their giving framework and given responsibilities. In my experience these teams are most prone to solve the questions on a sustainable future with renewable energy. It will not come as a surprise then, that these are the teams I like to build, work with and elaborate on. Working with such teams, they have demonstrated to obtain results, thought to be unobtainable.\u2028\u2028 \n\nNot only advices on these pressing issues need to be giving. On request, I will see through that advices given, will to be executed in any program or project-based approach. So that what is written on paper, does not only stay on paper, but will make a real contribution. \n\nWhether viewpoints originate from economics, technical developments, business cases, politics or culture, all Jigsaw Pieces have to come together for a good and widely supported solution. Multidisciplinary teams with people of all backgrounds and all vocations are needed as is an earnest involvement from and towards society, to get the job done. To get the job done for a transformation towards a sustainable future and the use of renewable energies.",
