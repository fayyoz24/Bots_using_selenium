    "summary": "Background (modified from www.itc.nl):\nAbbas Farshad (1944) has a BSc in geology of the State University of Tehran, Iran (1965), an MSc in Soil Science, from Ghent, Belgium (1975), and a PhD in Earth Sciences from the same University (1997). \nHe started his career at the Department of Land-reform, Iran. He then got a job at Soil Institute of Iran, as soil surveyor, carrying out regional and local studies in the Southern Provinces going as far as the Persian Gulf coast. \nAfter 2 years he was appointed for studying at ITC (1970-1971). He then went back to Iran and worked as \"soil and land evaluation party leader\". In 1973, he went to Belgium, the State University of Ghent to do his MSc. During 1975 to 1980, he worked as \"soil correlator\" at the same Soil Institute. In the same period, he also followed a course in remote sensing at ITC, Enschede (1978). In 1981, when moved to Enschede (where his wife comes from) he got a job at ITC, involved with teaching air photo-interpretation and fieldwork. \nBefore he got retired (Sept. 2009), he taught various subjects and supervised many research works, related to soil mapping and the interpretation of soil data for land degradation, conservation, land suitability evaluation and sustainable land management. His research is directed toward degradation and desertification, and more specifically to the use of remote sensing and modeling (in GIS) for salinization and compaction, etc. Abbas Farshad has published many papers in national and international journals and conference proceedings. \nAbbas has collected a wide experience in sustainable use of land, in particular in (semi-) arid regions. His wealth of experience originates from his trips to different parts of the world such as Spain, Portugal, Luxemburg, Belgium, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana, Bangladesh, Turkey, Australia, UAE, USA, and Mexico.",
