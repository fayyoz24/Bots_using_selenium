However, the assembly of suitable experts is usually left to the initiating innovators themselves or fortuity. To tackle this problem a new integrative competence model of medical engineering based on data mining algorithms has been conceptualized by the institute of Applied Medical Engineering (AME). It identifies suitable and proposes actors based on published texts for a given project by matching experts from medical, technological and product-related fields to the project.\tLogo mi-Mappa\nSpecifically, the product-related dimension of the approach faces the problem of the correct assignment of patents (and the corresponding inventors) to designated competence fields in medical engineering. In the mi-Mappa project we try to tackle this challenge by two different but complementary ways: on the one hand a relation between information from medical products and patents is searched for, because medical products are easily assignable to competence fields and hence, the related patents are assignable to competence fields. On the other hand, we try to find publications of the patent innovators related to the project topics which are more easily assignable to competence fields than the patents themselves.\nThe project is based on technologies and knowledge from the fields of ontology modelling and matching, data and text mining and data cleaning.",

Among all the popular fieldbuses widely used in various fields\uff0c PROFIBUS has become the most important site bus standard with its unique technical characteristics, the strict certification standards, open standards, the support of many vendors and evolving application norm.\nThe goal of this project is to achieve DP master and slave communication functions described in the DP protocol. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the structure and content of DP master side agreement is necessary, which leads to the design of the software system. Moreover, as a market-oriented product development, it is needed to test the software to ensure it correctly achieved all the descriptions in the DP protocol, as well as to meet the needs of actual production. Therefore, through the software platform for simulation runs and the actual connection to the slave station are the two ways to ensure that the research for this project. What I achieved in this project is that I designed communication system for PROFIBUS-DP master based on finite-state machines described in international standard IEC61158, as well as the UI using Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC).\n",
