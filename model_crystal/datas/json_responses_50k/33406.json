    "summary": "I have worked with various audio-visual agencies in Buenos Aires, taking on diverse roles and responsibilities over the years. My experience includes working as a scenography producer and props master, creating and bringing to life countless sets and props for a wide range of productions.\n\nAs a scenography producer, I have worked on over 10 productions for both stage and film, leading teams of up to 15 people and creating the perfect ambience to bring the Director's vision to life. To enhance my skills, I am professionally trained in artistic and FX makeup for both theatre and film, body painting, and digital art software such as Illustrator, Photoshop, After FX, and Premier. This comprehensive skillset ensures that I can contribute to all aspects of production.\n\nIn prop making, I am experienced in creating not only toys and figurines but also in overall set creation, bringing concepts from the imaginary to reality by outsourcing all necessary resources. I am proud to have received international recognition for my skills as a scenography producer, winning awards in both Argentina and Chile.\n\nI am passionate about my work and committed to delivering outstanding results for every project. I look forward to bringing my skills and experience to new challenges and collaborations in the audio-visual industry.",
