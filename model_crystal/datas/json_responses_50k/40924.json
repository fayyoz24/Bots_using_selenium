    "summary": "I am a third year PhD (Finance) student at Tilburg University (The Netherlands). Previously, I worked as senior tactical and quantitative strategist at one of the largest Peruvian pension funds, Prima AFP, with assets under management over US$ 15 Bn. Before that, I held the position of tactical strategist at Rimac Seguros, the leading insurance firm in Peru. In 2014, I participated in the Advanced Finance Course organized by the Central Bank of Peru. My working paper, \u201cCredit Spread Decomposition: A Regime Shift Approach\u201d, was presented in the 2015 World Finance Conference, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned the third prize in the 2016 Central Bank of Peru's Research Paper Competition in Economics and Finance. In 2017, I attended the Advanced Risk and Portfolio Management Bootcamp (New York University) lectured by professor Attilio Meucci. Later in that year,  my working paper called \u201cThe Best of Two Worlds: A Practical Approach to Combine Carry and Momentum in FX Markets\u201d was presented at the Central Bank of Peru\u2019s Economists Conference.",
