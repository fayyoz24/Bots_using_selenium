    "summary": "I have worked in several different companies and for different individuals. During my years of work, I have learned to edit videos, Photos and to create posts for social media platforms (mainly Instagram). I love making commercial videos and editing them. I'm looking for an internship position in which I could learn from a master of field and help the company with creating interesting videos.\n\n furthermore, I have started and managed Google ads campaigns and connected them to Google Analytics to increase brand awareness and site traffic, as well as analyzing uses behavior to improve company weaknesses. \n I have also took part in courses held by Google and coursera to better my skills. Certificates of these courses can be found in my profile. \nI study masters of digital marketing in Wittenborg university of applied sciences (Netherlands). That's because I have a never ending lust of learning and always looking forward to exploring something new. \nI can speak fluent English and have also studied German (B2 level) which actually never worked out well for me!\nIf you are in the Netherlands and you have an internship opportunity for me (in video editing and commercial videos field specifically) message me.",
