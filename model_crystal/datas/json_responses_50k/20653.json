    "summary": "Founder & Owner of Moedianto BV\n\nTake a bold decision, change the course of my heading and get to know the NEW me better!.\n\u261e Check out www.moediantobv.com\n\nNot limited by sector of industry, the company provides pragmatic solutions to various challenges by implementing off-the-shelf technologies.\n\nThe company main activities are in the IT sector. Global players such as KPN, AGFA GEVAERT and CATERPILLAR are among the customers. It was in 1997 when I decided to leave my employer and become an independent IT consultant. The venture turned out to be rewarding and I was looking for a platform to expand the business. \n\nMy primary drive was not entirely to build my own enterprise, I was more at securing projects. Whenever the need becomes apparent I would assemble a team of sub-contractors to get things done. Hence, Moedianto BV was established in 2008 as an instrument for this strategy. The company name is chosen as to honor my late father who had given me inspiration and purpose. \n\nFor the last three years Indonesia particularly catches my attention with its challenges in water treatment and salt import despite its long coastal line. Moreover, the government's plan to increase renewable energy portion in its energy demand and the inclusion of drone development in its strategic mission. For those reasons, I came up with two solution concepts. Therefore, I had initiated two projects that would assist Indonesia in achieving some of its mission: \n\n\t- Desalination Indonesia 4.0.  \n\t- Multipurpose Large Unmanned Cargo Aircraft\n            \n\nMoedianto BV is located at Saturnusstraat 46, 2132 HB Hoofddorp, The Netherlands. Check out the website www.moediantobv.com \n\nSpecialties: Creative Data Driven Problem Approach and Solution, Transformation Process, Project Management/Planning/Coordination, Technical System Architecture, System Design.",
