    "summary": "I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented, and ambitious quantitative analyst with extensive knowledge and experience in programming, mathematics, and finance. I have a proven track record of using analytical skills to solve complex problems and make data-driven decisions. A particular characteristic of mine is that I always approach problems from different angles. With expertise in a variety of programming languages, I am particularly interested in machine learning and its applications in investment and finance.\n\nFor my Master\u2019s in Business Analytics, I wrote my thesis in the field of quantitative investing with a focus on quantifying the value of alternative data. Within Probability and Partners, I am testing different trading strategies using our Probability Sentiment Indicators. I have technical expertise in credit risk, derivative pricing, stochastic modelling, financial mathematics, quantitative risk management, machine learning, data mining, and predictive modelling.\n\nLanguages:\nEnglish, Dutch, Spanish, and Papiamento",
