    "summary": "I've spend the majority of my career (over 10 years) developing software for XVR Simulation (formerly E-Semble BV). I spent most of my time working on the XVR On Scene product, which is VR training software to educate and train operational and tactical safety and security professionals. \n\nCreating XVR provided me and the rest of the team with some unique challenges.\nFor starters, with over 200 customers, training multiple disciplines of security professionals in over 8 languages, the software had to provide a high level of localization and customization. All these variations were built on the same code base, so we could provide our customers with regular updates. \nWe could not simply discard the old software and start from scratch after each project; instead our core product has to be constantly refactored and improved.\nOur customers spend a great deal of effort creating training scenarios, so the software also has to be backwards compatible, allowing those scenarios can be used in each new version.\nFurthermore, the educators building the scenario often do not have an ICT background, and many of the trainees are not experienced gamers. Therefor the user interface must be powerful, yet simple and intuitive.\n\nI worked on the systems which allowed the software to be used as an editor, with which people without a programming background could easily create their own scenarios. I also worked on creating a common code base from which localized and customized versions of the software could be quickly compiled.\n\nI have also worked on automated testing, continuous integration and processing usage statistics.\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n3D/Programming:\n.NET Framework (C#)\nUnity3D\nQuest3D\n\nWorkflow/Teamwork/Process Management:\nTortoiseSVN\nWinCVS\nMantis\nBugzilla\nStarUML\n\nOther:\nMS Word\nMS Excel\nMS Outlook\nPaint.NET",

Rescue professionals of different fields can be trained with the game and are taught how to be part of the forensic chain. The game has found its use in the CSI Lab within the NFI Academy.\n\nE-Semble is closely involved in the development and application of the board game elements as well as the virtual reality elements of the game for which several forensic scenarios are developed.\n\nMy key contribution to this project was creating the virtual clue cards, which can be edited by the end user.\n\n\n",

Several serious gaming companies work together in this project to analyze the opportunities and to develop \na prototype for the Security Region of Utrecht and the surrounding regions. The project is divided into two phases.\n\nXVR Forest fire fighting9\nThe first phase is aimed at analyzing technologies to simulate smoke and flames very realistically. The results of the first phase are now being documented and the concept has been delivered to the Safety Region. The developed technology can be used to train fire fighting procedures for accidents in tunnels and to visualize the impact of the chosen procedures regarding smoke and fire emission.\n\nThe purpose of the second phase is to develop a simulator for wildfires, that can be used in realistic multidisciplinary exercises, with all actors involved in forest fire fighting. In this phase, adjacent regions of the Safety Region Utrecht are involved as well since they share responsibilities to combat fires in the national park De Hoge Veluwe.\n\nMy key contribution to this project was creating a movable fire line, to which the end user could add segments, allowing the fire front to stretch for miles. I also added water cannons to the student vehicle, and implemented logic which allowed the used to draw burned patches in the environment (trees would also change to a burned version of themselves).\n\nAfter the first delivery of the project, I collaborated with Steven van Campen to design how the fire line could automatically progress through the forest.\n\n\n",

They are also able to export their creations, and share them with their peers.\nThe software is set up as a subscription service, with customers receiving biannual updates, consisting of new content (3D environments and models) as well as usability improvements. In addition, the platform is also used for tailor-made projects. It has even been used as an examination system by both Rijkswaterstaat and NBBE (currently NIFV).\n\nDuring my 10+ years at XVR I have worked on the XVR software product as a software developer. My work usually consist of some technical design (software architecture), followed by programming (initially in Quest3D, later in C#) and debugging. \n\nBesides programming on XVR, I have also done design and (automated) testing. I\u2019m constantly on the lookout for ways to improve workflow and efficiency (by means of revised software architecture, tools and policy changes).
