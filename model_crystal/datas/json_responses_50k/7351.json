    "summary": "I am a humanitarian professional and an energetic organizational millipede. I love connecting the dots and people. My mission and drive are to support humanitarians globally (organizations and companies) to improve aid delivery, humanitarian supply chains, and system change, to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and impact. \n\nOver the last two decades, I worked, conducted research, and lived in many countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. All this (and more) turned me into a passionate humanitarian speaker, pursuing system change, meaningful impact, and critical reflection on our sector. Reach out if you wish to learn more, invite me to speak, reflect or help you connect the dots or support your next (virtual) handshake.",

ActivityInfo allows organizations to centralize and synthesize data collected through tools like ODK or FLOW together with management information systems, financial reporting systems, and logistics pipelines to provide field staff and decision makers at all levels with a unified view of performance. Simplified mapping, visualization, and publishing tools allow non-technical domain specialists to work directly with data and turn data into actionable information. The software is cloud based but has a robust offline-mode that allows field staff to continue work when internet connections fail.",
