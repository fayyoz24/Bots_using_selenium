    "summary": "My colleagues know me as a social and committed person and as someone who tries to think from the customer's point of view. They see a person who is open to working for a new client, who wants to keep working and who tries to stay positive. \n\nI want to keep developing myself in and outside my professional discipline where relevant and possible. I am an open, honest person with both feet on the ground. I am a team player, I stick to agreements, am enthusiastic, optimistic and well organised. I see things in perspective, can deal with setbacks, am self-critical and not afraid of change. I am used to work within deadlines.\n\nMy biggest business passions are finance, analytics and process improvement. I prefer to work in an innovative environment, where next to economic matters I am also dealing with other areas of expertise, such as IT, quality or fiscal matters. I prefer working in a team and in a position where I have a lot of contact with people. I want to keep my language skills (Dutch, English, French, German) at least on the level they are now and preferably improve them. The same goes for my IT knowledge (amongst others SAP). I have a certain amount of creativity which can help me come up with solutions, a great affinity for technology and have analytical skills.",
