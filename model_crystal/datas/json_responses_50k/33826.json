    "summary": "I finished my degree in architecture with distinction at Aalto University in 2016 after studying architecture and urbanism both in Helsinki, Finland and Berlin. I have a specific interest in social resilience of communities with a focus on neighborhood level spatial and strategic interventions. Check my master thesis research \u201cUrban neighborhood reimagined\u201d on the topic on issuu via the link below.\n\nMy perspective on architecture and urbanism is to keep looking out for the current challenges and thinking beyond the conventions of the profession. I think my responsibility as a designer is to try to understand the ever changing conditions and to proactively contribute to the well-being of people and the environment, on both the local and global level, in a role of a communicator of new possibilities. My great passion is to improve my skills at that.\n\nI have gained work experience in architectural and urban design as well as graphic design and writing and editorial work in voluntary positions and I confidently put different methods and skills to innovative use. My best skills would be my strategic and systematic thinking, conceptual design, visualizing or vocalizing abstract processes and design concepts as well as an undaunted determination and interest in researching new topics.",
