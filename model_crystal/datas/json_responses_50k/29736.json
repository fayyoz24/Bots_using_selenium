This department is responsible for the managing and control of all the parking facilities (garage, street and bike) in Rotterdam. My assignment is about implementing assetmanagement by means of a risk driven approach, whereby the focus is on parking in garages. \n\nIn my second assignment I fulfilled the role of project secretary. My main contribution to the programme was writing a tender on behalf of a partnership of which the municipality of Rotterdam was the leading partner. The tender was about a SCBA (social cost-benefit analysis) of multifunctional roofs on several locations in the inner city of Rotterdam. The results of the SCBA were supposed to be relevant and workable for all members of the partnership. So the main challenge was to align and combine the different requirements of all the parties in one tender.\n\nDuring my third assignment I worked at the projectmanagement department of the municipality of Rotterdam. This assignment consisted of conducting a stocktaking of a specific part of the real estate portfolio of the municipality in Rotterdam Zuid. Besides that I was involved in negotions between the municipality of Rotterdam and housing associations in the area of Rotterdam Zuid.",
