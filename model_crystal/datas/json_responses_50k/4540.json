    "summary": "Results-driven and experienced leader with proven success in heading transformative, organisation-wide strategies and initiatives. I take an innovative and people-centric approach to resolving issues, developing new business opportunities and creating a culture of belonging. \n\nAs a partner to HR, the board and other business stakeholders on inclusion and how to address this as a business priority, I am responsible for designing inclusion and diversity programmes linked to core values and cultural frameworks of various organisations, creating operational tools to build capability including inclusive behaviours. In all my efforts, the growth and development of colleagues, the organisations I work for and my own are a red thread.\n\nA key foundation of my effectiveness is my commitment to collaborating with business leaders, cross-functional or cross-geographic partners, and stakeholders at all levels. Building relationships is essential in my role.  \n\nCore skills include: driving change, internal communications, exploring possibilities to improve employee engagement practices, designing programmes including mutual mentoring and experiential training to build inclusive teams, advising employee resource group networks, foundations and organisations on how to maximise impact for their stakeholders and build L&D programmes to strengthen the inclusive competency of youth; in short, helping drive diversity and inclusion or simply offering a fresh perspective.\n\nIf you need someone to guide your team on their journey of change, someone to support them while they explore new concepts, reach out. There is a whole world of exciting possibilities out there, that can change the way business is being done today. To me, nothing is more thrilling than helping organisations and teams find their purpose, to help them maximise their impact by creating programmes that truly come to life in a meaningful and sustainable way.",

The DBRT was created to help support the Dutch Embassy in Switzerland with promoting the interests of Dutch organisations and citizens in Switzerland and to further stimulate the economic relationship between our two countries. \n\nThe DBRT is now one of the leading institutes in establishing new and strengthening existing relations between the Netherlands and Switzerland. This is done through organising network and knowledge-based events (with a touch of Dutch) for both CEOs and seasoned professionals throughout Switzerland.  \n\nStarting 2017, I explored several other possibilities to amplify their environmental impact with a special focus on the position of the young professional working in Switzerland. We founded a young professional team dedicated to inspiring young professionals and bringing them together during special events and set up a special mentor project called Minds of Tomorrow.\n\nThe goal of the DBRT Minds of Tomorrow project is to stimulate young professionals, to increase their growth curve and to optimally use their own potential by connecting them with senior leaders active in the Swiss corporate life. A sub-goal of this project is to attract more young professionals to the activities of the professional Dutch network in Switzerland.  ",
