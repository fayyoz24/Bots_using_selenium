    "summary": "I have called my business Pivot Point Coaching because I strongly believe in the power of choice. Every upheaval offers an opportunity; whether it's a move, a new career, or one of the many challenges of partnership and parenthood. It is up to the individual to decide which way to pivot. I hope to help my clients on their explorations of choice. \n\nYou can call me a person continuously looking to get clear on her own purpose - learning and growing wherever I can. I am very comfortable with change. I have tried so many different things! And there are many more things I still hope to try. As a coach, I am able to channel the various experiences I have had for the good of my clients and help make changes appear less daunting. It takes courage to get to a better understanding of who you really are, and what you really want, but it is essential in order to get past difficult choices. I am there to guide you along the way with compassion and creativity so that you can move towards your goals. \n\nIf you have come to a Pivotal Point on your travels, I would love to help you embrace the changes in your life and to live on purpose.",
