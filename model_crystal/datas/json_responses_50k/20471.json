QuaLiFY will create a solid basis to launch commercially viable products and services in the area of personalised dietary advice by providing a knowledge infrastructure and harmonised open innovation protocols. Three main areas of implementation have been chosen, based on the interaction between dieticians and clients, namely obese children, eating disorders and type 2 (pre-) diabetics (WP3). Resulting products and services will be tested, integrated and optimised for consumer use in a field lab setting, the \u2018Nutrition Researcher Cohort\u2019. QuaLiFY will also publish a model business plan and a guidebook for open innovation business development based on EU-funded RTD projects.",

Together with the Programs Scientific director Dr. Ben van Ommen and the individual project teams comprising of almost 100 scientists in many expertise areas, we make sure that we achieve the goals we have set for this program and for the projects.",
