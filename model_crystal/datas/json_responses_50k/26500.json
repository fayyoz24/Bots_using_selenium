One of these event ideas was to create a world map-timeline and bring awareness to scientists from all over the world. Originally, this would have been an in-person exhibition. However, because of COVID-19 this was not possible - instead, we thought that by making a website, this map could be shared not only with our small community, but students all over the world. And thus, the Scientific Time Travel Map was born.\n\nThis was my first experience of building a website and I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing an idea turn into reality. We envision the project to be an interactive resource for students to learn more about the world of science as well as the history behind it. The website has been launched and is in its final stages of completion.",

At a glance it just looks like a beautiful craft with paper but the more you practice it the more you realize the interdisciplinary nature of the craft. Mathematics plays an important role in origami and in turn origami can be used to teach math. This artform doesnt only help you be cretaive and make pretty peices but it also increases concentration,precision and critical thinking. I dedicate an hour or two every fifteen days to learn a new model or practice an old one during covid lockdown.",
