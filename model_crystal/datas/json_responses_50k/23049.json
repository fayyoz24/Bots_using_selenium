The volunteering project was organized by AIESEC. It contributed to the UN Sustainable Development Goal number 4, Quality Education.\n\nDuring the 6 weeks period I taught on a daily basis to classes of 6-year-old children to 18-year-old teenagers, to improve their level of English through conversation lessons, and to broaden their cultural horizons. \n\nEvery class was entirely organised and taught by me, choosing topics and lesson plans. Vocabulary and grammar based lessons were organised for the younger students classes, whereas contemporary  topics were chosen for the teenagers classes. The aim was to enrich their knowledge of the world and to expand their horizons, while at the same time improving their English speaking skills, fundamental for having access to university, finding a higher-placed job and thus having a better future in the country and abroad. \n\nDuring the period I lived with a local family, from which I learned more about Cambodian customs and culture."
