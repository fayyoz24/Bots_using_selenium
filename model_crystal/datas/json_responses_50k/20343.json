    "summary": "I am a Ph.D. researcher from intelligent electric power system group (IEPG), Delft University of Technology with experience in handling multidisplinary projects in control, aerospace and power engineering.  I have a Master of Technology (M.Tech.) degree on control system from IIT Kharagpur, India.\n \nI possess a strong research background in modeling, simulation and hardware in the loop(HIL) testing of various control applications in aerospace and power system domains. These projects required to learn about their respective systems, model the system behaviour, and design appropriate control algorithms and computer programs to solve some specific problems of the system. I have always enjoyed the process of using various software tools to study, analyse and solve the problem of a system. Currently, I am working as an senior electrical engineer at ASM.",

Experimentally found\nout the transfer functions of the servos used in the MAV. Tested the sensors for the MAV with\nequipments like 3 axis rate table in Hardware in Loop Simulation(HILS). Developed Kalman\nfiltering algorithms for attitude estimation of MAV.",
