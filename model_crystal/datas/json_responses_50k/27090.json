    "summary": "I am a 24 year-old mechanical engineer, specialised in production management who is currently working as a project management graduate at Siemens Gamesa.\n\nI am a self-motivated, responsible and hard working person who is capable of working well both on my own and in a team environment. I am always excited for challenging situations and environments, to which I am adaptable. Professionally, my main interests are production and maintenance engineering, industrial management and ecological engineering. My daily focus is always doing my best and learning the most I can, so I can continuously improve.\n\nBesides my student and professional duties, I have always tried to complement my academic curriculum with different nature related volunteering experiences, not only in Portugal, but also internationally. Therefore, I have developed soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, adaptability and open-mindedness.\n\nI have always been passionate about travelling and getting to know different cultures since a very young age. This allowed me not only to see some of the wonders of world, but also the societal, structural and technological problems that still exist. I am undoubtedly sure that all these experiences have significantly contributed to my personal growth.\n\nI am also a semi-professional marathon runner. In October 2022, at age 23, I was able to qualify directly for the world renowned Boston Marathon, by running the Chicago Marathon in under 3h (2:58:14), a feat only achievable by the top 5% all-time marathon finishers, according to ASICS. My goal in to run all 6 Abbott World Marathon Majors (London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Tokyo and Berlin) under 3h by the age of 30. I have also ran the 2023 Berlin Marathon in 2:58:10. My next race is yet to be determined.",

The idea behind the Scope Nature, its name, design and logotype are totally innovative. The Scope Nature includes a thorough plan, budget and presentation, meeting all the proposed requirements.\n\nThe Scope Nature has a total duration of 7.5 months, during which I would participate in 9 different volunteering projects focused of environmental education, ecological engineering/construction and animal species/habitat conservation. All of these projects are located in 7 distinct North and Central American countries (Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica). \n\nThe Scope Nature was created due to my passion for animals and nature. Its objectives are raising awareness amongst local populations of remote regions for the benefits of coexistence and the adoption of sustainable practices and protect endangered species.\n\nDuring the 7.5 months, besides volunteering I would also visit many nature related tourist attractions across the 7 countries. However, priority would be given to affordable and sustainable accommodation and transportation options. The Scope Nature requires a financial commitment of 4776\u20ac, which meets the 5000\u20ac budget requirement imposed by the Lobo Scholarship 2022",
