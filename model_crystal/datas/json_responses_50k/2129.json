    "summary": "Currently studying international leisure and event management at BUas. I have chosen this because I have been wanting to organize things all my life and I feel at home in the leisure world. I love organizing something where other people get a smile on their faces, it does not really matter in what way.\n\nIn the years before this study, I worked and studied in different types of industries, which gave me a lot of experience. Both business and individual. At the moment I feel very much at home in Breda and in the coming years, I think will mainly focus on the sports industry. Maybe my education will give me new insights into other factors of the leisure industry. I always try to learn as much as possible! \n\nDo you want to know more about my skills and experiences?\nExplore my page further or get in touch! \n\nJelmer Boltjes\n06-29507270\n",
