    "summary": "As an ESG Advisor at 4ESG Consulting, I help large financial institutions navigate the complex and evolving landscape of environmental, social, and governance issues. I provide strategic and sustainable solutions, policy implementation and integration, and ESG-related analysis and advice to clients at both national and EU levels. I enjoy working with a team of skilled experts and constantly growing personally and professionally in this dynamic field.\n\nI have also completed a double degree in Public Policy and Human Development from United Nations University-MERIT and Maastricht University, with a specialization in Risk and Vulnerability. I have gained expertise in the policy cycle stages, with a focus on sustainability, risk, and vulnerability situations. I have also completed a certificate in Business Sustainability Management from University of Cambridge, enhancing my knowledge and skills in this area. My education background in Psychology and International Relations, along with my academic awards and study abroad experience, has given me a unique foundation in understanding and communicating with diverse actors and stakeholders. My previous work experiences have also involved multicultural settings, teamwork and collaboration, and analytical duties to measure program success and failures. I am passionate about working on a global scale, and with/for varying audiences around the world.",
