    "summary": "I\u2019m a brand designer who loves taking on strategic challenges and seeing them through from concept to execution. I\u2019m a problem solver who loves the excitement of stage 0 of building a new brand. My strength is my ability to break down and translate nascent ideas into creative thoughtful and pragmatic designs. Learn more about my process and work at www.sashaahuja.com\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt present, I am consulting for a non-profit in the food and baking industry while levelling up my skills in UI/UX design and web flow. Last year, I acquired a Master\u2019s in Society, Science and Technology from Maastricht University where I gained a deeper understanding of the social, ethical and political implications of techno-scientific developments. Prior to this, I worked as a senior brand designer for Paytm Insider, a fast-growing scale-up. There, I played a key role in facilitating a major rebrand and received recognition from the Chief Marketing Officer for my effective communication and management of the project. Before this, I consulted as a visual designer for a UX design agency and a real estate firm. I\u2019ve created brand identities for clients of varying scales and complexities such as mental health practitioners, an ethical fashion brand and restaurants, to name a few. \n\nMy academic background and professional experience enable me to apply a holistic and critical perspective to my design practice and to address my client\u2019s challenges with creativity and empathy. \n\nI currently live in the Netherlands but I have worked for clients in the UK, Denmark, Greece and India.",
