    "summary": "I am a scientific entrepreneur striving for social impact. \n\nAs a creative mind with a passion for science and innovation, I am committed to utilising my skills and knowledge to bring science and innovation to people. \n\nAt OASYS NOW, we empower people to take control over their health data and contribute it to science securely. My work at OASYS NOW enables me to bring cutting edge technology and scientific advancements to society. We build technologies enabling secure DNA data exchange, that helps bring new treatments to patients faster.\n\nMy research at Erasmus Medical Center revolves around Genomic Privacy, meaning applying cryptographic techniques to the DNA data lifecycle (under supervision of Dr. Gennady Roshchupkin, Computational Population Biology Group in Department of Radiology and Department of Epidemiology).\n\nMy previous research, I conducted at the DNA Damage Repair Lab of Dr. Joris Pothof, Department of Molecular Genetics, Erasmus MC. I dove into how RNA sequencing data and Differential Expression measurements are created in Aging research in different tissues. I unraveled a novel bias by combining knowledge of the underlying mathematical assumptions in the algorithms, with how the biological processes of aging shape the gene expression data. I also built a pipeline to compensate for this sample specific gene length bias that uncovered many differentially expressed genes in aging that weren't detectable previously.",

We are an interdisciplinary and diverse team, specialising in secure and ethical health data reuse. \n\nOur solutions put people in control of their most sensitive health data, including their DNA. \nYou can gain personal health insights and see if there are relevant clinical trials available for you. \nYou can also choose to donate your data to research of your choice, thereby helping patients to get a treatment faster.\n\nI am a scientist turned social impact entrepreneur. I am in love with the technological advancements around DNA sequencing and Precision Medicine, but found that the practical, ethical, and legal challenges need to be addressed so we can bring this field forward in a way that is as beautiful as the science behind it. \n\nI am motivated to empower people to take part in this revolution in healthcare brought on by DNA called Precision Medicine. We want to improve health accessibility and health equity, by shaping this field through privacy-by-design technology.\nMy mission is to improve on people's privacy by protecting their most sensitive biometric, their DNA data, all the while making it safely and transparently available for research when people choose to. I also want to help in evening the skew in DNA data, as right now 95% of all DNA data is of European origin, meaning the medical advancements created out of this DNA research is not for everyone (see gwasdiversitymonitor.com). \n\nIn the team I play a role in Business Development, Product Development, and R&D into Genomic Privacy.",
