MMD designs, develops and manufactures custom microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and assemble micro devices. Our 140 experts working at the MEMS Foundry and Micro Devices Facility follow a phase-gated approach to demonstrate the feasibility and give proof of concept, develop the process to the required maturity level and manufacture your devices with the right quality.\n\nSome background info, what is MEMS technology? \nMicro electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS, is a process technology used to create tiny integrated devices or systems that have both mechanical and electronic components. The functional elements of MEMS are for example: minitiaturized structures, sensors, actuators and microelectronics. You wil find these devices implemented in e.g. medical applications (pressure sensors, transducers for hearing aids, microfluidics, microsurgical and diagnostical tools, etc) and applied in a wealth of Industrial and commercial products (printer heads, smart phones, the airbags on your car, etc.. etc..).",
