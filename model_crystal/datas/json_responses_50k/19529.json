    "summary": "Endurance, driven, unafraid of improvisation, non-stop learning, a fresh view on what goes on in the business world because I don't origin from it, ability to work and communicate on all levels within a company, always looking for thrills, innovation and fun. Those are my natural qualities which are omnipresent in the performing arts and mix with the characters and situations I encounter in the businessworld. I performed the role of management assistant, executive secretary, office manager, commercial assistant, you name it within a wide variety of businesses: semi-commercial and highly commercial. My goal is not to switch environments constantly but the market directs, especially now. If given a chance I can ground and let a team share and benefit from my working experience and flexibility. I was raised bilingual in Dutch and German and master a foreign language quickly. My English is good and used daily, Spanish is active and alive, French is also active but on a basic communication level. After 9 years in supporting roles for which I didn't receive any training at all, I'm ready to step into a commercial role with budget responsibility.\n\nSpecialties: Dramaturgy: shaping roughly existing ideas into theatre, dance and film scenes; mediator between director and cast on the stage; creative empowerment training for foreign language audiences. Personal qualities other than listed before: quick adaptation, open minded, enthusiastic, imaginative, exploring, playful, analytical, thinking in images, left-handed, musically, works best with sparring partners. I am used to a very busy working week with a freelance theatre business next to my job.",

I collaborate with director, actors and technicians in creating and generating scenes. 2002 I began my own theatre projects next to keeping a regular job in the business world. Situations I encounter in this challenging mixture, feed my creative thinking. My personal interest lies in stories of migration and survival. Two pillars closely connected, touched and influenced by history. Coming forth from a Dutch-German marriage with family members living in the USA I explore the historical context of my own generation and that of our (great)grandparents in those 3 countries during turbulent times. Next to creating performing art productions I specialise in theatre workshops for foreign language audiences. Personal stories form the base and are moulded into scenes. In particular (young) groups benefit greatly from the educational and healing effect of sharing hidden emotions and creating ways to reflect together on pain, sorrow and sudden displacement.",
