Lack of resources creates the need to be creative with all things available.\n- With the exception of plastic waste, which is present everywhere.\n\n- Mame Coumba Bang is a reality for many people who helps society, if well treated.\n- However pollution of water is omnipresent.\n\n- Manual fishing and boat construction are important parts of the local economy.\n- However international and technological developments create large pressures on daily economic life.\n\n- St. Louis fishermen live with the sea.\n- However, rising water levels have catastrophic effects on their houses and their environment.",
