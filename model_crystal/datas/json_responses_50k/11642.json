    "summary": "Hey, thank you for taking your time to read through my profile. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMy profile is characterized by diversity and flexibility with a main focus on communications. \n\nThrough previous experiences, I was able to acquire and expand my skill set in various fields that contribute to my adaptability and fast perception.  \n\nMy field of expertise remains communications. Therefore, I have gained experience in both external and internal communications in bigger corporations as well as on a smaller scale. \n\nI have a lifelong learning mindset and like to challenge myself by taking steps out of my comfort zone. Therefore, I moved to Australia, or decided to study abroad, amongst others.\n\nConstant development plays an essential part in my journey. \n\nI truly believe that there is not one right way to do things but through our unique journeys each and every one of us is able to bring enriching perspectives and complementary skills to the table. \n\nI am looking forward to staying connected & learning from each other!",
