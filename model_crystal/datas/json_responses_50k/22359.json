They key success factor was to deliver a tailor-made solution in a short amount of time before the official start of the season. In 4 weeks the project was delivered successfully!\nMy role during this project was to implement a solution in FileLinx that met the requirements of KNVB. The set up of the information structure and the automation of the processes in FileLinx were the key parts of this solution. By remaining in close contact with the client during the implementation we could continuously finetune our solution and deliver in a short time a great result. ",

Besides the theoritical part, the study was also enhanced by using Matlab and Network Workbench software tools for the analysis of the datasets of existing complex networks.",
