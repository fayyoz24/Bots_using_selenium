    "summary": "I am a post-doc in Behavioural Ecology. Curious about the world. Interested in nature conservation, science communication, nature education and changing the world.\n\nThe social and spatial dynamics of animal populations are my main research interests. During my first MSc thesis at Wageningen University (Netherlands), I investigated parental care differences between migrating and non-migrating barnacle geese [Thesis prize] and during my second MSc thesis at The Simon Fraser University (Canada), I studied if anthropogenic structures and activities affect the spatial distribution of dabbling ducks in agricultural fields [MSc Cum laude].\n\nI have a special interest in how individuals weigh the risk and benefits of particular situations, for example social situations. As part of my PhD at Wageningen University, I used a novel tracking system and a self-designed video-playback experiment to study the effects of personality on proximity and communication networks in great tits [PhD Cum laude]. \n\nAt the moment I study how social dynamics might link to foraging succes in wild Trinidadian guppies (IGB) and I started a postdoc fellowship at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) to study personality and migration strategies in noctule bats.\n\nNext to my scientific work, I have always been active in science communication and education. For example, by designing online tools for the Bachelor course Animal Behaviour and by being a co-creater of the free Massive Open Online Course: Introduction to Animal Behaviour on Edx.org. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, I wish to contribute to a better world. Nature conservation has always been a crucial theme in my professional and personal life. Via volunteering in nature conservation organizations and by sharing the wonders of nature via (social) media, I hope to make people more aware of the amazing natural world around us.\n\nContact me: lysannesnijders@gmail.com\norcid.org/0000-0003-0911-3418",
