    "summary": "I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering & Management, which I finalized with a graduation internship at Heineken Nederland, where I also worked after graduation. The projects I carried out during my studies provided me with experience in process improvement at Dutch companies such as Philips, ASML, Inalfa Roofsystems, New Dutch Connections and Varossieau in Suriname.\n\nCurrently, I specialize in the field of sustainability through a joint master's degree in Industrial Ecology at Leiden University and the University of Technology in Delft. \n\nRecently, I worked as a chairman for the LDE Centre for Sustainability Student Board, which allowed me to organize events for students of Leiden University, TU Delft and Erasmus Rotterdam. Together with other board members, we raised awareness about sustainability and connected students with scientists and professionals in this field, while promoting various opportunities for education in the disciplines of sustainability.",
