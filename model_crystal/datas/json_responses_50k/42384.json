    "summary": "Hi! My name is Jana, 31 years old and currently based in Rome, Italy.\n\nI speak Dutch and English fluently (most people think I'm from the US), I can manage myself in Indonesian and I even understand a tiny bit of Russian and Italian. I love to sing, dance and travel (how wonderfully clich\u00e9). Went from being a meat-lover to a flexitarian and I try to stay away from all products containing palmoil, because I consider saving orangutans to be my own personal mission.\n\nWhat satisfies me in life is reaching people on an emotional level and perhaps more importantly; change lives. My goals? Creating public awareness regarding different kinds of atrocities, fighting for the rights of humans and animals, breaking through taboos, and maybe one day become a documentary filmmaker.\n\nYou might think I'm boring and dull, because of all of the above, but I'm a very fun person. I promise! ;)",
