The lighting industry is going through a radical transformation driven by rapid progress in LED lighting, semiconductor technology, and the need for sustainable and energy-efficient solutions. \n \nThe EnLight project aims to exploit the full potential of LED lighting through breakthrough innovations in integrated lighting solutions beyond retrofit applications. This includes intelligent lighting systems. The aim is to reduce energy consumption by up to 40% compared with today\u2019s LED systems. \n \nThe EnLight project is developing more compact and efficient lighting electronics, drivers and controls, which together will lead to optimized LED modules. In addition, developments will maximize the impact of LED by improving energy efficiency and lowering system costs. Finally, the EnLight project will optimize intelligent systems, which, in combination with advanced sensors and controls, will fuel new applications, solutions and market uptake. \n \nThe EnLight project will deliver new technology and applications that inspire and enable designers in ways far beyond conventional lighting. \n",
