    "summary": "My name is Eiman Bashir, I am an Assistant Research Professor with a Ph.D. degree in water management from Wageningen University and IHE Delft Institute for Water Education in the Netherlands, a Master of Science degree in Engineering Hydrology from the National University of Ireland Galway, and a bachelor's degree in civil engineering (Hydraulics & hydrology division) from Sudan University for Science and Technology in Sudan. I have a long experience of over 15 years of applied research in water resources and hydraulic engineering, hydrology, irrigation water management, flood and drought management, risk management, soil and water interaction, and environmental monitoring with the objective of sustainability of water resources.  Additionally, I have gained appreciated experience in the management of development projects, preparation of technical reports, and dissemination of project outputs. By working with local, and international partners I have gained effective interpersonal communication and leadership skills besides being well integrated with teamwork, and self-motivated with a strong work ethic and a positive attitude.",
