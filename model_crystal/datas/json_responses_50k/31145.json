    "summary": "I was born in Bogota, but have grown up largely in Europe, living and studying in 6 cities across 5 countries - so far. This has exposed me to various cultures and backgrounds, allowing me to build an international network of driven and intelligent people. Seeing their hard work and achievements motivates me to seek out new challenges, and never stop learning. \n\nI recently graduated from the Bachelor in Politics, Law, and Economics at IE University. Rather than study these three disciplines apart, our degree aimed to uncover and analyze the challenges that lie at their intersections. We were stimulated to think and act as the bridge between stakeholders, in order to find solutions that are effective while minimising negative effects for others. \n\nI perform at my best when I am entrusted with a healthy amount of responsibility, in a team that values transparency, honesty, and respect. I have demonstrated this in past roles, as well as by setting up and leading various initiatives, but I strongly believe success is earned - not deserved - despite my achievements. \n\nAs of the summer of 2023, I would like to combine my passion for cross-cutting issues with my interdisciplinary capabilities, and apply them toward a vision and purpose I can stand behind in a full-time position.",
