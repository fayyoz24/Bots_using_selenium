From this we discovered that most technologies affect scope 2 and 3 emissions and that, with the current legislation on CO2 emissions, there is a lack of incentive to invest in such technologies. To create such incentive, I worked closely with my supervisor to prepare a legislative framework proposal with the core concept of a 'value-added carbon chain' built around the idea that, when carbon is reused, it gains in value and is too valuable to be emitted. \nThe experience in the company was valuable, as I learnt a lot about how big corporate companies work and think in terms of sustainability. I believe that this new sense of direction will help me during my master studies and future work in creating realistic and optimized energy transition approaches.",

In addition to preparing and filming several simple, but common and helpful experiments that often can't be completed due to lack of material in Ethiopia, I gathered material sponsoring (including two laptops, two tablets, 2 electric hot plates, a simple electronic microscope, many pipettes, 50 plastic test tubes, 50 microscope plates, and several plastic petri dishes), and prepared simple learning exercises for both staff and 3rd & 4th grade students. \n\nIn May 2014, I then travelled to the school with all the material and worked with the staff for three weeks to improve applying learning objectives with the limited material at hand and also increase awareness of safety in the labs. I was also asked to teach grades 8 and 9 about HIV awareness and preventative measures. \n\nThe entire experience was extremely valuable to me and a learning process for both myself and the staff. I still try to contribute by participating in the sponsored walks whenever I can.\n"
