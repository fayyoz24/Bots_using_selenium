    "summary": "I've over 15 years of working experience within real estate (mixed use / commercial / retail/hospitality) and large scale urban development. Besides I initiated, led and contributed to several strategic corporate transitions. \n\nMy specialties: a clear vision on results to be achieved, naturally aligning stakeholders interests, creating high quality concepts & plans, creating & contracting partnerships, leading project teams and stakeholders with creativity and driven by issues that matter to society. \n\nSpecific expertises: (commercial) real estate & retail, urban development & sustainability, mobility & transfer, user experience.\n\nAfter finishing my masters at TU/e (summa cum laude) incl. several interns,  I started my career at New Amsterdam Development Consultants. NADC's experienced team of urban developers learned me to align the complex conditions of large scale area development projects by housing corporations (Rotterdam/Amsterdam).\n\nAfter 2 years I had the opportunity to join TCN, developer/owner of commercial real estate, famous for its innovative concepts and branding strategies. I've developed and implemented real estate concepts and long term strategies, focusing on large scale business parks like Media Park and Energy Business Park Arnhem. Unfortunately TCN had to quit all of its activities 2 years later.\n\nThen - for 5 years - I have developed stations and surrounding areas by integrating mobility, retail, hotel and public space. I enjoyed inspiring others by sharing ways to integrate mobility, stations and the city. I've worked on 3 corporate strategies enabling me to think strategically about the future of companies.\n\nAs of 2017, for 2 years, I have been employed at EDGE Technologies / OVG Real Estate and thereby responsible for the acquisition of healthier working projects in Paris.\n\nCurrent, I work at AM - among Dutch largest area developers - and responsible for the acquisition and development of Mixed Use projects.",
