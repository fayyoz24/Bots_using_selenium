    "summary": "\"And so you touch this limit, something happens and you suddenly can go a little bit further. With your mind power, your determination, your instinct, and the experience as well, you can fly very high\"\nAyrton Senna\n\nAyrton is one of my sports heroes, and this quote really inspires me, and somehow defines how I feel life must be. At any level, at any time, in the personal or professional aspect, you always need to be heading for your limits. That is the only way to really get to know yourself and find what your purpose is\n\nI am a very enterprising person who enjoys a healthy life, full of physical activity and socializing with friends. Sport is my greatest passion. I enjoy the competitive edge, but above it, I love the team spirit that comes with it. Achieve a goal on your own gives you a nice kick, but achieving the same with your teammates is a whole new level of satisfaction. \n\nI love to try as many sports as I can and face the challenge that each brings me. Above all, Rugby is the one that beats stronger in my heart. I have played since I was 10 years old and I can't be thankful enough for so many values I learn from it. I love to think that I grow up to be the person I am today thanks to what I experience & learn in the game:  \n\n\"Always return the jersey in a higher place than when you receive it\"  \n\nThe one mantra I learned and I fully embrace for life. \n\nSpecialties: \n\u2022 Creative Client Service, with a big focus on project management & planning skills. \n\u2022 Brand toolkit development and implementation expertise, with a special focus on content re-purpose.\n\u2022 Brand content production (TV, print, OOH, brand identity, and digital coms) either from creative origination, or adaptation/localization.\n\u2022 Competitive research for FCGM brands, with a strategic eye for consumer journeys and content creation recommendations. \n\u2022 Overall, more than 10 years of experience in advertising & brand communications.",

The new product was aimed to be a low cost alternative for professional targets that want to still relay on Ariel high quality laundry (Satin removal & odor control) but at a more competitive price that could be more easily fitted on their tight business budgets. Based on this brief, we created a campaign aimed to highlight the good odor and stain removal qualities of the \"Ariel Simply Formula\" by using entrepreneurs experiences as our main storytelling drivers. The campaign portrayed the story of two young gastronomy entrepreneurs that talked about how Ariel Simply had helped them to achieve top clean quality against heavy stains; and perfect odor control on their working clothes as well as on the restaurant table linens. The campaign was launched in France as the pilot market and the results where very positive, with a high recall of the new brand and good retail results in the product first quarter. This good results lead for several campaign adaptations on other eastern Europe markets such as: Poland, Hungary, and Russia.  ",

Since in health marketing you are not allowed to promote directly your product to the patients we developed this indirect camping to create awareness about the common problems that any couple could face while trying to conceive. This way we could re-direct potential target to the brand target business by the simple explanation of the alternatives for their conception problems. The website it also performed as a dynamic platform because users can interact either with us or between each others. Using the inquire form, known as \u201cconsultas\u201d, they could reach some medical advice as a first contact with their fertility problems. They could also publish their own testimonies and search for the closest fertility center. We have also developed some online applications as major claim for users engagement. An online pregnancy calendar follow up, and a photo album slideshare are some good examples of this target hook apps. As regard the digital strategy we developed a linkbulding campaign and a social media optimization (SMO) plan. We started we some SEM campaign until we reach a stable traffic statics. Then we move forward into the linkbuilding and the SMO strategy, with active profiles on the most important social media networks. ",

As a communications manager, my responsibilities were focused on the broadcast the project through all the available channels and help us gain as much contribution as possible from public and private parties. We achieved a good partnership deal with the public sector by having access to public sports facilities to held the \"fun-day\" activities, as well as good PR on local media. From the private sector, we were able to collect good collaborations from important companies such as Kraft-Food Argentina and McDonald's. The whole project was a complete success for the community and for our ONG experience as teenagers. We won the 2001 JA leadership contests against the other 15 school projects. "
