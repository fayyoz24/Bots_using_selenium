    "summary": "I am an experienced Urban Development and Climate Resilience Specialist actively seeking full-time positions in the US starting in 2024. With expertise in planning, policy, design, program management, and consulting, I have contributed to substantive projects in the public and private sectors - most prominently the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).\n\nCurrently, I am a doctoral candidate at TU Delft's Resilience Lab. My research, practice and teaching interests are within the nexus of urban resilience, climate change, and long-term integrated and inclusive planning for cities of the next century. I specifically investigate the knowledge divide between the Global North and South, with support from organizations like the TU Delft Global Initiative, and the C40 Women4Climate program.\n\nPreviously, I have worked with entities, including UNDRR, the National Disaster Management Authority in India, the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, and leading architecture offices. Additionally, I have served as a guest lecturer at TU Delft, a visiting faculty member at Mumbai University, and contributed to media platforms in India, discussing urban development under climate and disaster risks.\n\nAs the Valedictorian of my class at Mumbai University, I earned a full scholarship from TU Delft for my performance in the Masters degree in Urbanism, graduating with honours and cum laude.",
