The two activities I focused on in my research were Study abroad programs and Outdoor Education initiatives. What I found, was that such activities in their own right are not neccesarily transformational. In fact, true transformation requires that students be subject to Extraordinary leadership from the faculty and staff who run such activities. In my thesis I drew on the \"Leadership Challenge\" (Kouzes & Posner) which outlined the five practices of extraordinary leadership. I offered this model, and added two additional practices that I determined would be of added benefit for leaders in the study abroad field.",
