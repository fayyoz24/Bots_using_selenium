Motivating, sharing responsibilities and supporting the responsible managers are crucial for success.\n\u2022\tInitiated and lead start-ups in Czechoslovakia, The Netherlands, USA, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea. The success was in most cases depending on understanding the local cultures and what is driving these individuals in their environment to take over the ownership of an idea.\n\u2022\tMost valuable in my experience are also the setbacks as a result of the regular downturns experienced in the Semiconductor industry. Also in such situation you have to be a leader and accept that tough measures have to be taken and be as energetic as in an upturn to create a new base for the company after the downturn.",
