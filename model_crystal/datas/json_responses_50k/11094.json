    "summary": "Interdisciplinarity is my main occupation and interest, in particular in the field of the social sciences where the complexity of our reality requires it so strongly.\n\nAs a Research Master student in Philosophy and Economics I am interested in the role of Identity in Economics and the related field of Behavioral Economics. Yet I am a Global Governance alumni and as such I am passionate about current global issues and policy debates, for that I have mainly focused on AI and the phenomena of disinformation and misinformation online.\n\nThese somewhat hybrid interests are what defines me professionally. Working at the intersection of these fields is my aim. This translates into understanding how theoretical approaches deriving from Behavioral Economics and Philosophy of Science can inform social and digital policy. In order to achieve this I remain open to different kinds of opportunities for professional development, both in the private and the public sector.",
