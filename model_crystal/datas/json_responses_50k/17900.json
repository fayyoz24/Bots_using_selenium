    "summary": "As a young boy, I had a natural curiosity and vivid imagination. I remember building castles with Lego, exploring the forest for treasure, or designing my dream home. As a grown-up, curiosity and imagination remained a common thread in my life. This is evident in my study and career choices. I am still passionate about creating solutions, exploring new tech, and crafting immersive stories. These skills also come into play with one of my hobbies: cooking. \n\nTherefore, it is no surprise that I started working in the kitchen during my studies, before kicking off my career as a researcher. For some, these jobs might seem very different, but I strengthened many skills as a chef, from which I later reaped the benefits. Essential skills like multitasking while eyeing pans on the stove, keeping composure in a high-tension environment, teamwork, and integrating customer feedback to improve the overall experience. Analytical skills, communication and creativity compose the core of being a chef, which is also the case for being a marketeer or researcher. \n\n\u2714\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\nI see the big picture and identify patterns, while getting to the core. Take a bird-eye\u2019s view and take different angles to recognize drivers and barriers. As an analyst, I often came across challenging projects, where I helped clients connect the dots and optimize strategy to come out on top of the competition. \n\n\u2714 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\nI have worked in different industries in diverse teams. Effective communication is vital in project management, where I maintained contact with clients, external parties and respondents to secure a smooth project delivery. Moreover, while interviewing I strengthened my skills regarding active-listening, verbal- and non-verbal communication. In total, I have conducted 100+ interviews and focus groups on a wide variety of topics, with people from various social backgrounds. \n\n\u2714 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32\nI like to get my creative juices flowing. In my spare time, I do this by cooking. I experiment and challenge myself by switching up flavors and think about different ways to present. Professionally, I do this by keeping up with new technologies to integrate in research approaches. Immersive storytelling techniques help me to effectively transfer knowledge. People process and store information most effectively in the form of stories. This is something I always keep in mind, whether it is while visualizing key findings in a report or writing an authentic LinkedIn summary.",
