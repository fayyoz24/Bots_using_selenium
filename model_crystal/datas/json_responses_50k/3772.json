Sietsma. During this period, a study was made in the area of non-destructive microstructure observations. For this a range of experimental tools was used to study microstructures, among them electromagnetic measurements (Barkhausen Noise and related techniques), thermal measurements and high energy diffraction using both synchtrotron methods and neutron diffraction. The work dealing with synchrotron diffraction has resulted in a number of measurements on ball bearings that are unique in the world. This has led to a number of publications and presentations in this area.",

For me this was simply unacceptable and therefore I started being a 'Traffic Parent' at the school of one of my daughters (OBS De Distelvlinder). Under the supervision of the national traffic organization 'Veilig Verkeer Nederland' I organized the exam for 2017 together with another parent who joined me. About 200 children from schools in Culemborg participated. The event was a success and we even managed to get exposure in some local and regional newspapers."
