After 20 years of teaching, teaching has become more challenging because how to teach experience? Years of contract research and education all over the world has been of value beyond description. I aim to \"practice what I preach\" and \"preach what I practice\". I hope students recognize this and appreciate a lightness of the joy of science. Due to all auditing, they have less fun then I had in my studies. ",
