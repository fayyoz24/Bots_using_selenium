    "summary": "I am a student in the Master\u2019s programme Humanitarian Action and Conflict at Uppsala University. \n\nThrough working as an intern and temporary staff member for Child Care Africa, a small Dutch Foundation, I gained some experience working in international development. It taught me to come up with creative solutions to the challenges I encountered. I highly value listening, observing and self-reflection, which help me to learn fast from and with others. My bachelor\u2019s degree in International Relations and Organisations from Leiden University taught me to analyse and understand the political dynamics and complexities surrounding humanitarian/ development organisations. \n\nI am committed to working together with affected individuals and communities, listening to and acting on their priorities. In these processes, I emphasise openness and socio-cultural sensitivity.",

CCA supports vulnerable children, such as children with a disability and victims/children at risk of child trafficking, abuse, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. CCA provides these children access to education, healthcare, safe shelter and counselling. Moreover, CCA supports families through sustainable income programmes.
