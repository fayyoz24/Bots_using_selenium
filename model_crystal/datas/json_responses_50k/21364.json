    "summary": "As a business professional with nearly 8 years of experience at DB Schenker, I have extensive knowledge in pricing and solution design for BeNeLux land transport. During my tenure, I handled land transportation tenders and contributed to various projects, in addition to volunteering as an Emergency Response Officer and serving on the Young Schenker Board.\n\nI also worked as a Business Analyst at P&O Ferrymasters, where I handled tenders and was responsible for client communication and analysis. My experience at Villaxl.com and AanZee.com as a Financial Employee helped me understand the importance of maintaining accounts payable/receivable and tracking payments.\n\nThroughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to excellence, as evidenced by my Bachelor's degree in Business Economics from the University of Applied Sciences INHolland, as well as my pre-bachelor's degree in International trade and wholesale from ROC Nova College. \n\nI am a dedicated team player with excellent Logistics Management skills (verbal & written), with keen eye for detail, good problem solving skills and analytical abilities. Combined with a strong desire to learn and grow professionally.",
