    "summary": "Dynamic, Team oriented, Passionate about getting things done.\n\nI am a Global Health Advocate at Wemos with an international background and am passionate about human rights and equitable access to medicines and health.\n\nCurrently, I am working to increase equal access to health care for all individuals on the basis of human rights. My specialisations lie in intellectual property rights, sexual reproductive health rights and health system strengthening and financing. \n\nWithin my Health Law Master, my focus areas are Intellectual property, affordability and access to health services for vulnerable populations. During my studies in European Law Bachelor in Maastricht with Honours I gained practical legal expertise, leadership skills and 21st century soft skills. In paralel, I completed the dutch minor, enabling me to obtain civil effect in the Netherlands and qualify as an Advocaat (lawyer). \n\nIn March 2019 I co-founded a registered charity association with the purpose of supporting the education costs of the Makungu Care home in Kenya.\n\nContact me if you want to chat about common interests, engagements and skills!",
