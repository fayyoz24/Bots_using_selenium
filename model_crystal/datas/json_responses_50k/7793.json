The assessment documented long-standing irregularities and inequities in land and property rights; economic marginalization of resident communities; and conflict between communities and stakeholders, undermining resource management and economic opportunities. The assessment provided recommendations for specific program interventions from which the Securing Rights to Land and Natural Resources for Biodiversity and Livelihood in Kiunga-Boni-Dodori Reserves and Surrounding Areas in North Coastal Kenya (the SECURE Project) was born.",
