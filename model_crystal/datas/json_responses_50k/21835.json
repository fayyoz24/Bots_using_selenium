    "summary": "A self-motivated and innovative individual with an excellent track record of initiating and managing research on materials development and device prototyping. I specialize in the field of Energy Conversion and Storage, Water electrolysis, 3d porous electrodes, Organic/inorganic nanocomposite and Intermetallic Materials, Microstructural and Electrochemical characteristics, optimization, and structure-property correlations. \nMy current research is focused on designing and fabricating nano-/micro-architectured 3d porous electrodes for highly efficient large-scale water electrolysis. I have expertise in various materials development and testing using a range of techniques such as sol-gel, electrochemical deposition, ball-milling/mechanical alloying, powder processing, nanocomposite, hot-compaction, and sintering. \nI have hands-on experience with X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, EBSD, EDS, SAED, CBED), magnetometry (VSM, SQUID, PPMS), calorimetry (DSC, TGA), and electrochemical (EIS, voltammetry) characterization techniques.\nI have led and managed scientific projects, established international collaborations, and taught and trained bachelor's and master's degree students. My scientific accomplishments are evident in 12 publications as the first author and a contribution of over 20 abstracts in international conferences.",
