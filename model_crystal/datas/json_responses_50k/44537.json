            "description": "Batik is a majestic cultural heritage of Indonesia that is believed has been around for more than five hundred years and became popular since eighteenth century. When producing batik, traditional methods are still used, such as using sunlight to dry out the fabric and to activate the color contained in Indigosol substance, a dye substance widely used in batik industry. Hence, in rainy season the production capacity decreases from 30% to 50% according to many Batik Producer.\n\nIn 2015, it was found out that the specific part of sunlight spectrum that is responsible for the color activation in Indigosol substance is the UV ray which means the need of sunlight can be substituted by the use of UV LED. This principle was then employed to design and build a machine called Batik Photonic Machine. Over the course of designing and building this machine, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) guidance published by Kemenristekdikti RI was applied to make sure that the machine would suit the consumer\u2019s needs and would be more prepared to be used by Batik Producer. One of the main and vital features of this machine is the ability to produce batik fabric with industrial standard dimension which is 2m x 1,2m automatically and has been proven through several conducted tests. In order to accommodate such task, the machine was equipped with a conveyor made of 1,2m wide polyurethane and set in motion by a 150 watt induction motor. On the upper-side, a panel contained with 96 LED UV was set to irradiate the fabric. An electric panel was provided to regulate power originated from the Mains. To control the whole system and to simplify the operation, a control panel was also built. Comparing the Photonic Batik Machine technology development, it can be concluded that this technology has obtained the seventh level of TRL which means that the technology is getting closer to the final design and the LRIP (low rate initial production) can be initiated.\n",
