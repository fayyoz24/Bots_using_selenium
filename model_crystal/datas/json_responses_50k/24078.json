    "summary": "I have seven years of working experience in sales and marketing and a bachelor degree with merit in International Business and Management. Five years ago, I have moved from the other side of the world to live with my Kiwi-Partner here, in New Zealand. I have a New Zealand permanent resident visa and a valid driver\u2019s license. \n\nI have always been of curious nature and drawn to innovation, different cultures and new places. Hence I have lived and enjoyed working in Germany, the Netherlands, Silicon Valley (California, USA) and New Zealand where I have worked in many multicultural teams.\nI am deeply passionate about making the world a better place and futuristic living (IT, technology, plant-based meats, AI etc. ). I enjoy spending lots of time in the outdoors, with my family and traveling. \nMy working style is straight to the point, not wasting time and I like to do things properly. I like to set expectations upfront, set milestones and goals, communicate clearly and get things done. In my experience, clear and honest communication is crucial for any working relationship.\nMy experience lies in all things Business Development Management (BDM), Sales, Relationship Management and Digital Marketing. My skills are a result of working in the field while gaining new skills through online academies like Udacity.com or the HubSpot Academy. I love learning solving problems and learning new things.\n",
