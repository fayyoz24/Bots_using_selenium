    "summary": "My primary interest is working in multidisciplinary fields at the intersection of Electronics, Archaeology, Heritage and Computer Sciences. In the past, I have worked on various embedded systems based projects during my undergraduation in Electronics and Communications Engineering, before delving into Digital Archaeology (a discipline which explores different ways in which technology and the computer sciences could be integrated with archaeological research), specifically the use of AI based image processing applications in remote sensing. I still hold an interest in the use of AI and robotics in archaeological research. \n\nCurrently I work at Pure3D - a project aimed at providing a complete web infrastructure to create, publish, and preserve 3D Scholarship in the fields of Humanities, Art, History, Media, Culture and so on, as a Research Software Developer.",
