    "summary": "I am a System Engineer with experience in a variety of high-tech projects, including optical satellite communications, GNSS signal analysis and receiver design, high accuracy RF measurement systems, and microsatellite missions. I lead projects in the technical sense while enjoying acting as main point of contact between customers and colleague engineers. At the same, driving the design of complex technical systems allows me to be creative and passionate.\n\nMy own main area of technical expertise is combining system engineering principles with knowledge of digital signal analysis, embedded systems and software development in the fields of satellite communications and GNSS. I have led and been part of several projects using experimental, highly accurate RF measurement systems within various disciplines. My operational experience includes all phases of a technical project lifecycle: from preliminary design phases to integration and testing, to operations for a spacecraft.",
