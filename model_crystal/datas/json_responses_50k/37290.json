I did this by coaching, providing feedback, taking assessments and a final evaluation. Coaching students was very instructive, because I was able to share and apply my own knowledge about different marketing models. In addition, I developed a bit of management and leadership by taking the reins myself.",

Our projects in Bhutan made a positive difference in both our education and culture. Bhutan, opened my eyes and heart, the land of happiness."
