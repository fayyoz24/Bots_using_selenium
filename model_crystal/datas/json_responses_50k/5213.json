Furthermore, I would like to invite some feedback from current students and alumni, for example, monthly posts from various perspectives, not only to strengthen the database but to bridge the connections. \n\n2. Improve internal and external networking \nOrganize alumni networking events virtually (distance is not a problem) or in person (food brings the joy of course), meanwhile to collaborate with other board members to activate the inner connections among current students and outbound connections with alumni. This improves the sense of family for students to contribute back to EPHSA in the future.\n\n3. Navigate into the blue sea\nConnect with recent representatives to extend networking opportunities with partner universities. For instance, alumni from Dublin, Shielfield, Granada, Liege, Rennes, Paris, Maastricht, and Krakow would also be considered as part of the human resources, which creates opportunities for future public health collaboration globally."

            "description": "A program with a large population needs a rep to bridge students and teachers or coordinators. \n\nI developed my interpersonal communication skills working with colleagues in my programme, School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science. Every week, I would receive requests from classmates, which need to communicate and confirm with teachers, such as venues, assignments, and even some personal issues. Especially, when it comes to midterm and final exams, I need to check the venue,  content, and requirements with teachers. Sometimes, obviously, the teacher has announced in public, and I will reply with confirmed information patiently. Once, even a colleague who had covid positive test could not join in person. I need to report to teachers, and help her to participate fluently online. When people have disagreements with others, it is time that I should stand out to negotiate with different opinions. I remember vividly, at the end of last semester, I tried to compromise different opinions toward the yearly satisfaction feedback questionnaire.\n\nThis involved emotional intelligence, intercommunication skills, and cultural sensitivity. \n\nWhile working with different people, especially in our programme, from various countries, I always pause before replying to them. However, I can not notice the cultural difference sometimes. For instance, one girl from Africa asked me to tell the teacher that she couldn\u2019t come in person for the reason of being sick. For her, it is a courtesy to let me know. Nevertheless, the teacher regards it as their responsibility for her to inform him herself. This is a personal issue rather than a collective problem. I realized that it is truly a cultural difference or conflict. Hence, I learnt other than a pause, I should ask others for opinions. This helps me make better decisions. Additionally, it is not highly possible to hurt others unintentionally."
