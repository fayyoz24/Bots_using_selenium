    "summary": "I am an entrepreneurial problem-solver, having collaborated with over 5,000 startups. As an investor, I participated in early-stage buy-and-sell-side transactions, assisted startups in acquiring their first customers, and designed products and ventures. As an innovation evangelist, I taught product and business strategy and led large-scale innovation initiatives for governments, corporations, and multilateral organisations.\n\nI ventured into diverse sectors, charting previously uncharted territories, acquiring networks and knowledge along the way, taking significant risks in pursuit of excellence, and establishing myself as a significant player in the face of fierce competition. Whether in Deeptech Healthcare or Agri Supply Chain, I hustled through the 0-to-1 journey. My passions are problem solving, capacity development, enterprise development, and policy.\n\nI enjoy working in unstructured, agile environments, articulating problems, scouting solutions, making sense, observing, and adapting. I am convinced that there is a method to the madness and a case for empathy in business.\n\nIf you have a challenging problem, I can help solve, please contact me at mainak@alumni.harvard.edu.",
