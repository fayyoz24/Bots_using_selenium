    "summary": "I am an engineer by training, educator from heart and a continuous learner by choice. As an early-stage researcher at TU Delft, I examine with classroom teachers how to facilitate children's spatial development and thinking in Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics by applying Design-Based research using crafts or project-based learning activities. \nAs an Education and Technology master's (@LET_Oulu Finland) and Electronics and Communication Engineer, I aim to generate insights from multimodal data to make informed decisions about 'how people learn?'. \nWith over seven years of experience of training teachers in communicating science with low cost / no cost science experiments, I have developed skills in content creation, intervention design, teachers' training, strategic planning, networking, and open education resources.",
