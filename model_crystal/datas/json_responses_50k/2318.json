This report contains recommendations of which the easy to implement points (low hanging fruits) have been implemented immediately. Based on the remaining points, new improvement projects were started.\n\nIn addition to this major improvement project, I was also involved in locating and pragmatically validating possibilities for improvement within the production environment with the aid of data.

I carried out a design project together with my project team from Scotland, Greece and Catalonia. \n\nOur case:\nReal-time air monitoring and alerting plays a major role in protecting citizens with health issues. Since nowadays the air pollution measurements provided are measured by stationary monitoring sites and the measurements are delayed, there is a necessity for a portable device which can sense air pollution levels while alerting the user in real time.\n\nDuring this project we have worked with RSA Scotland for information sharing and Air Monitors UK for the sensors used. Our project team succeeded in developing, producing and testing a portable prototype. We have named this prototype BreatheON. The development of this prototype and the findings of the tests were recorded in a report. This report serves as a basis for the next generation of students to build on.\n\nBesides this design project, I took a number of courses at this university, specifically: Marketing & Finance, Project Management & team working, Operations Management and Communication.",
