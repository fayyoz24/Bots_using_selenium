In three months, the products were launched and in a year already accounted for a share of 10%.\n\u2022\tIn 12 months, I approved the design, machinery, equipment, devices and processes of the new CCE refrigerators factory, current Mabe, millions of dollars investment.\n\u2022\tIn the Technology Area, I sought the continuous improvement of processes and products, with significant financial returns.\n\u2022\tI led a multifunctional group (marketing, product / process engineering, design, quality and production) that, in two months and with a shortage of resources, successfully launched the new line of Dako refrigerators, replacing the CCE line.\n\u2022\tIdealized and implemented a quality information system at the critical points of the production process, which streamlined and increased the reliability of the decisions and also got a greater involvement of all responsible areas.\n\u2022\tFor the development and production of low-energy refrigerators, I have been able to obtain the Procel Energy Efficiency Seal for the last seven years.\n\u2022\tReduced unit freight cost by developing and deploying packaging for the transportation of reclining refrigerators.\n\u2022\tI created and implemented the CCE Electrodomestics operating system, which resulted in systematization, sharing and agility in the decision-making processes.\n\u2022\tAs a Program Manager, having a small team and integrating internal, external vendor resources and other Mabe sites, I deployed 24 new core products in five years.\n\u2022\tLed the development and deployment, in seven months, of a product that went from high consumption to low energy consumption, with Procel Seal. The objective was to participate in the tenders of the energy distributors, who exchanged the high consumption refrigerators used by the population of low income",
