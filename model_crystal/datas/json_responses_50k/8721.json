    "summary": "An ambitious third-year Marketing Management and Honours student with an interest in sales, advertising, and project management. I'm thrilled to announce that I have started a minor program at the University of Amsterdam, diving into the fascinating realm of \"Rethinking Sustainable Societies\". Completed an internship at Mondelez, where I expanded my knowledge of what skills a good manager requires to lead projects and successfully run a company. Strong ability to work effectively both in a team and independently. Able to remain dedicated and motivated while completing tasks. Keen to rise to the occasion and obtain an internship as an undergraduate work placement which will provide me with opportunities for further development and progression. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you and don\u2019t hesitate to contact me in case of any questions.",

After conducting a variety of research, we discovered that especially the older generation struggle to keep up an effective skincare routine as the types of products offered on the market are often overwhelming, complicated to understand, and filled with ingredients that are harmful to sensitive skin. Our mission was to create a handmade balm filled with chemical-free and gentle ingredients which naturally provide the skin, hair, and body with anti-aging benefits and rejuvenating factors. The all-purpose balm takes away the stress of having to deal with dozens of different tubes and pots filled with unreliable skincare products. The all-purpose balm can reliably be used anytime, anywhere. We pride ourselves in fulfilling the needs of our customers, whether it's providing them with glowing skin, voluminous hair, or soft hands. We set ourselves apart from the competition by adding a personalized touch to each of our products, as each is filled by hand, and each purchase comes with a personalized inspirational note. Our customers know that they are in the best hands, with Coco Nucifera.",

We want HEMA to become the store that has it all, for every wish and demand HEMA has a high-quality yet affordable solution. We want people to say that \u201call you need is HEMA\u201d, to fulfill your every need. With this in mind, we created the \u201call-you-need\u201d boxes. The \u201call-you-need\u201d box saves customers from stressing over how to decorate for a holiday, birthday, or dinner party, by supplying the customer with all essential party decor items. When someone is lacking the time to shop for a first baby necessity product or the first day of school items, the \u201call-you-need\u201d box saves you from accidentally forgetting to buy something essential, as all the essentials have been carefully selected by the HEMA team. The \u201call-you-need\u201d box allows for a convenient, effective, and sustainable shopping experience which leaves customers feeling relieved and relaxed for the upcoming event. The boxes come in 3 sizes. The products and packaging are all 100% recyclable or biodegradable. Each box contains all essential HEMA products which one may need alongside one limited edition item which makes the box more desirable. Finally, buying the entire box saves the customers money than if they had to buy each product individually.",
