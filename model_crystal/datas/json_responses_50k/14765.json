    "summary": "My job experience and expertise focuses on the boundary between Development and Operations. In previous functions I have been in either one of these organisations, which is why I feel very much at home in a DevOps team, where SCRUM and Agile are more than buzzwords.\nI get my job satisfaction from thinking up and carrying out solutions for technical challenges, always seeking to find the smartest and most efficient solution. If needed, I can specify the solution in a detailed way, enabling someone else to implement or develop it.\n\nIn my current position I facilitate DevOps teams by providing, operating and innovating for them:\n\u2022 a CI/CD pipeline\n\u2022 a standardised, version-controlled deployment method, in which configuration-as-code is an important pillar\n\nI think of myself as a real team player and feel most comfortable in a team. Outside office hours I also support my fellow team members. I am a great proponent of sharing knowledge and information.\nMy work attitude is typified by the following statements:\n\u2022 \u2018Yes it is possible \u2013 Every technical challenge can be overcome, it is a question of time and means.\n\u2022 \u2018How difficult can it be?\u2019 \u2013 Knowledge and skills gained in ICT can often easily be transferred to a new challenge. One who is familiar with OO programming will be quickly up to steam when starting with Java. I have not come across anything I have not been able to learn.",
