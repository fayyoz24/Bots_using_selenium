    "summary": "I have been with EY for 33 years, of which I served the last 25 years as a partner in the International Tax practice of EY, located at the EY office in Amsterdam. I decided to retire on February 1st, 2022, to focus on supporting my dear wife Hanne Jesca with her fast moving career at EY and be there for my children, Bella, Dexter and Bibi, when they need me. Furthermore I want to contribute to society in the best way I can.\n\nThe years at EY have been super exiting, at times challenging but very rewarding. My motto has always been to bring the best of EY to our clients, acting as one globally integrated team, no matter which region, country, service line, SSLs or competency the resources are located in \u2013 winning in the market and delivering exceptional client services as one EY has always my only sole driver. Over the years I have had the privilege to work together with many wonderful colleagues and clients and EY always gave me the opportunity to initiate, be part of and/or develop new business initiatives, with a few key landmarks:\n \n1988: Starting my career in the international tax practice in Amsterdam, followed by a 5-year rotation to the US; part of the Dutch Desk in New York and subsequently setting up the Dutch Desk in Chicago\n1996 : Being one of the founders of our Global OME offering - formerly known as Tax Effective Supply Chain Management - and leading this practice as part of the TP \u2013 TESCM group in Amsterdam; leading some of the most exiting globally integrated OME transformations \n2009: Establishing OME as one of the first 3 segments in the EMEIA Tax Center when it was established. \n2019: Leading our Agile Tax campaign and the SAP alliance for Tax in EMEIA. Technology in general and SAP in particular has been a totally new \u201cfield of play\u201d for me, which has brought me totally outside of my \u201cOME comfort zone\u201d, but at the same time has given me a lot of new energy and compassion to win for EY in the market. \n \nDriving personal ambitions and team goals with passion, dedication and deep personal interaction with colleagues and clients across the globe based on mutual trust, full transparency and unprecedented team spirit has always given me the energy to achieve the best for EY and our clients. What I have specifically enjoyed in my last role as Agile Tax lead has been to coach our next generation - allowing other people to shine and realize their full potential has been extremely rewarding and is all what counts. I will definitely miss being part of the EY family but look back at a great career and forward to the next chapter!",
