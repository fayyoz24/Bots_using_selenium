    "summary": "Hardworking professional who likes a challenge, with a passion for healthcare and sustainability. \n\nI do not give up easily and have a positive attitude. An excellent example of this is that I had just a vmbo degree in 2016. By working hard, I got a bachelor and master degree. \n\nI am interested in improving and challenging myself. In the past few years, I have done many different things next to my studies. During my bachelor Business Administration, I have worked at the Bedrijfskundewinkel and for the Buddy Program of Radboud University. I have followed extracurricular courses in international relations (Political Science). I have worked different side jobs and did summer school at Maastricht University. Furthermore, I was part of the Student Company program of Radboud University. \n\nI am interested in making organizations more efficient and safe. I have helped doing this for the integral supply chain of VieCuri during my Bachelor. And by combining my master thesis with an internship. My master thesis was about the continuous improvement of care pathways at Zuyderland (grade: 8). Also, I was part of the honours program 2022-2023 of Maastricht University: the PREMIUM excellence program. And I was part of a project team that had the goal to innovate the COPD care pathway of UMC+. This was next to my master Healthcare Policy, Innovation and Management. \n\nSome characteristics that describe me are:\nambitious, determined, goal-oriented, social, independent, creative, analytical, and resilient.\nI am interested in continuous improvement, sustainability,value based healthcare and care pathways.",

I chose to do this job in the United States because I wanted to improve my English and I like to work with children and horses. It was a wonderful experience that taught me a lot. My responsibilities included entertaining the children, ensuring their safety around the horses and in the pool, training the horses that were not yet suitable for the lessons, and providing personalized riding lessons to children who needed a little extra help.",
