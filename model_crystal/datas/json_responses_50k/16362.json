Saturday School: With this project we were looking to reinforce the weekly classes that the children have and teach them that they can learn in a fun way and install in them the love of study so that they can have a better future. Our objective was to decrease the school dropout that is so common in these vulnerable schools. We focused our classes in the English subject but we also taught different subjects such as: Spanish, Math, Art, among others. I coordinated this project and some of my responsibilities were: develop the curricula, coordinate with the school\u2019s director and teachers, establish agreements for our work in their schools, find new schools to implement the project, organize volunteers and students to implement the project. Monitoring and delivering results to directors and parents. \n\n2. Mercy for all: the objective of this project is to distribute perishable and non-perishable food to families living in vulnerable communities. My main role was to coordinate students and volunteers so they could benefit from this experience. \n\n3. My house is your house: This project benefits indigenous groups and vulnerable families in Nuevo Leon that do not have the resources to build their own homes. My role was to coordinate national and foreign volunteers. \n\n- Designed and implemented a project to empower young girls through researching female and spreading that knowledge to other girls.  \n- Led the national and foreign volunteered program.",
