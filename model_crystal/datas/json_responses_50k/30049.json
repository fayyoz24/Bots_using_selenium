The use of turbocharger to the engine improves the torque aspect of 2 litre engine, but the performance of the turbocharger is poor at low engine speeds. The aim of the study was to investigate the use of an electric supercharger to reduce turbolag at low engine speeds and fuel economy of the turbocharged  2 litre engine to that of 4 litre engine. An electric supercharger was designed and integrated in SIMULINK with a 2 litre turbocharged engine car to match the torque with 4 litre engine. An integrated Matlab model with System Modelling process is provided for\nvalidation. The output results from this integrated model suggest that it is possible to reduce turbolag and improve fuel economy in a turbocharged 2 litre engine with an electric supercharger. ",

            "description": "This research presents an innovative approach for surge detection of an electric driven\ncompressor. Compressor control algorithms and control system interactions are a retrofit that\nhelps to improve operations and move out of surge to prevent breakdown in the compressor.\nFor a given speed, the point at which the flow and pressure ratio, an operation of the\ncompressor becomes unstable is called surge. Surge causes momentary reversal of flow\nwhere the pressure of the discharge system is reduced. Surge cycles repeat until the discharge\npressure increases again allowing the compressor to resume delivering flow. Nowadays surge\nis controlled by anti-surge control system.  However the\nprocess of anti-surge control appears to be simple, it needs an algorithm to detect surge and\nopen the anti-surge valve accordingly. The main objective of the project is to create an\nalgorithm that can detect as fast as possible if the compressor is operating in the surge area\nbased on sensor input. In order to prevent the compressor moving into surge region, the\nproposed algorithm detects the compressor surge, based on measuring the DC current. When\nsurge is detected, surge can be prevented further in the compressor by decreasing the motor\nspeed. The process continues to avoid moving the values beyond the surge points. Surge\noccurrence in a compressor is related to a function of the mass flow and pressure ratio of a\nturbocharging system. The function of the mass flow and pressure ratio is directly\nproportional to the current drawn by the electric motor in an electric driven compressor.\nBased on the current, the algorithm is made and tested based on measurements in Matlab and\nSimulink model is developed to impelement the algorithm in dSPACE systems. Results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for surge detection\napproach.\n",
