    "summary": "Marhaba (welcome in Arabic)! I am Nayla, originally from Lebanon, born in Beirut \nwhere I have lived until the age of 16. Thereafter, I moved to Montreal, Canada with my family where I completed my studies at McGill University. I discovered my passion for teaching while working as a consultant, trainer, and project manager at various international companies in Canada, the U.S. and Europe. In 1999, I moved to Amsterdam. Three years later I started the language institute \u201cMaster Arabic\u201d, achieving my dream of combining my passion for teaching with my culture and background. Since then, I have the privilege of teaching hundreds of Dutch and foreign students the Arabic language and culture. \nMy school offers courses for 3 months, 3 times a year, for 6 different levels from 'Absolute Beginners' to 'Advanced', as well as our own practical lesson material (books and audio) available for purchase also non-students. We have recently launched an app in the app store called 'learnarab' for beginners, and we have started offering courses for children.\nMore information on: www.leerarabisch.nl or imasterarabic.com",
