    "summary": "I am a civil systems engineer working at the railway design department of Movares. My daily activities include the detailed design of railway sections, as well as the automation of design processes.\n\nIn July 2018 I graduated my master study Mechanical Engineering, track design engineering. I concluded my master in the topic of SLM printing porous metal structures. In January 2016 I have graduated my bachelor's in Advanced Technology after completing my bachelor's assignment at the Additive manufacturing group at the university of Twente.\n\nNext to my study I have organised a study trip to Japan together with 16 other Advanced Technology students. Our goal there was to see what technologies are currently developed in Japan and how this differs from the Netherlands. For our association this is the first time we organize a study trip like this, so we run into a lot of challenges.\n\nDuring my study I have been active as a full-time board member of the study assiciation Astatine as Commisioner of Education. I have also been active in the educational committee of Advanced Technology and the Faculty committee of the Science and Technology faculty.",
