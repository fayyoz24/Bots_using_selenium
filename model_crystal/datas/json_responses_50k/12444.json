    "summary": "Passionate about the ongoing transition, energy governance and resource management, I strive to learn from those around me and advocate for the betterment of our environment. \n\nUndergraduate in International and European Law at the University of Groningen and daughter of multicultural parents I have grown up in an international environment where I view the world in all its richness in colors. Experienced in permaculture and training in the application of biomimetics I wish to recenter our focus on the living and the importance of inter-species collaboration. I wish to make law a more interdisciplinary study where we incorporate more scientific reasoning and answer to our contemporary challenges triggered by climate change. It is important to highlight that this is \"change\" in order to remind ourselves that we are a highly adaptable specie. I hope to engage more and more of the international community and all the actors it so englobes in the cause that is the global commons, biodiversity and the respect of fundamental human rights. \n\nThese ambitions are fed by my unquenched curiosity for the world. There is a need to observe, question and understand elements that surround us, in order to assure cooperation and interconnectedness.",
