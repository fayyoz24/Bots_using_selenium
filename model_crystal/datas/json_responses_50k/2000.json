            "description": "In the London Communiqu\u00e9, the mutual recognition of accreditation and quality assurance decisions, and a significant increase in the number of joint programmes were encouraged. The TEAM II project aimed to combine both objectives and take away accreditation and recognition barriers for joint programmes. It did so (1) by facilitating single accreditation procedures for joint programmes; (2) by analysing current cross-border recognition practises and (3) by offering transparent information on the quality assessment and learning outcomes of joint programmes.",
