Therefore music education is essential for every child.\n\nIt turns out that in practice not every child is able to follow music lessons. One of the reasons may be the costs. From 2010, FluXus centrum voor de kunsten has launched a project bringing the music education to primary schools as part of the normal curriculum. Music enriches the lives of many young children. \n\nThe project started in 2010 with 4 primary schools in Poelenburg. Soon, more schools joined the project and more schools are expected to follow in the coming years. Our aim is to eventually reach all children in the 54 primary schools of Zaanstad.",
