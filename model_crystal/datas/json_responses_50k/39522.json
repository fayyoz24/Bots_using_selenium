    "summary": "My name is Martina Dumbarova and my passion is Graphic and Web Design. I have graduated with honors Master degree in GRAPHIC DESIGN, MULTIMEDIA AND ILLUSTRATION. During my 13 years work experience in different positions I improved my skills related to DTP and creative projects and also gained basic knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, WordPress, PHP, SQL, JavaScript. \n\nIn July 2022 I decided to start an adventure in learning more about the development processes, which stand behind Websites and Mobile Apps. I started several short HBO programs in The Netherlands. I learned more about Front-End Development, gained knowledge of Scrum working processes and also did the first steps in Programming with Python. All the courses I finished successfully, even earlier than the programs required. I was proud to prove in front of myself and my future dutch employer that the Dutch language is not a barrier I can not jump over. \nCurrently, I am following the short HBO program at LOI in User Research. Next to it, I was looking for more depth but also expansion. The Traineeship Application/Software Engineering at Educom was a logical next step for me. I am very happy I may continue to develop myself and I am sure that with my hard work and strong motivation in combination with the expert support of Educom, I will be trained as a professional Software Engineer.\n\nI must confess - this whole professional transformation (makeover), I dived into, looks like a real roller coaster. Not only because of the fast speed, but also because it brings me a lot of joy, positive attitude and even stronger motivation and desire to succeed. \n\nIf I have to describe my personality I can say that the design in all its forms flows in my veins. There is always an idea running through my head - ideas about a fresh looking layout for a website or an app, ad concept, innovative products to handcraft during the weekend and use at home, ideas for thousands of handmade products to make someone happy. \n\nShortly\u2026 CREATING TO FASCINATE AND TO COMMUNICATE - that\u2019s what I do at work and also in my hobby projects. I always work with great desire to provide the best solutions for every client. You can count on me for a competent way of work and professional production. In my spare time you can see me always holding a wood burning pen developing the next product in the range of www.vanhout.art.\n\nRegarding my personal strengths I am a responsible, highly motivated person with an inquiring mind.\nAREN\u2019T YOU LOOKING FOR SUCH A TEAM PLAYER?",
