Designed and implemented a full-stack BFF monorepo solution using React, NestJS, GraphQL and Lerna to enable an event driven architecture via GraphQL subscriptions.\n* web subscription service based on Angular and Firebase for HEMA. Designed and implemented the whole infrastructure on Google Cloud with related CI/CD, developed multiple express middlewares based on Firebase Cloud Function to communicate with multiple REST APIs (e.g. auth, delivery, direct debit payments) and implemented the frontend experience including the payment integration with Adyen. \n* app development for ING by using with Ionic, Angular, GraphQL, Firebase and RoR. The tech focus of the app was in the real-time chat working with GraphQL subscriptions.\n* leading frontend development for a web application based on Angular + NGRX developed for Zwitserleven, having the main goal to visualize multiple pension scenarios via d3 charts. The company frontend was entirely based on AngularJS, so I introduced and instructed all the developers in the company to Angular. I also introduced Storybook in the organization, which played a key role in the migration process;\n* developed a mobile app with React Native for Hely, a successful startup in the mobility business;\n* developed an internal tool to speed up a landing page and experiment creation, based on React, Google Cloud and Lerna. The tool is based on atomic components in React, which can be reused in multiple projects living in the same mono repository. By giving some data in the CLI, it takes nothing to have a new landing page live on the Google Cloud Platform;\n* the popular Colormate sketch plugin, developed with React, used to organize and clean up colors in a Sketch project",
