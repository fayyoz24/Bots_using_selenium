The organisation also provides vocational training to women in poverty there. In 2017, I had the opportunity to conceptualise and create 2 ad-film campaigns for the NGO. These films showcased the real stories of two children and their journeys of struggle to access a basic need: education . \n\nThe central aim of these films is to help viewers realise that if these children can walk long distances to go to school every day, why don't we take them further since we have the means to? These ad films were played during multiple fairs where I-India merchandise was being sold and was effective in directing consumer traffic to the stalls.\n\nSince then, I have been working with the I-India global concern club within my school and to date have helped raise over $6,000 through various fundraisers and awareness campaigns. I was the Head of Publicity for 2 years and became Chair in my last year there."

Here, women from rural villages all around the world come to become solar engineers via a 6-month training. These women then return to their respective villages to teach their community about how to construct basic solar-powered appliances such as torches, lamps, and solar cookers. During my time at Barefoot College, I had the opportunity to document and photograph the efforts within this 'Solar Mamas' programme. I also interviewed multiple women to better understand their perceptions of sustainability and individual motivations to educate their village communities."
