    "summary": "As an engineer at VDL ETG I work on cryogenic and superconducting technologies to increase the knowledge of implementing these in industry and possible design improvements of present day applications with new insights. Furthermore, I carried out performance tests at high precision machinery and designed CE approved tools for the production factory.\n\nBefore this job at VDL I studied Applied Physics at the University of Twente, where the focus lied on understanding the problem and solution oriented thinking. My master specialization was in the material science area; among other things cryogenic and superconducting science. \nBesides my study I did board work as chairman and other work as volunteer.",
