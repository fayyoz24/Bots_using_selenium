As a Proposition Manager Loyalty & eCommerce and a concept/format developer, I love coming up with and realizing something new. But I can be as enthusiastic about great incremental change.\n\n\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25. \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d. \nI also enjoy not doing things. I believe we should not do everything we can think of.

I trust my colleagues' expertise and foster a positive environment for experimentation and learning within my cross-functional teams. \n\n\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a. \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a. \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a. \nI love data analysis; getting a better understanding of how customers interact with our product or changes in behavior in our market.
