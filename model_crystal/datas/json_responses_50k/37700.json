    "summary": "Researcher, based at the Institute for Criminology and Sociology of Law (IKRS) at the University of Oslo.  I have expertise in people-centred and practice-oriented (forced) migration research, humanitarian innovation and gender and intersectionality. \n\nExpert on Jordan and the Middle Eastern refugee protection context. Experience in migration research within and from the African continent (Niger, Zimbabwe, Sudan and Mali). \n\nI am highly skilled in diverse research techniques, some quantitative but in particular qualitative techniques (focus group discussions, participatory action research, visual methods, discourse analysis and content and textual analysis of media texts). I am inspired by feminist and decolonising pedagogical practices. \n\nEfficient, innovative, dedicated, excellent communicator to different audiences (academics, donors, beneficiaries, students).

The thesis drew upon ethnographic research and considered the interplay between living in prolonged legal and social uncertainty and media-use. I argue conflict-affected migrants should be considered as digital connected but also points to the importance for caution for a too celebratory stance towards the \u2018newness\u2019 of digital connections and innovation. Online and offline interpretations of uncertainty in the present occur in reference to the past which includes one\u2019s (prior) socio-historical positioning and in continuation of (neo)colonial, capitalist and patriarchal entanglements. \n\nAs a Graduate Research Assistant I organised workshops and two international conferences, was editor of the postgraduate peer-reviewed journal of the School of Media, Communication and Sociology, was the PhD-representative and helped my PhD-supervisors (Prof. Dr. Leah Bassel and Prof. Dr. Helen Wood) with literature review and some coding and data-analysis for their respective work.",
