    "summary": "In search for a challenging position in the field of food technology, as product developer, R&D scientist or, in specification management or quality assurance.    \n\nI have used the remainder of this section as a window into me, a food scientist passionate about food technology, R&D, food product design, developing sustainable products, and human physiology. During my masters I gained a broad set of skills, in product design, ingredient functionality, food quality and process engineering, where I specialized in product design.\n \nFurthermore, I gained knowledge in human physiology, originating from my interest in gastrointestinal digestion of food products. I believe that the link between production processes and chemical and physical properties of foods with its digestive properties, is very important to characterize and improve nutritional properties of food products. \n\nIt is my passion and goal to improve and increase consumer health and nutrition, via (new) product design. I believe that innovation should be the base for this.\n\nI would summarize my professional profile with the following key words: \n \nEnergy: I act with effectiveness to deliver goals, ensuring progress, working with natural gentle manners, respectfulness, and attention to quality and to people. I work hard in a scientific and result oriented fashion, and won\u2019t miss a deadline or meeting (don\u2019t worry, I can also be flexible).  \n\nResponsibility: I can work independently, take ownership of the tasks and of the project I am working on, whilst ensuring that advice and feedback is taken into the right consideration. I value feedback and am willing to learn and improve my professional skills. \n\nTeam player: I enjoy working in multicultural and multidisciplinary teams and can be an added value by building a collaborative team spirit. Working in cross-functional, multicultural teams result in interesting discussions, which I enjoy, and allows me to broaden my knowledge in areas other than my own expertise. \n\n",

Although, the products processed where completely different, I found that experiences gained were also relevant in food processing and food factory/pilot plant way of working. \n\nAs production worker, I worked in rotating shifts.",
