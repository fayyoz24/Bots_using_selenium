    "summary": "Hi!\n\nI'm Michiel Nijk. Since we're all busy, here's some info about me in bird's eye view:\n\n\nEducation\n\nI was born in Amsterdam, but grew up in Heerhugowaard, a town near Alkmaar in Holland. I went to high school in Alkmaar, and subsequently to University in Amsterdam.\n\n- Murmellius Gymnasium, gymnasium B, Alkmaar\n- Propedeuse Biologie, Universiteit van Amsterdam\n\n\nNovels\n\nI didn't finish my molecular biology studies. When I was in my third year, my first science fiction novel was published. Iron must be cast when it's hot, so I stopped studying, and threw myself on writing.\n\n- De Heersers van Kant, Luitingh Sijthoff, 1995\n- Vrije Val, Luitingh Sijthoff, 1997\n\n\nProgramming\n\nI've always programmed computers, although not always as prolifically as during the past decade. I'm self taught, which, in my view, has both an upside and a downside. The upside - every new task you can force a computer to perform is a magical accomplishment. The downside - self tuition is a lot more time consuming than being taught.\n\nI've mastered the following languages:\n\n- .Net (vb.net, c#,  Aspx)\n- Java \n- JavaScript\n- SQL (I don't consider this 'a language' but I've mastered it just the same)\n\nI'm very experienced in the following programming fields:\n\n- IP connection code\n- Networking code in the broadest sense \n- Database code (Active Directory , Azure, OpenLDAP, Oracle, Microsoft SQL)\n- Serialization code\n- Code refactoring\n- Unmanaged code\n\nSome of the software applications I've developed:\n\n- Logon Analyzer, http://www.LogonAnalyzer.com\n- Aduc Admin +,  http://www.aducadmin.com\n- Database Comparer,  http://www.databasecomparer.com\n\n\nMy motto\n\nObject oriented programming is object oriented programming. What I don't yet master, I will in a month or so. I've never come across a problem I couldn't solve.\n\nGreetings!\nMichiel",
