    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my LinkedIn profile. My name is Stevin Treurniet.\n\nI established my own company \"Drs. T \u2013 Project Management & Consultancy\" to advise companies and organisations and to  lead or contribute to projects. My creative and problem solving skills and experience in (digital) communication, project management and business development can bring significant added value.\n\nMy working experience consists of a 30-year career at the life Sciences and Materials company DSM and a position as Project Manager at Maastricht University where I worked for the Maastricht University Medical Centre+.\n\nAt DSM I had positions in various disciplines such as R&D, HR, Communication and Marketing, exploiting my technical background as a chemist, my MBA and my great affinity with networking and communication.\n\nSince 2000 my focus has been on digital communication and digital marketing. I was responsible for the selection and implementation of a new worldwide digital platform for the DSM organisation. My digital involvement started when I was the first employee of the Corporate eBusiness Centre. I have played a key role in creating adoption and developing and disseminating best-practices. I am particularly proud of identifying, initiating and management DSM\u2019s investment in the electronic marketplace ChemConnect in 2000. After that I was responsible for DSM.com at DSM Corporate Communications.\n\nAs Corporate Spokesman at DSM Corporate Public relations in 1997-1999 I wrote press releases, answered press questions, organized press conferences.\n\nAs Business Development Manager I was actively scouting for acquisition opportunities for DSM Fine Chemicals, included visiting acquisition candidates worldwide and being a member of due diligence teams.\n\nAs Recruitment Officer at DSM Corporate Human Resources I was responsible for recruitment of academic personnel in R&D.\n\nWould you like to connect with me?\nEmail: s@drs-t@nl\nMobile: +31 6 2388 0799",
