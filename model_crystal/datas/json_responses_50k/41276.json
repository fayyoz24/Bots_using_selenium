    "summary": "I studied Cultural Anthropology at the Radboud University in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) and specialized in Medical Anthropology at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. My research interests cover issues related to reproductive health, uncertainties, and decision-making. For my MA, I studied ideas and practices around pregnancy loss and induced abortion in eastern Cameroon. After (cum laude) graduation in August 2005, I completed the Research Masters in African Studies at Leiden University, while I also worked as a supervisor of BA theses at Radboud University. \n\nIn September 2006, I started my Ph.D. trajectory at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Resarch (AISSR) of the University of Amsterdam. My Ph.D. research built upon my MA research in Cameroon. It addressed the experiences and decision-making processes around reproductive loss. I defended my thesis (cum laude) in November 2011. \n\nThe next decade saw me employed as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam. In 2012, I received a VENI grant (\u20ac250,000) from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) for a self-designed post-doctoral research project on reproductive health, loss, uncertainty, and decision-making in Central Romania. In addition, between October 2016 and July 2017, I coordinated an evaluation project for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assessing the effectiveness of a number of (inter)national programmes targeting sexual and reproductive health issues all over the world.\n\nCurrently, I work as a Research Fellow at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD). The research I am involved in concerns self-care practices in the domain of sexual and reproductive health, and has been developed in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).   \n\nOver the last 15 years, I have also taught different medical anthropological courses in the Netherlands and abroad - including at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the Netherlands School of Public and Occupational Health (NSPOH), the GGD Academy, and Samenlevingsacademie.\n\nOverall, my professional life is filled with activities related to research and analysis, writing and publishing, as well as teaching and supervision.

In this self-designed post-doc research project (funded by NWO), I critically investigate the diachronic and synchronic dynamics of reproductive perceptions and practices in Central Romania. I do so by studying, within a historical-ethnographic framework, the different fertility events (e.g., pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, and infertility) in the lives of Romanian women born before, during, and after communism.",

It illuminates the ways in which Gbigbil women deal with, and make decisions around, pregnancy loss. Different forms of fertility interruption - such as infertility, miscarriages, stillbirths, perinatal and neonatal deaths, but also induced abortion and fertility regulation - are pervaded by ambiguity in Cameroon. The cause, underlying intentions, and consequences of such incidents are often unclear. My thesis describes how women give meaning and direction to these contested happenings; it shows that women's reproductive decisions are related to their network of social relationships, their individual ambitions, and the workings of their material bodies. This complexity of reproductive decision-making is often ignored in scientific debates on fertility in Africa and sheds new light on common notions of reproductive intentionality, choice and control that inform much of the contemporary reproductive health discourse. Different findings from my Ph.D. research have been published in Social Science & Medicine, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, Culture, Health & Sexuality, Medical Anthropology, Sociology of Health & Illness, and Anthropology & Medicine.",
