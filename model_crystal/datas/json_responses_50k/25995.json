    "summary": "Alexey Y. Kovalgin obtained the M.Sc. degree in Physics in 1988 and the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Materials Technology in 1995. Since 1997 he has been working at the Chair of Semiconductor Components, University of Twente. His fields of expertise include Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Plasma Enhanced CVD, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), Hot-wire ALD, growth and investigation of 2D materials (silicene, graphene), properties of ultra-thin (metallic) films, chemical modelling of plasma reactors containing silane, semiconductor device fabrication at low temperatures; CMOS post-processing, contact resistance of metal-to-semiconductor junctions, and low-power hot-surface silicon devices for chemical sensors and micro-reactors. He has contributed to over 160 reviewed international journal and conference papers.\n\nProf. Kovalgin has been a reviewer of 24 international journals, leader of 7 scientific projects, member of the editorial board of The Open Electrical & Electronic Engineering Journal, Journal of Recent Patents on Electrical Engineering, jury member of STW VENI 2010 program and two Open Technology Programs (NL), international jury member of Romanian Evaluation Process in 2012, International Board Member of EUROCVD conference and Technical Program Committee member of ICMTS conference. He is the main lecturer of 2 Master courses at the University of Twente, and is strongly involved into the Problem-Based Learning approach since last 2 years.",
