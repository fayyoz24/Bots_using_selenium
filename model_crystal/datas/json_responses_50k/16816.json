While green areas are known to contribute to improved health and well-being of residents, there may also be a less positive effect to the greening of neighborhoods.  Worldwide such initiatives have been shown to lead to green gentrification. Green gentrification refers to the displacement of low-income families and small companies as a result of greening initiatives. \n\nGreen gentrification is often associated with environmental justice: having equal access and/or exposure to environmental goods and bads, regardless of race, origin, or socio economic status. Most prior research about environmental justice in the Netherlands  has focused on the distribution of environmental disadvantages, such as exposure to air pollution, rather than the benefits such as access to urban green areas.\n\nThe aim of this study is to explore to what extent green gentrification occur in the Netherlands. We investigated whether green gentrification causes environmental injustice. In some occasions, environmental injustice is known as a precursor leading to social inequity in cities.\nWe defined underlying mechanisms of the process of green gentrification, which is elaborated by three case study neighbourhoods (Amsterdam, Arnhem & Amersfoort). Neighbourhoods were selected based on the recent increase in average income and greening initiatives. In-depth interviews were conducted with residents, local experts and civil servants of the municipality.\n\nWe concluded that green gentrification is occurring in the Netherlands, but does not cause environmental injustice to the extent seen in foreign cities, such as New York or Berlin. Gentrification can be triggered by actual greening and as a result of an increase in \u2018green\u2019 awareness amongst residents. We did not find any evidence concerning intentional gentrification in the urban planning of municipalities. \n",
