    "summary": "I am passionate about being a third culture person. I have never lived in a country for more than 6 years (except for the Netherlands) and have been moving every 3-5 years from country to country all my life until I started studying. Coming across bountiful differences in diverse cultures and having the possibility in making many connections and friends has given me a broad environmental and social awareness and a unique experience. The countries I have lived in include Ghana, Bangladesh, Sudan, Oman and now the Netherlands. I am extremely passionate about sustainability and renewable energy, supported by the completion of my bachelors in Innovation Sciences and masters in Sustainable Energy Technology. I am eager to learn, willing to approach challenges, and  I have the ability and experience to work with people from across borders; an excellent team player.",

This year it was organized for three weeks to Brazil, for a total of 24 students and 2 supervisors, visiting diverse cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia & Sao Paulo, along with seeing and meeting various cultural places and people. My role, as chairman, was to lead a group of 8 into finding enough case studies for each participant that would join the trip, being in charge of planning, being involved in the financial status and program throughout the organisation and during the trip, encouraging adequate promotion for the trip, and being involved in the control committee that would check and give permission for certain decisions made by the committee throughout the process. In order to find sufficient case studies, connections and contact had to be made with diverse companies related to our studies. This was the most challenging and rewarding part of my experience as it allowed me to get in touch with certain companies and learn how to develop a manner of communication in which case studies and other rewarding activities could be achieved.  All in all, this experience has allowed me to grow as a leader, as a person and as a hard working co-worker who appreciates a challenge.",
