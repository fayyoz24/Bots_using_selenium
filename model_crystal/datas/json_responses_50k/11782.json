These cameras yield enormous streams of data and provide the means for communication, observation, and interaction. Understanding visual data remains a challenge and it is this challenge addressed by the computer vision (CV) group.\n\nThe mission of the CV group is to research on core computer vision technologies and in particular color processing, 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and human-behavior analysis. The aim is to provide theories, representation models and computational methods which are essential for image and video understanding.",
