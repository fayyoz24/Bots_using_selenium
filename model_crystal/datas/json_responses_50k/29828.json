By calculating the energy of the pixels, the program uses topological sort to connect a vertical or horizontal seam of low-energy pixels and removes it. Contrary to cropping and scaling, seam carving preserves the most interesting features of the image such as objects and aspect ratio and removes the least interesting features.",

WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. WordNet also describes semantic relationships between synsets. My program implemented a digraph to store all the hypernyms and thus create the conceptual digraph which was used to calculate the shortest common ancestor and outcast. It also implemented a hashmap that takes in a String and an iterable Bag Integer in order to pass in the synsets as strings and their ids into the bag and another hashmap which mapped Integer to string in order to store and retrieve ids to synsets. To find the shortest common ancestor, my program used 2 breadth first directed Paths going through the digraph to every vertex and edge. It calculated the shortests path by going through all the vertices and if both directed paths existed to the specified vertex, the two distances were added. We then calculated the ancestors in the same way by choosing the shortest distance.\n",
