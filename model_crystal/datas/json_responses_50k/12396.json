    "summary": "My greatest passion and strengths are community building, (academic) program curation and project management, particularly in the field of international educational exchange and female international business relations. I\u2019ve built two successful brands around those passions (Amsterdam Academy and Spark). I have a proven track record of building successful teams, both pre and post-pandemic. My mission is to support women in their career paths, help young adults with intercultural learning, and promote life-long learning through knowledge-sharing and face-to-face contact. \n\nI'm available as a freelance or interim project manager, program curator, community builder (HR/team building), and copywriter. A Renaissance woman with strong people skills. Let me know how I can best support you. Email: hannah@amsterdamacademy.com\n\nDuring the pandemic I wrote and published a novel called Place, a story about finding one\u2019s home in the world while being mobile. This book can be purchased on www.amsterdamacademy.com. Ebook is available on Barnes & Noble and Kobo.",
