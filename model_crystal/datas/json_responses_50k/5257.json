Our solution, called the Switch, would optimise the use of existing infrastructure and give priority to sustainable transport such as bicycles. This would reduce the need for new roads and thus save a lot of resources, furthermore it would benefit sustainable transport and would be flexible and applicable where needed in the everchanging and growing urban environment."
