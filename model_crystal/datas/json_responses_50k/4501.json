I focussed on the world's most pressing complex global challenges on a social, economic and ecological level with human dignity and development as a centred theme. By an interdisciplinary and systems approach through various segments of human societies\u2014encompassing the politics of world hunger, North-South relations, the environmental crisis and intergroup conflicts (East-West dichotomies, minority, gender and indigenous issues) in relation to social change and sustainable development processes, human rights, restorative justice, leadership development & organizational change, conflict resolution and peace-building I participated in integral crash courses to understand various geographies worldwide on a deeper level. Consequently, I worked on a grassroots level for Community-Based-Organizations and NGOs in the respective countries and generated engaged knowledge that was informed by the contextual social policy mechanisms within the field. \n\nThese learning experiences inspired my personal leadership development to shape a larger vision. Together with peers as emerging leaders and impact agents within the Millennial generation and mutual mentors as existing (seasoned) leaders sector-wide, I strive to contribute to the paradigm shifts of our time in the way we lead, learn, collaborate, do business and design organizations to tackle the most pressing challenges across generations, sectors and disciplines. In this way, I strive to bring together a cohesive intergenerational value-driven world community. Hereby the focus is on individuals who centre their personal leadership development for committed action in their direct personal and professional communities to work towards synergized collaboration for a more just, thriving and sustainable world in the 21st century.",
