To solve this issue, the applicability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is explored, tackling the problem at the image level. The results of the SEM image denoising model (SEMD) are presented and compared with the state-of-art predictions, showing the effectiveness and enhanced performance of the SEMD method.",

            "description": "One of the really hot trends in machine learning at the moment is automated machine learning, or automl. There are several tools, open source and commercial, e.g. H2O that are focusing on this. The key idea behind this movement, and the tools in question, is that once we have data prepared for modeling (and remember, this can often constitute a resource-intensive task that is difficult to avoid) we often follow a scripted procedure of preparing training and test sets, trying out different models, tuning these models with methods such as cross-validation and then comparing these models to pick the final results. Up till now, this has usually involved training models sequentially by hand, and then manually issuing commands to begin training the next model etc\u2026 We are now moving to a phase where a lot of the repetitive work that we have been doing as data scientists is beginning to be automated.\n\nWith that in mind, the objective of this assignment is to introduce you to this exciting field and mode of work in what we believe to be the best way possible \u2013 by actually building your own automl system in Python. This may sound scary, especially for those of you who have not had extensive experience in programming before, but this assignment will walk you through the entire process.",

The dataset used for this assignment contains California\u2019s road networks and points of interest. To be more precise the dataset consists of crossroads, roads connecting one crossroad to another and points of interest which are located in the road network. Each road may contain from none to several points of interest. For this project purposes we transformed the dataset, we designed and created a graph database, we then loaded the dataset into the graph and finally we performed queries in order to answer specific questions. In this report we will describe in more detail the procedure which was mentioned above.\n\nDataset\nWe used an open source dataset provided by the University of Utah.

The Human Protein Atlas will use these models to build a tool integrated with their smart-microscopy system to identify a protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image.\n\nProteins are \u201cthe doers\u201d in the human cell, executing many functions that together enable life. Historically, classification of proteins has been limited to single patterns in one or a few cell types, but in order to fully understand the complexity of the human cell, models must classify mixed patterns across a range of different human cells.\n\nImages visualizing proteins in cells are commonly used for biomedical research, and these cells could hold the key for the next breakthrough in medicine. However, thanks to advances in high-throughput microscopy, these images are generated at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated. Therefore, the need is greater than ever for automating biomedical image analysis to accelerate the understanding of human cells and disease.",

The dataset was available in one of the Kaggle\u2019s competitions named \u2018Instacart Market Basket Analysis\u2019. This competition challenged data miners from all over the world to answer to the following question: \u201cWhich products will an Instacart consumer purchase in his next basket?\u201d.\n\nMarket basket analysis is an important component of every retail company. Simple, yet powerful - MBA is an inexpensive technique to identify cross-sell opportunities and engage customers. At the same time, personalized recommendation systems differentiate companies from the competition and they can lead to competitive advantages. Moreover, recommendation systems are proven to improve user experience, to increase user traffic and the number of purchases and to encourage user engagement and satisfaction. This competition was an opportunity for us to expand our knowledge and to gain hands on experience on models and techniques used in the fields of basket analysis and recommendation systems.\n\nData\n\nThe dataset used for this project purposes consists of 3 million open source online grocery store orders from more than 200 thousands of users. For each user, it contains between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. It also includes information concerning the week and hour of day that the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.\n\nThe dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data. All data files should be placed in the /data directory.\n\nModel\n\nSVD + Neural Networks + Tensorflow",
