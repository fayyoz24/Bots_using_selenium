    "summary": "I have education in Bachelor of Business Administration from Tallinn University of Technology (TUT) specialising in corporate finance. I have also studied about E-Governance Technologies and Services at TUT, Healthcare Economics and Management  at University of Oslo and Healthcare Informatics and E-Commerce Business Models at National University of Singapore. Right now I am writing a research paper on disruptive innovations in healthcare and finishing my master level studies in Healthcare Technologies at TUT.\n\nDuring my studies I have also accumulated work experience in various business areas. I have organised events and been finding and analysing investment opportunities for private investors. I have done market and financial analysis, created business plans and marketing materials. I have been part of several starting companies by helping them to develop the product and create industry partnerships. I have also been involved in advising startups and helping to build startup ecosystems. I have worked in different sectors and now focusing on healthcare industry specifically on e-health solutions that have great potential to improve population health by changing the way healthcare is delivered. I believe the product itself is the most important part of any business and addressing the real problems of customers is one fundamental factor of a successful business.\n\nMy interests are in healthcare, ICT, startups and venture capital investments. I am a highly motivated team player with individual work experience who on the one hand is eager to learn, experiment and create new solutions and on the other hand ready to contribute to the community. I believe that consistency and life-long development are the attitudes we need to promote to build a better future. I like to read and think but these activities only matter if we act on them. I am always ready for communication and new opportunities in the areas where we can make the biggest change in the world. ",
