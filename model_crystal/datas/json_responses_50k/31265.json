    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Phyllida. An advisor within the pharmaceutical industry. Analytical and logical, not afraid to take (calculated) risks. Always learning. A bit of a science nerd. I value accuracy but I can step back to see the bigger picture. I believe that the ability to communicate is as important as subject matter expertise.\n\nI started my career in 2017 as Science and Technical Advisor for Medicines New Zealand. I tackled a steep learning curve to familiarise myself with several aspects of the pharmaceutical industry at once: regulatory affairs, market access, advertising compliance and ethics.\n\nSome days I would be providing advice to pharmaceutical companies on proposed marketing activities. Other days I would be chairing teleconferences discussing regulatory affairs policy changes, or analysing data, drafting reports and public submissions. Other times I would be planning workshops, reaching out to key contacts, or providing objective peer review of a communications piece.\n\nAs my manager said \u201cno two days are the same at Medicines New Zealand\u201d.\n\nI took on all problems with a level-head, a positive attitude and a good dose of lateral-thinking.\n\nI gained the trust and respect of my immediate team, pharmaceutical company executives and senior managers within our membership, as well as external consultants and researchers. \n\nI was motivated to produce high-quality work for the membership, (\u2018our clients\u2019) such as AbbVie, Janssen, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Sanofi, Seqirus, and Roche, and I thrived on the opportunity to meet and work with a diverse range of external stakeholders.\n\nSadly after nearly three years in that role I have recently left to take on another big challenge: moving abroad to the Netherlands with my Dutch partner, learning the language and adapting to the culture. I'm participating in intensive Dutch language lessons at UvA Talen until June 2020. In July 2020 I joined Sandoz as Registration Manager for the EU and Switzerland.\n\nMy core skills and qualities:\n\u2219 Analytical and methodical\n\u2219 Proven communicator\n\u2219 Tech savvy\n\u2219 Team player\n\u2219 High integrity",
