This study examines the relationships between the multi-dimensional consumption values' constructs, consumers' attitudes toward green cars, environmental concern, and intention to purchase green cars. This study also examines attitudes as a mediator and environmental concern as a moderator of intention to purchase green cars. In addition, the mental accounting theory was utilized as a supporting theory for the new dimensional factors' resale price, self-expressive benefits, and fuel prices. All variables were measured using a seven-point Likert scale. By using the simple random sampling technique, 425 questionnaires were collected from the targeted respondents. An in-depth investigation and a number of practical conclusions from the study provide valuable empirical evidence for scholars and prompt decision-makers to better understand the hurdles facing green cars in Malaysia and the best way to overcome them. The implications, limitations, and future research directions were also discussed.",
