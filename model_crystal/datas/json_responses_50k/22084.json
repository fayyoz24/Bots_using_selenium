    "summary": "A motivated individual working in global events, administration and marketing since 2004. I'm able to use my own initiative as well as work as part of team; I thrive on pressure to meet challenging deadlines and objectives. A first rate communicator with outstanding organisational and inter-personal skills, I have the will and determination to succeed.\n\nI am a people-person, and gain energy and drive from working within teams to achieve mutual work goals. Offering guidance and assistance to colleagues also gives me sustenance which reflects in the teams I manage.\n\nCreating my own business and brand in 2015, Waiting for the Metro, I currently offer a personalised in-house dining experience. The only one of two available in Amsterdam. Tourists and locals can join me at my table, in my house to experience Amsterdam on the other side of the window. \n\nThe business also has two tours of Amsterdam. LGBTQI+ History Tour, and the Amsterdam Oud-Zuid Tour.\n\nMy previous employment of three years was with Brinkman Fine Real Estate, assisting Anne Paul Brinkman in his latest undertaking, Real Estate sales and development. Within this role, I aided in all administrative tasks and was lead interior stylist for all listed properties.",

After dispelling a long-standing myth amongst NGO\u2019s that \u2018money matters in the urban slums are dangerous\u2019, we have now resolved and are committed to organized savings and credit activities in the slums, working towards effective economic empowerment. With this basic foundation laid, the concept was concretized into a separate project with aim of bringing about a qualitative change in the lives of families in the slums through economic empowerment, by encouraging women to initiate and participate in self-help groups and other income-generating activities.\n\nwww.apsabangalore.org"
