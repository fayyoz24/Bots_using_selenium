Some System Administration experience using Linux (Apache with Tomcat / Oracle 10g Application Server) and Windows (IIS with Apache TomCat).\n\nStarted programming computers at 12 and have used Microsoft Basic, Turbo Pascal, C, C++, C#, Delphi and Java as well as low level assembly languages (Z80A, 8085, 8086, 80286).  As the web became more accessible this branched out further into Scripting Languages (ASP, JSP, JavaScript). Due to many years experience in various languages, programming has become second nature and new languages and techniques are easily picked up.\n\nSpecialties: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, XML, Java, WYSIWYG layout tools (Ebase, Eclipse)",
