    "summary": "Mark Mutsaers was born in Rijen (The Netherlands) on July 27th, 1983. He received his MSc. degree in Control systems from the department of Electrical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands in 2008. \n\nHe has been working towards the degree of PhD at the same institution under supervision of prof.dr. Siep Weiland and prof.dr.ir. Ton Backx. The title of his thesis is \u201cControl relevant model reduction and controller synthesis for complex dynamical systems\u201d, which he successfully defended on September 6, 2012. Part of this research has been done in cooperation with TNO Integrated Vehicle Safety in Helmond, The Netherlands. \n\nDuring (and also after) his PhD, Mark's research interests include model reduction of large-scale dynamical systems, general systems theory, optimization, and model predictive control.\n\nFrom October 2012 on, Mark started to work as mechatronics engineer at ASML, Veldhoven, The Netherlands. Daily activities in this work are e.g. controller design for stages in the ASML machines, as well as investigating and analyzing dynamical aspects of other modules in the machines.",

S. Weiland and prof. dr. ir. A.C.P.M. Backx.  \n\nThe purpose of this project is to develop methodologies and algorithms to infer simple substitute models for large-scale (or high-complexity) models of systems or controlled behaviors, that retain the accuracy of the original complex model. Not only reduction, but also the modeling of dynamical systems (in computational fluid dynamics) is a part of the project. The focus of the project is to infer reduced order systems that are specifically relevant for control oriented tasks / objectives.\n\nThe results of this research period are summarized in my PhD thesis entitled \"Control relevant model reduction and controller synthesis for complex dynamical systems\" which can be found on www.markmutsaers.nl/thesis or below in my profile.",
