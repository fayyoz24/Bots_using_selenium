    "summary": "\"We study the past to understand the present; we understand the present to guide the future.\"\n\nQuotes like these sometimes tend to sound like oversimplified platitudes. Also, I won\u2019t add \u2018clairvoyancy\u2019 as one of my LinkedIn professional skills. However, sayings like these have always inspired me to move forward in my endeavours and form a guiding principle throughout my (academic) career.\n\nI am a passionate and ambitious master\u2019s student with a special interest in International Relations. Especially the European Union, Human-Rights and civil society related subjects peak my interest. I love to delve into a regions culture to try and grasp an understanding of its current political and social dynamics. Factors that can potentially determine a regions bright future.\n\nAs a History of IR student, I have built a considerable frame of reference about the differences and historical origins of international identities. I know how to quickly analyse, contextualise current political events and get to the essence of complicated texts and policies to set up research.\n\nAdditionally, I have a total of four years of experience standing in front of full classes as a teacher in higher education. Aside from learning about the merits and flaws of education systems and its influence on citizenship. I developed essential public speaking, communication and management skills. I greatly benefit from these in academia, whether it concerns giving a comprehensive talk, leading or participating in a group assignment.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, I finished my traineeship at the SDG House/TRGConsultancy. Together with a multidisciplinary team we developed a didactically sound teaching module which focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and world citizenship. In this programme I propelled my understanding of the international agreements regarding a more sustainable, peaceful, collective future even further.\n\nMoreover, I want to build a stronger expertise regarding the multiple perspectives on international politics and conflicts. Therefore, you can imagine why I chose to do my second masters\u2019 \u2018Conflict Resolution in Divided Societies\u2019 at King\u2019s College London. I want to to take a deep-dive in how I can potentially help and bridge the divide.\n\n\nI strive for a career in International Relations where I can delve into relevant socio-political problems and make a difference. I want to surround myself with experts from all different backgrounds, disciplinaries and walks of life so that I can challenge myself every single day.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to find out what the future holds!",

Hence,\nthis thesis explores why the EU has managed its borders the way it did and how this has\nimplications for its functioning as a stable union that defends human rights. Also, it links the\nmanagement to the securitisation of migration and Euroscepticism. This is done by analysis of\nacademic literature, primary sources, reports and statements by prominent actors within\nEuropean civil societies. It argues that the EU\u2019s border externalisation created a situation in\nwhich it is more vulnerable to blackmail. Because states like Morocco can threaten with a\nsudden migration influx. Lukashenko pursued to exploit the same dynamic. Since migration\nhas become increasingly securitised in the EU, Brussels\u2019 is forced to decide: deal with\ndomestic backlash or potentially undermining its values on human rights by letting harrowing\nsituations unattended at the borders.",
