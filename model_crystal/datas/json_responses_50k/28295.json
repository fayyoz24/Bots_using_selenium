    "summary": "Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read through my profile. In this summary I will try to describe myself in a personal manner in order to portray a picture of me of who I am.\n\nIn my daily life I am preoccupied with sports such as playing indoor football every week (before corona break out). I was born and raised in Amsterdam, which sincerely feels like my hometown. I have a strong arithmetical mind which I often apply in many of the things I do, such as the analysing of detailed data. \n\nFor more information on the voluntary work I do, please read my background information. I keep myself regularly updated with news, new technology and like to share my knowledge with my direct environment every chance I get. \n\nA metaphor of my values is for example when somebody slips or loses his/her groceries, then I am always one of the few people who stops and helps. Next to this I have a strong sense of respect, being aware of someones comfort zone and I live by a gentleman's code.\n\nDuring my study Medicine I discovered my capacities and growing ambitions for the corporate sales world in combination with healthcare. In this time I have had the experience with working for myself, consult, do sales and marketing (even organize events).\n\nThis ambition eventually brought me to the decision to quit my study so that I can fully focus on achieving that the most fitting job \n\nI am currently looking for opportunities. Hoping that this matches not only my experience but also my personality. At the moment I work as sales director and operations in the field of building corona test streets in house at active companies during the pandemic.\n\n Feel free to send me offers, opportunities or any other request. \n\n\u2709: ov.fiaz@gmail.com\n\u260e: +31 6 86183462",
