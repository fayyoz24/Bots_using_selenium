But children living in orphanages have few to very little experiences due to tragic and possibly economic reasons. It leads to vast social issues where a few of them live without any dreams and become rejects at schools, which results in the direction of a failing future.\n\nThus, we offered them a great experience by bringing English-speaking volunteers and enjoyable activities in the Ueno Zoo (Tokyo, Japan). The intention is to motivate children to study English and have actual dreams!"
