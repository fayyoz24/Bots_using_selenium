Commercially focused on added value and Roi. Since 1987 involved in Search technologies, Business Proces Management and Big Data. Right-info-right-moment-right-place.\n\nThe use of \"new\"\u200b media, the speed of spreading the news and experience. The world seems more flat than before, this  gives unique opportunities to the business and the consumers. The majority of the mentioned things concerns content. Since 1987 I am involved in various Content involved innovations. From simple Document Management systems to improve the customer satisfaction at a Bank towards online interactive forms and finally apps for insurance claims handling by using Blockchain, There is always content and interaction. By using available innovations to optimize the involved processes, a big efficiency step can be made. It concerns all flows in the organization; HR, ERP,CRM, CMS of Call center info. By using and analyzing the data in a \"smart\" way the added value is impressive and quaranteed. \n\nCombining flows and information from various in- and external sources the information becomes knowledge. Making use of this knowledge during processes bij BPM tooling or recently becoming popular RPA, with straight through like ideas are even more popular at this stage. By just making use of this knowledge you can be steps ahead of the competition and make the difference. Combining knowledge and AI with \"reality\" gives even more opportunities (VR/AR).\n\n\"Nothing\" new, but because of the power of the current generation cloud solutions and infrastructures it becomes scalable and available for everybody. This offers a complete new way of thinking and dynamics, Especially since everybody owns a handheld system (IOT!) which is online 24 hours a day. \n\nInterested to chat about the above issues, drop me a line:\n\n\u260e 06-26984213 | \u2709 nico@next2know.nl | \ud83c\udf0d www.next2know.nl",
