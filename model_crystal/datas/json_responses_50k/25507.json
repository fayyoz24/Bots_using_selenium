For this purpose, two different acrylonitryle butadiene styrene (ABS) grades are studied and compared, aiming to check to what extent the regular ABS developed for conventional polymer processing, with a different rheology than the one provided for the FDM process, can also be used in this process (FDM). To support the analysis, the two materials are rheologically characterized using a stress controlled rotational rheometer (Paar Physica) and a capillary rheometer (Rosand RH10), and are subsequently used to produce FDM samples. The quality of the samples produced by FDM with the two materials is compared mechanically and optically, and the usability of the conventional material in the 3D printing process is discussed.",
