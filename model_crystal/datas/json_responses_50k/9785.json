    "summary": "I am an environmental specialist with over 10 years\u2019 experience working on infrastructure development projects in Africa, in the energy, transport and water sectors. \nMy approach is pragmatic and risk-based, while simultaneously looking at ways to increase benefits on the environmental and social fronts and have a greater impact. This means, among other things, being particularly attentive to the circumstances, needs, and wants of the people who are involved in, at the receiving end of development projects.\nI have a strong interest in issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, which led me to work with Lean In Netherlands, and set up an initiative to tackle elderly loneliness.\nWhatever I do, I aim to empower the people I work with, and reach the best possible outcomes for a more sustainable and equitable future.\nI am a citizen of France and South Africa, currently living in the Netherlands.",
