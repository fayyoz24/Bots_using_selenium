    "summary": "I am an open minded and engaged entrepreneur, trainer and lecturer-researcher, who professionally has a passion for public governance, change management and developing organizations, (virtual) teams and individuals, especially with simulations & serious gaming tools.\n\nThroughout my career, I have demonstrated to be able to combine creativity, an entrepreneurial mindset and a hands-on mentality (\"Rotterdam can-do approach\"). I enjoy to work in teams, to seek common ground and collaboration and to deliver results. \n\nMore specifically, with 20+ years of experience inside and around national and city government (Parliament, Rotterdam, G4 and G32), I consider myself an agile policy entrepreneur, who can make a difference in peddling influence in public arenas.\n\nIn addition, simulation & gaming has become a new passion and profession. I founded Simulation Experience (simxp.com) with the ambition to unlock the great potential of proof of concept and ready-to-play simulations and games for professionals and managers on a variety of organizational and management issues, like change and (virtual) team development. We deliver powerful game-based learning experiences and help teams and organizations stretch to their next level, often in co-creation with consultancy firms, business universities and internal trainers. We collaborate closely with developers and companies from U.S.A., Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Poland, Taiwan and of course The Netherlands.",
