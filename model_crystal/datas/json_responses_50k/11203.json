    "summary": "\"We have to change to stay the same\". I am fascinated by the concept of ambidexterity: the ability to simultaneously 'explore' and 'exploit'. Thus, I've did research on how teams (collectives) can contribute to organizational ambidexterity, in stead of the more common top-down leadership vantage point.\n\nI did this during the Executive MScBA from Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University in 2020/21. I have worked across various industries and in different roles; from (big) corporate communications consulting to high velocity start-up environments. The uncertainty of disruptive technology and innovations has always been the driver of my career.\n\nAt Siemens Digital Industries, I am regionally responsible for \"Digital Enterprise\" and working in the country core team of our open business platform Xcelerator. Siemens combines the real and digital worlds to empower companies to act flexibly and sustainably.",
