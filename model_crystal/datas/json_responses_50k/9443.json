    "summary": "For more than 30 years I am supporting management in improving their supply chains. At present I mainly work as chief responsible transformation manager in designing and implementing vast supply chain solutions for customers in retail and production. Together with the Supply Today experts we cover the total range of topics from supply chain strategy, finance, designing lay-out, mechanisation, building, ICT selection and implementation. \n\nI started my career in logistics at DHL (Nedlloyd) with jobs in transport, distribution and warehousing in various European countries. I was among others regional director in Germany and managing director for food distribution and warehousing in the Benelux. For KPMG I supported many Japanese and American customers in consolidating their European warehouse activities thereby reducing costs while keeping the service intact. \n\nMy decision to start my own consultancy and management firm was insprired by doing things differently. Not only design but also implementation. Therefor we gathered a group of highly experiences consultants and managers who are committed to results. Now being an entrepreneur myself I better understand challenges and risks of developing business. Our customer base consists of many famliy owned companies with which we seem to have a natural fit.\n\nToday focus of our customers is on digitalization of supply chain processes and on mechanisation of production and logistics activities. Complex projects with huge budgets where we support with our end-to-end expertise and customers can benefit from our extensive experience.\n\nAs I have insight and experience in all parts of the supply chain I understand risks and plan mitigations. I focus on local management and employees, whom I challenge and coach with humour as well as with to the point communication. Programs being in control and giving a feel of comfort at all times. Even at hard times, which - for certain- will arise in each project.",
