    "summary": "RESEARCH PROFILE AND ETHOS: \nI am a sociologist and cultural geographer by education, an innovation researcher by profession and a people\u2019s person by nature.  \n\nMy Core Values\nKeep innovating and investigating new ideas in order to find solutions to the major societal challenges of our time by being in constant dialogue with people on the ground.\n\nI\u2019m characterised by an agile mindset and by the ability to adapt to change. My core competency is to deliver successful projects, driven by my key values: cooperation, authenticity and trust. There are two key components to sustainable success: PEOPLE and COMMUNICATION. It's always about people and about establishing the necessary framework for solid cooperation. Along with authentic communication, this framework makes the difference when it comes to creating strong output. In other words: success is not the result of planning, but a natural consequence!\n\nIn my research I am focusing on the experiences of people living in rural areas and their role and capacity in building the resilience of their rural communities. This links to the personal experiences on-the-ground and local participation with implications for self-regulating policies and programmes that focuses on the rural communities and their future sustainability \u2013 Socially, Economically, Culturally and Environmentally.\n\nIn investigating these issues, I am focused on remote and rural regions (mainly in Europe), where population decline, ageing, and poor service/facilities provision, present particular challenges to rural policy and practice and to Rural Life in general. \n\nThe persistence of place, as well as aspirations of local governance, engagement, local participation and social innovation,  are elements of a wider context which inform my wider research.\n\nResearch Ambition:\nTo influence (social) policy and practice in order to improve life in rural communities and help people recognize and harness their resilience for shaping their own future tailored to local needs in light of contemporary societal challenges.\n\nMy research vision and aspiration is to add an innovative and substantive focus to the growing body of research portfolios for defining, conceptualising, measuring and unpacking the various components of \u2018community resilience\u2019 (socially, economically, environmentally, culturally).",

We identify and examine a range of cross-cutting issues in energy citizenship, which will inform iterative typology development and criteria for case selection.\n\nDrawing on existing databases and a search for new cases, we will select 500 initiatives and undertake mapping and typology refinement exercises to demonstrate the depth/breadth of the energy citizenship concept in theory and practice. 40 cases will be selected for in-depth analysis exploring development, evaluation, intermediaries, institutions, governance and ICT in energy systems. Using a multi-actor perspective, we will develop an empowerment toolkit for practitioners and citizens, co-create viable strategies, and develop new business and social innovation models, and new forms of organisation to advance energy citizenship.\n\nA critical part of the research involves analysing the external and internal contextual conditions as they support or hinder energy citizenship in its various forms. Based on the analysis we will match suitable models and forms of organisation with different countries, regions and contexts.",

The aims of this 5 Year programme are: \n1) to assess how communities have been, or can be, empowered to generate local economic development, shape service provision, directly address poverty, or influence key land use decisions over the long term; \n2) to understand how these processes can play a key (rural) development role in enhancing community resilience and wellbeing; \n3) the costs and benefits of a community-led approach to addressing systemic challenges and maximising opportunities.\n\nMy previous research work focused on \u2018Low Carbon Rural Economy\u2019 and in particular on the governance and institutions involved in facilitating or hindering the transition to a low carbon economy and society in rural areas in Scotland. This research was part of the Rural and Environment Research Analysis Directorate (RESAS) funded programme \u2018Environmental Change (Local Response to Global Change)\u2019 (2011-16).\n\n'Governance and Decision-making for Community Empowerment in rural communities':\nI was also involved at the Scottish Government-funded research stream reviewing conceptual frameworks and methodologies of vibrant rural areas and evaluating interventions to develop strong, resilient and supportive rural communities.
