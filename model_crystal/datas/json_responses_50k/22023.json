    "summary": "An Associate of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (ACIM), I\u2019m currently working as a Customer Experience Technology Consultant at EY VODW. I have had intensive experience working with startups and mentoring entrepreneurs. My academic background is multidisciplinary, and I have had the opportunity to study in different countries. Hence, I enjoy working as a consultant, as it allows me to bring together my experience to solve complex challenges.\n\nAmongst my personal milestones, I self-published my poetry collection in July 2021, \"One at a Time: A Poetic Journey Into the Unconscious Mind.\" I am a professional actor with experience of working in short films, and training at the Mulholland Academy in Amsterdam. Acting also helps me humanise the consulting experience and truly understand human beings before finding their needs as customers.",
