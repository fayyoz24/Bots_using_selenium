    "summary": "Practical thinker with creative eye. Dedicated, detail driven manager. Aspires to consistently deliver wonderful creative output with a positive and approachable attitude. Background in accounting, media and marketing.\n\nProject management / Business strategy / Budget management / Operations management / Facilities management / Sourcing / Design management / Image production / Travel logistics.\n\nI started my own production company in 2019 that works side by side with other production companies in Spain, Germany, South Africa, Miami, New Zealand and Australia. So arranging shoots from A-Z is second nature to me.\n\nThings like: working permits, locations, models, hair and make up, stylist, catering, travel, hotel etc.\nI feel that with 17 years of experience on both sides of the camera, as a photographer, videographer and model with Kult Models in Germany, that I know what is possible to produce on a day, how to handle difficult circumstances and how to find solutions for any situation in a day.\n\nI\u2019m a very calm people\u2019s person and I believe working should also be fun and enjoyable for everyone and never boring.",
