    "summary": "Senior Consultant in Eraneos consulting practice Digital Business & Innovation (DB&I). With 15 years of experience in the academic healthcare sector and recently started as a consultant for Eraneos. I advise clients to set a foundation for success in both the present and future using digital solutions, and guides in the development of their strategic visions within the full ecosystem they are operating. I love to combine academic knowledge with analytical capabilities, and have a strong sense to excellence.\n\nBefore Eraneos, I was an academic researcher at the intersection of life-science, biomedical engineering, medical technology and finally a policy advisor at the Amsterdam UMC. I collaborated with multiple research disciplines as a trusted academic advisor across industries to provide solutions and increase the societal value of scientific projects. As a policy advisor, I had a supporting role for the management in the Amsterdam UMC, provided advice on various issues for academic research and developed related policy. I have been involved in regional initiatives for the public health in Amsterdam and participated in projects for the reusability and availability of health- and research data for researchers through an organized data infrastructure. \n\nI prefer to describe myself as an enthusiastic innovator and always ready to explore new edges. I communicate easily across organizational levels with a hands-on mentality.\n\nExpertise\n\u2022\tData science: a combination of statistics, scientific research methodologies, AI (theory), and data analytics\n\u2022\tBusiness transformation and innovation\n\u2022\tData and AI strategy\n\u2022\tData and enterprise architecture",
