    "summary": "I am a counter-terrorism researcher with an interest in the process and experience of radicalisation. My strategic focus typically rests on Pillars One and Two of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, seeking to develop a deeper understanding of terrorist organisations, as well as the process(es) by which an individual comes to legitimise and/or perpetrate an act of violent extremism or terrorism. \n\nThrough a psychological lens, I have co-ordinated a number of projects in this domain, including qualitative research with former perpetrators (right-wing, separatist, and Islamic groups), fieldwork with NGOs in the West Bank, as well as experimental research on the social cognitive processes of violent radicalisation through narratives. \n\nI am also one of a number of counter-terrorism experts who consult with the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN), as managed by the European Commission. My research has been funded by the Irish Research Council, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Canadian government's Community Resilience Fund (CRF).",
