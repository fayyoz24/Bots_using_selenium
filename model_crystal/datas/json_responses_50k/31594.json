    "summary": "Alfonso Agatino Isola was born in Catania (Italy) on February 4, 1978.\n\nHe received his M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Catania, in 2006, for his work on methodologies and instruments for the characterization of the Parkinson disease.  \n\nFrom June 2006 till February 2007, he worked as Computer Science Researcher for the Thales Nederland B.V. in Hengelo (Netherlands).\n\nFrom March 2007 till February 2010, he worked towards his Ph.D. degree at Philips Research - Hamburg and in cooperation with the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam. His research interests included motion-compensated iterative reconstruction algorithms, motion estimation methodologies for cardiac CT, elastic image registration, and parametric assessment of myocardial perfusion. \n\nHe received his Ph.D. degree from the Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, in 2010, for his dissertation entitled  \"Motion Compensated Iterative Reconstruction for Cardiac X-ray Tomography\" (available at: http://hdl.handle.net/1765/19823).\n\nFrom March till September 2010, he worked as Research Scientist at Philips Research - Hamburg. He studied and investigated novel image reconstruction methods for Cardiac C-arm X-ray.\n\nFrom October 2010 till March 2013, he worked as Research Scientist at Philips Research - Eindhoven. He studied novel medical imaging solutions.\n\nSince April 2013, he is working as Senior Scientist at Philips Research - Eindhoven. His research interests lie in the field of numerical optimization for radiation and thermal ablation treatment planning (e.g. Pinnacle Evolution TPS, DynaCAD Urology ablation planning, etc.), and in the field of AI and data science for cardiac diagnostic solutions (e.g. IntelliSpace Portal 12).\n\nReviewer for \"Medical Physics\", \"Physics in Medicine and Biology\", and \"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine\".\n\nSpecialties: RF/MW/Cryo thermal ablation, LDR/HDR brachytherapy and EBRT planning, cardiac CT imaging, cardiac motion correction, myocardial perfusion, numerical optimization, medical physics, image processing, image reconstruction, image registration, AI, machine learning, data science, SIMD vectorized software (SSE,AVX), C, C++, C#, Python, Matlab.\n\nLicenses & certifications: Scaled Agile SAFe\u00ae 5 Scrum Master and Product Owner/Product Manager.",

Within this new role inside the Research Sector Medical Imaging Systems, I was studying and investigating on a new project that aimed at developing a three-dimensional method to reconstruct moving objects from cone-beam X-ray projections using an iterative reconstruction algorithm and a given motion vector field (MVF). This approach was successfully applied to perform \"motion artefact\" free cardiac CT image reconstructions. This PhD project was based on a strong cooperation between industrial research, university groups, and clinical partners. I benefited from an extensive european research network, offering cooperation with the Biomedical Imaging Group of my host university \"Erasmus Medical Center University of Rotterdam\" and three clinical partners (Hamburg, Aachen, Stockholm).",
