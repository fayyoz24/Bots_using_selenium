Biscuit International is the leading European manufacturer of private label sweet biscuits, with a wide range of products with a Worldwide, European or local presence.  Within the BI strategy the present sales entities within the group take over the commercial responsibility off all (inter)national group sales in their \u2018areas\u2019. So this also happened with our 40 million euro Aviateur export sales and ca. 70 million euro Dutch food retail sales. A new business development team at Aviateur was formatted and it\u2019s my role, within the team, to direct, support and control all BI sales entities (outside the Benelux) in selling and developing the (for them new) Aviateur assortment and keeping continuous focus on our unique and delicious cakes, pastries and traditional Dutch biscuits. Current sales entities are Poult, Arluy, Northumbrian Fine Foods, Stroopwafel & Co. and Banketgroep/DACH and cross selling is what we\u2019re targeting on within our new Aviateur BD team.",
