    "summary": "600 characters only? Those who know me will know that\u2019s tough for me. I have been busy learning new things in this company for the last 29 years. In fact learning is my favorite thing about working in Syngenta, new challenges. I like to come in and watch how things are done, understand the pain points and help folks to reduce or eliminate the pain. In my current role this is through analysis of business process and talking to folks about what in their dreams a tool could do for them, then running experiments to learn what is possible. I used the same skills when I was an operations manager and when I was running a QC lab. I believe if you are open minded and love to learn you can do anything! ",
