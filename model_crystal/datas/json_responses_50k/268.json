    "summary": "I am currently looking for an entry-level position in the field of international development and cooperation, ideally in the thematic field of migration and protection of refugees' rights, either in the non-governmental sector (international or local NGO) or in the intergovernmental cooperation sector (for example bilateral/multilateral cooperation projects). I would prefer to work in a country where I can apply my language skills, ideally in a francophone country, but am also very open for other options (luso-, hispano, italo-, anglophone or others).\n\nI am Interested in the intertwinement of human rights and development issues and the solving of related problems through active engagement in the field (project planning and implementation). I am focused on developing projects that can have a positive impact on the socio-economic inclusion of marginalized population groups, with a special interest in ethnic minorities and refugee/migrant communities. My passion for languages and people are my driver to leveraging the potential of community engagement to empower grassroot efforts for social change.",
