For obvious reasons there is a continual need for the advancement of forensically non- destructive developmental techniques across all disciplines. To enhance the chances of recovery, the initial examination phase of a scene or exhibit should always involve a visual examination with the aid of a forensic light source. This is prior to physical and chemical enhancement involving the application of powders and stains. The superior advantage of the forensic light source for the development of fingerprints is its non-destructive, non-contaminating properties. This case study dis- plays the circumstance where the initial application of light using the Polilight-Flare\u00ae Plus resulted in a far superior devel- oped latent fingerprint when compared to the same latent fingerprint post powdering. The quality of the powdered finger- print has been considerably and notably reduced, not just visibly but also biometrically. I have represented each latent fin- gerprint as seen on NAFIS (National Automated Fingerprint Identification System), alongside their respective minutia counts and generated biometric scores.",

Unfortunately, there has been little movement to embrace the substance of the reports, and accept the need for change in evidence interpretation, reporting and delivery.  Through education and awareness, fingerprint experts across the globe need to significantly increase their collaborative efforts. In turn, training needs to be provided to enable experts to articulate their reasoning with relation to non-numeric conclusions, lack of probabilistic analysis, uncertainty, difference of opinion, institutional bias, contextual bias and cognitive bias. As a discipline, we need to explore urgently the best approach to the changing landscape of fingerprint science particularly with respect to limitations, errors, validity and reliability. It is important to take an accelerated approach toward the assessment of Bayesian logical frameworks to support our currently claimed identification infallibility. Fingerprint experts need to understand/realise the dangers of uncertainty without empirically supported data, and need to be aware of bias, and how to counteract it. It is integral that we treat human errors with openness, yet not allow our reputation regarding validity and robustness to suffer.",

High profile erroneous identifications, the inherent subjectivity involved in fingerprint interpretation and the terminology used, particularly in the absence of objective standards, has resulted in an increase in court challenges across the globe. Professional codes, legal rules and scientific requirements must be met to ensure the evidence meets specific admissibility criteria, and is reported in a scientific manner. To address these challenges a Fingerprint Sciences Group Statement Working Party (FSG-SWP) was formed, with representation from a  range of forensic practitioners; the Education and Training Unit and Fingerprint Specialist Advisory Group, two research specialists affiliated with the Office of the Chief Forensic Scientist, and fingerprint examiners with varying skills and experience. Advice was sought from legal academics, and statements from other jurisdictions were collected for review. The primary objective of the FSG-SWP is to address critical challenges, focus on current controversial topics in the fingerprint community (bias, terminology, error rates, limitations, documentation) and ensure scientific and legal requirements were met. To overcome change barriers and ensure successful transition, all meetings were documented and educational forums were held throughout the process. A focus group was established to review, raise and address concerns and find common ground prior to implementation. As a result a new statement template has been successfully implemented along with a glossary of terms and a statement of limitations. A blind verification pilot has been successfully launched and sing A.C.E. reports are a work in progress with single reports being trialled.",

Leaders with strong understanding of scientific principles enables the progression of scientific initiatives, active engagement with external sources, promotion of best practice and contributes to the ongoing development of fingerprint examiners.  Most importantly, leaders can provide support for the expansion of fingerprint examiner subject matter expertise. The framework must be structured to ensure that information relevant to task expertise is covered, and that examiners are conversant with limitations, risks and potential sources of error. Continuing professional development after certification is critical for ensuring the maintenance or growth of expertise.

To determine what factors affect overall reliability it is necessary to separate fundamental aspects relating to methodological application. Reliability requires a solid foundation - strong adherence to scientific principles, maintenance of validated standardised protocols and the ongoing ability to measure accuracy.  This presentation will discuss how to achieve reliability at each suggested level: (1) Reliable application of ACE-V methodology (adherence to scientific principles, capturing interpretive judgments, mitigating human factors) (2) Individual examiner reliability (Intra-examiner variability, sufficiency thresholds, decision thresholds) and (3) Reliability within an organisation (inter-examiner variability, overall accuracy, error rate). Examples of potential avenues of improvement to current practice will be discussed, such as how the development of robust validated SOPs may serve to mitigate error and enhance practice, or how to capture examiner reasoning to make the process transparent to fact-finders. Any application needs to coincide with organisational policy to protect the individual from factors which may affect judgements. The level of individual examiner reliability can be captured by fit-for-purpose proficiency tests that measure individual performance.  Enhancing the reliability of fingerprint science will require attention to processes, protocols and examiners at multiple levels, but there is a vast body of literature, recommendations and knowledge that the community can build from in these activities. \n",

Practitioners must understand their accountabilities and the risks associated with failing to keep abreast with current literature. Attempts must be made to critically analyse recommendations that have been published in recent authoritative reports, and bridge the existing gaps. One recurring theme in these critical reports is the need to move towards transparency in reporting fingerprint conclusions.  Part of this shift involves the requirement to state any limitations that exist within the fingerprint science, and what may affect the evidence being presented.  In the Australian adversarial system, fingerprint expert reports are bound by legal requirements. In Victoria, if an expert report is requested as per the County and Supreme Court Practice Direction, it must specify any limitations or uncertainties affecting the reliability of the methods or techniques used, the data relied on to arrive at the opinion(s), as well as any uncertainties affecting the reliability of the opinion stated as a result of insufficient research or data. \nIt is important for fingerprint practitioners to have an understanding of the limitations within their field, and to accurately report and articulate them in a manner that is understood by a lay person.  And so these questions are posed - what limitations exist within the science of fingerprints?  Do practitioners agree on what constitutes a limitation in their field of expertise?  How can limitations be reported and articulated?  This presentation will consider and discuss limitations at foundational and practitioner levels, inclusive of error rates, cognitive factors, lack of probabilistic analysis, absence of fingerprints, ageing of fingerprints and the subjective nature of sufficiency determination.",

            "description": "The identification of deceased persons is a key function of the Victorian Fingerprint\nBranch with current best practice to obtain an impression of fingers palms and feet using\nblack powder and sticky white labels. With the high quantity of deceased persons\nprocessed it is important to employ simple but effective methods whilst ensuring the\nbest quality result is obtained yet minimising the resources required. This poses the\ncontinual requirement for the advancement of best practice. Obtaining fingerprints from\ndeceased bodies undergoing varying stages of decomposition can be complex at the best\nof times. We propose that for complex cases, digital photography becomes the\npreferred procedure. This is also inline with improved strategies for harm minimisation,\nstress management and the general health and wellbeing of forensic officers being\nexposed to a large number of deceased persons per week. This case study focuses on\nthe more complex situations such as those involving advanced decomposition and\nassociated putrefaction. We demonstrate a comparative study, utilising biometric scores\ngenerated by NAFIS as a direct source of quality. The lift, the digital image and the digital\nimage enhanced with Adobe Photoshop\u00ae are all compared. In this particular case, the\nimages alone were found to be far superior in comparison with the lift demonstrating the\nbenefits of this as an alternative to current methods and in situations where direct\nelectronic capture is not feasible.",

This has ultimately led to the introduction of stringent quality management programs involving proficiency testing, validation studies and quality control procedures.  As scientific technological advancements continue so to will the requirement for relevant updates in training and procedures.  There is little risk of transference of genetic material through fingerprint brushes. However, it is a possibility. It is inevitable that technology will advance, sensitivity will increase. This presents a constant requirement in the forensic science community to protect the reliability of results and in turn prevent scrutiny in the public, scientific and legal communities.  Many processes and procedures, starting from initial investigation by police members to confirmation or elimination of the identity of an individual by a forensic expert are involved in the process prior to its admissibility in court. Police members and forensic practitioners must communicate and work together to ensure the upmost integrity and reliability of evidence presented before the courts.  The development for a validated procedure in the cleaning of fingerprint brushes is one aspect of this process and will hopefully eliminate any questions being raised about the origin of an individuals DNA and negate the argument involved with secondary transfer.",
