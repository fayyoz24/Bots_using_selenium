    "summary": "Sustainability and the energy transition get a lot of attention at the Hanze University of Applied Science. Our lectures and projects show us how we as mechanical engineers can contribute to this transition. Because of this good amount of thought that is being put into this topic, I found myself inspired to participate in the transition to new and innovative technology. The inventing of a new sustainable energy source as well as optimizing the manufacturing of products are both noble acts I would like to contribute to in the future. Everybody benefits from the developments that are being made in the technological sector. I get satisfaction in being able to perform well and getting challenging assignments. I am proud that I passed the propaedeutic exam within one year with a designation cum laude (average mark 8+/10). My goal is to also finish my bachelor program with the same judicial.\n\nI am currently looking for an internship with a duration of 20 weeks starting per two September 2019. I already had some excursions at different companies and also some projects that gave me an idea of how an engineer operates in practice. Through these projects I have gained skills I expect to use during my internship:\n-\tThermal analysis\n-\tFluid analysis\n-\tDesigning and analyzing components\n-\tStrength analysis\n-\tStatistical Process Control\n\nHowever, an internship is my chance to finally get some real hands-on experience in a business environment for a longer period of time.\n\nI would like to get some working experience in a foreign country because working abroad is something I myself would very much enjoy in my future job. And staying in a foreign country all by yourself is also a great addition to become an independent adult. \n \n\n",
