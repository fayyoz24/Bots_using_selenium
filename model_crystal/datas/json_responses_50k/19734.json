    "summary": "I have been actively involved in the consulting field for over 25 years including human resources, organizational development, instruction/coaching, marketing/media relations, customer relations, and senior project management.  I also offer afterschool outreach programs for children K-12 some of whom have learning challenges.  Community service plays a vital role in my life.  I am on the Patient Experience Council with Alameda Hospital where we are working on ways to improve their processes/procedures, customer service, and community outreach communications.  I am also on the Steering Committee and Director of the Animal Rescue of Tracy (ART).  I've received special honors for my community service including the Mayor's Ball for my youth program and two consecutive years Tracy Chamber of Commerce for From the Heart.",
