From strategy, concept, to slogan.\n\nBoijmans Hillevliet is a community where various cultural worlds meet in Rotterdam South. However, the south is often viewed as a dark area. So how can we depict and represent Boijmans Hillevliet in another way and inspire the young generation?\n\nTo make this happen, I created and developed a concept in which young contemporary artists born and raised in Rotterdam South, are portrayed as heroes. What is their dream, what do they want to achieve and how do they perceive the museum of the future? Among these were some of the questions I posed during the interviews with these young creators.\n\nTogether with filmmaker Loes Korten, I created a series of short documental stories that give a glimpse into the artist\u2019s life, work, and career and show their connection to Rotterdam South. Through these stories, the young creators get a stage, and they become the heroes of Boijmans Hillevliet.\n\nCaptured in 3 videos and translated to visual stories. Published online as part of the museum\u2019s branding, including social media channels and the website.",

In addition, I analyzed their type of communication in their social media (social media analysis), and their \u2018spots\u2019 with the aim of helping in the development of a strategy, searching for an area of communication at regional and global level, to inform the strategy department. The main activities were doing research, making a planning and creating communication strategies for clients.
