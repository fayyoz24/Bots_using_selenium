    "summary": "My life motto is #justdostuff. This means saying yes to new experiences and see everything from a positive point of view. \n\nThis always helps me to reach for value for myself, but also for others!\n\nMy value is that I want to help others by inspiring, supporting and advising them. For the past years, I have seen that I am a very passionate person and that I would like to see that people become a better version of themselves. During my EBF Board Year, I and my board created value for students through events like the EBF Skillsday. This year, I expanded my skills towards being a trainer and coaching by working at the FEB Career Services. Here, I give workshops in an energetic and interactive way to let students learn from me and through each other. As a personal entrepreneur, I always try to reach out for new opportunities to develop my passions. I engage in public speaking and I have a goal to eventually give a TED talk myself. \n\nI will pursue my passions for the upcoming times towards being a trainer, public speaking and organizing events. I am a very energetic, positive and collaborative person! \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nWanna connect? Please do!\n\nSend me a message through LinkedIn or send me a message to jeroenbzuidberg@gmail.com! Hope to speak to you soon! \ud83d\ude0a",
