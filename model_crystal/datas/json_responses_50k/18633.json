EELISA is a groundbreaking initiative that unites nine prominent universities from around the world, with a common goal of enhancing the accessibility and exchange of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses.\n\nIn this diverse and dynamic team, I assumed the role of Marketing Strategy Manager, where I spearheaded the development and execution of our marketing strategy. Our approach was rooted in agile methodologies such as Scrum and Design Thinking, allowing us to adapt swiftly to evolving challenges and opportunities.\n\nMy responsibilities extended to student and professor recruitment, user journey mapping, and the deployment of a comprehensive marketing strategy, leveraging the Flywheel Model for sustained growth. We delivered a compelling mockup of our platform and presented our vision to the commission, resulting in us achieving the highest grade possible.\n\nThis transformative experience immersed me in the realms of innovation, marketing, agile methodology, and international management. It provided invaluable insights into collaboration across borders, problem-solving in dynamic environments, and the strategic intricacies of bringing a visionary project to life. EELISA not only deepened my understanding of these key areas but also ignited my passion for driving positive change through innovative solutions in the realm of education.",
