Each region was assigned a person that had to analyze where we had products that we do not sell at a sustainable margin and why, and if we could do something about this. It is my job to work with the marketers and the Key Account managers to determine if we can do better and how. This can result in a price increase, but it can also be that Sensata just has to do better in their manufacturing to cut costs there. It can also be that an item needs to be discontinued, or replaced by a similar item. This job requires a lot of patience, affinity with numbers and data mining.",

To be able to do that, we have to build a business case in which we calculate how we can approach this the best, at which costs and for which margin, to make sure that we win the business but also make a profit. This process was not streamlined and scattered and put a heavy burden on the organization, as it always needed to be done in a limited time frame. The Growth Team was created to streamline this whole process and to centralize the building of the business cases in one team, and be the team in the organization that used the knowledge of the other departments in the organization without letting each and every part of that organization do a small part of the business case. The Growth Team members have a lot of interaction with Marketing, Sales, PMT, Finance, Manufacturing, Process, Purchasing, Customer Service to make sure that the business case built in feasible, accurate, profitable and accepted by our customers as well as our own internal organization.",

This manufacturing line had to be moved to our manufacturing facilities in Botevgrad, Bulgaria, and at the same time we where obliged to maximize output to enable transfer stock build for our main customers, so they could be supplied while the line was moved. Furthermore, we knew that our customer demand would be going up and new part numbers were to be released, which complicated the project. I was assigned to stabilize and streamline the productionplanning in cooperation with the people in Borgwarner Ludwigsburg, and to allocate the capacity we had in such a way that we had minimum change over time between products, minimum downtime and maximum output, to supply the customers but also to build the necessary transfer stock. In parallel we started up a new, semi-automated production line which made the same product, in Botevgrad and as a consequence we also had for all customers a phase over planning from the Germany-produced products to the Bulgaria-produced products. For that I was also made responsible to plan the production in Botevgrad in such a way that we would have minimal obsolete stock from German products and a smooth phase-over to Bulgarian products.  Together with a small team we had daily calls with several large OEM's about output, shipments, stockbuild and phase over planning. After approximately a year we were able to transfer the German line without any major issues in customer supply.",
