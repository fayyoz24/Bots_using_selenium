    "summary": "I have  worked as a guest researcher with dr. G.R. Blake at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials in the Department of Chemical Physics, University of Groningen. \nI have worked on the temperature dependent structural properties of Organic-inorganic hybrids and on the synthesis, structural and magnetic properties of Co based Jarosites materials. \nDuring this period, I have learnt the operation of single crystal diffractrometer D8 Venture and structural analysis with SHELX software. Co based Jarosites synthesis by Hydrothermal Method, operation of D8 advanced powder diffractrometer and analysis of the structural part with SHELX and GSAS (General Stuctural Analysis System) Crystallographic Software.  \nIn my master project I have worked in the Pharmaceutical company in Q.C.Lab as a trainee for about 2 months.My Project was based on the Qualitative/Quantitative Analysis of Raw,Bulk and Finish Products.. During practice I learned the operation of various instument like TLC, U.V. spectrophotometer,Karl-Fischer titrator, polarimeter, PH meter etc.\n",
