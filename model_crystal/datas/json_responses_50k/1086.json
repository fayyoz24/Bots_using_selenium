    "summary": "Currently, I am focused on finishing my International Studies degree at Leiden University. As part of my studies, I specialize in East Asia with the main focus on Japan. I also act as an Ambassador for Education First (EF). As part of my work for EF as well as my own personal interest in Japan, I provide information to students and others about Japanese culture and language. I also work part-time at SET Genki Tei Japanese Restaurant. \n\nCurrently I am looking for an internship in Tokyo for 6 months starting September 2020. If you need someone with an international background and excellent proficiency in several languages, please contact me. \n\nMomenteel ben ik met name gefocust op het afronden van mijn International Studies in Leiden Universiteit. Mijn focus ligt voornamelijk op Azie met name Japan . Daarnaast werk ik als een Ambassadeur voor Education First en ik informeer ook studenten en ge\u00efntereseerden over Japanse cultuur en taal. Ik heb ook een bijbaan bij SET Genki Tei.\n\n",
