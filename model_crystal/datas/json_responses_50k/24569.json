    "summary": "I am currently a 26-year-old student with a healthy thirst for knowledge and the motivation to get the most out of everything I do. Curiosity, perfectionism, and perseverance are among my best qualities. \n\nI am a jack of all trades (and master of none? Perhaps a few?) who dabbles in all kind of fields, with a special interest in writing and the arts. \n\nLanguage holds my interest as well, and with a Cambridge Proficiency Exam Certificate I can say my level of English is not at all shabby. Most of my writing is actually done in English as is most of my communication through social media. You might even say that I prefer it over Dutch, which is my native tongue.\nNot only do I find English interesting, but I also quite love the development of languages in general, how we use them, cultural differences, etc.\nAside from those two languages, I can also more of less read and understand German, though producing it is not my strength.\n\nIn the arts I dabble both in traditional and digital work, although not through any official schools. I am working on publishing my work on the internet and hope to grow through there. Contact me if you are curious as to my work.\nMy interests in this field are extremely broad, from theatre to sculpting, media, gaming industry, and architecture.\n\ntbc...",
