    "summary": "After studying geology and geochemistry, I somehow focused on how to curate extraterrestrial samples, and I love it! After over 2 years with the Curation Office at the NASA Johnson Space Center, getting hands-on experience on designing, building and monitoring first-class curation cleanrooms, I joined the European Space Agency as a staff scientist. I aim to promote and develop curation and sample analysis activities in Europe. Keeping precious samples returned from space in pristine condition is paramount to enable high-level science. \nI deeply enjoy networking and bringing together people, whether for personal or professionnal purposes.",
