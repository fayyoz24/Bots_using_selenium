Analysts study data related to criminals, crime suspects, incidents, issues and trends. By collecting and assessing this data, they can identify relationships or connections between different crimes in different places. The analysis is then used to provide insights that can drive or support law enforcement investigations, operations and strategy, as well as influencing government policy and decisions.
