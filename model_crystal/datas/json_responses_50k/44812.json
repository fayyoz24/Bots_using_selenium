    "summary": "Hi! I'm Thomas, the CEO and co-founder of Tasman, a boutique analytics consultancy that turns disorganised data into real business value. I'm proud to lead a company that empowers fast-growing businesses to implement sophisticated analytics they own themselves. Using strategic thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication, I help clients build their data infrastructure and assemble a top notch team so they can gain (even more) data insights.\n\nWith a foundation in theoretical physics and over a decade of industry experience, my expertise lies in analytics, business intelligence, and data science. From computational genetics research at KU Leuven to heading the data team at Peak Labs, where I played a crucial role in the company's expansion from 3 million to over 35 million users (and acquisition), my journey has been deeply rooted in the power of data.\n\nAt Tasman, we believe that the best companies leverage data as a superpower \u2014 any company can do so, too. Building technical infrastructure disconnected from business value is doomed to fail, hence we emphasise on a centralised, domain-modelled architecture and strive to deploy data effectively through self-service access to a single source of truth.\n\nProjects I've worked on span multiple mobile app and commerce companies, including Canon, Heist Studios, The Business of Fashion, Asana Rebel, Kaia Health, ResQ Club, and The Collective. We specialise in delivering fast value, working in condensed sprints that focus on implementing data analytics pipelines, producing data models, and modelling multi-touch attribution.\n\nOn a more personal note, I have a keen interest in wildlife conservation. I'm certified in fauna conservation and I can recognise 20 types of duck!\n\nIf you're struggling with data strategy and/or implementation, or simply have an interest in data, please feel free to reach out to me. Let's explore how Tasman can help you transform your data into value.\n\nYou can contact me at mailto:thomas@tasman.ai or visit our website at http://tasman.ai for more information.",

The assumption was that by working smarter, the new approach could deliver better insight, faster and cheaper.\n\nThe critical success factor for the project was the collaborative working that combined the right skills and talent from both teams. This was made possible by the flexibility and determination of the team members and the agile approach adopted, including working in short, weekly sprints and using cloud-based collaborative tools. The judges were impressed by a strong example of business-critical integration.\n\n(Read more at http://www.dataiq.co.uk/talent2014/winner/intergrated-data-planning-team#sthash.7jJTlomQ.dpuf)",
