    "summary": "I design products and services based on a human centered approach. Raised with two cultures (Dutch and Palestinian) different from each other, I started to wonder why people do things in certain ways. I developed an open attitude and became more and more curious about what lies behind people's actions and behaviour. \n\nAs a designer I use my expertise in qualitative research to address people's needs and understand the situation.  I translate these needs into design guidelines and use them while designing products and services. My ambition is to design for a sustainable world; sustainable in how we behave towards each other and towards the planet.\n\nWhat I do:\n\n- UX research\n  Context mapping, Observational studies, Interviews, Surveys, usability testing (GetFeedback, Hotjar).\n\n- UX Design \n  Design the customer journeys and interface of landing pages, prototypes, websites, apps.\n\n- Lean startup innovation\n  Design and set up the right experiments to quickly test the risky assumptions of your product or  business idea.\n\n- Graphic design\n  Design of logos & identity.",
