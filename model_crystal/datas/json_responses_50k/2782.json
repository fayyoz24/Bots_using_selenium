    "summary": "I was born in Barcelona from French parents, we lived for a bit in France and later moved to Hungary and Egypt. It was this multi-cultural environment in which I was evolving that pushed me to pursue my studies in the UK and the Netherlands. It is also this lifestyle that made me curious, always curious about anything and everything! I try new hobbies every three months, right now I do a lot of embroidery. I love to spend time outside (of both my house and country) to get inspired by what\u2019s surrounding me. I often get lost in Netflix series like Explained or Youtube channels like Vox and TED. \n\nThis curiosity and tendency to try new things led me to discover design and the potential this field has in creating meaningful solutions. After graduating from a Master\u2019s in Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London, I realised I wanted to have a more human-centred approach when tackling and solving complex issues, especially the ones affecting our planet and the people. Integrating Design for Interaction, a second Master\u2019s at Delft University of Technology, has provided me with what I am certain are essential tools and ways of thinking to shape an ecologically and socially sustainable future. \n\nI get my energy from working on challenging and inspiring projects, within a multi-cultural, and possibly -disciplinary, team. This is what you can expect me to do:\n- Start at the fuzzy frond end of a project and see problems as opportunities\n- Plan and conduct research to meet user needs and create/enhance user experiences\n- Facilitate creative workshops with relevant stakeholders\n- Identify trends and themes to develop meaningful and inspiring insights \n- Deliver and communicate the outcomes of the project with a clear and compelling message\n\nReach out with any random fact or if you have some tips and leads that will enable me to continue my explorative journey :)",

When I joined, the team wanted to change the system by which students enrol to attend the workshops. I was put in charge of that task and managed to elaborate an enrolment system dealing with more than 500 students. Besides, I supported the planning and organisation of the course and assisted one of the three workshop hosts every week. This course also allowed me to dive into a certain topic every week.",
