Oftentimes, engineers and architects are at the forefront of decisions made about the choice of material used in a building or the location but the skills of a material chemist are vital in material choice, specifically because sustainable alternatives to building materials are core. This workshop brought forth some specific edcuation criteria such as the use of supplementary cementitious materials, natural superplasticizers, and use of local aggregates as an alternative.
