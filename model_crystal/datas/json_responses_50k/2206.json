I created consensus with finance and architects how to implement these changes. I documented this for the implementation within the IT department. Because I understood the business content and the technical possibilities we could choose the most cost efficient strategy, also taking advantage of automation possibilities and controls to improve straight through processing and first time right delivery. I advised the project leader about needed actions and planning and I created documentation for senior management decision making. \n\n(2)\tI translated the SII review changes (for Q4 2023) into the required changes for the financial control and financial reporting chain. Together with finance I documented the required changes and documented these for the implementation teams.\n\n(3)\tI improved the reporting chain for both IFRS and Solvency II by automating manual work, creating automated controls and creating dashboards which show the progress and status of the chain.\n\n(4)\tI analyzed the KPI dashboard for the top management in order to automate the process and get faster and better management accounting insights with less costs.\n\n(5)\tI helped with the migration of different SAP Fico ledger elements. I guided the process of collecting the requirements. I mapped the data flows and how these data flows needed to be translated from the different transition architectures. \n\n(6)\tI created a roadmap for the corporate tax domain. I analyzed which changes were needed in order to smoothen the complete reporting and declaration process. I estimated the expected implementation cost. With the corporate tax team, we decided which changes had the best business case. I implemented these most beneficial changes with different scrum teams. \n\nThis was all in a scrum, SAFe environment.\n\nCertification:\n\u2714 Togaf 9 Certified (2021)",
