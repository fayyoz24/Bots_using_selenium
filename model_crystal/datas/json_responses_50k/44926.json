    "summary": "KPN:\n\nKPN in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany \nKPN provides high-quality telephone, Internet and television services and products and is an all-round provider of ICT services. Consumers in the Netherlands take fixed and mobile telephony, Internet and TV from KPN. Business customers use our entire array of innovative and reliable services. They include everything from telephony, Internet and data traffic/management all the way through to the management of ICT services. In Germany, Belgium and elsewhere in Western Europe, the services of the KPN group consist mainly of mobile telephony.\n\nMy Specialties\n\ntelecommunication, mobile, data, voip, voice, internet\nBy giving technical support to customers, which have subscribed to the KPN Business DSL, the knowledge of Software and Hardware has increased substantially. Also deducing complicated problems to simple solutions has become hereby a second nature.\n\nWith the latest introduction last year of KPN Online Services, also the different techniques of supporting Webhosting, Exchange, DNS, Backup Software and different kinds of storage and sharing programs online, have had an increasing impact of differentiation in my profession. Needless to say is, that it also had an huge impact on the knowledge I already possessed.\n\nFinding and creating solutions for all kind of problems is my drive to excel. Going baldly where no man has gone before, seems to be a bit Star Trek alike, but describes mostly what my goals are. Therefore I always live by my motto: Even if not, then still....\n\nSpecialties: Analytic, Solution-driven, Eager Learner, Impact-analist, Spider in a Web",

It was a big learning period where I finally found out what suited me best. Not the sale, but the service. For some period I also did the Service-desk. This has changed my life and career to what I am right now. A person always trying to see the positive side of bad things that can happen to anyone. Trying to get a smile of hapiness on a hardened or disappointed face.",
