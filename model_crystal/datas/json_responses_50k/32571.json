Even though I joined the organisation as an intern, I was trusted with important responsibilities. We had to live and work on site and work alongside people with different cultural backgrounds from various other countries, which helped me not just develop as a person but also made me more sensitive towards how as humans we are destroying our surroundings rapidly.I was involved in making shuttering out of discarded petrol pipes to using building materials made out of tetra packs.I have gained hands on experience as I worked on site which involved carpentry,concreting and was trained by very talented masons who were part of matrumandir construction. I even worked on designing of community, detail drawing and planning, building services drawings,3D and community services on site and in Auroville.",
