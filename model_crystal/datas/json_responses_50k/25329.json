With the concept of \"Remote Building Management\",  MPL offers a service to owners and users of buildings which on the one hand simplyfies their organizations and on the other hand saves costs. \nMPL takes the lead in the development of what is called \"Smart Buildings.\" Contemporary new and renovated buildings are stuffed up with electronics. This includes sensors, cameras, open and close systems, burglar alarms, fire alarms, temperature monitoring, quality of IT network signals, identity checks, access controls, determining maintenance / repair needs, light monitoring. Normally, in construction, the above systems are installed with their own software package: Cameras with their own camera software, opening and closing systems with their own package and so on. \nMPL acts differently. MPL brings all software packages from all subsystems into one software platform, called Winguard. MPL integrates all these functions in one system. The data generated by all subsystems are collected in one large database. Using analytical tools, MPL can generate useful information from these \u201cbig data\u201d with which the user / owner of the building can take decisions and measures to reduce costs, make the building greener, and optimize the use of the building.",
