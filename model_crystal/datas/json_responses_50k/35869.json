    "summary": "I am a highly experienced Materials Scientist and Assistant Professor for the Department of Design Production at the University of Twente. I have proven skills and strengths in working with industry stakeholder teams and external agencies to develop industry-disrupting products. I combine this with a consistent record of driving quality improvements to operational processes within the 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing spaces. \n\nAs a skilled 3D Printing thought leader, I have in-depth expertise across the manufacturing and regulatory field and use these skills to deliver quality assurance benchmarks. Motivated and focused, with a keen appreciation of the needs of industry, management, and partner agencies, I have a proven track record in establishing professional relationships, negotiating with internal and external stakeholders and deliver product development objectives within highly regulated environments.\n\nI am skilled in client engagement and project management, successfully working with public, private, and academic organisations. Here, I deliver increases in consciousness on key areas of sustainability to ensure effective adaptation and deliver manufacturing transformation for global companies. I also advise industry partners on Material & Process Development, Certification, and AM Design. \n\nWhile I thrive on maximising contribution through inspection and compliance best practice, I am very personable and easily facilitate clear communication with multiple teams. I believe that this is a critical aspect to delivering the high levels of quality and innovation demanded by the 3D Printing industry.",

RAMLAB (Rotterdam Additive Manufacturing LAB), in collaboration with various organisations, has created the WAAMpeller, the world\u2019s first 3D printed ship\u2019s propeller for the maritime sector.\nRAMLAB is the first field lab with 3D metal printers that focuses on the maritime industry. The prototype propeller is 1,350 mm in diameter, made from a nickel aluminium bronze alloy, and weighs about 400 kilograms (882 pounds).\nThe goal of the project is to build more efficient, cost efficient, and environmentally friendly ships. 3D printing is a great medium for that, as it uses the minimum amount of material required and works mostly autonomously.\nBecause 3D printed materials are built up layer by layer, they display different physical properties in different directions: a characteristic known as anisotropy. Steel or casted materials, on the other hand, are isotropic: they have the same properties in all directions. Because of this critical difference, one of the first steps was to carry out extensive testing of the material properties of the printed material.\nThe printing of the propeller was rather complex, as the propeller has a double-curved, geometric shape with some tricky overhanging sections. But with additive manufacturing, you can print most metallic components, so there is a lot of potential for the future.\nThis first prototype WAAMpeller will be used for display purposes, and planning for a second example is already underway, which the team aims to install later this year.\nThe collaboration of companies working on the propellers consists of Damen Shipyards Group, RAMLAB, Promarin, Autodesk and Bureau Veritas.\nAside from the huge WAAMpeller, RAMLAB also 3D prints smaller ship\u2019s propellers from stainless steel.\n\nsource: WAAMPELLER IS THE WORLD\u2019S FIRST 3D PRINTED SHIP\u2019S PROPELLER - www.materialdistrict.com\n",

Here, I developed strong research outcomes, including leading welding spine and additive manufacturing group\u2019s activities using the project to develop the foundation of RAMLAB\u2019s success in producing high quality, certified metal parts. I also performed exploratory research on multi-material WAAM, with the findings being used as a foundation for the Grade2XL (Horizon 2020) programme.\nOverseeing end-to-end project lifecycles, I developed a robust hypothesis and authored a winning proposal as well as delivering research, analysis and guidance on real-world applications. These findings have been published in numerous scientific journal papers and I have also presented my findings at international conferences. \nCoaching and mentoring 10 master\u2019s students, I ensured each student realised their potential and made useful contributions to their field of study. I also facilitated the knowledge transfer between researchers of the Aim2XL research programme and the main industrial partner, RAMLAB.\nSummary:\nThe GradWAAM project explored the possibility of creating large-scale structural components with functionally graded metallurgical and mechanical properties by Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). Using Additive Manufacturing enables the production of products-on-demand, delivering reduced time to market, reduced waste material and a lower carbon footprint. \nAdditively manufactured metal components are produced by the deposition of liquid metal to a near net shape. This provides the unique opportunity to tailor the local process conditions and even alter the chemical composition locally in the weld pool to induce specific desired properties. Using graded functionality leads to revolutionary product design and improvements in the service performance of structural components.",

Here, I developed a new heat treatment approach for producing trailing arms resulting in higher mechanical performance, cost reduction via energy consumption reduction and different alloying, successfully delivering a 30% saving in energy costs while delivering the same performance. \n\nMy research also resulted in the company adopting self-developed processing strategy for their future product line, including aligning manufacturing with the new framework for alloy design optimisation.",
