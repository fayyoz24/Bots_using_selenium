I chose a biomedical company because of the rigorous nature of the regulatory environment they work within \u2013 this provided me with a very structured and accurate perspective of quality demands, efficiency requirements and core competencies necessary within the industry.  \n\u2022\tI worked closely with Abbot Vascular in Clonmel for the purposes of this study. I gained invaluable insight on how their company works in particularly their supply chain at a practical level. \n\u2022\tI delivered a presentation on my critical analysis of how the company operated including any recommendations/changes I would make if I were in charge.  \n\u2022\tThis challenge allowed me to put the theory I learned into practice, significantly enhancing my total learning experience.\n",
