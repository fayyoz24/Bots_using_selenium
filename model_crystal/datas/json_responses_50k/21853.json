    "summary": "I have done more than 20 years in Shell. Having started as a scientist, I moved into Downstream technologies (catalytic cracking, hydrocracking and thermal cracking), followed by some engineering work, technology licensing (Shell FCCU process) and some project execution at Shell Pernis Refinery. Since 2006, I have been working in Shell Upstream in various engineering management functions. \n\nI carry a wide range of skills, some of them are due to my scientific background \u2013 PhD in Physical Chemistry, earned prior to joining Shell followed by some 30 publications in renowned research journals. Soft qualities include logical and analytical approach, providing the structure and space (prioritising, planning, goal setting) without overpowering others, striving for creative and optimal solutions, leading by example and respect for the people.",
