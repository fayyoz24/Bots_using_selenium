    "summary": "I have always been interested in data.\nHowever, back in the day this wasn\u2019t always evident. I recall a day when I was young where I took a piece of paper and enumerated every letter I came across in my book. End result: the letter \u2018E\u2019 was most common, letters such as \u2018Q\u2019 and \u2018X\u2019 the least. \nThe analytical aspect of this exercise is quite easy. But how could this possibly benefit me. I recently philosophized about this. A possible added value could be a better grasp of the occurrence of letters in the Dutch language, making solving puzzles easier. \n\nIn my opinion, the analytical and business side of data should go hand in hand. Always.\nMy passion lies in solving problems to make thing better, more efficient, using the innovative technologies and tools that are currently available. With the rising importance of AI, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and all the other buzzwords the world of Data & Analytics has become even more interesting than it already was. Professions such as data translators, data analysts and data scientists who can understand the need of the business and have the know-how to solve specific problems are rising in importance.\n\nWhat can we do with these developments and how can we make sure businesses \u00e1nd people profit from these vast amounts of available data? Whether it is to determine, visualize, analyze or solve a problem. I love to explore these questions in a team of motivated and diverse group of enthusiasts where we face new challenges whenever a problem is solved. \n\nHave I made you more interested in Data? I am always looking for new challenges, new adventures and new opportunities to help companies grow in their data proficiency.\n\nReach out to me via a DM or invite me on LinkedIn.",

During these six months several solutions were implemented such as a churn prediction, new SLA reporting and KPI dashboards. The way of working was by means of Scrum with sprints of 4 weeks. The employees of KIS also received training to be able to make their own dashboards. Python was used to do the analyses, in combination with displaying the results in Microsoft PowerBI using a connection with an Azure Database where all the data was stored.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\u2022\tBusiness analysis on requirements to make the client more data driven;\n\u2022\tFeature engineering;\n\u2022\tFeature selection;\n\u2022\tBuilding (mathematical) models;\n\u2022\tVisualizing the data in a product that is clear to the customer using Power BI.\n\nResult:\n\u2611 Working Data Lake with a connection to several databases.\n\u2611 Several PowerBI dashboards.\n\u2611 NPS prediction model & churn prediction model.\n\u2611 Increased NPS of the client.",
