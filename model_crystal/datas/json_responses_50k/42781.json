I then validated them with A/B tests, and depending on the results, my team and I made decisions to implement the feature. This approach allowed us to fully increase user activation by 500%, increase 30-day retention by 7%, and reduce the cost of user acquisition by an average of 300%.\n\n\u2022  Implemented a Scrum/Agile process for a team of 10 people (eight engineers, one designer and one QA which allowed us to create an accurate Roadmap for the future. It also increased the development team's involvement in the business strategy and got QA and designers involved in the overall process.\n\n\u2022 Communicated with stakeholders and partners to understand deeper their needs, created a roadmap and managed the development team to implement functionality in a timely manner.\nInvented and implemented a monetization system into the product. After many trials, I found a monetization system that benefits us and pays off the product. Because of this, we have been able to make our marketing more aggressive, which allows us to grow faster.",

I figured out that expanding the payment options for users could bring at least a 50% increase in paying customers. Since it was difficult to implement, I created a prototype concept and we tested it. The result exceeded our expectations\nand increased the number of paying users by 75%.\n\n\u2022 Developed an onboarding system with rewards and achievement incentives that increased 30-day user retention from 1% to 14% and increased conversion of free users to paying users by 40%.\n\n\u2022 Constantly updated backlog with hypotheses found through data analysis GA, GTM, Hotjar)\n\n\u2022 Successfully implemented Agile/Scrum processes for the team, improving documentation, communication, and understanding of team goals among the team",
