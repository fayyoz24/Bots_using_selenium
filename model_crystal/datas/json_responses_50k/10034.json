    "summary": "FOOD WRITER\nAfter many years of traveling throughout the world and eating out thousands of times in restaurants and on the street, I started to use my knowledge about good food by writing about food in local magazines and running three restaurants for a period of two years in Singapore. An English steakhouse, a temporary Australian and an Italian restaurant. Now, back in the Netherlands, I decided to combine my four passions in live, travel, food, photography and writing. I invent modern recipes for cookbooks, travel for food related articles and make pictures of places and dishes. If not published elsewhere, the results go on line on www.remcoosculiflowers.com, my Dutch food blog. \n\nSpecialties: Travel, Food and wine Writing in Dutch and English including photography.",
