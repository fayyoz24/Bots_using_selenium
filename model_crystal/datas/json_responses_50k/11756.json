    "summary": "I am a third culture kid, who was born in the Netherlands. At the age of 5 I managed my first expatriation relocating to Germany where I attended an international school for the first time. During those years, I not only learnt to speak German fluently, but also English became as good as my native language. Before my next relocation to Asia in 2012, I had already grasped important qualities that were taught from a young age on. One of these qualities being communicative and openness to different cultures. In 5th grade, I had to design a project from scratch with two fellow classmates. We had to closely collaborate whilst also respecting each other\u2019s ideas and values. Being respectful in communication is one of the most important skillsets one can have. \n\nFrom 2012 to 2014 I furthered my school career in Hongkong/China, attending both an American curriculum as well as a British International School. I took active part in the FOBISIA international sports competition where a selection of students from a range of schools in Asia Pacific gathered to compete in swimming, track and field, soccer and basketball competitions. The FOBISIA Games were organized in Beijing, China and Seoul, South Korea. Not only did I make new friends at these competitions, I also learned how to successfully work in teams, and I got exposed to different cultures and country dynamics.\n\nAfter 3 years in Asia I relocated to Germany and returned to Frankfurt International School for a successful graduation in 2019. Being an international citizen, I not only learned to manage change and be culturally adaptable, but I was also taught many more skills and competencies such as being a risk taker, drive innovation, and being adaptable to changing environments. \n\nAs I like to perform in teams, for 3 consecutive years I was part of the FIS girls\u2019 soccer team. From being the captain in Junior Varsity leading the team to many wins and tournament wins, 2 years in a row, to leading the defense in Varsity girls. As part of Operation Smile, I have been performing voluntary work (e.g raising money, awareness, etc.) to help children with a clef lip pre, during and post-surgery. It felt great making a difference in someone\u2019s life. \n\nI received both my High School Diploma and my International Baccalaureate Diploma in 2019. From 2020 until 2022 I am studying Law at Maastricht University in the Netherlands with the ambition to become a successful lawyer.",
