    "summary": "Hospitality and communication make the difference for me. I strongly believe that the facility department plays a significant (leading) role in increasing colleagues   and clients awareness of the possibilities to reduce carbon footprint for a safe and sustainable future. I am used to direct interaction with the management team an to co-operate closely with all company departments.  I have (inter) national  experience in budgeting, cost responsibility so a direct influence on profit and loss.  \n\u201cService is not just a word for him; it is a way of living\u201d.  This compliment from a former employer describes exactly my attitude and the way that I hope that my (former) colleagues and clients thinks about me.  \n\nSpecialties: facility management, hospitality, real estate, sale of office, lease contract negotiations, office layout planning, refurbishment, security planning, health and safety, car fleet management, mobile phones management, purchasing, suppliers management, maintenance management",
