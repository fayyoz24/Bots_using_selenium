I am passionate about all areas of STEM. My goal is to further my research in pure mathematics, Number Theory in particular.\n\nI consider myself an outlier: aged twelve, university student; fourteen, university teaching assistant and undergraduate researcher; fifteen, university Maths Club president; sixteen, BSc (Mathematics and Physics) graduate; eighteen, BSc (Honours) graduate and graduate teaching assistant; nineteen, MSc (Distinction) and PhD candidate.\n\nAlongside my academic path, since the age of ten, I was featured in all types of media due to my unique life experiences and numerous volunteer efforts. For example, I have delivered well over fifty talks including at the World Science Festival in Australia and the Reading Festival in the UAE; founded an online learning hub; and started a monthly radio show to help motivate young people.\n\nDiscovering, contributing and sharing are my lifelong goals.",

This was the way I explored maths and it enabled me to cover all the maths curriculum from year 1 to year 13 before the age of 5. You will be surprised how quick and how easy you can grasp the concept by this vertical way of learning. And did anyone tell me to do it this way? No! I was just curious about this funny stuff and kept exploring. At that time (I think I was only two!!), I knew nothing about what year 1, year 2\u2026year 13 meant. I ignore these year levels and keep exploring upwards. This is the reason why I won\u2019t specify the year levels in my videos to remove your psychological barriers. I could do it, so, I am sure you can do it too. Maths is fun!...\""
