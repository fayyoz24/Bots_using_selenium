Such a system is to be compatible with wireless read-out, setting the ground for the future development of smart sensing RFID tags. The FlexSMELL technology platform will be in principle suitable for different applications with the main ones envisaged for the in the field of logistics for the monitoring of perishable goods along their transport and storing, though smart packaging solutions. Teaching and training strategies will be implemented to prepare the next generation of scientists in this fast developing strategic research area. Eventually this effort will leverage the strength of the EU in organic electronics and micro-technologies for sensing applications as well as their integration into systems providing services to the individuals and to the community in the areas of food control though smart packaging, but also health, environment, communication and security",
