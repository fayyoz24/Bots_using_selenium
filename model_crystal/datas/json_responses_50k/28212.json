Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have been used previously to target a duplex region between the junctions of a 3-turn tensegrity triangle motif. The motif consists of three helices directed along linearly independent directions and forms a three-dimensional crystalline lattice stabilized via sticky end cohesion. It has also been demonstrated that it is possible to target an oligopurine sequence that spans a crossover junction. Here, this research used a TFO to target one edge of a 2-turn asymmetric triangle motif containing an appropriately embedded oligopurine binding site which spans one of the junctions. Formation of DNA triplex within the motif was characterized by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Bands with a lower mobility were clearly\nevident for the modified motif molecules in the presence of the TFO. The research also targeted a TFO containing a photocross-linking agent, psoralen, at its 5\u2019-end; the cross-linked products were analyzed on a denaturing gel. Results indicate that a TFO can be targeted specifically to a site spanning the junction in the tensegrity triangle motif. Triplex formation could be exploited to direct any reactive group to unique locations within a DNA nanostructure.",
