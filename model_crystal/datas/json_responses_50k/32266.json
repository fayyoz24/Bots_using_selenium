In my work, I make it my responsibility to create the perfect conditions for my team members and myself to succeed, using my sensitive leadership skills. \n\nI thrive in complex situations, and adapt easily to new circumstances. Even though I\u2019m very flexible, I always keep the end goal in mind and make sure others stick to their responsibilities. I create order from chaos. I get it done. \n\nI\u2019m a strategic thinker, collecting inputs from others and analysing those to draw the best conclusion, suitable for specific situations. Every experience is a learning opportunity to present the best version of myself. \n\nMy key expertise is on natural ingredients for cosmetics, food and health products (including medicinal and aromatic plants, essential oils, vegetable oils and extracts), spices, herbs and tea",
