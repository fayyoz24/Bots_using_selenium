    "summary": "I am an Aeronautical Engineering graduate from Inholland University of Applied Sciences Delft, specializing in Design and Development. The program taught me how to apply technical and scientific knowledge to design, construct, sell, use, and maintain aircraft in day-to-day practice. During my studies, I gained valuable experience through internships and full-time positions at Air New Zealand as an Engineering Intern and Support Engineer. Additionally, I served as a day editor for the Dutch aviation news website Up in the Sky.\n\nI graduate at E-Flight Academy in Teuge, where I built a simulator for the first EASA-certified Electric Aircraft, the Pipistrel Velis Electro. My work on this project was awarded the Dutch Aeronautical and Aerospace Award of 2022 from the NLF Foundation, highlighting the significance of the project. After graduation, I continued working at E-Flight as a Simulator Developer, gaining further experience in developing and testing flight simulators.\n\nRecently, I joined KLM Engineering & Maintenance as an Aircraft Systems Engineer, where I hope to continue to develop my expertise in aircraft maintenance. I am excited to continue building upon my experiences and contributing to the aviation industry.",
