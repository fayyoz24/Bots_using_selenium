    "summary": "A bit about me. I studied at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam and completed both my Bachelor in International Business Administration and my Master in Marketing Management. Due to the work of my father, I had the pleasure of growing up in three different countries, through which I had the opportunity of becoming fluent in German, English, Dutch and Spanish. Moreover, I also gained quite an understanding of how to work in diverse settings and understand various perspectives. In a professional setting I like to consider myself to be a quick learner, very approachable, ambitious and a good team player. My main interests are marketing, music, photography, entertainment and technology.",
