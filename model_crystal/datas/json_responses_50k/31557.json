    "summary": "My name is Marnix Rollfs of Roelofs a Project Manager at Talmark. As a Project Manager I learned to make a working project planning, to present the ideas and advice the clients, and to manage the teams as effective and efficient as possible in order to get the desired end results. However there is still a lot for me to discover and explore in the world of project management for a Marketing company!\nBefore I started working at Talmark, I graduated from Inholland University of Applied Sciences in The Hague, majoring in International Media and Entertainment Management. During my studies, I have learned things that made me grow as a student into a professional who is ready for the real world. Working on different projects and assignments that are reflecting on the real world gave me a good impression of what to expect. \n\nI aim to get the best out of myself by keep searching for a challenge.  My strengths are:\n- Professionalism;\n- Planning;\n- Creative;\n- Communication;\n- Team player;\n- Eager to learn.",

During the three weeks in M\u00e1laga, I had Spanish classes at a Spanish school every morning until 1. The only language we were allowed to speak was Spanish since the teachers did not understand any other language. I received a certificate for passing the first level of Spanish.\n\nBesides the three weeks of classes, I have also been working on a project for two weeks. This was an assignment from a real client in M\u00e1laga. The client has a cooking school, which is called Laboratorio De Sabores, and he wanted to create more brand awareness in the region of Andalusia. I have been working on making a promotional video for this company to show his target group what his company has to offer. The client was very happy with the results and the end product I delivered.",

From this moment on I created the planning for the entire project (start to go live moment), and started scheduling the necessary team members.\n\nDuring the project I was constantly testing and checking in with the project teams. Besides that I was in close contact with the clients on a weekly basis. We discussed the progress, compared the made planning and the current project phases. I also gave advice to the clients when there were questions and/or requests along the project. \n\nSome of the projects I have worked on:\n\n- werkenbijtennet.nl - karriere.tennet.de\n- ikwordfloormaster.nl - screenmaster.nl\n- bluewaverecruitment.nl - bluepeaks.nl\n- 2at.nl\n- groenehartservice.nl\n\nBesides the \u201cstandard\u201d Projects, I was also responsible for several development projects of existing career websites. I had weekly or monthly calls with the clients to discuss their questions, requests and advise them if necessary. We worked in sprints between 2 weeks and 1 month. Therefor, I had to plan everything carefully, to meet the deadline and deliver everything up to standard.",
