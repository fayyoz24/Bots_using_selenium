    "summary": "I'm an accredited management consultant and certified project manager with five years of experience helping purpose-driven organizations transform their impact through strategic development, fundraising & applied research.\n\nThis experience has given me a deep understanding of the challenges involved in growing an organization. Working at the intersection of research and practice, I have had the opportunity to help organizations address and respond to emerging challenges in their funding and strategic environments.\n\nI am passionate about social innovation and committed to navigating challenges with warmth and insight. My recent MSc. in Social Inequalities, which explored how systems of power can be transformed, has provided me with a strong foundation for my work as I undertake a fully funded PhD in the TU Dublin School of Business & Entrepreneurship. This research focuses on defining Ireland\u2019s philanthropic DNA through an exploration of Irish giving culture and philanthropic infrastructure. ",
