    "summary": "I am a PhD candidate at Delft University of Technology working on Internet of Robotic Things where I combine mobile networked robotic systems with IoT applications of sensing and wireless communication. My PhD is supported by the European Project InSecTT (Intelligent Secure Trustable Things) which focuses on developing edge processing algorithms on resource constrained devices under the purview of creating white box AI which can be utilized across industries. I am also the co-founder of ZED or Zero Energy Development, a TU Delft startup focusing on Energy Harvesting and batteryless wireless IoT technology. I also love making things and am a founding member of Delft Open Hardware, a community which fosters the spirit of open source and freedom in hardware innovation and a mentor to the Robotics Student Association in Delft",

My team and I worked on ultra high accuracy, low frequency seismic MEMS sensors originally developed for gravitational wave experiments which we re-imagined as instruments to improve PET Scan imaging. I had the pleasure to work alongside a wonderfully diverse team of TU Delft honours students. \n\nThe culmination of our work was published as an article in the CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation. In it we explore the first stages of a new product development process, drawing insights into an optimal approach to follow for coming up with new ideas. Illustrating this process of translating a CERN technology into an application which benefits the society at large, the paper exemplifies the importance of open innovation in the idea generation and selection processes.",
