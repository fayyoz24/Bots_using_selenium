In 3-months time, with Platform's Founder support, I created\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba a new business plan for PortalYogi, with a subscription as a main offering\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba product vision\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba launch strategy\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba community vision and strategy\n\nMy responsibilities also included\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba new website concept and execution\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba sales funnel planning and execution\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba ongoing email communication with existing customers and future prospects\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba restructuring of existing online courses into a subscription content\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba adjustment of the educational platform for a subscription product hosting (there was a lot of hacking included) \n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba community engagement strategy (included hiring and training of a suitable community manager)\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba defining and monitoring of KPIs\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba long-term growth strategy (including paid and non-paid channels)\n\nWhat were my biggest learnings from this project?\n1) Hire great specialists to get things done faster and better. It's not always the smartest thing to hack everything.\nI pretty much pull this all out all on my own. I thought we were saving time and money by not hiring contractors for graphic design or basic landing page coding (and I managed to do them myself). Now I would have spent my time on more strategic projects (like PR and partnerships for launch and entrusted more technical tasks to specialists. Focus is everything - put it into your strengths and areas where you're irreplaceable.\n\n2) Plan but don't over-think\nIt's great to have a strategy and plan in place. But it's even more important to have enough time to execute on it. You don't have to draw or describe every single element of the plan. Start moving as fast as you can and work out details on the go.",
