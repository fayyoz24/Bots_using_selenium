    "summary": "Hi! Just another tech guy helping Snowflake customers solve complex technical issues. \ud83e\udd13\n\nWith a couple of Cloud and Data platform certifications up my sleeve and some Python coding skills, I craft solutions and build apps around AI using tools and platforms like Snowflake, Streamlit & OpenAI.\n\nWhen not taming tech beasts, you'll catch me reading business and personal development books. So far, I'm 5 attempts closer to building a successful profitable personal business over the weekends.\n\nI always love meeting new people and working together on something cool (or hot). So, whether you want to talk tech, swap photography tips, explore astronomy, or exchange startup dreams, let's connect and explore exciting possibilities and create a future that's both innovative and fun. \u2728",
