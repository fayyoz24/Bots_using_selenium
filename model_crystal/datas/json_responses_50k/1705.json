    "summary": "Since June 2018 (and in 2011-14), I have been involved in research and research coordination on urban food systems in Africa, urban-rural linkages, food systems innovations, and demographic aspects of food and nutrition security in Africa. More broadly, I work on the complex links between the demographic and climate change, socio-economic development of countries, and food and nutrition security. Demographic issues, such as e.g. the population growth, labour force evolution, population aging, urbanisation, migration (economic, environmental, conflict related, irregular and other), are at the heart of my research. In my work, I combine my expertise in demography with that in economics and can further grow. I am proud to be part of a great multidisciplinary team at WEcR, which explores these issues for a better future of all of us.\nI am a statistician and demographer, have PhD degree in mathematical demography, MSC degree in statistics and econometrics, and years of experience in research on demographics, economics, and in coordination of complex international projects. Through my career (2000-11 & 2014-17) at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) I accumulated significant expertise in quantitative analysis of demographic consequences (killings, missing persons, exhumations, forced migration etc.) of war crimes and other violations of the International Humanitarian Law, in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, and Cambodia (for ECCC in 2009). At ICTY I acted as the head of Demographics Unit and expert witness for the Prosecution. I testified about 20 times as an expert witness in ICTY trials including the highest profile cases, such as SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC, RADOVAN KARADZIC, RATKO MLADIC and many others.\nPreviously, I also worked on research positions in the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in The Hague (1991-2000) and the Warsaw School of Economics (up to 2000).",

Issues, such as the population growth, labour force evolution, migration (economic, environmental, irregular and other), urbanisation etc are at the heart of food security in many regions of the world. In my work, which becomes complex at times, I use my demographic expertise with that in agricultural economics. I am proud to be part of a fantastic team at WEcR which explores these issues for a better future of all of us.",
