    "summary": "I'm a design researcher (MSc in Industrial Design, PhD in product/user experience), head of the Interaction Design group and a fellow of the UT DesignLab. I study how the design of products and services influences people\u2019s behaviour and motivation with a specific interest in how products and services can support healthy behaviour and in how technology (interactive devices and wearables) can engage people in therapy at home. As a project leader in several design for behaviour change projects I have experience in developing services in collaboration with industrial parties. My scientific work has been published in journals in the design field as well as in health(care). I am co-editor of the book Design for behaviour change (sept 2017, Routledge) and editor of the Journal of Design Research.",

People who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias often face cognitive, behavioural and psychosocial difficulties, including impairment and degeneration of memory and of perceptions of identity. In a social context, this can cause difficulties of recognizing, relating to and empathising with other people. These difficulties often pose a challenge for engaging socially, reinforcing their effects and reducing personal well-being. ",

Our group generates knowledge on how to design for the interaction between people and the technology they surround themselves with. We focus on ways to design products and systems that people can understand and appreciate in a context where technological advancements fade the boundaries between hardware and software, device and users. In this context, we see it as the role of designers to integrate form, function, and to enrich human experience (i.e., meaning, emotion and (social) behaviour). With our research we aim to contribute to solving societal challenges of our time in domains such as sustainability, health, social connectedness and education.",
