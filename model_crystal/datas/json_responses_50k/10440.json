I have been involved as a full-time researcher in the topics of international law at the Philip C. Jessup international law moot court competition for 2 years. Afterward, I worked as a legal advisor to assist women in family and inheritance cases in Afghanistan. \nBesides that, as a volunteer assisted newcomers in the COA for 4 months. \nThroughout my career, I advanced my skills in communication, leadership, management, and teamwork.\nI believe that the things I learned and the skills I acquired is the greatest asset as a professional person for me.",
