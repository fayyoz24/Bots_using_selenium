    "summary": "Gender Team Lead and Senior Gender Advisor at KIT Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam. With a background in resource management, international development and the management of agricultural knowledge systems, Rhiannon's focus lies in gender equality in agricultural and environmental research and development. For 25 years, Rhiannon has worked on gender dynamics in agricultural development, agricultural innovation systems, social and environmental standards and certification, and social learning, as well as cross-cultural and development education. \n\nOver the past 8 years, Rhiannon\u2019s work has focused on supporting international agricultural and environmental research institutes, specifically CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) and Centers, with gender analysis, gender research and the institutional change needed to support gender integration and tranformatie change. She acted as interim Gender Research Coordinator for the CRP on Livestock and Fish (2014-2016), integrating gender analysis into technical, systems and value chain research, distilling entry points for institutionalizing gender research and integrating gender into a next phase proposal. From 2017-2019 she coordinated the CGIAR Collaborative Platform for Gender Research, which was housed in the CRP on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM), led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). She supported the development of a system-wide gender research agenda, profiling and making visible the gender research of the CGIAR system\u2019s 12 research programs and 15 Centers. In 2020 and 2021, Rhiannon was granted support from the NL-CGIAR partnership in the Senior Expert  to work with IFPRI in PIM\u2019s gender flagship, supporting and coordinating cross-system gender research. As part of the that work, she co-edited a system-wide book on CGIAR gender research entitled: Advancing gender equality through agricultural and environmental research \u2013 past, present and future (Pyburn & Eerdewijk eds 2021). \n\nRhiannon has a proven track record as a skilled and dynamic facilitator, analytical thinker and a good writer. She works well both independently and in collaboration with a team and is a natural partnership builder and networker. She is an excellent research manager and her strengths lie in pulling our higher level research for development questions across diverse gender research areas. She writes and publishes extensively (working papers, books and peer-reviewed articles).",
