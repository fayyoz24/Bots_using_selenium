I help my clients to achieve breakthrough thinking. Here are my 4 characteristics of companies who embrace deep change:\n1) Customer centricity - forget about lines of business or products managers who operate in silos.\n2) Seamless multi-channel experience \u2013 being able to star a transaction in branch and completing online without loss of information.\n3) Operational simplicity enabled through technology \u2013 analytical capabilities to understand customer needs out of the tons of data available; STP; paperless to name a few\n4) Agility and superior execution \u2013 gone are the projects where you need 2 years to deploy something. Things change too fast to be able to afford to wait this long.",
