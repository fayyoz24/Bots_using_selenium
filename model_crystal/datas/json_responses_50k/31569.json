    "summary": "Born and raised in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, I have always had a passion for two things: sports and (international) business. Sports has been influential in my life, both personally and professionally. After playing competitive field hockey for 18 years and practice competitive sailing for 8 years, I transitioned my passion for sport into a career. \n\nMy experience as a competitive athlete sharpened my communication and management skills. I am fortunate enough to have been exposed to many leadership experiences where I have applied these skills.\n\nInternational experience has always been appealing to me too. I have developed my understanding of the international (sports) business industry by working for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and studying in the United States. I completed my master\u2019s degrees in Business Administration and Sports Administration. The Master Business Administration helped me enhancing my core business competencies and I developed confidence to thrive as a strategic and resourceful professional. The Master of Sports Administration has given me these insights too, but I also had the opportunity to travel with the program and meet a lot of different areas of the sports industry as well as meet a lot of alumni.",
