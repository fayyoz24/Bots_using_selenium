    "summary": "As a passionate advocate for gender equality and social justice, I bring a unique perspective to the field of public policy. My Bachelor's degree in Political Philosophy and Critical Theory from Erasmus University College is where I found my passion for feminist philosophy in my capstone. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Public Policy and Human Development with a specialization in Social Protection at United Nations University - MERIT. As such, I have a strong foundation in both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical applications of gender-informed policy-making. I am deeply committed to using my skills and knowledge to advance policies that promote equity and inclusivity for all.\n\nWhether it's through research, advocacy, or community engagement, I am dedicated to using my expertise to create positive social impact. If you're looking for a dynamic, strategic, and thoughtful public policy professional with a passion for gender-informed policy-making, let's connect and explore how we can work together to make a difference.",
