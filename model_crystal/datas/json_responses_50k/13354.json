    "summary": "With quite some experience in change management and business development, I often get caught in the argument of \"people don't like change\". The interesting part is that everyone who would make that statement, holds a deep secret hope that I'll say something new to prove them wrong. And that by itself actually confirms that people DO like change... what is more - they WANT change. The trick is to deliver a change that actually makes sense to them, that connects to their values and beliefs for the future. Change, that says \"I see you, I need you, help me make the future awesome\". That's how you activate the fire in the human soul and then... well then, magic happens for the individual, for the business, for the community, for the whole world. \n.\nWith my strong analytical and organizational background in different industries, I have a diverse experience in project management, process development and stakeholder engagement. Having worked for small as well as international companies, I have developed a good set of skills in understanding different business needs as well as being flexible with solutions and approaches. Managing change has been an integral part of my career as most of my roles were focused on bringing innovation to the business. Engaging people in adopting new tools, processes or behaviours requires not only strong communication skills but also determination, empathy and understanding of the complexity for each stakeholder. Driving collaboration, designing and organizing inspiring trainings, working with people of different backgrounds and cultures, as well as supporting the business in developing both their strategy and their talents, gives me great personal fulfilment and motivates me to continue developing in the only constant there is - change management and transformation.",
