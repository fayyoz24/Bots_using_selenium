This presentation argues that, by infusing service-learning opportunities with faculty research, students gain valuable insight into the process of conducting future studies and often feel more connected to their program. In this presentation, the process of establishing a research based service-learning program was discussed from initializing such a project to the submission of a manuscript. The presenters will also provide preliminary qualitative data of student\u2019s perception of program allegiance along with their personal experience as the result of such research based service-learning programs. Discussion with the audience focused on implications of the research findings for counseling programs.",

Duties included maintaining school partnerships, grant writing, writing for the IRB applications, scheduling, training, assessment administration and scoring, and providing play therapy directly to children. In the second year, I became responsible for providing intensive instruction of child-centered play therapy principles and tenants, training for the administration of numerous assessments, and initiating role-play scenarios for new additions to the research team. Along with administrative duties, my other responsibilities also included introducing school district protocol, prompting parent-teacher consultations, and maintaining, shopping for, and maintaining multiple playrooms in the schools. Results and experiences during research and training phases were presented at state and national conferences, including Crimes Against Children Annual Conference, Texas Association for Play Therapy, and Texas Association for Counselor Education and Supervision.",
