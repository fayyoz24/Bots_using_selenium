    "summary": "I started working as an analyst and over the years I handled different kinds of situations in different economical situation including the crisis in 2008. My analytical skills are extremely good, I have a good overview very quickly.\nWhat you get with me is a personality that can cooperate very well, who is very thorough with working, paying attention on details and always meeting the deadlines. I have a drive to obtain good understanding of the areas, and I am eager to learn and develop. I can work independently but at the same time I really enjoy being part of a team.\n\nAs a top talent at IBM I had the opportunity to participate in a 4-weeks international consultancy program where we could offer our expertise to solve complex issues in less developed parts of the world, thus I had the chance in 2012 to spend this opportunity in China.",
