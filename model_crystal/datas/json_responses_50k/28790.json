Where? How? Well\u2026 As a current law major student, I knew that the only way to gain hands-on experience in fields like human rights and international public law is to find an internship where you could grow together with other inspiring legal professionals. \n\nWhat can I say\u2026 I could not be happier to join the dutch non-profit organization, the Centre for African Justice, Peace and Human Rights, which promotes justice, peace and human rights through raising awareness, capacity building, research (legal and otherwise), education, training and campaigning.\n\nMy specialized field of work \u2014 is sexual violence (SV) against the male gender. Yes, you understood right \u2014 AGAINST male gender:  our Team acknowledges that SV is experienced by all genders, but males constitute the focus of our work as in theory and practice, they are often overlooked as victims, and the field is so stigmatized that the silence and stigma surrounding this topic makes it even harder for the activist to support the victims.\n\nTogether with the Team, we conduct research (including legal research and research on the underlying causes of SV), publish magazines, and host annual conferences. I am very grateful for this exceptional opportunity, and let's see where this internship will guide me.",
