This award has been given on the \"Day of the Freelancer\" on April 2nd 2016.\n\nOver 10.000 freelancers competed in the Freelancer of the Year Awards, spread out over 10 categories. Based upon written reviews from former employers, managers and colleagues, a top 100 was established. The people in the top 100 were invited to record a pitch video, representing themselves, their company and their line of business. \n\nA shadow jury judged each pitch video and selected a top 3 for each category. The actual jury decided the winner of each category based on the written reviews, the pitch video and background research. Contestants were judged on several factors, like busness case, professional appearance, level of ambition and entrepeneurship. \n\nThe personalized results from the jury have been combined in a report which can be provided upon request.",

Initieel gebruikte zij Peter Connects voor het aannemen en doorverbinden van telefoongesprekken. De mensen op het contact center werkten al 20 \u00e0 30 jaar met deze software, waardoor zij de verandering met argusogen bekeken. Ik heb hen gerustgesteld door met ze in gesprek te gaan om te begrijpen waar zij tegenop zagen en hoe zij hun werk deden. Vervolgens heb ik hen trainingen aangeboden waarin ik op een rustige en heldere manier het nieuwe systeem heb uitgelegd en henzelf de ruimte heb gegeven om met het nieuwe systeem te oefenen. Door ze tegelijkertijd goed te informeren over wat er zou veranderen en waarom dit moest gebeuren kon ik het vertrouwen opbouwen wat uiteindelijk geleid heeft tot een succesvolle migratie.\n\nR.A.M.\nUitvoering: De afkorting van dit project staat voor \u201cRotterdamse Applicatie Migratie\u201d. Alle applicaties die in Rotterdam actief waren moeten worden gemigreerd naar een nieuwe IT-infrastructuur. Het was echter nog niet duidelijk om welke applicaties dit ging en wie hiervoor verantwoordelijk was. Ik heb de applicatie inventarisatie geleid en een bijdrage aan geleverd. Op basis van het resultaat van deze inventarisatie heb ik een plan van aanpak opgesteld en daarin duidelijk aangegeven welke rollen hierbij betrokken moesten worden, welke rol welke verantwoordelijkheden zou hebben en in hoeverre er mensen beschikbaar waren binnen de organisatie om deze rollen invulling te geven. Op basis van dit plan is vervolgens het project gestart om de migraties daadwerkelijk uit te voeren.",

Additionally, there was no Enterprise Architecture at the beginning of the project, nor was there an overview of the infrastructure, architecture, and of the applications and the application landscape, and insufficient description of all company processes.\n\nTo guarantee the project\u2019s success, I put together a study group and a reflection group where all the departments and teams of the organisation were represented. I also contracted external parties to work together with the organisation on a Project Start Architecture for the new office automation and a design brief for the new DMS. Taking small steps, I took the organisation by the hand and developed the different products. This led to an implementation plan supported throughout the entire organization, which made it possible for Phase 2 of the project (the actual realization thereof) to begin.",
