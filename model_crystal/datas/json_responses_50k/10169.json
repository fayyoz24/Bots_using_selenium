This PhD-project aims to fill the gap in historical mortality research by focusing on the influence of the number of siblings on mortality chances of children under the age of five from a comparative approach. Because the way in which humans organize families varies around the globe, the overall picture of the human family is one of flexibility between and within populations. Moreover, this affects the way in which family members cooperate or compete with each other. Thus, this PhD-project investigates inequality in life chances by examining the diverse roles siblings may play within households in Taiwan and the Netherlands during the period 1860-1940.\n\nPopulation and household registers are used because these sources record the presence or absence of siblings in a household at a particular point in an individual\u2019s life. The theoretical framework of household systems will be used to expand our understanding of inequality in life chances by including the distinctive features, such as marriage structures, parental power and household organisation, of both Western European and Asian households. Moreover, regional variation will also be taken into account by looking at possible differences within the Netherlands and Taiwan. By doing so, it will become possible to include regional variation and to test if differences regarding sibling influences are minor within both societies compared to the differences between them.",

            "description": "Who determines which criteria are set to determine what has value and what does not? How do we judge if historical objects, texts, and heritage have any value? And why do researchers, policy makers and investors chose for different definitions of what value is depending on the context? In other words, what is the interplay and tension between on the one hand explicit arguments and implicit cultural, economic and political factors on the other hand? Surprisingly, only few historians talk about the process of giving value to something, while this is clearly connected to the very foundation of every debate discussing the use of history for a society. Moreover, trying to answer these questions is extremely relevant because of the current political and societal developments such as the Wetenschapsvisie 2025, the new Erfgoedwet, the fast innovation in digital humanities and so on. \n\nIn this project we would like to deal with the process of giving value to something by looking at three domains: \u2018places of storage\u2019, \u2018heritage\u2019 and \u2018public history\u2019.  This division makes sure that this complicated theme can be dealt with in a more systematic manner and is inspired by the diverse professions in which most trained historians end up. Moreover, these three domains are neglected by most historians, while it are the domains which form the basis or are the result of most historical research. Likewise, it are also the places in which the average person interacts with history. Therefore, the conclusion can only be that historians should be more aware and involved in the places where history plays a role outside of academia. \n",
