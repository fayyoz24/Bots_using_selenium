    "summary": "Adaptable and equipped with a diverse international background. I am deeply fascinated with the interface of Biology and Chemistry and the translation of these topics in healthcare. I pride myself on being a driven and capable biomedical scientist with an established interest in the field of data analysis. Having formerly worked as a data analyst for Dutch Screening Group (DSG), my passion for education has veered me back to complete my Master's degree. I am currently undertaking my Master's of Biomedical Science at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), following the track 'Medical Biochemistry and Biotechnology'. \n\nI completed my Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences at Maastricht University, with my minor focusing on Pharmacology. During my Bachelor's, I graduated from the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences honours programme.  During this honours period, I participated in a project concerning the monitoring and quantitation of pharmaceutical waste in water bodies using LC-MS. This project aimed to generate data to aid in decisions to facilitate safer filtration options. Throughout my time in the honours programme, I worked diligently as a member of the \"Lab team\". My bachelor concluded with an internship at the Maastricht MultiModal Molecular Imaging institute (M4I) in collaboration with DSG. During my internship, I worked closely on analysing specific biospecimen matrices generated from MALDI-MS. \n\nIn lieu of my internship, I was subsequently employed as a data analyst by DSG and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. As aforementioned, I am currently a student, studying for my Master's of Biomedical Science at UvA interning at the Faculty of Molecular Biology and Microbial Food Safety (MBMFS). Now, we are investigating interventions to tackle subpopulations of pathogenic bacteria. This line of research has brought me to Monash University in Australia as a visiting researcher.",
