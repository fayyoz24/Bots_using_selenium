    "summary": "Lecturer, artist and educator specialized in empathy research. \n\nI have six years of experience working in international higher education, where I developed curricula and implemented courses centered on the theme of empathy, initiated student/faculty platforms for dialogue, organized campus-wide events, and assisted with a wide range of admissions and student-life activities. I excel in high-paced environments where I can bring about positive change. From 2012-2014, I received a Fulbright Scholarship in the United States for academic research to bring about cultural understanding; my thesis research focused on empathy, vulnerability and trauma, as investigated through the lenses of psychology, philosophy and performance/video art. The conjunction of these disciplines has given me the insight to isolate the specific circumstances that influence the way we perceive the \u201cother\u201d and ourselves, which lies at the heart of empathy.\n",
