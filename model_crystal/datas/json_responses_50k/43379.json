Using the collected data the goal is to make a prediction of temperatures. These prediction are made in Jupyter Notebook using the Python scripting language. A flask server backend is provided on an heroku server together with an heroku PostgreSQL.\n\nBig thanks to my co-creator who has the project on his github (See the link).",

The design, testing and validation of these PCB's was crucial to advance our project and our mission to the ISS.\n\nThe OSCAR-QUBE project is the part of the OSCAR project series. With this new chapter, we got shortlisted, and eventually, we got selected to fly our project to the ISS. This year was mostly comprised of preparations to get ready to launch the project by August 2021.",
