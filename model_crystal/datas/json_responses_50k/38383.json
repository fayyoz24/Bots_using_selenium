During this period I have learned that in all elements of life, relationships matter. I believe that leadership is the ability to achieve results through people. Therefore, I choose to dedicate my life to becoming the best leader I can be in and outside my job description. I try to achieve this by adopting coaching as 'a way of being' and by building an inclusive, high-performance culture in which all can thrive and thereby impact as many lives as possible.\n\nI hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in Commercial Economics from the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam and a Master of Business from the University College Cork.",
