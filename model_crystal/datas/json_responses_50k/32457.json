I have a knack for capturing the essence of people, moments, topics and businesses in words.\n\nI am a self-made citizen of the world, and have lived and worked on three continents\u2014Africa, Asia and now Europe. I\u2019ve taught English as a foreign language in India and Vietnam, taught Yoga in the Philippines, worked in admin roles and as an au pair/tutor in South Africa. Now in the Netherlands, I work freelance as an editor/proofreader and stats/quantitative research tutor for university students.\n\nOn my travels, it was always the people and the multitude of creative ways to make authentic connections that inspired me. At this point, I am used to being thrust into unfamiliar territory and wiggling my way through the discomfort.\n\nP.S. I\u2019m always on the lookout for freelance writing and proofreading gigs so feel free to cold message me!",

This role was essentially training in interpersonal communication, especially considering the multitude of cultural differences between me and my students and the fact that my students didn't speak the same language as I do. Not to mention, my understanding of the complex workings of the English language had to be immaculate. Working abroad has made me adaptable and skilled at navigating multicultural environments.",
