    "summary": "My experience in the field of education for more than 6 years and a Ph.D. \"Theory and Methodology of Higher Professional Education\", unleashed my potential in academic management and teaching skills in various educational institutions. My core competencies as an educator include the development and implementation of curricula, psycho-pedagogical diagnostics, teaching various subjects, coordination of scientific activities, and cultural integration. I am passionate about creating a supportive and exciting learning process and adapting students to a new environment. My commitment to continuous learning and professional development allows me to explore new opportunities and not stand still.\n\nAs an Assistant Event Coordinator, I have the experience of coordinating 20 volunteers who have carried out activities aimed at educating and integrating expats in a new country. As well as the experience of attracting new 7 volunteers, information support for our event participants, and publication of information in social networks of the company.\n\nAs a Class Teacher at Hermann Wesselink College, I had the privilege of working with children who fled from Ukraine and helped them adapt to a new country and culture. I taught Math and Socio-Emotional Learning in English and collaborated with my colleagues and parents to provide holistic and personalized education and student support. It was very intense, but I really enjoy this job!\n\nAs a volunteer working with refugees, I have worked in a fast-paced environment and have been helped by my multitasking skills. Collaboration with the municipality of Amstelveen, colleagues, and community partners has made it possible to provide comprehensive and individual support to refugees.\n\nThe Quality Management System is also a field of my professional expertise, which is confirmed by my work background and a Certification of quality management systems based on ISO 9000 standards. I have an in-depth understanding of developing quality management system documentation, conducting internal audits, analyzing and processing data, and writing reports.\n\nAs a great teammate, my ability to work in a fast-paced environment with a positive approach makes me a great addition to any professional team. I consider initiative and attention to detail as my strengths, as well as strong communication skills while multitasking. A high level of computer literacy and easy learning ability help me to solve work tasks quickly.",

Living together in such a diverse context is not always easy. It is therefore important that people from different backgrounds come into contact with each other. \n\nMany organisations, companies and associations are already working in this direction. In Amstelveen, there are wonderful initiatives to make people get to know each other better and gain a deeper understanding of cultural similarities and differences by cooking together, playing sports, making music, etc.      \n\nSometimes it is difficult for people with different backgrounds to meet and sometimes they need help organising activities. By creating centres of communication, even bigger initiatives are being created to involve more people. This is why the municipality has launched the Amstelveen Connect@ project, a networking platform that brings together both events and those who organise them."
