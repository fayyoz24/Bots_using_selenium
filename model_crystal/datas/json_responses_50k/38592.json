    "summary": "An accomplished technology leader with an extensive track record as a software engineer in both frontend desktop and web application development, and high throughput multithreaded real-time backend server development. Primary programming skillset includes C# 10, .NET 7, ASP.NET Core MVC, Blazor, SQL Server (T-SQL), JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Solidity, as well as previous experience in C++, PL/SQL, WPF.\n\nI am an avid proponent and practitioner of DevOps and Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban), and tooling such as Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions to streamline development and build/release pipelines with CI/CD and test automation methodologies. I have led many small and large teams of engineers, testers, and technical architects, and have also had hybrid roles as a Scrum Master alongside of being a developer. I enjoy mentoring and leading both junior and senior technical team members, and guiding a team to delivery, while also keeping my technical skills fresh by constantly coding in new technologies.\n\nI work autonomously and am passionately motivated to develop high quality software using SOLID principles and BDD/TDD to ensure secure, efficient, robust, extensible, maintainable, scalable, testable, and concise readable code. Depending on budget, scope, and user requirements, the aim is always to build software with clean design (typically DDD) that performs well under load, and to maximise uptime per business requirements.\n\nI have a proven track record in investment banking writing efficient code in real-time systems within strict deadlines, and I am able to interact with the business and end users to understand and gather requirements for both product delivery and support, demonstrable by the various applications I have written for Tier 1 investment banks.\n\nQualifications: I have a degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Nottingham, and two charterships (CITP and CEng) with the British Computer Society and Engineering Council.\n\nAs a family man with young children, I aspire to work in a company where I can leverage my technical and leadership skills over a long-term period and add sustainable value to the business. I work well under pressure, and am at a stage in my career where I may combine my past experience with contemporary technologies and concepts such as AI/ML, big data, blockchain technology, .NET and DevOps to lead and build a cutting edge project and make it an explosive success.",

            "description": "PDC Margin is a system for credit checking trades with high-risk clients prior to the trade being accepted.  The system consisted of a back-end (C++) that performed the credit checking itself and a front-end GUI (a WPF XBAP application) that provided the reporting and workflow interface.  I solely worked on the front-end.  The front-end also consisted of a WCF service layer using the CSLA .NET Framework in order to communicate with the back-end (a SQL database and other back-end services).\r\n\r\nFor PDC Margin to interface with the back-end, I had to write a service layer component using WCF based on an in-house implementation of a third-party framework called CSLA .NET.  I faced many technical challenges implementing this and had to learn and understand some of the security and data restrictions in WCF to tackle issues such as user credentials being passed from the front-end (client-side) to the service layer (server-side).  There were also size limitations that were causing problems due to some of the data being transferred from the back-end to the front-end such as margin trade data which I had to resolve and understand the implications of.  Interoperability of the WCF component with the back-end services proved challenging due to the use of interop components to interact with C++ modules via DCOM.  Due to using different source control systems (Perforce and ClearCase) between these systems, DLL Hell was encountered and required substantial investigative work to determine how to resolve.\r\n\r\nThe system was ultimately delivered to the business on time and was received very well and continues to be used today.",
