                    "description": "Suzan Offereins has painted portraits of the general public and dignitaries for the past 30 years.  Even after all these years, and having painted hundreds of portraits, it is still an ever increasing challenge for her, using her painting skills and technique to capture, in the smallest detail and movement, the character of any particular person.\n\nAfter twenty years of painting, the ultimate pinnacle of her work was the commissioning by the Council of Rijnsburg of a portrait of Her Majesty, Queen Beatrix in 1998.  The painting session at the Palace Huis ten Bosch, where the Queen sat for her, was to leave a lasting impression on Suzan. A few years later, in 2006, she had a further memorable and very special experience when she was given the honour and privilege to paint a portrait of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander at his residence at Wassenaar, commissioned by the Council of Eede. \n\nThe sixtieth birthday of Queen Beatrix in 1998 was to be the occasion for Suzan to paint a further series of special moments in the life of the Queen.  This collection, was painted  with the aid of historical photographs from the Royal Archives that Offereins was allowed to use. This collection of Royal portraits and of special and historical moments has grown gradually over the years.\n\nIn 2011 there followed, by Suzan, portraits of Prince Bernhard and also of the young family of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima.  A painted \u2018Throne-Chair\u2019, adorned with portraits of Queen Beatrix flanked by future monarchs, is the latest asset to be added to this collection. On the back of the chair is a portrait of the young Princess Catharina-Amalia.\n\nYou can find an overview of the collection of the Royal and other works by Suzan Offereins on her website: www.suzan-offereins.nl\nSuzan lives and works on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides in Scotland.\nFor more information you can contact us by telephoning +31-33-4550954 or +44-1859-520315.",
