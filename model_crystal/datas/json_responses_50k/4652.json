    "summary": "As an Industrial Engineer (MSc) I have more than 20 years of experience in designing, consulting, implementing, supporting and managing changes to logistics business (ERP) software. I have worked with several software applications/vendors together with many customers in a wide range of  businesses, such as engineering & production of customer specific goods, service & maintenance, sheltered workshops, the building supply industry, food & beverages and the fashion industry. At customers I have worked in fields like CRM, customer order management, logistics and purchasing, planning and production, object and service management. Besides that I have also knowledge of project management and document management.\nBeside functonal area\u2019s like object and service management, cost based invoicing and cycle counting, I have contributed to the development of new software in non functional area\u2019s like replication and usability. The latter requires a more abstract approach, which suits me well.\n\nIt is my goal to contribute to a company in the field of information management. As an intermediair between business and IT, I improve the effectiveness and efficiency of operational, tactical and strategic processes by applying IT solutions and improving IT processes.\n\nI like to see something of myself in the company I work with, either in processes, the IT landscape or in its products.\n\nSpecialties: Proces analysis, Processes and procedures, Identify and analyse problems, Advise and implement improvements, Holistic view, Abstract and pragmatic approach, Creative, Communication and presentation, Specific but standardised solutions, Logistics, Business software, Requirements, Design, Usability",
