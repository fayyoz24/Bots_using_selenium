In the end, a lot evolves around interaction and mindset, both strong pillars within the Agile way of working.\nSubsequently, I will advise about the best Agile approaches to facilitate the Agile transformation within a company and I will support teams and individuals in their personal and professional growth. In this process, I use DSDM, Scrum and Lean methodologies among other.\n\nWemanity offers a broad scale of possibilities to shape and facilitate the Agile transformation of a company, from assessment to implementation. We have a broad international team specializing in many Agile methodologies. Do contact me to hear more about our approach.\n\nBesides my regular activities, I currently am co-facilitating the team page of all Wemanity colleagues on our website and I organize meetups with customers and prospects. \nIn the past, I was responsible for Wemanity's group Twitter account in 2016 \u2013 2017 and I took part in the Social Media team. \n\nOther activities: \nQ3/16: translation of the book \"The illustrated guide of Agile best practices\" from French to English, as well as translating parts of the Wemanity website from English to Dutch. \nDec '17: Inspirational Agile Breakfast for customers in The Hague, where Arie van Bennekum, co-author of the Agile Manifesto, shared his insights and knowledge. \nJan '18: I created the Dutch subtitles to Henrik Kniberg's reknown video 'Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell': https://amara.org/en/videos/ymgYyCpSVr60/en/471078/.\nFeb '18: Live-streaming event in The Hague of the Agile Consortium's annual conference in Brussels.",

Daarom is het goed dat er binnen ING ook een netwerk actief is voor LHBTI+-collega\u2019s en hun bondgenoten. Ik ben gevraagd om die bondgenoten een gezicht te geven binnen het bestuur en daar heb ik met plezier ja op gezegd. Samen werken we o.a. aan meer bewustwording van de uitdagingen op de werkvloer voor LHBTI+-collega\u2019s, aan het blootleggen van onbewuste vooroordelen en het organiseren van mooie bijeenkomsten voor alle leden van ons netwerk.\n\nTo be who you want to be, to love whom you want to love and to be able to share that without any doubt. It sounds so simple and obvious, but unfortunately it still is not. It is a good thing therefore that there is an active network within ING for LGBTI+-colleagues and their allies. I was invited to represent these allies within the current Gala board, to which I gladly said yes. Together, we a.o. raise awareness of the challenges faced at work for LGBTI+-colleagues, help uncover unconscious bias and organize interesting events for all network members. "
