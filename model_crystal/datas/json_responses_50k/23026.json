This is done through experiential learning with a curriculum that builds work/life skills. \nThe previous face-to-face process needed to be migrated online due to COVID-19. In this role, I assisted with redesigning the program to be delivered online and remotely. This included re-designing the curriculum, determining the delivery platform, ensuring delivery was interesting and engaging, and researching which businesses were currently engaging in tours and for those that were, ensuring social distancing protocols were in place. Additionally., I curated customer personas and also created files charting a plan for the business to increase its social media presence on different platforms.",
