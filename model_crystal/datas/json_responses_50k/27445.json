    "summary": "Experienced educator, mentor, innovator and philosopher. Love to work with children of all ages! Love to be in the class! Dedicated to make a difference in children' life! \nExpertise in classroom practices, educational innovation and educational philosophy. \nMember of the Japanese Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (JASCD) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). \nI am very interested in happiness as a mean and aim of education. I believe happy children can learn better, can achieve all their personal goals, can be successful and better human beings!\n\nMy educational statement\nWhy am I teaching? Because I do not see another way; because I believe every man has a gift and teaching is mine. \n\nI believe teaching is an art, a true art; a talent you are born with. I believe teaching is more than knowing a subject and some techniques to \"deliver\" the knowledge. Teaching means passion, care, understanding, trust, respect, friendship, communication, and above all, of these it means to love the children. \n\nI see the child as a whole, and I try to educate the \u201cwhole\u201d with passion, kindness, patience, and respect. Every child is unique and she/he has to be treated like this. \nI believe that every child has strengths, which she/he will hone and highlight. It is the art of saying the same thing for different levels of understanding, the art of cherish with patience until the flowers of knowledge, courage, love and respect will bloom. The art is to inspire the children to believe in themselves, to make them open to you. \nPersonally, I do not have a particular style of teaching. I adapt myself to the particular learning style of any children. My goals are to provide the individual attention that they need to reach their maximum potential and to have an important contribution to their development through mentorship and an active involvement in their activities, both in class and extra-curricular. My teaching strengths are: love, respect, passion, open mindedness and trust. \nI love children, I love being around them all the time and this is the most important thing for me. This is my way and I do not know another way, but I can tell you that I am doing this for more than 20 years and my life was extraordinary.\nI am a dedicated teacher committed to teaching as a career, who wishes to develop his professional skills. I did not choose this profession it chose me. I believe, if you have passion for what you are doing and you care, you can make a difference, and you can make children happy. In the end this is all that matters.\n\n",
