    "summary": "Besides focusing on my study, I love to do a lot of extracurricular activities.\n\nI'm Thijs van Deudekom and currently studying MSc Technical Medicine. This is a multidisciplinary Master programme from the TU Delft, together with Leiden University, Erasmus University Rotterdam and their academic medical centers.  I find it very interesting to have both a thorough understanding of the functioning of the human body as well as an equally comprehensive understanding of the medical technology.  Presently I'm following the track: Imaging & Intervention. This specialization focuses on two important trends in health care: early diagnosis and developing the most targeted patient-specific treatment possible with the shortest possible recovery time and minimal side effects.\n\nBefore I started my Masters, I've obtained the bachelor Technical Medicine. For my minor, I studied at Clarkson University in New York. This was very instructive as I could take other courses that were very interesting such as 'Designing and Leading Innovative Ventures' and 'Economics of Innovation'. \n\nI've done several things next to normal curriculum. For instance, I was the president of the Exploitation Committee at my rowing club Laga. Secondly I was on the board of my Study Association Variscopic. Here I was the Commissioner External Affairs. \nIn both these functions I learned a lot about leadership and responsibility as a head of a large committee or a whole association. \n\nCurrently I'm working as the Chief Commercial Officer at Corsano. This is a new HealthTech start-up that will make the measurement of for instance AFib very easy and continuous via PPG monitoring. \n  \nI will always be eager to take on a challenge, to improve myself and I like to encourage others to do the same.",
