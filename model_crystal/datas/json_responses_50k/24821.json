    "summary": "After working in online higher education providing support and guidance to Masters and Doctoral students, I have taken a new career direction.  I now have a GA Level 5 Diploma in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), awarded by i-to-i the world-leading course provider, and have completed specialisms in Teaching English One-to-One and Online and also Teaching Business English.\n\nThe TEFL qualification comprises:\n\n\u2022\tEnglish Language Teaching and learning in Context\n\u2022\tLesson Planning and Resources in English Language Teaching & Learning\n\u2022\tTeaching English Language \u2013 Vocabulary, Grammar and Pronunciation\n\u2022\tTeaching the Four Skills \u2013 Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing\n\nI have solid experience of working with part-time adult student professionals from all parts of the world and provided help and guidance at all stages of their studies.  The study language was English which was often an additional challenge for some students in the course of their studies.  I am now sharing my excellent English teaching, writing and communication skills to help students of different Nationalities improve their English.  Some of my students are adult professionals who are taking one-to-one lessons to refine their English skills.  These are customized lessons to prepare them for further success in their business.",

I create customised lesson plans exactly tailored to my students' interests and motivations for speaking and writing in English.   I use actuality and original materials to provide entertaining and challenging opportunities for my students to learn and progress in each lesson.  My aim is always to encourage students to expand their knowledge and capabilities so that they feel they have made progress after each lesson and look forward to the next one.",
