MSM carries out the technical maintenance for the ships, while for the seafarers it performs the crew planning, HR, payroll and finance.  \n\nI was recruited by the director of Maersk Ship management to lead an IT project with a budget of 1.38 million USD, with the following main aims: \nTo replace the old crew planning, HR and payroll office applications by a new integrated system. \nArrange a data load from the existing applications. \nTo implement the new system in 6 different locations worldwide.\nArrange interfaces to the payroll and finance systems.\nMake sure users are prepared, trained and motivated.\nTo roll out a new on board system for crew planning, payroll, finance and HR on 35 vessels.  \n\nMain achievements: \tThe project was completed successfully, within budget and on time. The main benefits were improved efficiency, major data quality improvements and standardization within the Maersk group.\nPersonally, I got invaluable experience in the field of IT project management. \nI learned to do project planning, work flow and gap analysis, business process mapping and setting up user training sessions. On the technical side I was instrumental in dealing with matters like data loads and interface building. I had a leading role in the project board and was a member of the project executive board.
