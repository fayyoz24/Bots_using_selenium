Such agents, which are computer-generated, animated conversation partners for technology users, allow for rich and persuasive automated communication. As compliance with health advice is important for positive health outcomes, successful design of persuasive virtual agents can have huge health benefits. Through a series of studies (co-design sessions with older adults, design experiments, and a real-life evaluation), we will identify the different factors that explain virtual agents' potential success for dietary change in older adults. The project is financially supported by a ZonMW grant and will be carried out by Wageningen University and Research, Roessingh Research and Development, WAAG society and the National Foundation for the Elderly.",

The patient can be supported in this through eHealth, and social support from both informal caregiver and healthcare professional. Based on this idea, the self-management platform Emma was developed by Medicine Men. However, limited attention was paid to increasing psychological motivation to support behavioral change. Therefore, the aim of this study was to participatory increase the persuasiveness of Emma.\n\nMethods. The CeHRes Roadmap and the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model were used for the development and evaluation. The study was divided into three stages; (1) Stakeholders, current situation and values; (2) Prototype design, requirements and development; and (3) Evaluation. Eight COPD patients (52-70 years) from the Bravis Hospital participated, together with three informal caregivers and four healthcare professionals. Participants were interviewed, invited for a co-creation session and completed an online evaluation in each stage respectively. The interviews and co-creation session were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed by an iterative process, which combined deductive and inductive coding.\n\nConclusion. We showed that Dialogue and Primary Task support were needed in persuading COPD patients into increasing their self-management. A non-invasive Reminder tool seemed indeed effective in changing patients\u2019 behavior. Including multiple stakeholders and an extensive and systematic contextual inquiry are recommended.\n",

The purpose of this study was to determine the interplay of parenting style (authoritarian, permissive, authoritative) and personal standards on perceived parental pressure. 72 athletes (50% female) completed the questionnaire (M age=13.8 years, SD=1.40). The questionnaires used are the Sport-MPS-2 and the PSI-2. Regression analysis show a connection between an authoritative parenting style and less perceived parental pressure, moderated by low personal standards. Furthermore, there has been found a main effect of a permissive parenting style on less perceived parental pressure. Personal standards correlates positively with perceived parental pressure. A permissive parenting style and an authoritative parenting style in combination with low personal standards indicates the minimum pressure. It is therefore important that children find a balance in the level of personal standards they set for themselves.",
