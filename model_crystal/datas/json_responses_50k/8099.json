    "summary": "Sustainable development has been the key topic throughout my time at university and my personal development as well. Shifting towards a global system that is regenerative, circular and balanced is in my view inevitable . \n\nMy Bachelor's degree in Delta Management has helped me to lay the foundation for my keen interest in sustainable development. In my spare time I was involved in personal development and leadership programmes and activities, all related to sustainability. I had the chance to join the Honours Programme at university, which included one year of research into a wicked problem. Going to the United States and Canada for research into vertical farming was the result.\n\nThe experience of managing a large student-sustainability network as a board member has helped me to develop my management and leadership skills. Together with a circular economy and business innovation semester at Rotterdam Business School it makes for a solid basis for growing a business sustainably.\n\nThis knowledge and experience all comes together in my work as head of marketing and communication at Own Greens (vertical farming spin-off of Vitro Plus), where I started as an intern in 2017. I am extremely passionate about working on a vertical farming solutions that will revolutionize the current food production industry. Besides my work at Own Greens, I am also working on building a community platform for vertical farming and organizing events to enhance information sharing within the industry.\n\nI am always looking for like-minded people, so feel free to connect if you see possibilities for collaboration and cooperation.
