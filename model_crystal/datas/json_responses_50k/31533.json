    "summary": "Looking for potential Full-Time opportunities as Machine Learning Engineer, Computer Vision Engineer or Researcher and Software Engineer for Summer 2021. Final Year Master Student in Data Science at TU Delft. Resume: www.anweshcr7.github.io\n\nI am a highly motivated Data Science Graduate with a predisposition towards specializing in the field of Deep Learning. Currently working on my master's thesis at the Vision Lab at TU Delft and looking for Full-Time opportunities in Computer Vision and/or Machine Learning Roles. Demonstrated experience in the field while working as a Computer Vision Intern at Beyond Sports.\n\nGiven a history of strong projects involving Web/Android-based UI and writing REST APIs and Services, I can translate a real-world problem into software-based solutions with fair competence. While my professional expertise lies in building highly scalable and functional web applications, personally I love spending time reading about advances in tech and the various innovative solutions that are being applied around the world to solve interestingly complex cross-domain problems. (Read, Medium).\n\nWhen the day is over, I am a hardcore football fan (love Manchester United) who works out regularly (at least tries to) and fixates upon silly things like everyone else. I like meeting new people as it allows me to gain a better perspective at life. Interested in AI projects and ideas which I would like to pursue part-time. Confidence and Conscientiousness are two words that describe me aptly.",

This kind of personalization has become imperative for e-commerce websites, allowing them to convert\nbrowsers (visitors) into buyers by enticing them to increase their cart spend. The e-commerce industry predominantly uses various prediction models for product recommendations which play a crucial role in exposing customers to new products based on their online behavior. These are items that have been frequently viewed, considered, or purchased along with the one which the customer is currently considering. Harnessing the power of data science has undoubtedly helped e-businesses to improve\ncustomer satisfaction and keep customers more engaged with their e-store. Can we better this personalization model? Our main objective with this project is to give these e-commerce\nrecommendation models a new dimension by incorporating the personality of a customer in providing product suggestions. Contemporary personality psychologists believe that there are five basic facets of personality, often referred to as the Big 5 personality traits namely, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to experience and Neuroticism. There are Certain studies which explore the possibility of automatic recognition of these personality traits by mining conversational and textual data through Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis module. Considering the existence of an ecommerce based conversational application, we utilize insights from the aforementioned studies to train a recognition model based on historical conversational data that the application would gather over time from its users. This model can then be used to satisfy our objective by equipping us with the tool to automatically recognize a customers personality.",

Also implemented an OCR model trained on a custom dataset for character detection with recognition logic for Dutch licence plates and ported it to ONNX for efficient inference.\nDeveloped custom architecture for damage detection on vehicles, achieving accurate detection and localization of damages with different types/sizes.\n\n- Image Segmentation: \nSet up a pre-labelling (pseudo-labelling) pipeline using Meta\u2019s Segment Anything Model for Vehicle Part Segmentation to heavily reduce costs and optimise data annotation process.\nOwned the process of incorporating an instance segmentation model (DeepLab-v3) for segmenting vehicle parts using platform independent frameworks for edge-devices - ONNX, Tensor-RT.\nR&D of multi-view network architectures to fuse information of vehicle damages from multiple angles (images) onto a 2-dimensional space (like an insurance blueprint). \n\n- Heavily involved in introducing and setting up MLOps workflow using ClearML for automatic data processing and storage.

Successfully modelled the likelihood of scoring a goal (in Football) using sequential models that learn from a sequence of event frames leading upto a goal. This project was based on training sequence based models like LSTMs and Conditional Random Fields (beginning with simple classifiers as a PoC) to predict the Expected Goal Value as a measure of the chance of actually scoring a goal. This was done by deriving insights from features like player positioning, player roles (dynamic positions in the formation using Markov Models), team playing styles etc. \n\n2. Additionally worked on data validation (and smoothing) for NHL based match data using filters (eg: Kalman) to enhance the data stream (by removing/smoothing jitters, data imputation etc.) being fed to unity based visualisation systems as a downstream task.\n\nBeyond Sports is an AI based Sports Analytics company that offers a new way of experiencing sports. Through positional tracking data, beyond sports delivers anything the fan can imagine to multiple platforms by leveraging the power of computer vision. Beyond sports\u2019 technology is used by elite teams such as Arsenal, Ajax Amsterdam, AZ Alkmaar and the KNVB, as well as by major broadcasters like fox sports and sky sports.",
