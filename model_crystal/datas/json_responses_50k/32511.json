This caused severe inconvenience and risk of injuries or death for road users.\n\nThe main duties of this project included the analysis of the different instability problems along the road by dividing it into different stretches, collecting comprehensive rockfall data and rain reports, proposing an appropriate rockfall hazard rating system to evaluate the different stretches and finding correlations for predictive analysis between rain episodes and rockfall events.\n\nFinally, slope sections were rated and mapped in order to create a database indicating the most dangerous stretches that needed urgent remedial measures.",
