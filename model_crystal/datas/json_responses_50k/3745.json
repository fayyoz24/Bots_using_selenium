To this end, designers first focus on the important desired qualities, both in a material sense and in a social interaction sense. Only after they have moved the design brief away from the actual product to a more abstract level, do they start thinking about problem solving.\n\nMemetic Design - Students develop designs based on Richard Dawkins' theory of cultural memes, the bits of cultural information that become markers of identity, status and differentiation.\n\nAutomotive 3D - Students develop 3D clay models of cars with a focus on formal aesthetics, cultural style and emotive expression.",
