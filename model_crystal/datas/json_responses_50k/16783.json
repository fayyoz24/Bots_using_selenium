    "summary": "I am specialised in ecological modellingand ecosystem restoration and reforestation, and have a background in (tropical) forestry, organic agriculture and agroforestry, from writing forest mangement plans to science, and from ecology to the social sciences. Experience: modelling (such as Ghanese cocoa, and carbon capture after reforestation), analysis of (large) datasets, the use of the programming language R and basic Python, ArcGIS and QGIS, a biodiversity study in Australia, writing management plans, and field work (e.g. forest inventories) in Australia, Surinam, Spain and Indonesia. \n\nI am autodidactic, analytical and an out-of-the-box thinker. People have told me I learn quickly, that I can rapidly see opportunities for improvement and that I am able to find creative sollutions.\n\nMy free time is all about music, art, nature and books. I play the piano, draw trees, craft leather, search for fossils on the beach, hike, and since a few years I have been writing my first historic novel set in Indonesia.",
