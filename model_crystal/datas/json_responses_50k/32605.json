    "summary": "New decade, new focus! From 2020 I will focus all my energy, enthusiasm, knowledge and skill to help you feel good every day and reach ultimate health with ease and joy. \n\nI have always been passionate about food, health and finding what feels good in life. I love to question the way we do things and to look for better ways to better results. This quest has led me to a three year in depth yoga teacher training, participating in many retreats, traveling to India, staying in ashrams, following many courses and lectures by the best in this field and now a four year bachelor level study Ayurvedic Practitioner at Delight Academy in Amsterdam and India. \n\nNow that I have so much experience in how yoga and ayurveda has improved my life, I am ready to share this wisdom with everybody that wants to find ultimate health with ease and joy. I promise you that healing in this loving way is not too spiritual or weird at all but very fundamental, logical, easy to incorporate, a lot of fun and live changing. Together we will take care of your body, mind and soul and you will shine brighter than ever! \n",
