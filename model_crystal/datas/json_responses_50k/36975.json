Mijn verantwoordelijkheden omvatten het stellen van kaders en het leiden van het team in het testen, het bepalen van benodigde testen voor kwaliteitsborging, het opstellen en automatiseren van testcases, en het geven van advies over testtooling. Ik draag bij aan geautomatiseerde regressietests, bepaal de mate van automatisering en documentatie, voer geautomatiseerde testsets uit, en draag bij aan het overdragen van testwerkzaamheden aan collega's. Ik voer diverse tests uit, waaronder regressietests, en bereid en borg verschillende testsoorten in een OTAP-omgeving voor. Als tester werk ik nauw samen met het scrumteam, draag bij aan backlog-items, meet en verbeter de werkzaamheden, en deel actief testkennis om de kwaliteit te waarborgen, zowel binnen het team als ketenbreed.
