            "description": "The newly formed group Iman Spaargaren Undercurrent has released their debut CD In The Moment June 2013. Piano player Franz von Chossy (DE, Franz von Chossy Quintet), guitarist Guillermo Celano (AR, Celano/Baggiani Group), drummer Jasper van Hulten (NL, Wouter Hamel, Erik Vloeimans), double bass player Cord Heineking (DE, Simin Tander) and trumpet player Dirk Beets (NL, ex-Monsieur Dubois) joined their forces.\nIn The Moment offers exciting, free-spirited and intense music.\n\nIn 2013 the group played o.a. at Jazzahead 2013, North Sea Jazzclub (Amsterdam), Jazzahead (Bremen), etc.\n\nPress about 'In The Moment' (CD and CD Release concert):\n\"Melody and lyricism are strong features of saxophonist and composer Iman Spaargaren. With clear expositions he wanders on paths leading to adventure without ever getting lost. Melodic sounds on tenor- and soprano saxophone, played by the bandleader with great empathy, are commentated by guitarist Guillermo Celano with his rough sound. Great to see that the different characters of the bandmembers [Celano, Heineking, Baggiani and Spaargaren] fit together so well. Spaargaren put a great band together for sure\" (Jan Jasper Tamboer, het Parool, 2013).\n\n\"Iman Spaargaren: a busy man, not deprived of outstanding musical qualities, as an instrumentalist as well as a composer. On his newest album all 11 compositions are his writing. The pieces have an almost natural simplicity and sound transparant and spacious due to the line up and the high quality of Spaargaren's bandmembers - guitarist Guillermo Celano, bassist Cord Heineking and drummer Jasper van Hulten. It is nice listenable modern harmonic jazz, which has solos  of great stature by the tenorsaxophonist - sometimes on bass clarinet - Spaargaren and guitarist Celano\" (Jacques Los, Draaiomjeoren, 2013).",

The recordings were done during a magnificent concert at Hot House in Leiden, Holland.\nThe energy and musical adventure leave you in astonishment! Monk's compositions are being torn apart, closely examined, and put together in a different fashion again. True swing, soundscapes, burning improvisations and witty interplay.\n\nAt the moment Thelonious4 is working on the release of the next album with guest soloist Tony Miceli (vibraphone) from Philadelphia, USA. Release will be at the end of 2012.\n\nComing from different musical backgrounds the band members always reach for the highest level of expression. This working ensemble approaches the traditional quartet format from a new perspective, creating a unique ensemble sound. The blend of tenor saxophone and electric jazzguitar is a beguiling one, and this Amsterdam based jazzquartet exploits it with great skill. The neat band is complemented by steady and highly creative double bass and drums.\n\nWith the release of their first album 'Thelonious 4' one can already here a shared vision of swing, taste and execution. This foursome reflects the true heart of Monk's music, ballads and sly blues or vigorous groove music.\n\nThelonious 4 played on different festivals such as Te Gast in Garnwerd, East of Eastern, Huse Jazzt and in various jazzclubs in Europe.\nThe individual members of the group played on festivals such as North Sea Jazzfestival and at jazzclubs such as BIMhuis, De Tor, Paradox, SJU Jazzpodium, etc.",

The sound of the Quartet is attractive and the compositions are very varied\u201d (de Volkskrant, BIMhuis concert review 1 march 2012).\n\n\u201cThe music sounds thoughtful, cautious, in a moderate tempo. Spaargaren has a strong voice of his own. Quality and talent are undeniable, his melodic and harmonic caracteristics are strong, a true choice as Young VIP\u201d (Jazzenzo, BIMhuis concert review 1 march 2012).\n\n\"Flow is filled with enthousiastic, hard-driven, contemporary jazz. The compositions by Iman vary from very expressive to dreamy, from light-footed to funky\" (SJU Jazzpodium, Utrecht).\n\n\"A promising modern jazz album. Iman's compositions stand for very melodical, light-footed musical lines. Spaargaren solos with great skill: modest and beautifully frased; he lets his emotions run free\" (draaiomjeoren.nl).\n\n\"Contemporary adventure. Iman Spaargaren Quartet and Septet play eager and energetic, but remain within a melodical spectrum\" (JB, Nederlands Dagblad).\n\n\"Iman is an important player in the Dutch jazzscene\" (Jazzflits).\n\nThe best musicians on the Dutch jazz scene turn Flow into an album jam-packed with energetic, enthousiastic, modern jazz. The atmosphere of Iman's original compositions and arrangements ranges from excited to dreamy, from light-footed to funky. \n\nIman's saxophone playing catches the ear with his very personal and lyrical tone and inventive use of rhythm. His arrangements for septet make one think of the works of Amina Figarova en Wayne Shorter.\n\nLine up: Iman Spaargaren \u2013 tenor-, sopranosax and bass-clarinet / Gerard Kleijn \u2013 trumpet / Mark Lotz \u2013 flute / Marike van Dijk \u2013 altosax / Marzio Scholten and Santeri Sulkunen \u2013 guitar / Cord Heineking \u2013 double bass / Mark Coehoorn and Klaas van Donkersgoed \u2013 drums",

Saxophonist, (bass) clarinet player Iman Spaargaren (NL), guitarist Guillermo Celano (ARG) and drummer Marcos Baggiani (ARG) join forces.\n\nUndercurrent Trio\nThe music of Undercurrent Trio offers a wide variety of different moods. Melodies from the heart tell a story while the band moves through musical landscapes using different timbre and contrasts. Adventures in musical styles create cinematic music in dreamy colours, dark gloomy thick grooves or sharp edgy political commentary.\nThe three musicians explore the engaging and sometimes compelling compositions by taking much freedom of expression and by creating strong interplay and fierce improvisations by all three members.\nThe unusual instrumentation of clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone, guitar and drums offers the listener a fresh sound. The use of musical space is a strongpoint of the Trio. \nTheir debut-CD In The Moment features the group in a larger setting with double bass, trumpet and piano.\nIn 2019 the new fresh album High Tide Low Tide will be released on Flea Boy Records!\n\nGuillermo has worked with o.a. Michael Moore, Joachim Badenhorst, Clemens van der Feen, Ellery Eskelin, Chris Cheek, Ingrid Laubrock, Gerard Kleijn, Joost Kesselaar, Robin Verheyen, Josef Dumoulin and Gorka Benitez.\nMarcos Baggiani is a versatile drummer with firm roots in improvised music. Over the years he has been working with o.a. Sylvie Courvoisier, David Kweksilber, John Edwards, Ernst Reijseger, Han Bennink, Achim Kaufmann.\n\nLine up Undercurrent Trio:\nIman Spaargaren - tenor saxophone, clarinet, bass clarinet\nGuillermo Celano - guitar, effects\nMarcos Baggiani - drums, percussion",

The school's concept was developed by Christian Hassenstein and other instructors from various Dutch conservatories. With this concept, DJAM has distinguished itself in the Dutch music education scene.\n\nThe school's goal is that aside from learning basic musical skills, special attention is given to developing improvisation skills and ear-training. We thereby apply structure in every student's musical abilities, achiving a high level of musicianship in result.\n\nDJAM offers a complete musical education with theory as well as practical lessons, which are all geared toward one another. By offering courses on five levels, the program is suitable for beginners as well as advanced musicians. Through an entrance exam the level of the student is determined for every course.\n\nThe atmosphere at DJAM is often intense and personal. The number of students per class is manageable. DJAM can also be used to prepare for both the practical and theoretical parts of the Vakexamen Lichte Muziek or to prepare for admission to a conservatory.\n\nDJAM is a meeting point for people who want to play music together. Our school, like every serious musician, is in a constant state of development.",
