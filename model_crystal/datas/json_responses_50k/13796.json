    "summary": "I love software, hardware and everything using base 2; I have been coding since 2008 as a full stack developer with experience in Java and Javascript primarily; along the way I have encountered many other languages, frameworks and platforms.\n\nCoding is used loosely, as it involves so many things: meeting with clients, gathering ideas, discussing and converting into proper requirements, architecting solutions and building the actual product with the help of many other people. \n\nI have done the above on many projects and have a can-do attitude about the process as a whole, I love collaborating and working with my peers, but most importantly, sharing knowledge and improving the end value to the customer for any given project. \n\nMy current industry experience lies in the security industry, w.r.t risk management, risk assessment, alarm monitoring and compliance. I have also been involved within the FinTech sector. \n\nMy personal goal is creating software that makes the world a better place. i.e. I want to create and build software which helps people. ",
