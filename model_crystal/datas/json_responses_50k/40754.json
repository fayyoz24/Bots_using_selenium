Next to the implementation of Oracle EBS in Sweden and US, we also build out scenarios for intercompany Sales and Services to all these entities, as the mergers of these entities with Fluke entities were happening simultaneously. \nDuring this project we also implemented SOACS for the various interfaces the team is using for their compliance tracking in order to build out the SOACS solution globally in due time.\nIt was a very interesting and extensive project, with a lot of moving pieces and side projects that interfered with the planning.  After a challenging post-go-live period, the team is now feeling more stable and comfortable with the system and we will soon start revisiting the processes to make the second level of improvements.",
