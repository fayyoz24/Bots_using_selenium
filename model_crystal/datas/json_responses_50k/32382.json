    "summary": "Harshit finished his Master in Information Technology from DA-IICT, in India, and started his first job in EAI. In his first company, Reliance Infocom, he was part of the team which was responsible to develop and maintain SOA based integration layer, implemented in TIBCO.\n\nAt AtosOrigin, he was responsible to offshore all TIBCO development to AtosOrigin offshore center in India. He contributed in establishment of processes that facilitated working in onshore-offshore model. He created a number of tools as part of factory-model of development.\n\nAt CIBER, he worked on a project to build Canonical Data Model and Centralized Transformation Service. He also worked on Data Integration project for one of US County\u2019 Social Services. He also contributed in RFPs, SOA Methodology and Enterprise Integration Architecture. He has also worked extensively with the TIBCO stack for Enexis, Essent and RWE Supply & Trading Netherlands. He  gained much experience in the practical aspects of middleware. He knows what is crucial to keep high-availability application running stably in live production environment. He has worked on projects that involved redesigning entire landscape, including migration across datacenters, migration of messaging bus technology from Rendezvous to EMS, migration of orchestration layer from Cordys to TIBCO, redesigning monitoring. His responsibilities include implementation of change requests on mission critical interfaces and maintaining a TIBCO applications spanning across TIBCO stack. \n\nAt the moment he is working on a project to migrate policies built in TIBCO Policy Manager to TIBCO AMX Meditation and upgrading version of BusinessConnect. He has actively participated in POC involving AMX Service Bus that is used by client as reference implementation. Harshit has also undergone training on AMX BPM and AMX Service Bus.\n\nHe is a self motivated team player and takes great pride in what he does. His goal is to develop into an Enterprise Architect.",

Harshit played instrumental role in off-shoring of integration project from the Netherlands to India. He was involved in development of adapters, composite services and platform components.

            "description": "Client had been complaining that existing architecture was not up to speed with evolving service and product line of the organization. It took too much time to realize a service or product with existing architecture. This was partly due to duplicate logic that existed in silo applications and too many point-to-point connections between endpoints. The business rules of the organization were hard-coded within silo applications which made it very difficult to respond to dynamic markets. Client was also involved in energy trading and required a system that could correlate and respond to events such as weather forecasts.\n\nClient required a solution that could alleviate it from the above mentioned problems.  Use of CDM, CEP, Centralized Transformation Service and Business Rule Service was proposed.\n\nThe implementation not only catered to various transport protocols but also involved XML and Non-XML based message formats. Created Central Transformation Service that allowed reuse of existing transformations.  Content based routers were developed to route messages to appropriate destinations. Centralized business rules services was implemented to provide centrally managed business rules. Utilized ESPER as CEP engine to correlate events and respond to the same by sending messages to downstream applications.  Coordinated with client' business analysts to elicit requirements and create a fully functional solution in very short span of time. Worked with analysts to envision services and also contributed in creation of Canonical Data Model.",
