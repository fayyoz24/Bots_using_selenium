    "summary": "I believe that teams and stakeholders deliver the best results when they are happy, regardless of context.\nTeams and stakeholders become happy when they work in an environment where they have transparency, clear communication, minimal waste, and opportunities to learn and grow. \n\nMy goal is to create such environments, whether it is at team level or across teams. For the team, I can help to create a roadmap with a clear focus and priorities, tasks with clear requirements, and an environment with minimal interruptions. For the stakeholders, I can create transparency on progress and value of our deliveries, challenge  requests to ensure that the right priorities are set, and help to create, or finetune mission and vision. \n\nWith the right priorities and clear communication, we will have a positive work environment with the best results possible.",
