            "description": "Carbon dioxide being the most anthropogenic greenhouse gas,it needs to be isolated from entering into atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage is process that captures CO2 emitted from various sources,separates it from other gases and stores it in a safe place preferably in underground geological formations for large period of time. It is then purified and monitored so that can be made to reuse. Monoethanolamine, zeolitic imidazolate framework, microalgae, membranes etc are utilized to capture CO2. Post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion along with chemical looping combustion are technologies for scrubbing CO2. The properties of CO2 being easily miscible and readily dissolving in oil with impurities makes it capable for numerous applications such as in producing oil by enhanced oil recovery (EOR), Bio CCS Algal Synthesis etc. CO2- EOR operation is capable to produce million barrels of oil and extend the field's lifetime as in case of Weyburn Oil Field in Canada. The physical storage of CO2 is technically the most feasible direction provided that the associated safety and sustainability issues can be met and new materials for CCUS process at low cost are urgently found so that so that fossil based systems with carbon capture are cost competitive.",

            "description": " In this study, a semi-analytical model of contaminated water injection under fracturing conditions, including the effects of damage mechanisms over time is developed, that couples the reservoir engineering and fracture mechanics aspects of the problem. The main features of this model are finite fracture conductivity, external filter-cake build-up on the fracture face, internal plugging at fracture tip by injected solids, backstress resulting from pore pressure inflation (poro-elastic stress), backstress resulting from formation cooling (thermo-elastic stress), and fracture propagation. The most important characteristic is that the fracture is of finite conductivity due to fracture fill up by total suspended solids and oils in injected water. This is what differentiates this model from conventional waterflood induced fracturing simulators. This model incorporates a rectangular fracture that fully penetrates a permeable layer bounded by impermeable layers on top and bottom. The fracture is surrounded by three elliptically shaped zones, formation damages caused are included which are critical for fracture propagation, and the primary objective is to predict long term fracture growth and well injectivity. The governing Equations for fracture propagation are based on four fundamental physical phenomena which are fluid leak-off from the fracture into the formation, fluid flow inside the fracture, poro-elastic and thermo-elastic backstress on the fracture face and fracture propagation into the formation. The novelty of the new simulator is the ability to model waterflood induced fracture including all kinds of damage mechanisms, and accurately predict fracture propagation quickly.\n",

            "description": "The project was on field development planning of Tern Field, Block 210/25 UK North Sea. It was an extensive 6-week course to propose development scenarios of the Tern field. \nSeismic Evaluation, Structural Modeling, Petrophysical Analysis, Property Modeling, Reservoir volume calculation, Dynamic Modeling and Economic Analysis were carried out in sequential manner over the 6 weeks using mainly Petrel, Eclipse, Que$tor and MS Excel. \nReport: Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to the country and area of interest, including the regional geology. In Chapter 2 the process of seismic evaluation is described which is followed by the structural modelling in Chapter 3. The petrophysical analysis can be found in Chapter 4 and plays an important part in determining the geological model for Petrel in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 one can find the uncertainties related to the final STOIIP as all data acquisition methods contain errors. Once the static model is complete it is upscaled to a model that will be used for dynamic modelling. This can be found in Chapter 7 along with reservoir uncertainties such as the permeability. Chapter 8 goes into the three different development scenarios which are then economically assessed in Chapter 9. The risk and risk mitigation can be found in Chapter 10 and Chapter 11 contains the HSE plan. ",

Research shows that a staggering 70% of the offshore hydrocarbon resources are undrillable by conventional drilling techniques. But we are posed to the fact that are formations that have narrow drilling window and therefore high precision is needed to maintain the borehole pressure. Techniques that triumph at this task are termed as \u2018Managed Pressure Drilling\u2019 methods.  \nThe focus of this article is to briefly describe these sophisticated methods and go into the technical details of one such technique \u2013 the Constant Bottom Hole Pressure. In this method, the bottom hole pressure is needed to be constant. This condition could be achieved by adjusting the back pressure that is imposed to the annulus. In this article, a model to calculate the annular pressure loss and back pressure is presented and a range of parameter was used to calculate it to investigate the sensitivity of each parameters to the calculation result. An example of the pumping schedule and the back pressure application is also presented. We concluded that the most sensitive parameters are the annular clearance between drill pipes and open hole and the rheology of the drilling fluid, while cuttings concentration effect to the pressure loss is negligible.",

Accidents of one of these tankers may cause oil spillage which creates serious environmental problems. Our study will test the oil absorption potential of various inexpensive and readily available organic waste materials like sawdust, wood chips, hair, coconut fiber and the viability to use them in the open sea based on properties like capillary action, density, fibrous structure and wicking properties (ability to transfer liquids). The most prominent is Sawdust that can be prepared to absorb oil and repel water. It can absorb 3 \u00bd times its weight of oil. It can also be made magnetic and this property would prevail with it even after oil/water absorption that can help in its retrieval from open sea using magnetic devices. \nHence, a major environmental issue of oil industries can be tackled using abundant unused waste present in the environment itself.",

                    "description": "In this study, a semi-analytical model of contaminated water injection under fracturing conditions, including the effects of damage mechanisms over time is developed, that couples the reservoir engineering and fracture mechanics aspects of the problem. The main features of this model are finite fracture conductivity, external filter-cake build-up on the fracture face, internal plugging at fracture tip by injected solids, backstress resulting from pore pressure inflation (poro-elastic stress), backstress resulting from formation cooling (thermo-elastic stress), and fracture propagation. The most important characteristic is that the fracture is of finite conductivity due to fracture fill up by total suspended solids and oils in injected water. This is what differentiates this model from conventional waterflood induced fracturing simulators. This model incorporates a rectangular fracture that fully penetrates a permeable layer bounded by impermeable layers on top and bottom. The fracture is surrounded by three elliptically shaped zones, formation damages caused are included which are critical for fracture propagation, and the primary objective is to predict long term fracture growth and well injectivity. The governing Equations for fracture propagation are based on four fundamental physical phenomena which are fluid leak-off from the fracture into the formation, fluid flow inside the fracture, poro-elastic and thermo-elastic backstress on the fracture face and fracture propagation into the formation. The novelty of the new simulator is the ability to model waterflood induced fracture including all kinds of damage mechanisms, and accurately predict fracture propagation quickly.",
