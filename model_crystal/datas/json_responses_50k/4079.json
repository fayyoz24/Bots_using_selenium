    "summary": "In the global and competitive world we live in today, in which everyone and everything is more and more connected, and words as Open Innovation and Internet of Things are key, problems are increasing in complexity every day. In order to find solutions to these issues, a closer look needs to be taken at different disciplines and their connections. Moreover, being aware of different cultures can guide us to improve and make solutions more universally applicable. \n\nAs a recently graduated Master student in Marketing Analytics & Data Science, I have been constantly confronted with the ever increasing challenges of technology and Big Data. My background as a graduated Business Administration student, majoring in Technology Management, further aids me in facing these challenges. The Honours programme in philosophy in which I took part during my bachelor period, confronted me with different viewpoints on these managerial challenges and has helped me to look at problems in innovative and creative ways. Moreover, my experience as a Buddy of ESN Groningen combined with my exchange periods in Barcelona, Milan and Coimbra has increased my cross-cultural awareness, which aids me in discovering and communicating solutions in multicultural ways.\n\nIn the future I hope to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge and intercultural skills by providing a communicative and valuable link between business and IT solutions, while simultaneously developing innovative and creative solutions to any challenge that may arise.",
