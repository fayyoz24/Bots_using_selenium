    "summary": "I am a GCMA, ACMA, CISA qualified professional with 9 years\u2019 experience using my mixed finance and IT background to bridge the gap between business and IT. I am currently leading global assurance activities at Ahold Delhaize. My responsibilities include driving assurance activities, reporting quarterly to the Management Board, Supervisory Board and Audit Commitee as well as improving IS controls throughout the organization.\n\nWhile as a manager at PwC, I specialized in risk and controls in IT environments including external auditing and project implementation assurance engagements over large projects. I also gained implementation experienced through leading a team implementing SAP RE-FX for IFRS16.\n\nI really enjoy improving processes and implementing effective controls using automation and data analytics to gain insight into how the business really controls its processes.",
