    "summary": "I am a highly motivated and dedicated Medical Information Specialist with over 3 years of experience in the field. I am currently working at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, leading a team of researchers in conducting multiple systematic reviews and resulting in several publications in peer-reviewed journals and numerous presentations at national conferences. \n\nI have a strong background in medical information retrieval techniques andproficient in R programming language, allowing me to extract relevant data and provide results in a clear and concise manner. I am also experienced in teaching and developing training courses on information retrieval techniques using PubMed and R programming language which resulted in a 30% increase in the number of relevant articles identified by the research team. \n\nMy prior experience includes internships at Maastricht Brain Imaging Center where I applied my skills in multi-staining protocols, light-sheet microscopy, and post-processing using Fiji Image J software and teaching Problem-Based Learning methodology at Maastricht University. I am an experienced team player and enjoy teaching, I am committed to delivering high-quality work and continuously improving my skills.",

This involved complex logic and problem solving as most of the time different labeling probes were not compatible with each other. We successfully implemented a beautiful and novel triple stain by the end of the project. I applied techniques such as iDISCO+, MASH and SWITCH clearing and staining procedures (IHC & fluorescence) as well as light-sheet microscopy. For post-processing, I developed skills in using Fiji Image J software.",
