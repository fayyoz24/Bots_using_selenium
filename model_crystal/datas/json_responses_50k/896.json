    "summary": "Hi there :) \n\nNice that you came across! Feel free to reach out if there is interest or common ground.\n\nMy biggest passion is a fair and sustainable fashion industry, changing towards a Social Circular Economy that values people, animals and the planet. \n \nAiming towards that change, I try to make use of my greatest strengths which are solving problems, reaching out to people and connecting the right dots. So far this really supported me in doing great things in collaboration with people. I particularly love to work with fashion brands to see how to proactively engage in social and environmental challenges and explore new approaches to reduce uncertainties and step into action.\n \nThe integration between my applied science studies in Fashion Management, my practical experience in Bangladesh and Tanzania, combined with the Master of Science in Global Management of Social Issues create a wonderful synergy that enables me to work on multiple wonderful projects. \n\nMy primary focus lies in promoting collaborative learning among diverse stakeholders within the fashion industry, as well as within organizations themselves. I firmly believe that a collaborative and compassionate approach, valuing both people and the planet, is crucial as it creates a space where limitless possibilities can emerge :)\n\nFeel free to leave me a message! I am always up for new ideas and awesome projects.",

I am very thankful that I was able to be a member of this group."
