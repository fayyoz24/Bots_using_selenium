    "summary": "Annalisa Pelizza  is Professor of Science and Technology Studies (STS) at the University of Bologna, where she holds the Chair in Sociology of Communication Processes. Before joining Bologna, she was Associate Professor at the University of Twente, department of Science, Technology and Policy Studies (STePS).\nHer research focuses on STS-informed methodologies to study fleeting online sociability, and on governance by data infrastructures shaping modern institutions. With her work, Annalisa brings tools proper to STS analyses to investigate and expand information systems studies and political sociology. This combination is made possible by her former experience working with governmental agencies and engineering companies, developing large-scale IT infrastructures.\nAnnalisa Pelizza was the recipient of several European Commission scientific grants and currently leads the \u201cProcessing Citizenship\u201d (http://processingcitizenship.eu) research group, funded by the European Research Council. The team investigates transnational data infrastructures for migration management as activities of European governance transformation. She has held visiting professorships at the Center for Technology in Society at the Munich Technical University (2016), the Institute for Advanced Studies in Paris (2017), the University of Twente (2019-2022).\n\n",

            "description": "Intensifying migration waves are changing EU policies\u2015with Hotspots being set up in frontline countries\u2015but also the way knowledge about migrants, institutions and territory is created. Information systems are key enablers of this knowledge. They materialize legislative, political, administrative dynamics in which citizenship, state and territory are co-produced.\nProcessingCitizenship aims to establish information systems as \u201cinterfaces\u201d that make visible changes in the modern nation state. It aims to develop a history of the present that accounts for contemporary materially-embedded practices of registration of migrants at Hotspots as activities of governance formation. It addresses three research questions: How are migrants\u2019 identities shaped in information systems-mediated registration practices, and how do migrants adapt or resist it? How are Member States and Europe re-enacted by data infrastructures for migration processing? How is territory reshaped?\nThe project combines globalization and border studies and surveillance studies in IT and migration with a materialist performative approach derived from science and technology studies and media geography. It analyses information systems, registration practices, data architectures and territorial patterns. Data will be collected via qualitative (script analysis, interviews, participant observation, discourse analysis) and computational (analysis of ontologies and algorithms, new method for web services tracking) techniques\nThe research is ground-breaking in three ways: 1) by focusing on alienage and on the technicalities of data infrastructures, it sets the basis for detecting incipient changes in the order of authority; 2) it develops brand new software methods for web services analysis that is expected to set a new promising field of techno-sociological research; 3) by combining contiguous disciplines rarely interacting, it amplifies their ability to understand the co-production of technology, society, knowledge",

Information systems are key enablers of this knowledge. They materialize legislative, political, administrative dynamics in which citizenship, state and territory are co-produced.\nProcessingCitizenship aims to establish information systems as \u201cinterfaces\u201d that make visible changes in the modern nation state. It aims to develop a history of the present that accounts for contemporary materially-embedded practices of registration of migrants at Hotspots as activities of governance formation. It addresses three research questions: How are migrants\u2019 identities shaped in information systems-mediated registration practices, and how do migrants adapt or resist it? How are Member States and Europe re-enacted by data infrastructures for migration processing? How is territory reshaped?\nThe project combines globalization and border studies and surveillance studies in IT and migration with a materialist performative approach derived from science and technology studies and media geography. It analyses information systems, registration practices, data architectures and territorial patterns. Data will be collected via qualitative (script analysis, interviews, participant observation, discourse analysis) and computational (analysis of ontologies and algorithms, new method for web services tracking) techniques\nThe research is ground-breaking in three ways: 1) by focusing on alienage and on the technicalities of data infrastructures, it sets the basis for detecting incipient changes in the order of authority; 2) it develops brand new software methods for web services analysis that is expected to set a new promising field of techno-sociological research; 3) by combining contiguous disciplines rarely interacting, it amplifies their ability to understand the co-production of technology, society, knowledge",

To investigate the patterns of self-empowerment that underpinned the development of computer-mediated communities in 2000s. To investigate how social actors involved in online aggregations account for the empowering potential of ICT.\n\nMethod. Bottom-up approach using a \"performative\" definition of the object of study: quali-quantitative (for N cases - using co-occurrence, search and replace and mapping software) and qualitative (for n cases) textual analysis. Data set: Prix Ars Electronica's Digital Communities submission forms archived from 2004 to 2007 (920 cases).\n\nResults. The empirical results call into question both leading sociological positions and hype-generated commonplaces as far as the notions of \"cyberculture\", \"digital revolution\" and \"empowerment\" are concerned. They call into question well-known sociological positions (i.e. Castells's networked society and Wellman's networks of sociability) that explain the relation between ICT and society through linear evolutionist models of \"dominance\", rather than co-existence of different forms of sociability. In addition, the results offer evidence to those arguments according to which current ICT developments represent the beginning of a new phase of technological enclosure.\n\nDerived applications. The results, apart from being officially presented at Prix Ars Electronica 2008, have been used by the Prix as a consultancy, as part of the re-design of the Digital Communities competition and archive. Publications (Pelizza 2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b) and participation as invited speaker in conferences Europe-wide have been a further output of the PhD research.",

Interoperability of Governmental Information Systems as Redesign of the Modernist State\".\n\nInteroperability as a form of data exchange that is meant to cross organizational boundaries is reconfiguring governmental assemblages in ways previously unforeseeable with traditional eGovernment policies. Interoperability is designed within governmental networks \u2013 at different scales (e.g. between municipalities and ministries), or among different areas (e.g. cadastral and tax offices) \u2013 but also among public bodies and private or civil society actors (e.g. contracted companies exerting public functions).\n\nA major transformation is taking place, and it is invisible and unnoticeable not only to citizens whose data are exchanged, but also to the same decision-makers and practitioners. It is as a result of technical capabilities \u2013 and not of changes in the law or formal system at large \u2013 that shifts in functions among institutional branches and among the Public and the Private happen. Every-day evidence speaks for an unnoticed, technology-led relocation of formal roles in the public administration, and rearrangement of public/private equilibria. \n\nNew questions emerge, as a consequence. For instance, where does responsibility lie in case of misuse of data? On actors that \u201cstore\u201d them, or on those who distribute them, or on those who \u201cuse\u201d them? Most importantly, how does this proliferation of intermediaries affect the contract between government and citizens?\n\nThe TRANSLATING INSTITUTIONS research recognizes that integration of administrative information flows is not just a matter of efficiency. It re-designs relations among actors: between governmental bodies at different scales, the Private and the Public, and ultimately between the Governed and the Governing.\n\nMain research question: How are authority and accountability redistributed throughout the implementation of interoperable information architectures?",

It offers globally-recognised senior and junior researchers a chance to carry out five- to nine-month research stays in Paris.\n\nThe Paris IAS was founded in 2008 by Fondation Maison des Sciences de l\u2019Homme (FMSH), \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), and \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS). In 2011, it became an independent, autonomous institution, with support from the 13 main universities and research institutes of the Paris region, as well as the City of Paris, FMSH, and the \u00cele-de-France Regional Authority. It also enjoys funding from the French Ministry for Research and Higher Education as part of the \u201cInvestments for the Future\u201d programme currently managed by RFIEA (a network of the four Institutes for Advanced Study in France).\nThe Institute has a very selective recruitment process. We launch an annual Call for Applications throughout the international academic world. Preselected applications are first reviewed by at least two outside evaluators specialised in the applicant\u2019s research field. The Institute\u2019s Scientific Committee, comprised of internationally-recognised independent researchers, creates then a list of qualified applicants on the basis of the external evaluations, and the IEA\u2019s Director makes the final selection.\nEach year, we welcome around 20 researchers, one-third of whom are junior level. They cover a wide range of disciplines: archaeology, economics, psychology, philosophy, history, literature, philology, linguistics, art theory, architecture, sociology, or the history of science.\nSee the list of current guest researchers: http://www.paris-iea.fr/en/fellows",

To design, develop and implement new methods to assess the usability of the Emilia-Romagna governments' online services, and users (i.e. local authorities, businesses, citizens) satisfaction.\n\nMethod. By substituting the notions of \"usability\" and \"immediacy\" proper to cognitive ergonomics with ANT's notions of \"prescription\" and \"subscription\" (Akrich e Latour 1992), I designed a new technique to assess the \"appreciability\" of an online service as the gap between the forms of interaction allowed by the digital interface and situated practices of use. To analyse the interface, I used script analysis and the semiotic narrative schema to identify intended users, their competencies, objectives and behaviors. To analyze actual users' practices I drew upon situated narrative interviews and participant observation.\n\nResults. Recommendations for the improvement of specific online services. On an organizational level, recommendations were given to optimize the smooth-running of functions between the marketing and the design areas, among public institutions and their contractors, among institutions at different scales (trans- national, regional, local)",
