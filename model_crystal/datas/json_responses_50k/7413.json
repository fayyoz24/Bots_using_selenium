    "summary": "I am currently working with Ekata, Mastercard to help businesses with the ability to link any digital transaction to the human behind it.\n-----\n\nI've had the privilege to grow up in different parts of the world from a young age which has given me a unique perspective on people and life. People tend to be the same, but I believe that the beauty truly lies in our differences. It's my fascination of these differences: cultural, political, economical, social that drove to read IR for my higher education.\n\nAfter finishing my MA & having experience as a researcher in New Delhi, I had ambitions of pursuing a PhD., but let's just say destiny had other plans in store for me.\n\nMy passion for sales, tech & SaaS came unexpectedly, but once it found me, I don't think I can ever let it go. I've been fortunate enough to be part of great organization's that are really looking to change the game. I've met great sales people that have taught me the meaning of building a strong human relationship with their clients, and that has helped me progress in my sales career so far.\n\nFrom reading about EU Energy Policy at 19, to working as a Business Developer for a company that built an Energy Management System for SME's at 25. From my days watching my grandma negotiate at the vegetable market at 7, to the days of dealing and negotiating in B2B contracts by 23. From day-dreaming about bringing \"power to the people\" in my politics classes to representing SwipeGuide in their mission to empower the front-line workers. Life is always strangely collected if you stop and connect the dots.\n\nI value respect, kindness, passion, a good work ethic and a hunter mindset.\n\nWe only have one life and the biggest hope I have is that I never stop continuously reinventing myself to be the best version of me.",
