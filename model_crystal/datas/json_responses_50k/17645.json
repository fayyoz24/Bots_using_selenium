            "description": "One of the things that struck me the most when I moved to Thailand was the disparity in living conditions between people who lived only a few minutes apart. For example, Klong Toei, Bangkok's largest slum, lies only two kilometers from the city's wealthiest areas. Constantly having that thought in the back of my head, I decided I wanted to get to know the community.\nAt the start of the covid-19 pandemic, a friend of mine introduced me to the Xaverian Missionary Fathers, a small group of people focusing on community development around the country, with whom I decided to volunteer. We would play with local kids every weekend, feed the sick and elderly, and in July 2020, I was teaching English at an elementary school in the slums every day. Additionally, I had the opportunity to visit other missionaries in Mae Sot, in the North of Thailand. During that week, I lived with Burmese & Karen refugees and participated in their family life. I learned about life in refugee camps (education, jobs, and healthcare), and taught English to kids at an orphanage.\u00a0\nFinally, I organized a large clothes donation for the people of Klong Toei and reached hundreds of people.\nAll those eye-opening experiences push me to keep going and use my privilege to provide more help, spread awareness, and educate people.\u00a0\n\nCheck out this article my dear friend Micol Galante wrote for Bangkok Post on the Xaverian Missionary Fathers in Thailand: https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1976843/missionaries-extend-helping-hand-amid-downturn-in-slums-of-klong-toey"
