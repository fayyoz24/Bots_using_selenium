    "summary": "I am a passionate and energetic leader who puts efforts into achieving great results and knows how to work effectively in a multicultural environment.\n\nIf you look at my working experience, this shows that I am an experienced project and team coordinator in both market research (13 years) and NGO areas (25 years); that I have worked in international environments, dealing with people from different cultures; that I managed teams and groups; that I studied and worked abroad. All this is what I've done so far, not who and I am.\n\nSo who am I? \nI am open minded. \nI am driven by passion once a new project captures my attention. \nI get things done. \nI believe in solutions, in people and I think there is always a way to reach your goal. \nI like challenges and almost never said no to a new one, even if it came with new, unknown and unpredictable details. \nI am not afraid to start all over again.\nI am good at learning quickly and challenge myself and people around me.\nI want to understand so I ask questions. Lots of them. All the time.",
