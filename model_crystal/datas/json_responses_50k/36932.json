    "summary": "Welcome to my profile! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI am Program Manager and a human rights advocate originally from Brazil, currently based in the Netherlands.\n\nMy journey is all about driving transformative change and pursuing justice while collaborating with diverse networks. Over the years, I've gathered rich experience working for NGOs and social enterprises, where I've had the opportunity to coordinate impactful programs, conduct research, craft advocacy strategies, and launch compelling campaigns.\n\nOn the academic front, I hold a master's degree in Public International Law from Utrecht University. I've also been expanding my horizons by diving into the world of Digital Marketing, since I've been interested in expanding my knowledge of communication strategies.\n\nMy curiosity for cultures and people, coupled with my passion for communication, has driven me to become fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, and English - and to continuously make an effort to learn Dutch. This unique blend of languages and multicultural experiences equips me to assist projects effectively in connecting with their target audience and expanding their network globally.\n\nIf you're are looking for a dynamic addition to your Programs, Human Rights, or Campaign team, feel free to reach out to discuss collaborations and my availability. \n\nLooking forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities! \ud83c\udf0e",
