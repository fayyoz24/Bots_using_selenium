    "summary": "Raised on a mixed arable and dairy farm in the Dutch province of Brabant, the agricultural sector in general and cooperatives in particular is a recurring theme in my career. I concluded my study Management, Economics and Law in Rotterdam with a graduation research project on the legal and fiscal aspects of farmers' cooperatives in the European Union. After graduation I started working as a policy and project officer at the National Cooperative Council (NCR), where I worked closely with board members, employees and members of Dutch farmers' cooperatives. Subsequently, I joined The Greenery, a commercial and logistics cooperative company that supplies fresh fruit, vegetables and mushrooms in the Netherlands and abroad all year round. There I was able to advise, guide and support the cooperative affairs department, department boards, the general meeting of members and individual members. In 2009 made the switch to ZLTO, the association for farmers and horticulturists in Zeeland, North Brabant and South Gelderland. As a horticultural specialist I was responsible for regional and (inter)national advocacy for the greenhouse horticulture and mushroom sector. I started in 2014 as a business advisor at Agriterra, where I previously carried out advisory missions as an Agripool expert in Vietnam, Kenya, Cambodia and Indonesia. Started with a focus on cooperative development in Indonesia and afterwards responsible for supporting Agriterra customers and teams in Nepal and the Philippines. Next to that, I have also done assignments in China, Myanmar, Uganda and Uzbekistan. In 2022 I made the switch to Rabobank, with almost 2 million members one of the largest cooperatives in the Netherlands, where I can contribute and advice as Advisor Cooperative and Governance on issues related to the cooperative (renewal) and governance.\n\nI see myself as a flexible, loyal and practical person with a heart for the agricultural and cooperative sector. And as a networker who enjoys working together, and making new connections. In addition to being stress resistant, culturally sensitive and accurate, as a coach I am able to let others get the best out of themselves.",
