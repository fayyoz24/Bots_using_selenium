    "summary": "Highly motivated, ambitious and eager to build my career, currently studying Bachelor(Information Technology) at Hogeschool Rotterdam. Life is a journey of learning and I am always up for new challenges so learning and developing new skills are a priority. I am very adaptive, a pro-active person with a result-oriented mindset. I speak three languages (Arabic, English and Dutch). \nI enjoy traveling and working in a multinational environment. I like electronics and programming so I am studying now Information Technology at the Hogeschool Rotterdam.\n\nDuring my first year and second year i learned Python/Django, C#, Android studio(Java and XML), react, NodeJS, PostgreSQL and Firebase.\n\nIn my third year, I started my training at Rabobank and learned to analyze and perform performance tests for several existing and new features of Rabobank applications. In this year also I am following a minor about Artificial Intelligence(AI). Where i learn machine learning and deep learning algorithms and structures also I made a project with 3 other students. This project was a prototype for AI glass for blind people where the blind people can see through the technology of AI. We made a programme to take capture from the camera and speaking the result of that caption to the blind people, which I really enjoyed that project. \n\nIn my fourth year I did a minor towards leadership in healthcare. During this minor I learned several things about leadership in a company or organization. I also had to do research with 4 other nursing students for Erasmus MC and IT Campus. This research was about e-consultancy within Erasmus MC and we achieved a good result during this research.\n\nI started also my self-educated and developed my programming skills by following a bootcamp, called the \u201cSamen Programmeren\u201d programme\u201d, that aimed at HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, Algorithm, Git, GitHub, Scrum Framework, Trello and developing skills concerning the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Nodejs).",
