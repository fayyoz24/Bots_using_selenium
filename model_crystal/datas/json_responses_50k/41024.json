    "summary": "As a Health Coach, Customer Service Agent, Project Developer, community manger and Sales Representative, I have gained valuable skills in communication, organization, problem-solving, and public relations. My experience as a Health and Wellness community manager and coach has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of human behavior and the factors that motivate people to make positive choices in their lives and work. As a Customer Service Agent, I have learned how to empathize with customers, resolve their issues, and provide exceptional service. And as a Project Developer, I have become skilled at managing timelines, budgets, and resources to ensure successful project completion.\n\nMy previous work experience allowed me to develop excellent public relations skills throughout Central America and North America. I was in constant communication with travel agencies, immigration services, hotel chains and more which helped me to establish strong relationships with key stakeholders. I am passionate about creating positive experiences for people, whether it is through helping them achieve their goals, delivering exceptional customer service, or building strong relationships with partners and stakeholders. I am excited to continue using my skills to make a positive impact in the world and create communities that thrive in a healthy environment.",
