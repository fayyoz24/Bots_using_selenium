    "summary": "Using my solid background as Senior Project Manager / Producer in the field of (digital) media, software, events and marketing to drive value creation and transparency in Global Procurement. \n\nI have always been focused on innovation and trends within the marketing and media landscape. Working with a large variety of stakeholders, I keep a strong focus on managing expectations, ensuring deadlines are met within budget and maintaining an overview of strategic goals. \n\nUsed to working with media and marketing directors, account managers, advertising & media agencies and A-list brands. I managed international multidisciplinary project teams consisting of creatives, 2D motion graphic artists, 3D artists, (multimedia) programmers. I am used to working in an Agile environment. \n\nThis experience made me solution oriented and able to see opportunities instead of problems. \nIn my past roles I have grown with companies from start-up to scale-up. Due to the nature of start-ups, I have been involved in projects from start to finish. From identifying the scope, writing proposals and tender bids to briefing and assigning work to internal resources and external production vendors. This experience gives me an advantage in successfully negotiating with external partners and the ability to recognize potential risks. \n\nI am a digital native with an analogue heart and a strong interest in all that technology and multimedia have to offer. I love a challenge and I always aim for personal development and professional growth. \n\nI have executed projects both nationally and internationally, mostly throughout Europe, North America and Asia. Brands I have worked for on projects include BMW, Sony, Ford, Samsung, Volvo, Toshiba, Philips, Mercedes, UNESCO, PLUS Supermarkets, Heineken, Becel and Flora. \n\nAdvertising and media agencies I have worked with include Saatchi & Saatchi, Omnicom, Publicis, Starcom, Ogilvy, Wieden + Kennedy, Mullenlowe, Grey Worldwide, Cheil, OMD, Imagination and TBWA.",

In close cooperation with the Jora Vision and Dolfinarium team, NuFormer produced the 3D video mapping animations for the new Aqua Bella show. The upcoming three years the Aqua Bella show will take the visitors of the Dolfinarium onto a journey around the world and will display the beauty but also the vulnerability of the earth. Displaying different continents was the main reason why a traditional fixed piece of scenery was not an option. The animations are projected onto a tailor-made decor, designed by NuFormer. The decor consists of multiple big screens that, put together, make up a big abstract tail. By means of 3D video mapping the screen is transformed into beautiful landscapes that alternate with the dolphin behaviors. The DolfijndoMijn is one of the first theaters worldwide to incorporate this technique into their show.",

Until the 19th of October 2012, the day that Starbucks, in a joint venture with Tata Global Beverages, opened her first shop in Mumbai. This festive event was reinforced by an impressive video mapping projection on the Elphinstone Building, the place where the first Indian Starbucks coffee shop is housed.\n\nThe script and storyboard for this production were established in close cooperation with the clients. The projection on the 40 meter wide building formed a challenge because of the short distance between the fa\u00e7ade and the public. Therefore the viewing angles were an important element in the content production process to make sure that the 8 minute mapping projection could be viewed well by all attending VIPs. And it worked out fine. Again a video mapping projection was the successful culmination of a very special event.",

In the complete darkness, the fa\u00e7ade of the Schleissheim Palace turned into a massive canvas for NuFormer\u2019s video mapping that showed striking video footage from the last played Champions League games and all its famous players. Gradually the show expanded to enlighten the full 60-meter width of the fa\u00e7ade. The 3D video mapping projection ended with a blast of \u2018superlative\u2019 animations and Champions League peak moments to prepare the crowd for what was still to come the following night during the final game. The guests had to be wowed and surprised until the very end and it was the talk of the evening and the start of the pre-match excitement for the special guests.\n\nMost of the video footage was shot during games played in the same tournament just weeks and in some cases days prior to the event and therefore supplied to NuFormer very shortly before the video mapping projection had to take place. This last-minute merge of 3D artwork as well as the editing of the footage was a real challenge due to the time constraint.\n\nCreative content production by NuFormer.

This brand-new mix allows for engaging interaction between the audience and a 3D character (accomplished by giving the actor in the motion capture suit a live video and audio feed of the audience) projected onto a building. I had the pleasure to work on the project management and production for the execution of the event. \n\nFor this production NuFormer joined forces with motion capture specialist Motek Entertainment. The technical production was a collaboration between NuFormer, Motek and Creative Technology Holland. Music by Studio Rockfish. \n\nLinks:\nThe making-of: vimeo.com/39409273 \nFull version (20 min.): vimeo.com/39056295\n\nMocap Mapping was shortlisted at the 2012 Tomorrow Awards",

Located in the very heart of the Ford booth, a twenty-foot-tall elevator took attendees straight through the ceiling of the hall into \u201cthe Cloud\u201d. Up there, a 360-degree seamless projection by NuFormer showcased Ford\u2019s future of in-vehicle technology. The projection content was a vivid and advanced combination of 3D animations and 2D motion graphics. After the 3 minute film the lift serviced people back to the ground and it was clear: Ford showed off its strive for innovation and forward thinking with their \u201cLiving Connected Experience\u201d, the largest stand at this renowned exhibition.\n\nScript and storyboard design in cooperation with Imagination.

At this moment the NuFormer team is creating the last part of the content. Also they prepare the full production for final and permanent setup and execution.\n\nThe video mapping content will be projected on the Wild Goose Pagoda in the city of Xi\u2019an, the ancient capital of China. This projection, that will as expected draw many people to the city in the near future, will be officially launched in spring of this year. Please follow our social media platforms to keep updated about this.\n\nThe video mapping projection is based on one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature, titled \u2018Journey to the West\u2019. The novel is a fictionalized account of the legendary pilgrimage to India of a Buddhist monk who eventually returned and brought back and introduced Buddhism to China.\n\nFor this cultural project NuFormer cooperates with the Chinese and Beijing based company Dream Lighting. This collaboration resulted in a refined script, an extended storyboard and advanced film recording for chromakey on location in Beijing. In this studio the monk and the horse were filmed. NuFormer did the direction of actors and the organization of crew and facilities during the shootings. Dream Lighting arranged the studio facilities and the 80 hands studio crew that worked hard to have all the shots recorded in three days. \n\nThe film footage was edited and post-produced in the NuFormer studio in The Netherlands. Also the 2D and 3D design and creation as well as the final composition was done in the NuFormer studio by the NuFormer creative team. \n\nThe music for the production has been composed by one of China\u2019s most famous composers and played by his dedicated musicians. Mostly tradional instruments were used and in close communication with NuFormer the music score was based on every separate scene and related emotions.",

The 3D projections turned the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings into two giant pinball machines in which soccer played a central role.\n\nThe theatre at the Plaza Santa Ana on a busy square in the middle of the city centre and the Colegio San Augustin, were the two buildings chosen for the projections. At this last location opposite the Bernabeu Stadium a VIP party was held. The 3D projection was shown there to a particular group of approximately 1500 people.\n\nFor both projections the central theme was 'Imagine Football in 3D'. In order to design these projections NuFormer used advanced chromakey technique. The 3D content and animations were of outstanding quality.",
