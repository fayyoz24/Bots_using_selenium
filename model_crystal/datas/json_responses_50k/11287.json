    "summary": "I am associate professor Work and Organisational Psychology.  I received my PhD in Occupational Health Psychology from Utrecht University on the topic of financial success and well-being of farm couples. Since then I have specialized in psychology of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurial employee behavior. I also teach cross cultural psychology, professional ethics and trainer skills. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of fair, healthy and engaging work environments in which people thrive, grow and collaborate to contribute to the success of their teams and organizations. \n\nI conduct research into psychological aspects of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship from an interdisciplinary perspective, looking at the interaction between the person and the environment. Major characteristics of my research are employing a multi-level and longitudinal approach in order to capture dynamic interactions between variables on different levels of investigation. For example, I have investigated whether the policies and cultures of different countries influence the relationship between stressors on the one hand and the well-being and performance of entrepreneurs on the other. Much of my research has a cross-cultural component.\n\nSpecialties: Psychology of Entrepreneurship; Cross-Cultural Psychology; Occupational Health Psychology\nPassion for Work; Job Design; Well-being; Job Performance; Structural Equation Modeling Techniques; \nMultilevel Modeling Techniques",

Building on the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM), this study investigated whether need for challenge, autonomy and balance predict intrapreneurial behavior, job crafting, work engagement and need satisfaction. Method. Data of 642 public servants (response rate = 58 %) participating in a 2-wave follow-up survey study with a three-month interval were analysed using SmartPLS2.\r\n\r\nResults. In support of the KCM, need for challenge, and not need for autonomy or balance, predicted employee intrapreneurial behaviour and job crafting. Crafting challenges and job resources at Time 2 followed from employee intrapreneurial behavior at Time 1. Intrapreneurial behavior and job crafting did not predict need satisfaction over time, but correlated with work engagement at Time 1, which did predict both challenge and autonomy need satisfaction at Time 2.\r\n\r\nConclusion. Need for challenge is the driving force behind intrapreneurial and job crafting behavior,  but the accompanying work engagement predicts need fulfilment.\r\n",

            "description": "Following an active approach in personality and entrepreneurial success (Frese, 2009), the current study tests bi-directional relationships between personality traits proximal to entrepreneurial activities (self-efficacy, risk taking propensity, need for autonomy, tolerance for ambiguity, achievement orientation and creativity), subjective entrepreneurial success and the odds of starting a new establishment 3 years later. \r\nSeveral meta-analyses have shown that personality traits relate to business success (Rauch & Frese, 2007; Zhao & Seibert, 2006). However, few longitudinal studies have been conducted on this topic. Most studies presume that the relationship leads from presumably stable personality characteristics to entrepreneurial performance. However, not all personality characteristics are unchangeable, some are malleable over time (Luthans & Yousseff, 2004), and there are good theoretical arguments to expect reversed relationships. For example, according to Bandura\u2019s Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1999), mastery experience leads to higher self-efficacy and increased self-esteem. \r\nThe current study is a three year follow-up study among 119 entrepreneurs in the hospitality industry (response rate Wave 1 = 23 %; Wave 2 = 43 %). Entrepreneurs filled in on-line questionnaires measuring the same variables at T1 and T2. Personality characteristics were measured with pre-existing, reliable, multi-item scales. Subjective entrepreneurial success was measured as satisfaction with the business (faces scale, Kunin, 1955) and 2 items asking entrepreneurs to rate how successful they were. Third criterion was having opened one or more new establishments at T2.\r\nResults of multiple (logistic) regression analyses show that personality characteristics at T1 (tolerance for ambiguity and achievement orientation) predicted starting a new establishment at T2. None of the personality characteristics at T1 predicted subjective entrepreneurial success at T2. However, the extent to which entrepreneurs were satisfied with their business, and the extent to which they rated themselves as successful at T1 did predict higher achievement orientation and creativity at T2.\r\nThese findings challenge the currently dominant point of view that personality predicts entrepreneurial performance, and underscore the need for longitudinal research designs. As both a theoretical and practical implication the results show it is necessary to fit specific personality traits to specific performance criteria.\r\n",
