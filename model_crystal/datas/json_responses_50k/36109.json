My job was to redesign one of the receivers (band 5) to a more mass producible version. \n\nFun fact: The ALMA observatory had an essential role capturing the first picture of a black hole!\n\n- ALMA project-\nALMA is an interferometric array of sub-mm radio telescopes located on a high desert plateau in Chile. It is currently the largest ground-based astronomical project with participation from Europe, United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Chile and Taiwan. The location of ALMA has been chosen because the altitude and dry desert environment minimises the amount water vapour in the air column above the telescopes. One of the major science drivers of ALMA is to observe the cold universe, in particular the microwave radiation emitted by water molecules in clouds and protoplanetary disks. This radiation is however also readily absorbed by the water molecules in our own atmosphere.",
