    "summary": "\"The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men [and women] who can dream of things that never were.\" - John Keats. \n\nI have a passion for finding a balance between science between and art:\nThis led me to pursue marketing and brand management where I have been able to develop skills in business fundamentals whilst incorporating creativity in brand executions. \n\nI am an artist (see some of my doodles at www.imagineero-sphere.blogspot.com), dancer (have a look at my awards below), music-lover (I started a business for this during university - check out UTG Indie Merch in my profile), reader (all things fantasy) and traveler (I most recently traveled to Galapagos Islands, Cuenca, Guayaquil and Quito in Ecuador).",
