    "summary": "Keren Levi is a choreographer based in Amsterdam. Between dance, live music and video Levi\u2019s work is best described as interdisciplinary, yet in its core it is founded on choreographic principles. Since 2017, Levi's company NeverLike has been receiving  structural funding support from the city of Amsterdam. \n\nKeren Levi\u2019s body of work includes \"Territory\" (2004) , a performance about identity and framing, the duet \"Couple-Like\" in collaboration with Ugo Dehaes (2006), \"The Dry Piece\" (2013), a video dance performance about beauty, symmetry and femininity, which received its XL EDITION on 2016,  the sound-movement concert \u201cClubbing\u201d (2015), a collaboration with composer Tom Parkinson, \"Footnotes\"(2018) based on a translation on a musical score (Crippled Symmetry by Morton Feldman) yet another collaboration with Parkinson and artist Krijn de Koning who created an artwork especially for this piece, and \"unmute\" (2019), a music-dance piece in collaboration with composer Yannis Kyriakides and percussion group Slagwerk Den Hague. Levi's upcoming performance \"In Service\" (2020) is a commission by Norrdans, Sweden. \n\nLevi teaches \u00a0in The School for New Dance Development (SNDO), as well as in festivals, training programs and companies across Europe. In 2014 she has graduated from the MA program of Amsterdam Master of Choreography (AMCh).",
