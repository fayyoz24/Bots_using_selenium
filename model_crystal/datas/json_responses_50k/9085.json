    "summary": "I'm a recent graduate with an MSc in Land Surveying and Geographical Information Systems Engineering.\nDuring my studies, I focused on Surveying, Remote Sensing, Cartography, photogrammetry, and GIS, gaining practical experience in using various surveying tools and software like Total Station, Civil 3D, and ArcGIS. I was involved in several projects, including surveying a garden space in my university using Total Station and building a topographic map using Civil 3D and Total Station, and deformation detection from close-range videos. \n\nMy passion for GIS and spatial tools stems from their ability to help us better understand the world around us, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems. Which, I believe will be a chance for me to make a change in the world through the work I do.\n\nCurrently, I am seeking an internship or entry-level position to apply my knowledge and gain more experience. I am a hard worker, eager to learn, and can work well under pressure while being a good team player.\n\nI look forward to connecting with you here on LinkedIn, or you can reach me at ahmaddayoub299@gmail.com.",
