This project formed part of the Gas-to-Power Plan under which project management, engineering, supply, construction and commissioning were undertaken for the realization of the Onshore Receiving Facilities (ORF). \n\nAs a Process Engineer I :\n\nDeveloped Kanban systems and other lean manufacturing systems for the purpose of :\n1. Decreasing pre-production and production lead times\n2. Reducing waste\n3. Decreasing Cost\n4. Improving the overall efficiency of the production process  \n\nUsed statistical analysis ( 3-sigma limits) to develop control charts for the purpose of detecting out of control conditions;\nThis was useful to control the production process and ensure that for example the manufacturing process does not continuously yield defective material parts.\n\nCollaborated with the supply chain department in order to determine points within the chain that needed improvement. \nSome of these points included:\n1. Storage and packing of materials\n2. Transportation (very important when handling shock sensitive, temperature and humidity sensitive materials).\n\nDeveloped process related documents for the purpose of providing a clear format as to how certain work procedures should be carried out. \n\nCarried out non-destructive testing like Magnetic Particle Testing and Dye Penetrant Testing for the purpose of detecting surface and subsurface defects in materials.\n\n\u2022\tInterpreted and reviewed latest structural drawings with the engineering team \n\u2022\tPerformed daily reception of preassembled and erected members and updated the planning    department on the daily and overall work progress. \n\u2022\tInspected and reported on refabrication processes.\n\u2022\tPerformed elevation and alignment checks for columns, low pressure vessels and tanks.\n\u2022\tProvided routine and consistent checks on tightening, bolts, nuts and washer assemblies, and calibrated torque wrenches.",
