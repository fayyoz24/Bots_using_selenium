You step into the shoes of a commercial pilot how just dreamed his dream job of flying for the local Hawaiian air charter: \"Kahului Air\". \nOver a course of 7 days you have to perform the everyday operations of the charter, which varies from transporting passengers to ferrying cargo. \nFor this mission pack we tried to put more realism in by having longer flights, with cold and dark start-ups performing checklists, IFR flights and performing emergency checklists. \n\nIt was a challenging project, but also I personally learned a lot of new things from producing it. It certainly was very interesting to work on this project. ",
