During this internship I developed a digital equalizer based on maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) for a 112-Gbit/s intensity-modulation direct detection optical transmission system. The work included theoretic understanding of digital signal processing and optical communications, algorithm implementation in Python and validation of the results in an optical communications research lab. The work resulted in two paper presentations at European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) held in September 2016, one as first author and one as co-author. The grade I received for my internship work is 9 out of 10.",
