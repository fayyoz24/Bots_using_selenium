Through in-depth research, we analyzed the various challenges the WFP faced in the food insecure regions of Nepal, Honduras, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and presented our findings and recommendations to the WFP. \n\nAs part of a team of International Studies Students, called Creating Access to Food, I researched the food insecurity issues in Nepal, examined the issues of Food Preferences, and analyzed beneficial roles of ICT in Food Insecure regions (focusing on the connectivity and the content of ICT). \n\nDuring the consultancy project I was the sub-group leader of the Nepal Research Group, and I obtained the role of Devil's Advocate. As a Devil's Advocate, I critically analyzed the ideas of our consultancy team, and offered new insights on how to improve the communication and performance of our group.",
