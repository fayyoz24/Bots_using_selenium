    "summary": "Aquatic ecologist with a deep understanding of data analysis and computational modeling. Has a strong background in emissions, water quality, hydrodynamics and catchment hydrology. Operates both nationally and internationally. \n\nI\u2019m passionate about protecting our natural environment and its wildlife. My believe is that the ecological functioning of our water systems can coexist with our use of the world, as long as we have a good quantification of our impact and are aware of the choices that we are making. By using ecological models and data-analysis, both with a strong link to the environmental conditions, we can estimate this impact and determine where our current knowledge is limiting. This knowledge is crucial for making educated and sustainable decisions. \n\nIn my career I\u2019ve developed strong skills in developing concepts with customers and translating those to technical applications. \n\nMy personal interest is in habitat analysis and connectivity assessments based on field data and contributing models (water quality, hydrology, hydrodynamics etc.). \n\nMy technical skills are in:\n- ecological models (habitat analysis, connectivity, individual based models), \n- water quality models (D-WAQ; D-Emissions; WFD-Explorer), \n- Lagrangian particle tracking models (D-PART), \n- GIS (ArcMap; QuantumGIS; GRASS;  PostGIS), \n- programming/scripting (R; Python; FORTRAN90) ,\ncatchment models, hydrodynamic models, databases, data visualization, statistics and optimization.",
