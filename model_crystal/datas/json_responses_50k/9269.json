During the week, we had the opportunity to work with Mercedes-Benz and look behind the scenes.\n\nI had to hand in a \"Pre-assignment\" about big data in preparation for this week. \nIn the week itself (22/03 - 26/03), we received several briefings and tasks from Mercedes-Benz Data. We had to formulate a communication concept in one of the assignments. Then we had to present this to the manager of Mercedes-Benz Data. In the final assignment, my team created an animation video/ customer journey map and several posters and gave them to Mercedes-Benz Data.\nI can proudly say that I was the designated leader of our group.",
