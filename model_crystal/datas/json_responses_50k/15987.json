When equipment is subcontracted it also includes guidance (technical/kick off/progress) and the performance of inspections at subcontractors located all over Europe and Asia.\n\nIn addition to the above tasks I also assist different disciplines in our project team (Complex Heat Exchangers) as quality control, procurement and mechanical engineering. I also gained a lot of knowledge and expierence in the field of applied metallurgy, failure mechanisms and pressure/heat exchange equipment during operation. Assisting clients during failure investigations and providing supervision both on and offshore (OPITO BOSIET + NOGEPA trained 0.5A). \n\nMaterial such as duplex stainless steel has my special interest.
