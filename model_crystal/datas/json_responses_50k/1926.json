The exhibition responded to a ubiquitous feeling of anxiety engendered by the perceived threat of war, terrorism, climate change, social polarisation, and the erosion of the welfare state. The exhibition also questioned the feeling that the end of an era is approaching. With impressive images, the artists evoked both a sense of immediate threat and measures of time beyond human comprehension. With the continuous presence of live performers, the inescapable question of humankind\u2019s role forms the heart of this exhibition.\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition was the theatrical installation Domain of Things by Pedro G\u00f3mez-Ega\u00f1a. On a steel structure, almost two metres above the ground, there was a twilight-lit living room without walls. Half-empty cups, an open laptop, and other details suggesting someone\u2019s recent presence. When the house\u2019s wooden floorboards start to slide like tectonic plates, it becomes clear that people have been present all along. Like a machine, tacitly and slowly, they set the construction into motion. Why did these people go underground? To seek shelter from the instability in the world above, or are they part of the very mechanism causing the instability?",
