Love and death in the age of Trump \u2014 the title of one of the tunes \u2013 is strange, scary, and uncertain. Truth is variable. You may be better off with a healthy dose of skepticism than blind faith in your lover, your guru, or your leader. You may have great plans for the day \u2014 or your life \u2014 but it\u2019s almost always later than you think. And the reality you are stuck with is almost certainly not the reality you ordered.\n\n*********************************************************\n\nRecorded on a vintage hard disk recorder in a tiny private studio in The Hague, mixed on a pc in a living room and mastered more or less by trial and error, \u201cSo late so soon\u201d is as bare-bones in its essence as it was in its production - a bass, two electric guitars, a bit of blues harp, and three voices, mostly recorded live in the studio in a couple of takes. Katvanger may be dealing with some serious stuff here, but nearly always with whimsy, irony, and frequently, tongue firmly in cheek.\n",
