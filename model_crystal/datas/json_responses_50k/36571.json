    "summary": "Experience with:\nOff-grid living, organic fruit farming, intentional community management, field data collection, exhibition hosting, community building, managing volunteers, survey setup and analysis, planning and managing the digging of water retention areas, laboratory work, organization of natural disaster after-care, festival building, sustainable design and construction of kitchens, nomadic living, cooking for crowds, mediation, suicide prevention, giving tours, caf\u00e9 floor management, bar tending, fundraising, land assessment, straw bale building, foraging, food forests, software development.\n\nCourses in:\nCommunity supported agriculture founding and management, viticulture, soil water management in semi-arid regions, off-grid solar panel and wi-fi setup, welding, tractor driving, soil analysis, tree nurseries, direct-marketing, apple variety breeding, de-escalation, laboratory safety, writing for the web, human centered design, weather analysis, flying glider planes, stone sculpting, photography, zen meditation, woodland management, chainsaw operating, quality control of agricultural produce, organic transitioning, bio-dynamic agriculture, tree grafting, pruning fruit trees, scrum, agile.\n\nDevelopments:\nI\u2019ve acquired 2 ha of beautiful land for turning it into a food forest, am co-responsible for doing the same with a plot of over 100 ha, and more is underway. For this purpose I developed an application for the prediction of edible plant species success in any given area. It indicates where to sow what and reach maximum biodiversity and edibility for an as stable, resilient and nutritious food forest as possible on any given plot in the world. This process resulted in studying software engineering at a remarkably open minded university department, whilst continuing to work on the food forest web app in order to improve its precision, expand its functionalities and to make it suitable for use by a wider audience. In this process I am expanding my skills in software engineering and organizational processes, with the purpose of easing the beautiful sustainable transition we are going through.\n\nCountries:\nI\u2019ve lived in the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Portugal, Switzerland again, Belgium and the Netherlands again. I\u2019m fluent in Dutch, English, German and Schwiizerd\u00fc\u00fctsch.\n\nCurrent main project:\nExpanding the web app that for any given area in the world indicates which edible plants can grow wild on this location. More functionalities are under development for aiding the creation, maintenance, spreading and improvement of food forests worldwide.",
