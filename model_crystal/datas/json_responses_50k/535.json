    "summary": "I am passionate about achieving a harmonious coexistence between humanity and our environment. This passion shapes my life philosophy. \n\nMy journey began in Ecuador and Italy, where I cultivated a strong interest in science and sustainability. Seeking to make a difference, I embarked on my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering at TU/e in Eindhoven. This foundation empowered me with a comprehensive understanding of fundamental principles and provided me with a powerful toolset to address global challenges. During my time at KTH in Stockholm, while working on my thesis, I discovered a compelling intersection between applied sciences and the food industry, allowing me to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. Motivated by this realization, I decided to pursue a Master's in Food Technology at WUR in Wageningen, where I encountered remarkable people and abundant opportunities.\n\nA pivotal moment in my journey occurred when I joined a group of determined students to participate in a challenge offered by the university. Our collective effort culminated in winning the Rethink Waste Challenge, which served as a catalyst for the next transformative phase of my life. Driven by our innovative solution to valorize waste from the food industry, my team and I founded Afterlife, a company dedicated to making a meaningful impact.\n\nThrough Afterlife, I am convinced that I can play a significant role in addressing the urgent challenges associated with nourishing our world in a healthy and sustainable manner. By restoring the equilibrium between humanity and nature, I am committed to leaving a positive legacy for future generations.",
