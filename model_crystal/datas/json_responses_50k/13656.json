    "summary": "Open, enthusiastic, curious and eager to learn new things. As a person and as a professional a define myself as loyal person and hard worker with a drive for the best results. Over ten years of experience at a corporate AND cooperative organization.   \n\nMy qualities are analytical and conceptual thinking together with a strong sense for communication and stakeholdermanagement. I combine strategic thinking with a hands on mentality and I am able to switch between content, process and interpersonal communication at different levels in the organization. I use these qualities in my role as a business manager to senior management. I particularly enjoy being a sparring partner for senior management on strategic direction, change management, and team development and - dynamics. Furthermore, I coordinate diverse projects and initiatives that are part of the CCO's portfolio. It's my nature to share my view, ask critical questions and facilitate a structured way of working. I enjoy working in a dynamic environment with different kinds of tasks and challenges and to operate in a complex stakeholder field.  \n\n\nGraduated (Cum Laude) in the Master of Strategic Management and made learning part of everyday life. Now working on my Master degree in Corporate Communications at the Erasmus University.",
