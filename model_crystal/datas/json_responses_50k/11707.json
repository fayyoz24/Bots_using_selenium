    "summary": "I am a senior embedded system designer with an extensive background in embedded systems design technology and in embedded systems software engineering, in particular in the image and video processing domain.\n\nAs a designer I produce solid and sustainable results, by using structured design approaches, resulting in high quality, re-usable software. I am a so-called \u2018master of interfaces\u2019, as I bring the abstract design view and the practical implementation together, to bridge the gap between the architect and the engineers.\n\nAs a team player I bring professionals and their ideas together. I carefully investigate all options and suggestions, and perform an analysis myself. This objective approach results in a positive and constructive atmosphere in which good results are obtained, even in difficult circumstances.\n\nAs a senior engineer I guide my colleagues on quality and innovation. I do this by providing examples of good software engineering practices, for instance, on interface-based design and software re-use. This leads to significant improvements of productivity and efficiency.\n\nKeywords: object-oriented design, interface-based design, modeling, simulation, multi-processor programming, C++, C, Linux, Agile, Scrum, Git",
