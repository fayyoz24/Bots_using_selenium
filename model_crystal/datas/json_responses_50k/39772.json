The main focus in this project was aimed at paper, manufactured by family-companies from the village of Zaandijk [since 1974 part of the municipality of Zaanstad], particularly the companies of C & J HONIG (BREET), J HONIG & ZN, J HONIG & COMP,  J KOOL (& COMP) and VAN DER LEY.  It incorporates many examples of 18th and 19th watermarks and reemcaps (or paper covers with company logo's).  Several finds I have publiced in the Newsletter of the HONIG BREETHUIS. Apart from topics of paper historical interest, the collection also incorporates different topics of general local and regional historical interest of the Zaan region. The collection in now preserved in the Municipal Archives of Zaanstad.I also made an inventory of photo albums of the HONIG(H) family with many identified portrait photographs of members of families from the Zaan region.    \n",

My personal references were my puberty in Germany and my highschool years in Wassenaar near the remnants of the Atlantic Wall. During my Museology studies, an audiovisual based on this installation was produced, entitled \"Ein Heldenleben\". This was my first and last serious manifestation in the liberal arts. Although this installation and its offspring got some positive attention, I decided to change my career into that of a museologist, My experience in visual arts helped me in mounting and designing exhibitions. Still, the fine arts would remain my first love.      ",

For this exhibition a remodelled the existing showcases into post-modern shapes refering to the different styles in glass design, ranging from Art Nouveau and Jugendstil to Liberty Style and Art Deco. My sources of inspiration were architects from this epoque working in these various styles. The worst compliment I got from a visitor was that he liked the design of the show cases better than the beautiful glass objects inside them. This ofcause was not my aim...In general the visitors appreciated the matching showcases which helped them recognise the nuances in the various styles of glass design from floral to geometrical.",
