The system outputs a prediction of the future stock price as well as a prediction of the associated confidence level; this information is exploited by an automated trading strategy that maximizes daily returns.\n\nWe developed this system during the iNTUition 2017 Hackathon in Singapore, winning the award for Best Artificial Intelligence Hack.",

Results from several biomechanical simulations and experiments were used as a means of injury assessment, mapping every seat to a probability of survival. Validation of the model with data from several aircraft crashes showed promisingly low error rates. This suggests that the kinematic conditions that lead to more survivable crashes can be largely predicted and are worth investigating for the design of safer airports.",

I am currently working on deducing causality between different initial conditions and crossflow transition via a variable N factor method based on comprehensive boundary layer stability simulations. Calibration of transition N factors for different free-stream turbulence and roughness levels will provide a broad framework for crossflow transition prediction and enhance understanding of the transient growth pattern of different crossflow modes.\n",
