    "summary": "Customer defines a service well delivered.\n\nMy hands-on experience with customer support and a career within constantly changing international CRM environment reflect well my skills and adaptability. Contact Center indicators, business fundamental tables, forecasting, invoicing, live results monitoring, NPS are all very familiar to me.\n\nBeing closely familiar with the roles of Supply Chain and Repair Operations adds to my understanding of any element affecting customer experience, operational support or service/partner management.\n\nManaging Technical Engineering and Life Cycle teams, and leading these teams through a difficult outsourcing phase causing layoffs, has taught me also the hard part of people management.\n\nGraduations in finance/economics and programming/systems analysis give me a sharp eye in the numbers and a logical way of tackling any issues. Years of creative work with B2B presentations and advertising supports my creativity and fluency in communication with as well internal as external teams, colleagues and partners.\n\n\n",
