    "summary": "Marco Lankhorst (PhD). I'm a lawyer and an economist with extensive field experience in various African countries, including Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri), Mali, Namibia, Niger and Rwanda, where I have been active as a scholar, consultant, and development practitioner. Thematically, my work centers on strengthening the rule of law (access to justice and legal empowerment, criminal justice systems, customary justice systems), company-community conflicts (business and human rights) and the land governance (land registration and dispute management mechanisms). I specialize in developing both a macro (policy maker) and a micro (beneficiary) perspective on the problems I work on, and to find solutions that are practical and meaningful at both levels. I combine this with extensive experience in designing and implementing large scale and tailored projects and programs.",

Since 2007 a number of pilot projects have been started in Burundi to test various approaches to community-based land certification. These pilots leave a number of important issues unaddressed, including: (1) how registries can be kept up to date, (2) how to avoid erosion of women\u2019s interests in land, and (3) how to deal with tensions between ex-refugees and incumbents in the process of certification. This project, in which The Hague Institute acts as academic back-stopper and is responsible the impact study, is meant to answer these questions and prepare the ground for a national certification program.

After war or mass conflict, it is essential to quickly bring about stability. Most such efforts will center on strengthening capacities of government institutions at central level. But in many post conflict countries, particularly in rural areas, central government institutions remain distant and detached from the population. In such a situation, the state is to a large extent associated with and represented by local governments. Local governments are, thus, in a unique position to contribute to restoring the state\u2019s legitimacy and allowing peace to take root. The training program aims to enable participants to address the problems with good local governance and rule of law in fragile states. It deals with these problems in terms of three dimensions: reconstituting legitimacy, re-establishing security, and rebuilding effectiveness.",
