    "summary": "I was born and raised in Vietnam for 15 years before moving to the Netherlands for a new chapter of my life. By experiencing and interacting with different cultures, I have been granted with opportunities to observe and work in diverse groups, which has given me a better understanding that differences in cultures are an essential part in doing business nowadays. If I have a chance to describe myself, I would say I am a motivated, dedicated, hard-working and seeking challenges.\n\nI started with International Schakel Klas, where I mastered the Dutch language in 1 year and got accepted to MAVO 1 instead of basic thanks to my knowledge. Although it was only 3 months that I followed MAVO 1, I received a chance to move directly to the final year, where I successfully passed the final exam. But I keep pursuing my education career by became an MBO student and followed by HBO.\n\nCurrently, I am pursuing my pre-master degree in Data Science with a major in Data Science and Society. By involving in different school committee during my bachelor degree, it granted me the opportunity to be critical and innovative. With years of experiences as Crew Trainer/Shift Manager, I developed leadership skill, training/coaching and delegating.\n\nInternational Business for Asia offered me the opportunity to study and live in China for a half year and executing my internship in Vietnam. It has a significant contribution to the process of my personal developments, also career developments.\n\nMy capabilities: Content marketing, Marketing plan, Event Management, Importing and Exporting.",

I worked in a group with nine members named Trends4U Import. We imported an Asian product and launched to the Dutch market. Our group imported SQUEASY, it is durable plastic travel bottle, and the largest size is 89ml. Meaning, it helps traveller never cross the limit ml for the liquid product. We created a demonstration video for SQUEASY. In the end, we ended as the winner of the import project and earned the title ''Best enterprise of the year''. I acquired the award: Employee of the year.\n\nHalfway the project, it was mandatory to change positions within the enterprise, so you were able to develop your skills and knowledge on multiple aspects of entrepreneurship. I challenged myself for the marketing manager position from an all-round employee because I wanted to learn to control leading skill and give other opportunities.\n\nGroup grade: 7,3\nIndividual grade: 7,8",
