    "summary": "The skills I would underline to form a future professional life are communication, mentoring, analysis and coaching. Widespread knowledge in languages contribute to enrich these skills.\n\nStarting up as a communication leader, I had the possibility to lear basic communication manners in business, such as negotiation skills and promotion of a company. I continued my activities as the focal point of a newly set up daugther company, which led to the essential knowledge of a multinational environment. The complexity of this challenge allowed me to coordinate several fields of activities in the same time, providing a general overview about the basic procedures of a multinational. The main focus was commercial management and daily communication with customers. With evoving the company\u2019s size, I also got the chance to contribute to redistribution of the tasks on management level. And as necessary contribution of tutoring the newcomers, continuous coordination and mentoring followed the enlargement in the coming years.\n\nDue to changes in my location and professional career, I started widening my field of activities with learning psychology and practising art and dance therapy. Being a freelance interpreter at this period allowed me to harmonize the old and new fields of activities. After terminating the preparatory period on art and psychology, I turned back to the well known multinational area, and continued my secondary fields of activities in my free time. It is time now  that I turn my passion my goal in life and change the balance.",
