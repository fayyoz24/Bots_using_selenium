    "summary": "I am a graduated M.Sc. engineer from Delft University in The Netherlands. Between 1974 and 1983 I have been employed by a major dredging company in The Netherlands and have worked among others in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.\n\nIn 1983 I joined Tensar International and worked in various positions in sales and technology. My major tasks were to introduce the new technology of reinforcing soil with geogrids and to set up a sales organisation on the mainland of Europe. I ended my career as the global director responsible for the application technology of geogrids\n\nDuring the last 27 years I have developed and introduced geogrids, its applications, the calculation methods and the certification of these methods. I have been a member of several working committees in Europe and have therefore a fairly good idea of how the geosynthetic markets work in the different parts of Europe. Moreover, since the mid-nineties I have been an active member of WG 1 (TC 189) and the leader of the Dutch delegation since 2003. \n\nI retired from Tensar International in December 2010 and I have now set up my own independent consultancy, 7asconsult BV,  in The Netherlands.
