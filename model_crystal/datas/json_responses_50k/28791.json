    "summary": "Reliable and forward-thinking management professional with over 15 years of experience in hospitality, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and some of the best hotel companies in the world. Strongest skillset includes creating and developing kitchen efficiency techniques, team leadership, and menu development. Growing up in the Tuscan countryside, I've been exposed to heritage Italian cooking from a young age. At the same time, I've been highly curious about new, unique flavors and techniques from around the globe. By fostering creativity and innovation in my own work and in the kitchens I work, I wish to convey the role chefs can have as artists. Most recently, I've been focused on plant-based foods to contribute my part towards a better future.",
