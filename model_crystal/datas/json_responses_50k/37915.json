    "summary": "My Clifton Strengths are: Relator, Strategic, Discipline, Restorative, Achiever. \n\nI am passionate about change-making and empowerment through entrepreneurship, so I have worked with a non-profit focused on that area since 2019. As a Changemaker, I believe that people have the tools to intact positive change when their mindsets are changed from negative to positive ones. I have experience working with a diverse group of people and the communication skills needed to work productively in such an environment. \n\nAs a leader in the NGO and in many projects I have implemented, I also have leadership skills. I have completed several professional training on conflict management, professionalism in the workplace, and work ethics. \n\nI am also very interested in the international nature of healthcare and epidemiology. Besides school and work, I write poetry, articles, and opinion pieces, and you can check out some of my work here (https://www.prochangeinliberia.org/blog). ",
