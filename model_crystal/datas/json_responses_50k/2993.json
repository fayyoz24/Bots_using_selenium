    "summary": "I am an architect working at the intersection of human-centered design, collaborative work, and spatial experience for inclusive placemaking. I am interested in how contemporary culture and technologies are radically changing the way we understand and inhabit space. My approach to exploring private, public, and gathering spaces involves concept development, delivery of competition proposals, taking projects from early design stages to the production of tenders and visual narratives that communicate placemaking. Recently my installation Twitt-a-Gate won the design competition Icebreakers Toronto and was constructed at the Toronto Waterfront. \n\nI have more than ten years of experience in the field during which I collaborated with various architects, designers, and institutions. I have worked with Atelier Bow Wow (Tokyo), Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (Ivrea - Milan), Harry Gugger Studio (Basel), Institute of Contemporary Greek Art (Athens), X| Atelier (Los Angeles) and RMJM (Istanbul). My work has been presented in Toronto (8-11 Gallery), London (AA), Florence (Beyond Media Festival), Saskatoon (AKA Artist-Run), and Athens (Athens Biennale, New Benaki Museum, Art Athina, ONASSIS Cultural Centre).",

My responsibilities included liaising with technology experts and drafting presentations and drawings. I participated in identity design for the Institute.\n\nInteraction Design Institute Ivrea acts - through its Masters Programme and the innovation projects that are carried out independently or in partnership with Italian and international businesses - as a cultural centre for extending and disseminating interaction design knowledge and know-how. It aims to develop the culture of interaction design, which originally emerged in Silicon Valley, in a European context, building particularly on Italy's heritage and present strengths in design, innovation and lifestyle. In doing this, it will forge a distinctively Italian fusion of culture, technology, service models, and design for products and services.\n\nSelected Projects\n \u2022 Lighting Devices \u2022 2005 \u2022 Light Fixtures \u2022 with Artemide \u2022 Milan, Italy\n \u2022 Lampscape \u2022 2005 \u2022 Proposal for Light Fixtures \u2022 Iceland\n \u2022 Europan 8 \u2022 2005 \u2022 Bergamo Italy\n \u2022 Cinevolo \u2022 2005 \u2022 Interactive Installation \u2022 Beyond Media Festival \u2022 Florence, Italy\n \u2022 Pixel Materiali \u2022 2005 \u2022 Interactive Installation \u2022 Museo Degli Innocenti \u2022 Florence, Italy\n \u2022 Interactive Facade \u2022 2005 \u2022 Esselunga Supermarket Chain \u2022 Milan, Italy \n \u2022 Interactive Fitting Rooms \u2022 2005 \u2022 Accenture \u2022 Milan, Italy",
