    "summary": "I am a versatile business leader with a diverse background and a passion for innovation and growth. My unique blend of Brazilian and Japanese heritage has shaped my dynamic career journey. Holding three bachelor's degrees in Civil Engineering, Product Design, and Construction Management, I embrace a wide range of interests and a thirst for knowledge.\n\nIn 2014, I was honored to receive a full scholarship from the Brazilian government to study Engineering at Cornell University, an Ivy League institution in the United States. This experience ignited my passion for international endeavors and set the stage for an exciting and dynamic career path.\n\nOver the years, I've had the privilege of working in various countries: S\u00e3o Paulo, Seattle, Florian\u00f3polis, New York, London, and Amsterdam. Each experience enriched my ability to navigate complex organisations and excel at stakeholders management.\n\nIn Brazil, I played a pivotal role in launching Uber Eats,as the third employee. I built the business from the ground up and secured partnerships with some of the world's largest restaurant businesses, acquiring valuable skills in adaptability and versatility.\n\nIn the next chapter in London,as the Partnerships Manager in the UK and Ireland I had a remarkable achievement partnering with Subway, marking it as the fastest and largest strategic deal ever executed for the business - over 2000 stores activated in under 3 months. My relentless pursuit of growth led me to develop a new-business strategy for retail and convenience stores, involving prospecting, negotiation, and onboarding partners with a potential reach of 18,000 stores.\n\nDuring COVID-19, I was invited to expand this project to the EMEA region, where it evolved into its own standalone business unit, now known as New Verticals. In my role as the Key Account Manager for EMEA, I imparted expertise to country teams on launching and selling new businesses. I worked closely with General Managers on critical negotiations and owned relationships with global partners and restaurant operators.\n\nMost recently, I assumed a global role at Uber Eats as a Program Manager, ensuring that our sales teams worldwide have the resources and support needed to excel in their roles, contributing to the ongoing success and growth of the company.\n\nI am passionate about innovation, fostering partnerships, and achieving excellence in every endeavor. My journey has been marked by adaptability, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of growth. I am enthusiastic about continuing to contribute to transformative initiatives on a global scale.",
