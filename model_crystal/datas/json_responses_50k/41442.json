    "summary": "Educated as an Art Historian (MA: Latest Time, Modern and Contemporary Art), for which I specialised in photography and film. My main interests go out to modern and contemporary art, documentary and contemporary photography and film. Over the years and within these different fields, I gained experience in communications, marketing and PR, and developed a strong passion for writing and philosophizing about all things above.\n\nBeing deeply interested in the role art can play in society, I developed a strong focus on intermingling art and the praxis of life and addressing global issues through visual storytelling. From this need and special interest, I co-founded iMPACT DOC - an educational platform for documentary photography and film, and former physical exhibition space - together with my brother Steyn Hoogakker.",

After swift deliberation, we decided to embark on a mission to share a different story about Ghana; one of criticism, but also of hope and opportunity. \n\nSince the start of this project, we frequented Leiden University\u2019s African Studies Centre archives to research James Barnor\u2019s work for DRUM Magazine, met up again in Amsterdam, paid a visit to James in his London apartment to dig into his extensive personal archive of stories and photographs, spent time together in Accra, Ghana, and worked on scanning and captioning a large section of his negatives from Paris.\n\nTogether with important publications such as DRUM Magazine, James Barnor has documented many important historical and political events in Ghana, including its long struggle for independence and ideas relating to Pan Africanism, which still resonate today. Ghana was the first African country that gained independence in 1957, with Kwame Nkrumah \u2013 a strong supporter of Pan-Africanism \u2013 as the first president.\n\nWith this ongoing project, we are addressing important contemporary trends linked to engrained societal issues impacting people of African heritage, such as the Black Lives Matter movements and the concept of Afrofuturism. This project will serve to place these movements in the right historical and informed framework of Pan-Africanism and (de)colonisation, thereby drawing parallels between the past, present and the future. This approach intends to facilitate the development of a new narrative through which problems, solutions and experiences can be shared and discussed, in order to increase mutual understanding and create a new future perspective.",
