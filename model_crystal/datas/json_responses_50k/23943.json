    "summary": "I'm excited to announce my newly published book Translucence of Memory:  Soul Stories, Spiritual Wanderings, Time Travel.  Available at your nearest Amazon since March 2022.  This is a collection of poetry to bring more beauty, reflection and hope into our lives.  There is a power of memory in our personal stories - our soul stories. \n\nAbout my Clinical Nutrition and plant-based work:  My expertise is in the field of natural, plant-based supplements including eco-friendly wellness and beauty products.  I am a plant formulation expert.  I enjoy identifying pure botanicals and creating beautiful products for this emerging new world.  My strength is in formulation development for optimal absorption as well as innovative creative development approaches.  My training and experience includes immune support specifically in nutraceutical ingredients, plant-based ingredients as well as sourcing.  I really enjoy working with people, organizations and communities that identify with the authentic vision to heal our world.      I also work with individuals to teach ways to understand nutritional and plant-based benefits for optimal living.  ~ Ingar Brunnett, Clinical Nutritionist | Plant-based Formulator\n\nI am also the Founder of  Summer Life Naturals.  Here is more about my work as the formulator, creative director and manufacturer of non-gmo, plant-based immune supplements.  Which was manufactured in a NSF cGMP compliant facility in California.  \n\n\"My goal is to support immune health with the elements of our world's natural resources.  After years of challenging health concerns and food sensitivities - I have developed a plant-based formula that resonates with both sensitive individuals and other body types.  It has been a quest of mine to bring our customers herbal blends that work well without the harsh side effects.  \n \nMany of us have become more conscious to our nutritional choices, the toxins in our environment and even our lifestyles.  It's timely that we make the right decisions in what we choose to sustain ourselves with naturally.  I am dedicated in bringing formulations made with pure vibrant herbs, botanicals and whole foods that work in harmony with our bodies and nature.\" \n\nWorking with herbs is a sacred practice.  We can experience the positive effects as a collective as we aspire for more of a restorative well-being.  Our formulas have been created with authentic and inspired partnerships.  Our relationship with reputable suppliers, partners and customers are foremost.",

This is a collection of poems and stories about the transformative aspects and expressions of becoming.  They have been written as reflections of self-care, creating sacred space and journeying through these life phases.  Discover time-mastered stories that take a haunting glimpse into the emotional power of memory, self-love and metamorphosis of womanhood.  Enter the state of nurturing, sensuality, grief, family lineage, generational healing, renewal and spiritual wanderings to find yourself.  This is an intimate look at haunting generational narratives that release empowering archetypes of ourselves to help crystallize how we become.  This book is a healing testament for the inner child you hold dear to your heart as well as for the children you may know or other that have grown and have already become.  This is a newly published book that embodies a prophetic time capsule now awakening about the power of memory and storytelling.  \n\nAvailable in paperback and Kindle on Amazon",

Our intention is to bring more harmony into the world by formulating plant-based supplements that resonate with our bodies without the harsh side effects. \n\nIMMUNE IMPACT\u2122 is a new approach to existing herbal immune formulas on the market.  It's made with a synergistic blend of 7 harmonizing botanicals in a vegetarian capsule. The proprietary blend is formulated without the use of harsh herbs or ingredients like Echinacea, Goldenseal and magnesium stearate. This provides a unique and delicate ratio for optimal absorption. \n\nIMMUNE IMPACT\u2122 soothes and supports the immune system, mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract.\n\nWe are presently expanding our company and interested in collaborating with like-minded people.  We are open to possibilities to bring our formulations and lifestyle format to the natural products community.",
