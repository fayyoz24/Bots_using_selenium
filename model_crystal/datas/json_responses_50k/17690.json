    "summary": "Driven by positive change and a connector by nature.  Building bridges, - and finding gaps -between micro experiences and macro outcomes or policy, or between you and me. Learn and create is my motto. Long term thinking in a short term world is essential to me. Building sustainable linkages and equal bridges for all our children to the future while being creative and finding new solutions or ideas. Activist for justice, children\u2019s - and women's rights, and always keeping this mother earth in the back of my (holistic) mind. \n\nHow do we move forward together, how do we engage in conversations about it, and how do we better understand each other to create a world for all of us? Listen, ask, create and lead. I love to discuss the future of the world and technology, human rights, ethics, philosophy and engage in talks about the polarization- and technical pilarization. I love to create and energize in solutions while being pragmatic, strategic, idealistic and bold.\n\nThere are no days that I wouldn't listen to music and when there is no music playing, the rhythm is all around us. Besides, once in a while I love to create photo\u2019s and video\u2019s (concepts). \n\nMore than 2 million children worldwide are in a situation of sexual exploitation. Free a Girl rescues minor girls from sexual exploitation. We have rescued more than 7000 survivors worldwide to date. We help survivors to achieve justice by tracking down the perpetrators and tackling impunity. When they've had time to heal, Free a Girl empowers the girls to become awareness-raising Watch dogs and Change Agents in their communities. Our School for Justice program trains survivors to become the best lawyers, paralegals, police officers, social workers and journalists, alongside empowerment programs to change the system from within. \n\nUnlock freedom, become our partner.

We help survivors to achieve justice by tracking down the perpetrators and tackling impunity. When they've had time to heal, Free a Girl empowers the girls to become awareness-raising Watch dogs and Change Agents in their communities. Our School for Justice program trains survivors to become the best lawyers, paralegals, police officers, social workers and journalists, to together with us change the system from within and create awareness on national and international platforms. Currently we work in 10 countries around the globe.",
