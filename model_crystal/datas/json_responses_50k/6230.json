    "summary": "Personal and professional development have been the leading aspirations throughout my career thus far, I am a student of science who tends to consistently challenge myself learning new innovative ideas. I have done my bachelor degree in Dentistry from Kabul Medical University (KMU) and I have got my master's degree in healthcare policy innovation and management (HPIM) from Maastricht University of the Netherlands. \nI worked in the ministry of public health in Kabul Afghanistan as Consultant, account manager and researcher and I worked in the Netherlands in Winstar Tandverzorging B.V as marketing manager and business developer. As a passionate student of science I am very much interested in science, innovation and working in healthcare companies. I can speak in seven languages, Dari, Pashtu, Hindi, English, French, German and Dutch. I love playing football, listening to music and reading books.\n\nNow I got the Dutch passport and I am searching for jobs in healthcare, pharmaceutical, medical devices and biotech companies. I am willing to move abroad if I will get a good offer.",
