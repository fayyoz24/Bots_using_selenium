Even though I am Dutch, I grew up as an expat and thus have lived in various places. I have lived in Taiwan, Dubai, Nigeria, New Zealand and The Netherlands, where I attended three different American Schools during that time. I am currently seeking a job position within the Safety & Security industry.",
