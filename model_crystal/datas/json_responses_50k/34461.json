De Alliantie Kinderarmoede brengt organisaties uit alle hoeken van de samenleving bij elkaar om samen nieuwe, creatieve en slimme oplossingen te bedenken voor de aanpak van kinderarmoede.\n\nIn de eerste twee jaar is de Alliantie Kinderarmoede uitgegroeid tot een landelijk netwerk van meer dan 250 private en publieke partners die kennis delen en samenwerken om kinderarmoede te bestrijden en voorkomen. Met de Publieksacademies Kinderarmoede zijn we in het hele land geweest, via online kenniskringen hebben we kennis maandelijks bereikbaar gemaakt en er is een drieluik aan handreikingen ontwikkeld voor het sociaal domein, het onderwijs en de jeugdgezondheidszorg. Er zijn ook nieuwe privaat-publieke samenwerkingen gestart rond opgaven zoals 'een gezonde dag',  'financi\u00eble educatie' en 'de rol van de werkgever'.",

                    "description": "After my internship, Yulius hired me as Technical Education Assistant for two of their high schools, named VSO Drechtster College and VSO het Tij. In this position I carried out big projects, like:\n- reviewing and updating all the schools protocols (e.g. the \u2018suspension protocol\u2019, \u2018dyslexia: identification and provisions\u2019, \u2018protecting student data and privacy\u2019) in compliance with the national educational laws. Then, I translated the protocols into practical tasks and flowcharts, and presented modifications to the school team.\n- collecting and analyzing student data to identify student needs, to monitor student learning outcomes and to reveal strengths and weaknesses in teaching methods.\n- drafting student development reports for ongoing financial support from the government \n- and prepared the annual report for the school inspection visit by the Ministry of Education. \n \nMy final big project was the development of the school-wide curriculum for 'Orientation- and Career Guidance', to provide teachers with the resources to guide their students in their personal development and prepare them for their job or study plans after high school.",
