    "summary": "Over the years, I have formed a quite diverse profile. My professional course so far is mainly consolidated in entrepreneurship. I understand deeply the challenges an organisation faces trying to innovate in the current business arena, the agility and creativity required in every step taken. Relationships and synergies are of the highest importance when opting to innovate and network development is placed in the spotlight. I have a long and solid experience in project management in a wide range of projects. I have worked in teams that vary from multicultural and multinational, via my studies in Zurich and Istanbul, to diverse levels of educational and professional backgrounds. I have worked a project in all its phases, as a member, a project manager and a general manager.\n\n  I am looking for a professional set up that is contemporary and relevant. One with a strong business orientation but also creativity, innovation and vision. One to utilise my existing and challenge a new skillset. I am sharp, extremely focused when passionate, with a solid background in business strategy and team coordination. I consider my communication and presentation skills to be my strongest asset.",
