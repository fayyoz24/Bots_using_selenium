The society\u2019s views on energy supply shifted towards more sustainable and renewable energy resources. And that is the reason why public opposition is identified as a key problem by project developers. According to the European Commission Report on \u2018\u2019Permitting procedures for energy infrastructure projects in the EU: evaluation and legal recommendations\u2019\u2019 (2011), one of the main reasons for [project] delays is \u2018\u2019lack of acceptance of energy infrastructure projects by stakeholders\u2019\u2019 (p.13). The gas transportation company Gasunie aims at developing an applied research project on Public Affairs in Strategic Environmental Planning - a strategy for common interest business operations. Its objective is to address, to understand and to adequately and quickly respond to (possible) social concerns when implementing a programme or project. The research team will present recommendations to Gasunie on how to integrate environmental considerations into its programmes and evaluate the inter linkages with economic and social considerations by applying analytical and participatory approaches with the society. In this way, the company may foresee some major disagreements and social riots; and better prepare on how to deal with such. The recommendations will help the organisation to communicate more effectively with its stakeholders regarding important issues and to better inform them about its functions.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nN.V. Nederlandse Gasunie is one of the largest gas infrastructure companies in Western Europe. With its headquarters situated in the city of Groningen, with approximately 1,500 employees, Gasunie is the main government-owned gas supplier in the Netherlands and Northern Europe.\n",
