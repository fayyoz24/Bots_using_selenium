    "summary": "Work experience: I am a software design engineer at ASML since October 2012. Prior to that, as part of my post-master program from 2010 to 2012 I worked on five software projects from five different companies. These companies include Philips Healthcare and Oce in the Netherlands, VITO in Belgium, and Compumatica in Germany. I have wide experience and education in embedded, control, and application software design and development. I have advanced programming skills in C, C++, C#, Java, and Python. In addition, I have experience with model driven software development. I have worked with embedded real-time operating systems such as VxWorks and uC/OS-II. I have wide experience with different flavors of the Linux operating system as well as the Windows operating systems. Due to my educational background in both electronics and software engineering, I can comfortably work at different levels of the software stack to the lowest implementation details. In addition to technical skills, I have professional training in teamwork, technical writing and editing in English, as well as working in multicultural and multidisciplinary environments.\n\nEducation: I studied Embedded Systems Master\u2019s program at Eindhoven University of Technology from 2008 to 2010. From 2010 to 2012, I did my Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) post-master program in Advanced Software Engineering (OOTI) in Eindhoven University of Technology. I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering for my Bachelor degree from 2003 to 2007.",
