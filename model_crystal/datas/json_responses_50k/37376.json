    "summary": "I hold a BSc. Degree of Science in Rural Development & Innovation and work since 2008 in the cocoa sector of Ghana. I worked in different positions throughout the cocoa value chain.\n\nI started my cocoa career at a known cocoa farmers\u2019 association where I headed the certification department, which under my leadership became the first UTZ Certified and Rainforest Alliance certified farmer group in West Africa. I also initiated and took part in different committees for the acceptance of voluntary certification schemes in Ghana and improvement of the certification standards.\n\nLater I established a Licensed Buying Company focusing on improved buying practices for the purchase of more than 18,000MT of certified cocoa beans from several farmer groups. \n\nFurther I led the establishment of a rural labor agency which managed the farms of 100s of smallholder farmers with employment of over 1,400 laborers and explored the business opportunity to establish a sustainable coffee supply chain in Ghana. Together with the government of Ghana and cocoa traders and processors from Japan we also undertook a feasibility study to establish a state of the art laboratory to undertake MRL testing at our storage facility in Tema. \n\nCurrently, I am the Sustainability Manager at a large Farmer Association where we design and implement different programs to improve the livelihoods of the smallholder cocoa farmers, their families and the environment. Some programs are: Child Labor Monitoring & Remediation System, (syntropic) Agroforestry, Farmer Business School, Living Income Studies and Village Savings and Loans Associations. We work together in different consortiums with different chocolate manufacturers processors, traders, retailers, NGOs and governmental organizations.",
