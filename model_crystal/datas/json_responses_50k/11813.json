Project involved introducing an evaporative-cooling unit, allowing refrigeration by consuming water instead of electricity.\n\nPart 2 in Matunda, near Kitale at the Loreto Convent girls boarding High School. Project included a case study on how to improve the schools resource management. The scope of the project covered waste conversion to bio-gas, greenhouse and administration improvement at the school farm, rainwater harvesting and possibilities for renewable energy.\n\nThe intercultural Internship was a great personal development. Working in a country with such a different culture in an environment I am not accustomed to was an interesting challenge. I have also developed my entrepreneurial skills together with my intercultural communication skills. The stay in Kenya has sparked an interest for complex development problems.\n\n",

We received mentorship and intensive business courses on entrepreneurship from local experts. The results of the projects were pitched on two occasions. Once for a grand jury of CEO\u2019s from sponsors and partners and a second time for the Dutch PM and his trade delegates.
