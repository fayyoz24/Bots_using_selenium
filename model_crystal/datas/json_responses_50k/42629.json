    "summary": "INVENTION + ADVENTURE = INVENTURE \n\nI cultivate systems and communication pathways for industry, educators and individuals to explore, simulate and realize new relationships between humans and machines. \n\nThe challenge and reward of leading international cross-disciplinary teams to uncover, process and claim uncharted territory is why I work in emerging technology. \n\nBy adapting and connecting to the familiar and foreign we generate a deeper understanding of ourselves, our connection to humankind and the relationship we have with the planet.  \n\nAs the founder Mission Control Lab, I use the concept of \"Inventure\" as a platform to organize the practice of translating ideas, thoughtfully applying creativity, and growing competitive advantage during change. \nhttp://missioncontrollab.com \n\nMakeON\u00ae is hardtech that universally adapts/connects the global electronic ecosystem for creating flexible cyber embedded physical systems out of almost anything, no code - code - cloud.  \nhttps://www.makeon.xyz\n\nInventure\u2122 is a methodology and social platform for cultivating \u201cfuture fitness\u201d through storytelling. From I to AI, individuals, educators and industries connect through local and interplanetary mega trends.  \nhttp://inventure.app\n\nI work with initiatives that embrace diversity, expression, empathy, sustainability, conscious decision making and community. \n\nhttps://www.jessicacobb.com/",
