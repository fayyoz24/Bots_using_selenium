    "summary": "Filmhuis Den Haag\nCurating and Connecting are two important vocal points of FHDH.\nWe curate a diverse portofolio of world cinema, with an emphasis on European cinema and a balanced and consistent programming of popular art house titles and more vulnerable films who need more attention in keeping them visible and therefore important.\nCuratorship is also making choices in programs related to filmhistory: from the forgotten films of Valerio Zurlini to the social realist films of Ken Loach.\n\nConnecting is what we do in collaborating with other cultural institutions in town and different communities\nWe Connect with the profile of The Hague as city of peace and justice and collaborate with human rights organisations, European commissions and embassies.\nAnd different communities in The Hague can Connect with us like students, surfers, hip hoppers, immigrants, minority groups, expats, you name it. They all come with their own wishes and, in some cases, are very eager to provide us with guest programming. This way we try to host and celebrate the cultural diversity of the population of The Hague.\nIn 2015 FHDH received the Europa Cinemas Award for 'best programming'.\n\n",
