    "summary": "I am a finishing Ph.D. Researcher from Tilburg Law School in the Netherlands, specialized in the area of International Business Law, Chinese law, IT Contract law and Biotechnology Law. I am looking for a position in an international law firm or company in the relevant areas.\n\nI received my bachelor's degree in Biology Science and master's degree in Private International Law. I am a native Chinese speaker and am fluent in oral and written English. Currently I am writing my doctoral thesis on the EU Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms, which combines the knowledge of law and biology. The inter-disciplinary academic training has moulded outstanding fast-learning and analytical skills. I also have a good command of Chinese law and passed the Chinese Bar Exam in 2011. \n\nAfter receiving my master\u2019s degree I worked as a legal researcher and lecturer in the area of Private International Law and Arbitration Law, two years in China and one year in Canada. For six months in 2010 I practiced in the Canadian law firm Fasken Martineau on international contract law, where I received comprehensive training on the draft and negotiation of commercial agreements. For another six months in 2011 I worked as a legal counsel for the Wuhan Municipal Government, where I provided legal advices to foreign companies concerning business/contract strategy, China\u2019s foreign investment law, arbitration law, choice-of-law issues, etc.\n\nMy work experience as lawyer and legal counsel has cultivated excellent communication skills. The fast-paced work environment in practical sectors has forged a flexible and hard-working attitude, as well as outstanding time management ability. I am very passionate about working and usually go great length to get the job completed. In my spare time I am a very active social activity organizer, devoting in the organization of many social events such as TLS football tournament, cycling and hiking trips for expats in the Eindhoven area, etc.\n\n",
