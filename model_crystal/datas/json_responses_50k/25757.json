My task was to formulate and develop an Internal Monitoring System (IMS) Manual to serve as a guideline for the women working with WEAVE at one of the refugee camps in the border between Thailand and Myanmar. This manual has as objective to make sure the alignment of WEAVE's economic empowerment through the support of artisan refugee women in their traditional skills of weaving, embroidery, and sewing, with the Ten Fair Trade principles. My other main task during the internship was to give trainings in the refugee camp in two main areas. The first was to assist a Monitoring Workshop based on the previously mentioned manual. The second was to give a two week training on Women Issues and Development (Feminist Perspective) to young women following the Women Study Program (WSP) in the camp. Finally I developed a Social Media Plan for the organisation to open an Instagram account.",
