During the secondment, I expanded my knowledge of the integration of the North Sea energy system and identified necessary changes and adaptations in EU and national legislation to facilitate such integration. My assignment at TenneT was to examine from a legal perspective how to use the offshore grid connection system more efficiently by developing multi-purpose interconnectors. Furthermore, I assessed the development of a legal framework for the offshore grid connection of consumers, e.g. power-to-gas and storage installations.",
