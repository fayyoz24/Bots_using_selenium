    "summary": "Hi, I'm Anja, \n\nAlthough I found a part-time job at C&A which I very much look forward to, I am still in for another challenge in project management, sales support or customer service, preferably in a dynamic international B2B environment in which I worked for over 23 years; that's what I am longing for to be part of again. \n\nI love to organize and improve work processes, solve problems, plan and follow-up, have a high level of customer service, always fully committed and enthousiastic and willing to walk the extra mile to catch a deadline or wrap things up.\n\nVery much looking forward to meet with a great employer and nice colleagues whom enjoy what they are doing. So who's going to catch me and make 2022 become a nice and sparkling, productive and value adding year.",
