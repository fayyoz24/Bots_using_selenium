    "summary": "I do marketing, brand and business strategy for expat language schools so that they can scale their business and deliver their best services with ease.\n\nHow did I get here? For over 10 years I was working as a consultant for NGOs and social enterprises. I was getting assignments mainly for the European Union, different Polish ministries, city halls and governmental units.\n\nIn 2017 I have decided to leave everything behind and move to France, from where I jumped to the Netherlands and here to stay (Rotterdam! \ud83e\udd70).  Before that I lived in Poland (clearly), Romania and Ireland.\n\nDuring my years abroad I have noticed how big of a difference learning the local language makes. And how important it is to find a good school - one that will not only teach the language, but also take me through the difficult experience of assimilating into a new culture.\n\nToday I help the language schools for expats to create that special, next level experience. All while ensuring the biggest growth they\u2019ve ever experienced.",
