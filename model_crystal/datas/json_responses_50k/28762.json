Working closely with the Sales/Product Manager at the the Chem Co.,I inquired inventories,product specifics, pricing, degree of international cooperation etc. from individual companies. I also arranged sample deliveries, connected the U.S. side with the managers from Chinese companies, and visited sites of manufacturers on behalf of the ChemCo..By the end of the 8-wk project, I have developed a number of eligible (meaning quality + good price) supply chains in China for each major product required by the company.",

Ivy Insiders is a popular SAT training program that typically hires current students in mostly Ivy League schools to independently market, sell and teach SAT training packages to students at local high schools.  It was no small task to make this successful American business model to adapt to China, yet I led my team and managed to make IvyInsiders gain influence and profit for the first time in China. \n\n     In order to make an impressive first appearance of IvyInsiders in China (where most of the market had already been drawn to a major Chinese agency), I recruited business partners who were also college students from top 20 in the U.S to join our team. As the leader I designed bilingual flyers, pamphlets containing the lecturers' bios and other promotional materials, tailored to the taste and understanding of our target in China. I also held mock exams, free tutor sessions that offered potential market face-to-face experience. Besides that, we recruited high school campus leaders to promote our brand right on campus.  Our extensive and aggressive marketing proved its effectivity within 4 weeks, when we officially started making profit with group training packages.  Since then our newly-launched branch has been such a success and hot topic that the local education TV network interviewed us as \u201cyoung entrepreneurs in education and new business\u201d.",
