    "summary": "For two decades, I worked as an executive Fashion, Accessories and Fine Jewelry Editor and Consultant. I have over 20 years of editorial experience at publications such as WWD, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W Magazine where I served most recently as Accessories and Fine Jewelry director. I have consulted for top jewelry and watch brands on a range of projects including creative direction, product development, art direction, branding and brand narrative. And, I was a founding member of two fine jewelry online businesses, Stone & Strand and Flont.  I'm a big picture thinker, I work creatively and strategically to achieve quick results and resourceful solutions for each project. I'm an effective manager and am accustomed to working in a fast-paced, deadline-intensive, collaborative environment.\n\nI'm currently focusing on my new business, Tend, a holistic wellness practice based both online and in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I'm a certified Integrative Health Coach, Fitness Trainer, Heart Math heart/brain coherence practitioner, and Yoga Nidra instructor. I believe a more holistic approach to healthcare and lifestyle is crucial as we cope with unprecedented levels of stress and chronic disease in today's society. I work with women to get fit, eat clean and reduce stress. I'm passionate about empowering my clients to cultivate more self-awareness and to live healthy, mindful and balanced lives.",
