    "summary": "I am a pragmatic software engineer. I am passionate about creating quality software that brings value and helps businesses achieve their goals.\n\nI am equally comfortable talking to customers, making technical decisions, and leading & mentoring software engineers.\n\nI strongly believe that the key to a successful product organisation is through empowered teams. I establish psychological safety within my teams, where people can voice and pursue their ideas, have a margin to fail and learn from their mistakes. I believe in describing goals rather than telling what to do. I lead by example and celebrate as a team.\n\nI am a master generalist, excited by the fine balance between hard and soft skills.",
