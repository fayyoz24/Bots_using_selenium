Following two years as a Customer Service Representative, I assumed administrative and training responsibilities as a senior agent, and as a Team Leader for my last 18 months with the company. I also worked on rotation as an Overnight Lone Worker Agent, with CallPageboy providing services 24/7/365. \n\nCallPageboy is highly dynamic in the services it provides to its customers and requires considerable levels of adaptability and consistency in its employees. I discovered and learned an expansive set of both technical and soft skills in multiple diverse roles and domains. As a Team Leader, I learned how to most effectively tackle problems through efficient collaboration with my coworkers. My responsibilities as an Overnight agent taught me to independently make key decisions under pressure, while administrative positions granted me experience in organization and practical tools including SQL and Excel.  \n\nThe tasks I most appreciated during my time in the call centre was that of KPI analysis using call centre statistics. It is the responsibility of Team Leaders in the call centre to both analyze both individual agent performance and overall floor performance, which could be broken down into office hours and after hours categories. I ran monthly statistical reports relating to these areas to track agent progress, the effectiveness of service procedures, and the efficiency of the services that we provided. Findings were then presented to the management team, where I gained valuable presentation skills. For me, this was the most satisfying of my responsibilities, where I could personally realize data-driven solutions to improve the quality of both the services provided by CallPageboy, and the working environment for my co-workers and myself.",
