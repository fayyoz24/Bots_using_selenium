    "summary": "I'm a seasoned journalist with over 9 years of experience, specializing in the writing on the intersection of development, environment, sustainability, and the ever-evolving politics of climate change.\n\nMy professional journey as a journalist started from business newspapers. Subsequently, I ventured into diverse territories. From webzines to magazines and back to the digital realm, I honed my skills, with hard news as the heart of my profile. This diverse background has equipped me with a deep understanding of the intricacies of journalism across different platforms.\n\nIn December 2017, I was inspired by the innovative Swedish movement called Plogging, sparking the birth of my own environmental initiative, Plogga India. Rooted in Delhi (but not limited to) this initiative encourages people to jog with purpose, making a tangible impact against plastic pollution while fostering personal well-being. Plogga India is not merely about cleaning up public spaces; it's about raising awareness of waste's entire lifecycle, from production to disposal. My vision is to instill a mindset of resource efficiency, question rampant consumption, and drive communities towards more sustainable futures. Moreover, we're on a quest to uncover how cities, as hubs of materialism, can slowly but intentionally embrace the principles of the Circular Economy.\n\nAs a Master's student of Development Studies at the prestigious International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), The Hague (of Erasmus University Rotterdam), my thesis delved into the realm of grassroots innovations and their connection to place attachment. My research focused on Groene Mient, an inspiring social-ecological intentional collective housing project in The Hague, Netherlands. This exploration shed light on the importance of place attachment in driving grassroots innovations like Groene Mient, with implications for sustainable urban transitions and renewable energy initiatives at the neighborhood level.\n\nIn my quest to make a meaningful change, I am actively seeking positions in the Netherlands and the European Union (EU) that align with my expertise and aspirations. Specifically, I am passionate about contributing to policy setting, analysis, and evaluation in areas related to development, environment, and sustainability.",
