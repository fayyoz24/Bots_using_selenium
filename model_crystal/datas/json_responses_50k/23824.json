    "summary": "I\u2019m currently working at the ABN AMRO as a call centre agent. I receive calls from people who have had a revolving credit, who may have paid too much interest in recent years. This job teaches me how to speak professionally to people, to use and switch between different systems, and how to handle and stay calm in different situations.\n\nNext to this I just graduated from the study International Business at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen, The Netherlands. The study International Business taught me the ins and outs of the international business world with subjects like: Marketing, People Management, Accounting, intercultural competences, consumer behaviour and so on. One of the things I learned is how to work with people from different backgrounds, nationalities and mindsets. This is also the reason why I am so interested in Marketing and Human Resource Management because the focus of these subjects is also heavily on people.\n\nBecause of this study I didn\u2019t only gain knowledge but also experiences, because we had a lot of projects. A few of the projects I had are the business plan project where we had to write a business plan for a made-up company and the international marketing project for which we had to write a marketing plan on how we would market chocolate in Australia. Also, my graduation project was a real live project in which I did a market research for the company Drenthe Tours for a new bus service. \n\nNext to the things I learn at the University they also offer the chance to go abroad. Because of this I studied Marketing for half a year at Letterkenny Institute of Technology in Ireland, I did a marketing internship in Nusa Putra College of Technology in Sukabumi, Indonesia and I went to a Summer school in Incheon, South Korea to study MICE. \n \nAs I mentioned before I\u2019m looking to take the next step in my career. If you now about or offer a position in either Marketing or Human Resource Management which would fit me, please let me know! I'm very interested. You can contact me here or per email, which is:  celinebartelds@gmail.com",
