The fieldwork consisted of interviews and surveys with stakeholders from the tourism industry, the national government and local NGOs, as well as observations of the dive and snorkel excursions. The objective of my research was to define the feasibility of a marketable, voluntary standard for safe and sustainable marine (whale shark) tourism in the area.",

During the 2-year intensive programme I have the chance to work at four different departments within the government in various positions. \n\nIn September 2017 I started my traineeship as a policy officer at the Energy Department (Programmadirectie Energie-uitdagingen 2020). This department was charged with the implementation of the Dutch Agreement on Energy for Sustainable Growth (Energieakkoord) and meeting the national energy reduction and renewable energy targets for 2020. Specifically, I worked on the implementation and enforcement of energy efficiency targets for the Dutch industry and the reforms of net metering (salderingsregeling). \n\nDuring my second assignment (March - August 2018) I worked as a Private Sector Development (PSD) Coach for West-Africa at the Netherlands Entreprise Agency (RVO.nl). PSD Apps provides a toolbox for Dutch embassies that assists them with activities promoting the creation of a business-enabling environment and the removal of trade barriers in developing countries. As such, PSD Apps help to shape the local implementation of the Dutch agenda for aid, trade and investment. \n\nDuring my third assignment I worked as a policy officer at the Dutch Permanent Representation to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the IEA (International Energy Agency) in Paris. Here I mainly act as a knowledge-broker, facilitating and promoting the exchange of knowledge between Dutch ministries and the OECD on the topics of energy, climate change and agriculture. \n\nIn addition to all this, I joined the trainee think tank in an effort to contribute to a more sustainable and diverse workplace. Together with some equally passionated colleagues I organize campaigns and events to raise awareness about topics such as recycling, gender equality and inclusion.",

After gathering this factual information, I translated the academic knowledge into understandable information and practical solutions for individuals, contributing to blog posts and an informative book, which were targeted at creating awareness and changes in consumer behaviour.\n\u2022\nThink Big Act Now is a research project that focuses on the causes and consequences of climate change on the level of the consumer, specifically the impact of embodied energy in food, infrastructure, and consumer products. One of the outcomes of the project is an informative book that explains the embodied/hidden energy in products and services and that gives tips on how consumers can contribute effectively to a more sustainable world (for more information, see link below).",
