    "summary": "Currently a PhD candidate in CAS group, EEMCS department, TU Delft. Working on topics related to machine learning, localization and navigation and control systems.\n\nPrior to starting my PhD, I have been working for 3 years as an 'Associate Research Engineer' at Flanders Make vzw in Belgium. Projects I have worked on include machine learning for object identification, control algorithms for autonomous vehicles and drones,  and other model-based control algorithms. \n\nI completed my graduate studies in Dynamics and Controls group (in a multidisciplinary program) at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I have background in vehicle dynamics and control systems. My graduation thesis at DAF Trucks N.V. and TNO (Helmond, the Netherlands) was on 'Automated Highway Platooning'. I have also worked on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) as a part of my internship at DAF Trucks N.V.. \n\nPrior to my masters, I also have 2 years of work experience in Research and Development (Engineering Research Center) of TATA Motors Ltd, India, where I enhanced my technical and managerial skills. My work included product development of a utility vehicle; and design and optimization of vehicle suspension system to achieve kinematic and transient vehicle performance characteristics.. My job profile also included supplier interaction and requirement elicitation. \n\nI have experience working in multidisciplinary and multicultural teams with a propensity to lead. I have participated in multiple challenging projects that can be referred to on my profile. I am a research oriented person, who is passionate about innovative technologies with a willingness to explore other relevant fields. I am also an enthusiast of autonomous systems (self driving cars, drones, etc.) and like to know about all related aspects of such systems.",

Universities from all over the word compete in this competition to showcase their engineering capabilities. It is run by Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 2010, Thapar University participated in the competition where the team constituted entirely of undergraduate students. My responsibilities in the team included:\n1.\tDesign of suspension static and transient behaviour.\n2.\tIntegration of the suspension system into vehicle chassis.\n3.\tIn-house manufacturing of components for the vehicle.\n\nThe suspension design for the vehicle used  in earlier competitions was taken as the basis. For suspension analysis, WinGeo 3 by Mitchell Software was used. The analysis mostly included kinematic parameters such as instantaneous roll center migration, scrub radius, bump steer, camber, etc. to finalize suspension hard-points. For optimization of vertical force on tires, a quarter car model was used to design spring and damper rates. On the manufacturing side, I was responsible for grinding operation and bleeding of brake system to remove any air bubbles from the system. The team was successfully able to compete in the competition. It was the highest placed Indian team finishing at 3rd in the cost category. Overall, the team showed considerable improvement over past years.\n",

It has a negative impact on the safety and efficiency of the existing road networks. Hence, there has been an increasing demand for intelligent vehicles, equipped with technology which improve the overall quality and safety of our daily commutes. For highways, automated vehicle platooning is gaining popularity, especially in the commercial segment, due to the many benefits that can be drawn from it. In this setup, a group of vehicle drive behind each other with small inter\u2013vehicular distances, using automated acceleration and steering control. This arrangement, due to low aerodynamic drag, results in higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions. This is especially true for truck platooning, which is the focus of this thesis. For ensuring the safety and stability of such platooning systems, significant research work has been carried out, focusing mostly on longitudinal automation of vehicles. The stability of such systems is captured in the notion of string stability, largely defined in the context of longitudinal control of platoons. The research carried out in this thesis focuses on steering automation of vehicles, particularly rigid trucks, for vehicle platooning on highways. The notion of string stability is extended to the lateral control of vehicles in a platoon. Main tasks included:\n1. Extending the concept of string stability for lateral control of vehicles in a platoon on highways.\n2. Design of string stable automated steering controller for automated truck platooning on highways. \nSuccessful completion of the project led to completion of graduation.\n\nTools Used: Matlab/Simulink, Mathematica, d-Space.",

This has seen DAF Trucks, in their dedication to provide their customers a safer and more efficient experience, invest in new ADAS functions. In spite of many benefits of ADAS systems, testing remains an expensive endeavor. Hence, it makes sense to seek virtual testing methods and tools. This not only decreases the lead time in the development of a product but also saves on costs incurred in their development. The first half of my graduate internship can be summarized as:\n1. Testing of developed ADAS functions using a virtual testing environment, PreScan, developed by TASS International. \n2. Simulation of requisite sensor technology in PreScan and verifying the data.\n3. Determination of advantages and disadvantages of using PreScan for DAF Trucks.\n\nThe second part of the internship is related to automated highway platooning in heavy vehicles. In an automated vehicle platoon, vehicles drive behind one another maintaining short inter-vehicular distances, while following the preceding vehicle using on-board sensors and wireless communication. Apart from the leading vehicle, all vehicles are driven using automated vehicle steering controllers and fitted with sensors and wireless communication capability with other vehicles. My tasks can be summarized as:\n1.  Develop various vehicle following controller designs for the automated platoon.\n 2. Investigate the stability of the platoon under the notion of string stability. For a platoon to be string stable, the following vehicles are required to track the motion of the preceding vehicles while attenuating disturbances.\n3. Comment on sensor requirements and information exchange over wireless networks for achieving desired stability and performance requirements.\n\nTools Used: PreScan, Matlab/Simulink.",

                    "description": "Tata Motors is a prestigious OEM in India and is responsible for a major portion of domestic sale of vehicles as well as exports. I was recruited as an Assistant Manager by TATA Motors Ltd. for the Engineering Research Center in India, where I worked on the suspension analysis of utility vehicle for about 2 years. The responsibility of my group, consisting of 3 people, was the effective deliver of project deadlines for suspension design (components) and performance as per given targets. My main tasks included: \n1.\tProject management to ensure timely delivery of set milestones.\n2.\tMulti-body dynamic (MBD) analysis of vehicle dynamics, static as well as transient characteristics, to satisfy given target performance.\n3.\tInteraction with component suppliers for required component design, especially for tires.\n4.\tMaintenance of CAD design of suspension system on CAD software, Pro-E, especially for layout and packaging.\n\nBased on the packaging space available for suspension components and design guidelines laid down by earlier projects, an initial estimate of suspension hard-points was taken. Then, a preliminary analysis on ADAMS Car, based on a simplified model of the vehicle, was run and compared with target values. For transient performance under specific conditions, a virtual testing software, CarSim was used. Then, the model was sent for CAD design, and subsequently, sent for structural analysis to test for structural loads. This entire process was my responsibility. After some iterations, final design was obtained which was sent forward for simulation using more complex models and specified load conditions. Additionally, I was in regular conversation with suppliers to communicate the product requirements for prototype building.\n\nTools Used: ADAMS Car, CarSim, Wildfire Pro-E,  Creo, TeamViewer, PLC Seimens, Microsoft Office.",
