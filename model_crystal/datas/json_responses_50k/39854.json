In order to not only revise the methodology of Argentinian tango as practice, I will explore its application to develop 'tango as a contemporary art form'. I will also show the influence of the cultural interaction with the Argentinian dance community.",

Its  setting and location is a Tango salon as site\nThe piece posits to the viewer an insisting question about what is original and what is an imitation or ultimately a plagiarism. What is live and what is recorded? What is the creative and what is gambled, distorted or taken from the creative? The theme of D\u00edptico inquiries, at the same time, how dancers' bodies are being used and exploited by the performing art industry and its environmental hits.\nDramaturgy- choreography Gabriela Zuarez, Visual design/ Costumes/ Light Micaela Tettamanti (Argentine) Music by A.

The big motive of this production is the identity and vulnerability of the dancer\u2019s body.  SUCCESS is being staged by three performers, three \u2018Tangueros\u2019, who are longing for recognition, acceptance and success within a social environment.\nIn a humoristic way, the dramaturge poses the question if what we see is the original, true form or just a mere representation.  She also emphasizes the exploitation of the artist\u2019s body in our actual society. SUCCESS is a dynamic and tragicomic theatre- dance production in a new dramaturgy that intertwines the language of modern dance with Tango that\u2019s being reinforced by cultural criticism.\n\nConcept/ dramaturgy Gabriela Zuarez Choreography Gabriela Zuarez Light design Micaela Tettamanti; Musical arrangement and sound Lucas Malec; Photography Eric van Voorden; Graphic Design T.Coggiola Packbureau Buenos Aires; Communication Marianne Ten Hoedt; Production Danzalterna. With thanks to Job Gerlings and Roshan Warjawand.\nSUCCESS has been developed  during the  workshop-production \u2018Body, Dance & Performance\u2019 of the Danzalterna Dance Centre- in collaboration with the theater Ostade A\u2019dam in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",
