I focus on delivering key outcomes, efficiently collaborating with teammates and other teams and quickly adapting to new learnings. \u2028\u2028Being born in an entrepreneurs family, I started my journey in marketing when I was 14 years old.

For the shopping bags we specially invited graduating graphical designer Kevin Rooi. The customer could put up requests with Kevin, and Kevin would translate the request to a design on the bag. In just four hours we sold 18 t-shirts, 26 stickers, and 13 bags. In my opinion, this was a great result and I am proud of my team for achieving this. \nThroughout this project, I felt that especially my communicational skills were challenged, but I also feel like I improved them very much. I guess we learn best through trial and error.",

Experience the culture and traditions that surround the brew that Germans consider as a national treasure. \nWithin this report, we will try to answer our key question \u201cIn which way is it going to be most beneficial to invest in the German beer market?\u201d and sub-questions: \n- Is there a niche in the German beer market which is not saturated?\n- On which target group should we focus on? \n\nTo be able to answer these questions, we analysed the external environment of the beer market, which consists of the macro- and the meso-environment and launched an online survey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFirst of all, we based our macro-analysis on the DESTEP aspects. This aspects examines demographic, economic, social-cultural, technological, environmental, political influences on our business.\n\t\nSecondly, the Meso environment consists of those factors a business can exert only a small influence on. It also comprises all those organisations or groups a firm will be affected by and have relationships with. Moreover, from the meso-environment, come opportunities and threats. To analyse the meso-environment, the beer market has to be examined by taking a close look at the market type with the entry barriers, the estimated market and its estimated growth. Furthermore, the product\u2019s nature, the demand features, the suppliers and the main players with their strengths and weaknesses.\n\t\nTo collect primary data, we released an online survey. This was considered as the best way of getting direct feedback from clearly defined target groups and it allows us to ask precise questions to a very specific group of people. This type of research helps to develop new marketing and customer profiling/ engagement strategies, identify our target group. ",

            "description": "Surprisingly, there are currently no sophisticated playlists with Ukrainian music on any music streaming platform. As the total number of music streaming subscribers reached 400 million in 2020, these are the leading platforms for music promotion and performers. Therefore, our project is focused on solving this problem: the creation of exclusively Ukrainian playlists.\n\nWe are a team of volunteers who have the necessary skills to promote Ukrainian music by creating well-composed, sophisticated playlists. I'm a team lead in this project and responsible for all the documentation, organisation. I'm also taking care of promoting our project and playlists by sharing it to relevant social channels and groups and applying for grants.\n\nhttps://www.ukrainians.nl/language/en/"
