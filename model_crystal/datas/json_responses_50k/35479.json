This is accompanied with a higher mortality rate and permanent cognitive damage. Early treatment will improve the patients outcome and reduce hospital time. The objective Delirum Monitor of Prolira with a detection rate of 90% will greatly improve the patients healthcare as this is currently a subjective and inefficient matter with a detection rate of approximately 30 - 50%. \n\nWe designed an electrode-patch which consists out of three pre-gelled electrodes. This patch will co-operate with the monitor and healthcare professional to objectively and efficiently detect and quantify delirium so that an appropriate treatment can be given to the patient. ",
