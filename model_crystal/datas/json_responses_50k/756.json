It was founded in San Francisco, California, in 1967 by Jann Wenner, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its coverage of rock music and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine broadened and shifted its focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music.[2] It has since returned to its traditional mix of content, including music, entertainment, and politics.\nLike many other countries in the world, Italy has its own edition of RS: the Italian edition was published for the first time in 1980 and after a short period has been stopped.\nThe magazine was reborn in Italy in November 2003, Rolling Stone Italia was conceived by Andrea Cagno and David Moretti and directed by Michele Lupi and Carlo Antonelli.\nThe Company was IXO publishing and beside  Rolling Stone Magazine was publishing other vertical magazines: Freeway, Groove, Rock Sound, Maxi Tuning, Freeway., Caf\u00e9 Racer",
