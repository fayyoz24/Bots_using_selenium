    "summary": "I like challenges and solving problems. I am a team player, and always try to get the best out of others. Effectiveness is a goal to me, and I am always on the lookout of new ways to become better at what I do. I try to make the systems work for me, by automatically building, running unit tests and deploying. \n\nI can also slow down and brainstorm with stakeholders to assess what is best on both the short term and on the long term. I have a high sense of responsibility and ownership, which results in dedication to any project I'm involved in. \n\nIn my career I have used a staple of programming languages, libraries and frameworks, and I do not prefer one for everything.  Instead, I believe that every situation has its own specific needs and different tools can be used.\n\nI believe that I can become a valuable member of any team, I adapt easily and always eager to do my part.",
