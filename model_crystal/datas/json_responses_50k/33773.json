    "summary": "Anne Karin ten Bosch is one of the founders of Platform-Scenography (P-S); a research platform focussing on expanding scenography and spatial dramaturgy. Creating meetingpoints for reflection, exchange and colaborative research and thinking. Connecting and building bridges between disciplines that share scenographic tools and strategies. She assumes designing and creating a way of analyzing and reflecting by doing.\n\nShe researches and reflects (by drawing, talking, walking, listening, teaching and writing) on scenography. Scenography is a discipline rooted in theatre, performance and a narrative tradition, concerned with 'making visible' and 'unravelling', she searches for connections and contrasts with other (design)domains. She is a (guest)teacher in scenography and a coach for students in scenography, visual arts, architecture and urban design.\n\nCorona times handed P-S (Anne Karin ten Bosch in co\u00f6peration with Willemijn Lofvers and Design Platform Rotterdam) the opportunity to continue the development of so called \"scenographic walks\". In autumn 2020 they started 'Walking to the end of the Night'. Walking in the dead of night from the inner city to her outskirts in the company of a complete stranger. Discomfort as a strategy to open up new horizons.\n\nIn 2019 P-S curated the entry for the PQ2019, presenting Julian Hetzel's project SELF, a soap shop based on his earlier work Schuldfabrik. Scenography in this project adapts the appearance of a pop up store in the context of a upcoming hipsters area in Prague, and uses this shop as a strategy to question actual theme's on production, trade and guilt by selling real soap, made of real human fat. \nhttp://julian-hetzel.com/projects/schuldfabrik/ \nhttp://www.platform-scenography.nl/PQ2019/\n\nIn 2016 P-S published \"Current Movements, Future Landscapes\" reflections on scenographic landscapes and criticism.\n\nIn 2015 P-S curated the Dutch entry on the Prague Quadriennial (PQ2015). We won the golden medal for best curatorial concept of the exhibition with the project Between Realities (www.betweenrealities.nl)\n\nIn 2014 P-S curated the \"Exposium Thinking Scenography\" for the HKU, a two days reflective journey through enscenated landscapes. \n\nAnne Karin ten Bosch worked for eighteen years as scenographer with different companies and artists on video and spatial design for audiences; in theatres, on location, in musea and exhibition spaces. She created several performance installations herself. ",
