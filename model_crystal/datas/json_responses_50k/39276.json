    "summary": "The best job is one that combines work with your interests. Ever since I can remember I have loved people - listening to their stories, talking to them and helping them with their problems. And that's exactly what my job is!\n\nAs a specialist in the 2nd track reintegration (Dutch: 2de spoor re-integratie), I help people who have been on sick leave for more than a year in their search for a new, suitable job. They often need to make a new plan for their life and future in the Netherlands. And I am there for them to support them on this journey.\n\nMy work is also related to my greatest passion - languages! So far, I have coached clients in four different languages (Polish, English, Dutch and Russian). Thanks to the knowledge of several foreign languages and excellent communication skills, I am able to help immigrants. This makes their reintegration more effective. In addition, knowing well the cultural differences between the Netherlands and Poland (and other Eastern European countries) allows for more culture-sensitive, personalized and flexible guidance.\n\nOne of my greatest achievements is the development of my career and continuing my education after moving to the Netherlands. What was supposed to be a short trip turned into an adventure of a lifetime. I can't wait to see what the future holds.",
