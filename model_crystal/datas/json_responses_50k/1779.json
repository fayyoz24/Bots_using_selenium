    "summary": "Mechatronics Engineer, Lean SixSigma professional with a solid background in project management, root-cause analysis, problem solving, and a big heart for continuous process improvement. I love to work with machines and people in an environment of technology and automation. More than 12 years experience in international Hi-Tech companies among interdisciplinary and multicultural teams, mainly focused on the manufacturing and engineering services for complex systems. Experienced in leading global teams either directly (direct reports) or indirectly (influence without power). Dealing with global customers and suppliers (Mexico, USA, Canada, Italy, China, Poland and France). \nI am highly pragmatic and enjoy maintaining myself in constant learning. Outstanding communication skills and extensive experience on presentation skills inside and outside work. I believe that growth is not only about how far you advance yourself, but how far you advance others. I seek to add value to the people working with and next to me, at all times with underlying integrity.  Outside work I enjoy investing quality time with my family, reading, carpentry, painting, exercising and camping.",
