    "summary": "Taneha K. Bacchin is an architect, urban designer, and researcher working at the intersection between urban design, landscape architecture, and environmental sciences. In her projects and teaching, she investigates the nexus between space, ecology, culture, and politics in the design and planning of critical and highly dynamic landscapes. Her current work focuses on situated (site/context/culture-sensitive) forms of urban design related to environmental fragility, increasing extreme weather events and climate, and resource depletion, with projects in the North Sea, the Arctic, Brazil, South Africa, and India. Her interest lies in the role of urban design and territorial architecture (morphology, composition, materialisation) in places characterised by high dynamicity, fragility, and projective change: \u2018extreme/ transitional territories\u2019 altered by the effects of the climate crisis, large-scale extractivism, resource scarcity, and new frontiers of urbanisation. She is head of Transitional Territories Graduation Studio and Research, and editor of the Journal of Delta Urbanism. Her work has been funded internationally and exhibited at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2002 and 2018 (Dutch / Venetian / Brazilian Pavilions), S\u00e3o Paulo Architecture Biennale 2013, and International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam (IABR) 2022. \n\nShe is programme leader of the multi-annual Water4Change Research Program, the flagship program of the NWO-WOTRO India-the Netherlands Collaboration on Water (Dutch Research Council / Ministry of Science and Technology India). She is theme leader 'Design, Planning and Governance of the Built Environment TU Delft-Brazil Cross-Faculty Initiative for R&D Programs Netherlands-Brazil.",

India is a country which is rapidly growing into urban agglomerations showing infrastructure deficits and adaptation gaps in response to current and future climatic, societal and economic change. While key drivers are well understood and technological solutions exist, this will be insufficient to deliver the transformative changes needed to pro-actively deal with and respond to these challenges. Therefore, to facilitate long-term sustainability and resilience of urban water systems, an integrative, fit-for-purpose and socio-ecological approach is required in governance, land-use planning, technology, infrastructure design and societal behaviours. These are dimensions that in combination determine \u2018equilibrium\u2019 solutions, sensitive to socio-economic, environmental, technical, and procedural conditions that will continue to change in the future. By synergistically connecting 4 realms for the delivery of change, the programme will develop an integrative and applicable water sensitive design framework for liveable fast growing secondary cities in India.",

The understanding of the changing nature of those drivers and their influence on the quality of the infrastructure space requires a new design approach, one that mediates system\u2019 performance, operation, and values under the influence of various ranges of uncertainty and management scales. This calls for multi/interdisciplinary approach as precondition in practice, research and education development, where design, planning and engineering, environmental and political sciences must converge into new forms of infrastructure design inquiry.\n\nThe typology of infrastructural project addressed by NEXT is the hybrid blue, green and grey network system, i.e. the integration between water resource management, rehabilitation and/or formation of ecological matrices and the built environment. Having the focus on the ground as resource and design space, NEXT aims at researching the spatial, societal, economic and environmental impacts of new constructed natures as infrastructural strategy supporting earth systems rehabilitation and a revised notion of urbanisation.
