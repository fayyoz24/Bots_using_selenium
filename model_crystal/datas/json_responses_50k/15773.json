The aim was to find the optimal way to burn risky biomass and how and to which ratio can the clean biomass be blended with the potentially risky biomass. Also a comprehensive fluidized bed model incorporating solid and gas phases was developed. A novel discretized particle population model was developed and implemented.. \n\u2022 Co-operative teacher for the 5th year MSc course",
