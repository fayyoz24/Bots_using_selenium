    "summary": "Vaishali Ashish Bodke\n \nVaishali does just that and whatever she paints comes about straight from her heart. Her output is stupendous and she firmly believes that no medium, material or matter is alien to hier. Her semi figuritives can be seen as a homage to the history of art in a whole. In her art, you can see influences from everywhere, particularly abstract expressionism of the West to East Asian practice of gestural brushstrokes .While Vaishali is always on the road as an artist exploring, what makes her style unique is the fact that one, of her recent works which she has done, the way she has worked on it, reminds us of one of one abstract expressionists, The Dutch American artist, Willem de Kooning. She has a sense of seamless ease in which she deconstructs figures and tries to give it a more fauvist feel. So in that respect her process could be called \u2018action painting\u2019. But at other instances she reminds you of one particular work by de Kooning called Police Gazette. De Kooning chose literary references like in his work Police Gazette, which was a homage to semi figurative. De Kooning\u2019s contemporaries observed that the internal shapes of the work so completely interlocked and created a unique juxtaposition. Something which Vaishali does through her work. As an artist Vaishali\u2019s painting style is completely different, in fact very stark and spontaneous. She is able to achieve because her style is more expressive and emotional. She feels that art must be spontaneous. So the technique she has adopted and sheltered is that she throws the paint on her canvas and the paints give her direction.Vaishali\u2019s works though in the infancy of her artistic career, must be regarded as promising because she in many ways, is a true artist and true artist\u2019s never follow anyone. They follow and create what they are.\n \n \n- Harish Kumar Sejekan  \nArtist, Art curator, columnist / features columnist with The Deccan Chronicle and Asian Age, Bangalore, India",
