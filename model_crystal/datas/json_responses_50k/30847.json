It consists of an intensive period where first-year students get to know each other through a series of organised activities. Besides its' heavily organisational aspect, the CO\u00d6P is also seen as the contactperson for many first-year students. Due to corona, many activities could not take place, extending the duration of the committee from 2 months to 8 months. This posed many challenges and required commitment, however, it also gave room for creativity and finding safe ways to bring students together in times of corona.",
