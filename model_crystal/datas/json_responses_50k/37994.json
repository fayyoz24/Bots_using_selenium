    "summary": "Robin is a sustainability advocate with a background in sustainable supply chains, certification, reporting and international water management. \n\nWater is becoming an ever more debated resource due to increasing demand and decreasing supply, be it through decreasing physical availability or economic scarcity due to bad management. Rapid population growth, climate change, land degradation and allocation issues are only a few of the pressures that cause this vital resource to be an ever more contested one, but also result in threads like increased risk of flooding. \n\nThe study background showed the tremendous amounts of degradation in natural capital, the difficulties for social and human capital and the lack of financial capital to successfully support positive change. \n\nRobin has gained long-term International experience in Thailand, Malawi and New Zealand that brought him into direct contact with local people, taught him intercultural differences and at the same time made him aware of the diversity of pressing sustainability issues.",

Previous research attributes rope pumps with a significant increase in income of up to 50%. The increasing water shortage and erratic supply augment the need for other (new) sources of water supply. This research explores some of the impacts that rope pumps have on household income in Mzuzu, Malawi.\n\nWith an average income increase of 35% among lower-income households, the rope pump presents a serious benefit for the people in Mzuzu. By decreasing water bills, extending agriculture and vending of pumped water, household income is diversified and allows for more financial leeway. Apart from direct income improvement, the rope pump aids in health improvement through the supply of clean drinking water and elevated schooling levels. However, the thesis also highlights the necessities for long-\u00ad\u2010term success and the importance of perception and maintenance, which is the biggest factor of negative conception. The rope pump is no large community pump, rather a low-\u00ad\u2010cost, self-\u00ad\u2010supply technology, which needs to be recognized next to mainstream community pumps. It can be highly beneficial when used and maintained correctly nonetheless, it is still in the promotion phase in Mzuzu.",
