    "summary": "Thijs van den Broek is assistant professor at the Socio-Medical Sciences research group of the Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management. His research focuses on wellbeing,  health and (informal and formal) care use, in particular of older people and migrants. As a scholar, he aims to contribute to diminishing health inequalities by doing rigorous research that provides insights that policymakers and practitioners can build on to develop equitable policies and interventions.\n\nHe holds a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for a project on health and wellbeing of Turkish migrants in Europe. Previously, he received research funding from the Economic Social Research Council (ESRC, UK) and Erasmus Trustfonds. In 2021, he was awarded the Frans Rutten Research Prize for most promising early career researcher at ESHPM. His work has been published in leading journals, such as Journals of Gerontology, Series: B; Social Science & Medicine; and Ageing & Society. \n\nAcademically, Thijs is a bit of a late bloomer. Rather than focusing on studying while in his 20s, he played underground stages all over Europe with several indie bands and scored a minor radio hit in Norway. In his early 30s, he signed up for the evening MSc programme in Sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam. He finished the programme with Cum Laude honours, and for his Master thesis he won the Joep Munnichs Prize from the Netherlands Society for Gerontology.\n\nFollowing his PhD in Sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, he worked as a postdoc at the London School of Economics. He also had stints as a visiting researcher at the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI) and the German Centre for Gerontology (DZA). He serves as associate editor for the journal Demographic Research, and as management committee member in the COST Action TraFaDy, an international research network on transnational families with 130+ members from 29 countries. The societal impact of his work is illustrated by contributions to advisory reports commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) and the Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands (SER), and by coverage of his research in mainstream media (Volkskrant, Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, LSE IQ podcast, BNR Radio).\n\nAt ESHPM, Thijs served as member of the ESHPM Faculty Council and Programme Committee. Currently, he is a member of the school's Research Ethic Review Committee. He also coordinates the elective minor course Public Health, and supervises master's theses.",

This is typically ascribed to the challenges that come with migration, such as the separation from friends and family in the country of origin and struggles with settling in the destination country. This project breaks new ground by exploring an overlooked additional explanation: selection of lonely people into international migration. The wish to escape experiences of loneliness in the country of origin may contribute to people\u2019s intentions to emigrate. This project analyses multiple, complementary data sources to gain insights into the extent to which loneliness is a driver of emigration.",

            "description": "Many countries in Western Europe have large and growing populations of older Turkish migrants. Turkish migrants tend to have relatively poor later-life outcomes in a broad range of areas. Efforts to improve the ways in which Turkish migrants age may be hampered by a lack of knowledge, given the limited attention to ageing in the study of immigrants and to immigrants in the study of ageing. Rowe and Kahn\u2019s model of successful ageing (SA), which has for decades been presented as a benchmark of how people should ideally become older, may be of limited use for the case of older Turkish migrants, given the plausibly specific ageing preferences of this group, the fact that risk factors for adverse later-life outcomes may be different for migrants than for non-migrants, and the fact that migrants may be confronted with specific challenges, such as discriminatory practices. A redefined model of ageing well is therefore called for. The envisaged project will contribute to this through the pursuit of three sets of specific research objectives: 1. To provide insights (a) in the perceptions of SA held by older Turkish migrants, (b) in potential differences between these perceptions and the views of older non-migrants, and (c) in variation by gender in these views. 2. To assess (a) whether the impact of particular socio-demographic factors on (dimensions of) SA differs between older Turkish migrants and older non-migrants, and (b) whether differences by migrant status are gendered. 3. To explain variation within the group of older Turkish migrants on (dimensions of) SA. To achieve these goals, multiple data sources with complementary strengths will be analysed, and innovative statistical techniques, such as factorial design experiments, fixed effects regression and instrumental variable estimation, will be used. Three destination countries will be considered to gain a broad understanding of the ageing experiences of older Turkish migrants: Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway.",

These and related questions are addressed in the large-scale integrating project FamiliesAndSocieties \u2013 Changing families and sustainable societies: Policy contexts and diversity over the life course and across generations, coordinated by Stockholm University.\n\nThe collaborative research project is financed in the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (\u20ac6.5 millions in EU contribution; grant no. 320116).  Launched in February 1, 2013 it will continue until January 31, 2017. \n\nThe main objectives of the project are: \n- To investigate the diversity of family forms, relationships, and life courses in Europe.\n- To assess the compatibility of existing policies with family changes.\n- To contribute to evidence-based policy-making.\n\nThe project will extend our knowledge on how policies promote well-being, inclusion and sustainable societal development among families.",
