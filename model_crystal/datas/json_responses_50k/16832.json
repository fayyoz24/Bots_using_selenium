Put one\u2019s thinking cap on; it means -\nput (one's) thinking cap on - To begin thinking very hard about something, especially a solution to a problem.\nget (one's) thinking cap on - To begin thinking or considering very carefully and seriously (about something), often to solve a problem. \nWe believe that if we all get our thinking caps on, we can come up with a way as individuals to be involved in climate action. \nThe aim of the project is to use creative educational techniques to jolt people out of their impassiveness towards climate change, to trigger behavioral change and instigate individual and community action against climate change. We hope to, by doing this, promote sustainable development and equip the future generation for more climate change adaptation and mitigation. \nOur objective is to educate by promoting critical thinking about climate change. Critical thinking that will translate to critical action. By using education, we seek to achieve real, long-term impact among people, especially young people.\nOur vision is to have a population who understand the climate change challenge and take action; this will lead to overall national action and commitment to tackle the climate change challenge. \n",
