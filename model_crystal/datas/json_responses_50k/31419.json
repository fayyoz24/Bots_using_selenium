I am going to cherish this experience for the rest of my life. The Netherlands is a small country in size but a super power when it comes to \"innovations and creativity\". On the contrary, Bangladesh is a not so big in physical size but among the world's top with the number of hard working people. It was an exciting time to work as an Ambassador of Bangladesh. For me, it was like a pilgrimage to learn water diplomacy, agri/forestry/fisheries/environmental diplomacy with a penchant for innovations and creativity. During my time, our export to the Netherlands almost doubled while Dutch investment to Bangladesh made a quantum jump. I wont take an ounce of credit for that except that i had a great team in the embassy whom I am already missing a lot. In fact, credit, if there is any, has to go to hard working people of Bangladesh who made our products and services so competitive globally. More importantly, it is during my tenure, we have had the good fortune of signing Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. People of Bangladesh, hopefully, would one day know how big a job we did through completion of \"Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100\". We are immensely  grateful to the Kingdom of the Netherlands for their patience and sustained support to make it happened. During my tenure in the Bangladesh Embassy, I have had the priviledge of woking as \"Chairperson\" of the Executive Council of the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Chairing the elite Executive Council of a 193 member UN affiliated organisation was one of the most challenging assignment I was blessed to endure. And eventually enriched.",
