Then we conducted PIV tests on the mechanism for varied frequencies at varied wing phase locations at three spanwise locations and obtained the velocity vectors around the wing. \n\u200b\nWe are currently studying the obtained flow fields to draw inferences that would help us to better understand the unsteady aerodynamics over a flapping wing.\n\nhttp://abhishekchatterjee6.wixsite.com/abhishek/new-page",

The project started with using artificial neural network training for parameter estimations in Hansa-3 aircraft.Further we explored the use of artificial neural network training in control problems wherein the elevator deflections are modelled using a 6-DOF system coupled with a trained artificial neural network.\n\u200b\nFurther we trained an artificial neural network for artillery shell trajectory prediction with the objective of improving the parametric prediction method that is presently being used.\nAn artificial neural network was trained to estimate the target of a Point Mass Model of an artillery shell for a given set of environmental conditions. The results are generated for a fixed bearing angle and varying bearing angles for estimating the target position and also estimating the required elevation angle and bearing for a given target position .The Point Mass Model was further improved to generate a Modified Point Mass Model which took into account additional factors such as spin induced drifts, coriolis forces of earth and better drag modelling. Neural network was trained to account for these changes and the resulting system was capable of predicting trajectory and target of an artillery shell with better accuracy than the parametric system that is currently being used.",

Then we conducted PIV tests on the mechanism for varied frequencies at varied wing phase locations at three spanwise locations and obtained the velocity vectors around the wing. \n\u200b\nWe are currently studying the obtained flow fields to draw inferences that would help us to better understand the unsteady aerodynamics over a flapping wing.\n\nhttp://abhishekchatterjee6.wixsite.com/abhishek/new-page",
