    "summary": "In my current position as Reliable AI lead at DEUS, my team and I are developing a platform that allows organizations to ensure all of their deployed AI systems perform as intended in any context and with any user. \nNext to that, I am also in the final stages of my PhD at TU Delft. During my research, I developed a theoretical model that formally defines the manner in which different types of abductive inferences are generated and evaluated. The model also serves as a step-by-step guide on how to design AI systems' behavior so that it will trigger intended uses. \nPreviously, I have also worked with cross-disciplinary teams in mid-sized and large international companies to create adaptive organizational structures by designing and implementing agile innovation approaches.",
