Using all of the collected data, existing streetlights on the medians can be powered by these wind turbines. \n\u2022Around 5-6 turbine would be used to harness energy effectively and efficiently. Additionally, since the wind source will fluctuate, a storage system for the power generated will be used to store, distribute and maintain a constant source of power.\n\u2022The results would be validated against theoretical calculations involving velocity inlet and outlet triangles. The performance of the system would be enhanced by the use of a diffuser at the turbine entrance in order to increase the power output.\n\u2022The analysis is being performed in ANSYS FLUENT and modeling in CATIA V5R20",

Initially drag analysis is done in order to determine the increase in drag force produced after mounting of the nozzle. It is found from existing literature that the drag increases by 3.4% after the mounting of the nozzle making it possible the mounting of a nozzle beneath the car. Additionally exhaust gases is also allowed to pass through the same duct to increase the mass flow to the turbine and thus generate more energy. This is made to strike the blades of a 2 stage axial flow turbine whose rotation generates energy. The power output from the turbine is the parameter of interest. This energy can also be stored in batteries and be used to run auxiliary equipment of the automobile including the air conditioner. The exhaust gases will be passed through a catalytic converter before striking the blades of the turbine in order to prevent corrosion of the blades.",

This involves the use of moving reference frame (MRF) and fluid structure interaction.\n\u2022The first phase involves the use of only drag force in cars and also a single stage impulse turbine. The study would be extended to the use of exhaust gases in addition to the drag force to account for the reduction in mass flow rate of air after mounting below the vehicle. This would ensure that some constant amount of fluid(air) is being delivered to the turbine and energy could be harvested at lower speeds also.\n\u2022The analysis is being performed in ANSYS FLUENT and modeling in CATIA V5R20\n\u2022Also this resulted in the submission and acceptance of a paper to IEEE R10 humanitarian Technology Conference.The paper has been indexed in IEEE explore",
