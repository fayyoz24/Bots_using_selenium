Coca Cola is facing many issues in a crowded city that leads to complicated and inefficient logistics operations. I worked together with my fellow students Elodie Marchand and Jos Gonzalez Fernandez, and together we proposed several solutions to these problems.\n\nWe were selected as finalists, and presented our ideas at the Coca Cola visitor's centre in Antwerp, as well as 4 other laureates which were selected. In the end, the jury selected our team as the winner of the TL hub business game.\n\nEN: http://mobi.vub.ac.be/mobi/news/vrije-universiteit-brussels-wins-first-tl-hub-business-game-powered-by-coca-cola-enterprises/\nNL: https://www.tl-hub.be/nl/hub-news/news/vrije-universiteit-brussel-wint-eerste-tl-hub-business-game-powered-cocacola\nFR: http://www.logisticsinwallonia.be/news/des-etudiants-de-la-vub-gagnent-le-premier-tl-hub-business-game\n",
