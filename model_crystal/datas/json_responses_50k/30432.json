    "summary": "Helping people feel connected and solving problems has always been my passion. What started with puzzles, brain-teasers & math challenges during my childhood turned into a career in which I\u2019m given the opportunity to work closely with people on overcoming their unique obstacles within a team and organization.\n\nMy path has finally led me to my beloved tech-space, after spending quite some time in the World of Events (managing 80+ people from various cultures and backgrounds, delivering large-scale outdoor events). Looks like mum was right when she said: \u201cGo study Computer Science or Engineering!\u201d (Kids: Listen to your mums! ;-) ). While these are two vastly different industries, there are quite a few things that translate over well - one of them being:\n\u27a1\ufe0f Having a connected Team, high levels of communication & transparency is key when delivering high-quality Events AND Software.\n\nSo this is what I strive for working as a General Manager at Tarmac: I would love to get to know you, your team & unique situation. Technology is my passion. And if we can help you solve your current challenges of a tech skill gap, optimize your processes, cut costs and reach your Software Development goals - well, that wouldn\u2019t only be a win in your books, but also mine.  \n\nFeel free to reach out directly - I\u2019d love to chat!",

In addition to the literary city portraits, a photographer produces a collection of 24 photos as a visual portrait.\n\nEvery citybook is available as a webtext, e-book and podcast (audio book, mp3) of thirty minutes in Dutch, English and French, and the local language of the city. For example: the citybooks about Lublin are also available in Polish, listen and read about Stellenbosch and Grahamstown in Afrikaans, about Graz in German and about Jakarta and Semarang in Bahasa Indonesia. The podcasts are read by the author in the original language, the translations are read by actors. Travel without moving! ",
