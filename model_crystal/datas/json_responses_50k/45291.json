    "summary": "Prof. Freek Beekman (MSc Radboud University 1991, PhD Utrecht University 1995)\nInnovator | Scientist | Entrepreneur |  CSO and CEO\n\nI am a dedicated scientist, innovator, and life science entrepreneur with a passion for pushing the boundaries of biomedical imaging. I lead the Biomedical Imaging section at Delft University of Technology, where we are pioneering advancements in imaging technology and its applications.\n\n\u2022\tCo-authored numerous scientific papers and book chapters focused on imaging technology and its  applications.\n\u2022\tInventor behind > 20 patent families.\n\u2022\tRecognized with international awards for contributions to science and innovation.\n\u2022\tEditorial board member for scientific journals including Biomedical Engineering and IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.\n\u2022\tFounder and driver of life science companies\n\nExpertise leading to extensive contributions:\n\u2022\tPioneering novel biomedical imaging devices and technologies in collaboration with academia and industry.\n\u2022\tDeveloping innovative tomographic image reconstruction and processing algorithms.\n\u2022\tDesigning tools that enhance diagnostics, therapy, and medical system models.\n\u2022\tIncorporating cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques into the realm of biomedical imaging.\n\nEntrepreneurial Venture: \nIn 2006, I founded MILabs B.V., an imaging instrumentation company. The company introduced an integrated modular preclinical platform encompassing SPECT, PET, X-ray CT, Bioluminescence, and Fluorescence imaging. Our devices, renowned for their unique capabilities for e.g. theranostic and multiplexed imaging, have reached universities and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, fostering advanced research and development.\n\nAs CEO/CSO of MILabs for over 16 years, I had to pleasure to work with an excellent team to steer the company through a remarkable growth trajectory. In 2021, our hard work culminated in a successful exit as MILabs was acquired by Rigaku from Japan.\n\nCurrent Focus: \nWhile continuing my part-time role at TU Delft, I recently established Free Bee International B.V. and founded the Molecular Imaging Foundation, both of which aim to drive advancements in the intersection of technology and life sciences.\n\nLet's connect and explore possibilities at the forefront of science and innovation.",

For example important PET isotopes that could not be imaged in a mouse at a sufficient resolution to quantify or clearly visualize uptake in tissue can be imaged at sub-mm resolution with VECTor-6, for example for 124-I with several times better resolution than state of-the-art coincidence PET. In addition, VECTor-6 uniquely enables to image thousands of tracer combinations simultaneously, resulting in a wealth of new accurate biological information that could not be obtained before. The new ultra-high resolution CT module that is integrated has the best characteristics for in-vivo imaging. Together with automated 3D Autoradiography and Optical Tomography options this has resulted in a Swiss Army Knife for Razor Sharp Synergistic Imaging.",
