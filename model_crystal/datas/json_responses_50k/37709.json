China in Africa in China aims to tell nuanced visual stories about the complex subject of China-Africa relations and the major shift in geopolitics that lies behind it. The goal is to present a view that goes beyond the media perspectives of a debt-trap or win-win situation, and instead shows the complexity and daily reality of the subject. The project will be presented in episodes and each will be available for print and digital media outlets. The entire project will become available on a mobile platform where a second layer offers insight to the global picture, media perspectives and the data behind it.\n\nUgandan partner organisation Fotea organised the first online session with photographers Katumba Badru, Miriam Watsemba, Andrew Kartende, Steward Tibaweswa and journalists Davis Buyondo and Ronald Kato. In a second session, the photographers and journalists brainstormed potential storylines on China-Africa relations in Uganda with Fotea\u2019s Stella Nantongo and Anna Ku\u0107ma.",
