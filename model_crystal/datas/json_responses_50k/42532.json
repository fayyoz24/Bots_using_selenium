Our group the \"Treeamteam\" proposed a solution for facilitating urban development without losing valuable nature. We purposed to create a database that maps all the trees in a neighbourhood and show the environmental and social benefits of a tree. This is calculated to an economical value. This way a municipality has insight into the value of trees in an area with urban development plans. The jury chose this solution to be the winning result because they liked the use of data and the interaction with the environment. Also, it is a project which can be implemented \u2018tomorrow\u2019 at a municipality. The winning team received a price of 2000 euros for study purposes.\nFor more details please check the link : https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/WendolijnBeukers/presentation-team-4-167137122?ref=https://www.kennislabvoorurbanisme.nl/project/summerschool-aug-2019/\n",

It is done by looking at \u201curban poor not as a problem but as a part of the solution\u201d to primarily address the issue of flooding. The project also aims to look into ways to integrate them as a key component of the larger water management schemes. The urban poor in the Kampungs of Jakarta shows a strong potential due to the deep engraved sense of community and affinity to the river and its cultural symbolism. These socio-cultural values of the people within the kampungs could be a key factor in bringing about a behavioral shift in the way they treat their rivers or immediate water systems. Bottom-up interventions within these Kampungs integrated with a top-down strategic plan could reduce a significant amount of stress on the river system and also improve the socio-ecological values of the river.\n",
