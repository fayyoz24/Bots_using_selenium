    "summary": "I am an open minded person and always ready for a challenge. I have learned to change my fields of interests as the economy also evolves so I am not afraid to always try something new. I am Ugandan by birth and I believe I have a lot to show to the world that Africans have a lot of potential more than what is portrayed in the media. \nAfrica is a place of so much innovation and ideas that are yet to be tapped in to. Africa is booming and in years to come, we will surely be the pride of our own people.\nI am a writer by profession, a creative writer to be specific. Who mainly writes about living between two different cultures; European/ Dutch and Ugandan. I already have written two books that are self published.\nI am also a textile designer, my medium is silk screening that I have been passionate about since I was a teenager in Uganda. ",

Kenya and Tanzania are known for tourism and even art. But now I think it is time for Uganda. I have been doing an intensive research, though it is my motherland, I had to research its art history and potential because there has not been a major art scene. But I was shocked that in the last 5 years, a lot has sprung up, including:\nFilm Festivals\nArt residencies\nArt academies, etc\n\nThis made me proud and I want to do something to give these young artists the exposure and appreciation they truly deserve. They need to be known because they work under the most testing conditions. I think the artists are the voice of other Ugandans.\nI studied at the Rietveld Academie and I had the luxury of using so much equipment that sometimes I could not afford but the school provided. But these Ugandan artists do not have that luxury yet they continue to work with all their being.\n\nI want to go to Uganda and buy some art works and come and exhibit them in Holland, starting in Amsterdam. Then as time goes on, some of the money can go back to these artists to help them even develop themselves more as artists to produce more art to exhibit in Holland and maybe other countries as well.\n\nThis is a lesson many artists should learn because in Holland, there are artist subsidies. Yet when a certain grant or fund is reduced or taken away, it is an outrage that deserves demonstrations. \nDoes your being an artist depend on outside factors like money? \nOn some level yes but money does not take away who you are or what your passion is. It is merely a facilitator that makes everything much easier.",

Secondly, the Pirate Cinema Dome; a geodesic tent of 6,5 diameter, equipped with an audio surround set and a projection screen functioning on solar panels.\n\nThe artists are provided with a unique and open platform in which the multidisciplinary contributions will create a dynamic relationship with the viewer as a result of their direct involvement and necessary interactivity. The combination of mobility, accessibility, eco-friendliness and co-creation in this project are related to the contemporary need to jointly find other approaches for regular and fixed structures.
