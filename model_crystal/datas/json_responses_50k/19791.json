            "description": "For my studies in my third year of Business Administration, me and four other students participated in the interimproject with the subject Management Concepts or Hypes. Our project focused on the new way of working and its effect on the employees. It discussed the difference between the two terms mentioned to understand the dilemma between the two stakeholders who are effected most by it; employees and managers. Our final report is rewarded with a 7.8. With a group of 124 students in total, each team presented the final findings during a small conference that was organized by our professor Marja Flory. Our final participation is evaluated by Marja Flory and our group that consisted of fourteen students in total is awarded with a bonus because of the coordination of the individual teams within our theme group. My individual participation was awarded by our professor Marja Flory with an 8.1",
