One particular experience stands out when I had the opportunity to assist other international students in their journey of settling into Finland.\n\nHaving gone through the challenges of studying and adapting to a new country, I could deeply empathize with the mixed emotions these students were experiencing. Moving to a different country, with its own culture and language, can be an overwhelming experience. Recognizing the importance of a strong support system, I made it my mission to provide genuine support and help them feel a sense of belonging.\n\nTo establish a strong bond, I spent quality time engaging in heartfelt conversations with the students. I genuinely listened to their concerns and aspirations, creating a safe space where they felt comfortable sharing their thoughts. By understanding their journey, I was able to provide personalized guidance and support.\n\nKnowing the significance of social networks, I encouraged the student to be involved within the university. I connected them with student events where they could meet fellow students and build friendships. I believed that by fostering connections, they would not only feel supported but also find a sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nMy personal experience as an international student gave me a perspective and a sense of purpose in relating to others facing similar challenges. It allowed me to draw upon my own experiences, provide guidance from a place of understanding.\n\nThis journey with the international students not only reinforced my belief in the power of empathy and support but also strengthened my commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others. It serves as a constant reminder of the importance of creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all students, irrespective of their cultural backgrounds."
