    "summary": "Sport is a wonderful opportunity to obtain health benefits. Moreover, participation in sports should solely result in positive experiences. However, in the last year, it has become (even) more apparent that this is not the reality for everyone. Transgressive behaviours are occurring on a daily base and positive experiences are taken away from athletes. To turn this around, individuals need to be protected from any opportunity bringing their (physical, sexual and/or psychological) safety at risk by establishing a safe sports climate through safeguarding. Therefore, the vision and mission of my scientific contribution is to establish safeguarding in the DNA of all levels of the sports community. Together, by striving to realise a safe sports climate, positive experiences in sports will become the norm for everyone.",

            "description": "Young people spend most of their time outside of the home in community organizations and institutional settings like sport. While it is widely known that participation in recreational activities brings benefits, evidence also suggests young people will experience negative or harmful consequences as a result of their participation. It is increasingly evident that the future of sport, and the safety of children\u2019s participation in sport, is dependent on how we respond to this crisis now. The existing gap in safeguarding implementation (including sexual, emotional and physical abuse) across all levels of sports in Europe leaves thousands of athletes at risk. Closing this gap is a critical step in moving forward in the effort to eradicate abuse from sport. It is simply unacceptable, and unconscionable, to make progress in this effort only when we are prompted to by the exposure of new cases through the media. Abuse in sport is here; the need to meaningfully act is now. The project is based on the EU sport priority of combating violence in sport, being a strong, solid and effective step towards a sport free from harassment and abuse in the continent. Following EU specific sport priorities, the project aims to promote integrity and the values of sport, with a clear message that sport has no room or tolerance for harassment and abuse, and has values such as respect, friendship and excellence as key pillars.",

Recently, more attention and effort to improve student\u2019s well-being have emerged in the academic world in general, and at the UT specifically. These efforts in general aim to increase well-being and reduce (the effects of) stress related to studies or related to personal life-event. We feel that now is the time to integrate this subject in the curriculum for a wider target group of students at the UT. The minor can positively influence the well-being of students, thus educating resilient and wellrounded professionals. It can simultaneously instil awareness of the importance of well-being when designing the future and implementing solutions in their respective areas of study.",

This aim is in line with the internationalization vision of the UT, as well as with the mentioned \"Shaping 2030\" ambitions. To become global citizens, BMS educates students during their study on how to communicate in an international context and how to cope with intercultural differences. The BMS faculty wants to equip students with sufficient capacities and skills in order to cope with and function in international situations. The BMS faculty offers students a number of possibilities to obtain international experience, such as studying in degree programmes in international classrooms with students from various countries, double degree programmes in cooperation with renowned international partner universities, and student exchange programmes that enable students to study at an international university as part of their study. In addition, the BMS faculty aims to offer international students optimal support and guidance. Therefore, this project has the goal to create possibilities within the curricula that enable students to function well in an international context with regard to communication and coping with intercultural differences.",
