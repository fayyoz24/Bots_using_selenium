I used three codes : CLASS (C) to compute the linear matter power spectrum, the N-body simulation PKDGRAV (C) to compute the non-linear power spectrum and the UQLab (Matlab) the framework for uncertainty quantification to build the cosmic emulator. The emulator is able to compute a boost factor (ratio between the power spectra in the linear and non-linear regime) for a wide variety of parameters at a very low computational cost. In addition, I also improved the PKDGRAV code by including the relativistic background.",

Hence, the group Safran explored multiple ways to replace Chrome VI as a coating. The new material needs to protect the plane against corrosion and conduct electricity  to ensure the safety of passengers in case of lightnings. \nMy job was to provide of proof of concept and evaluate the number of silver nanowires to insert in a neutral anti-corrosion coating to turn it into a conductive material through percolation. As too many wires would both be expensive and reduce the anti-rust properties, I needed to find the minimum number of wires to add while also exploring the importance of the size and width of the nanowires. The project lead to the development of a new coating used for planes.",
