    "summary": "Passionate and driven, I'm an ambitious young professional with an unwavering dedication to creating a just and equal society. As I just moved from the Netherlands to the UK, I'm looking for new opportunities to create impactful campaigns (in an employed or freelance role). \n\nMy true purpose lies in empowering communities and fostering leadership to ignite the change we desperately need. In my previous roles at the Dutch Labour Party, I focussed on scouting and nurturing talent, training & coaching volunteers and politicians in campaign skills, strategy development & execution of volunteer campaign structures and amplifying the voices of those often overlooked. My previous roles as well as the training programme at Harvard University that I successfully completed, have given me a wealth of experience in campaign management and grassroots organising. With an MSc in Political Communication (cum laude) and a BSc in Political Science, I also bring a keen analysis of the political landscape. Together, let's shape a better future.",

People can install the plug-in on their browser, which collects data from strategic political campaigns and provides the user with an explanation as to who has targeted them and why. This significantly increases the transparency regarding political social media advertising, which is in my opinion of high societal importance. Additionally, this data can be used in academia to further our understanding in this new field. \n\nIncreasingly important work, and therefore I'm proud to say that as a volunteer, I helped to make the programme available in The Netherlands.\n\nInterested in Who Targets Me and/or in installing the plug-in?
