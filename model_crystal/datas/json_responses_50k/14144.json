    "summary": "I am a second year International Business Administration student at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. One of my key attributes is my attentiveness and confidence while working. I can proudly say that I have always been extremely aware of my surroundings and ready to react to situations swiftly. I also consider myself a person who is able to maintain great communication and interaction with people. I have a very big heart, which has allowed me to be kind and caring towards others. Having completed a total of 60 hours of community service which included working at an animal shelter and in an orphanage, I have noticed both a development in my work ethic and an increase in the conscientiousness with which I carry myself, and which I will always continue bring into my work.",
