    "summary": "A MSc Management of Innovation student at the Rotterdam School of Management with a passion for innovation and sustainability. \n\nHaving completed my BSc International Business at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen I moved to Rotterdam to learn more about managing innovation at the RSM. Through my study, extra-curricular activities, part-time jobs and internship I discovered I enjoy connecting with people and making a positive impact with my work. Currently, I am further exploring my interests for sustainability through my thesis project, which is focused on Public-Private Partnerships for Development in Food and Nutrition Security. Simultaneously, I work as a teaching assistent for bachelor students whilst they build a business and technology report for several interesting cases provided by participating companies for the course Technology Management.",
