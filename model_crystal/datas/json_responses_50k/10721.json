Mark Robinson would feel confident, but it wasn't always that way. In Speak Inspire Empower, he explains his secrets of presenting to any audience - how you can keep them hanging on your every word and persuade them to follow your call to action.\n\nIn this book, you'll learn how to:\n\n- get everyone's attention from your first words\n- have a clear goal for your presentation\n- build self-confidence for your talk\n- learn from the very best public speakers of today\n- persuade your audience using influence techniques\n\nAnd he relates his personal story, how he gave his first presentation - terrified - to how he ended up on the TEDx stage to give the popular talk: \"How to present to keep your audience's attention\".\n\nThis book is unlike any other on public speaking. The techniques are powerful and practical. Each chapter contains exercises for you to implement what you've learnt. His personal story is as inspiring as it is fun to read.\n\nAnd his message of positive feedback is something everyone needs to hear.\n\nIllustrator: Hani Javan Hemmat\nEditor: Simone Roach\n\nAmazon author page: https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Mark-Robinson/e/B08BV25GZY",

Presentation skills are of course key to a TEDx event which is why Mark Robinson was invited for TEDxEindhoven. The city of Eindhoven is full of engineers giving technical presentations every day. Being an engineer himself, Mark has experienced a few too many boring presentations. Presentation skills are learnable, Mark himself is proof of that.
