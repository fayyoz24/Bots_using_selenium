This very niche SoC from TI also contains additional ARM m0 cores to facilitate a sensor controller operating on sensors while the main core is in deep-deep sleep. This allows for extremely low power(1 mA) while still being able to startup without any external switches. Since TI delivers these families of SoC, and others as well, completely with an multitasking OS(TIRTOS or FreeRTOS) as a starting point for further development, it simply works beautiful! Again one can put effort in designing, writing and adding application tasks or, add sensors to the sensor controller. Since this is also based on Simplelink, the (pure) application also runs on the CC3220SF and, can use OAD as well.",

The challenge here was to achieve the best lens focus in both the visual as well as the near infrared wavelengths. For this I designed a optical instrument which does just that. Till now they manually focused their lenses at real target distances of up to 35 meter. The optical instrument however has a length of 800 mm and can focus different lens modules from 6  up to 35 meters inside this 800 mm at 850 nm wavelength only. I used aluminum for the \u2018flat\u2019 parts en 3-D printed nylon for all other, more complex parts. By using the material properties of both the instrument is also compensated for small temperature changes. The camera hardware is programmed with C and VHDL and has a secure 1000T network interface. Each focused lens system is equal now and comes with a calibration report and shorter production time.",

Adequate hardware(new sensors, micro-controller, main cpu board, Bluetooth BLE) and software( c, c++ and java were applicable) redesign. As project lead  I guide this project, together with the stakeholder.\n\nThe second company, Mustec, Muscle Dynamic Technology BV(Amsterdam), has been developing a device for measurement and analysis of muscles of patient who for instance had an accident or other muscle health problem. It\u2019s a spin-off of an already proven concept. The previous product used Bluetooth classic as well, the new one uses Bluetooth 4.0(BLE). They ran into problems since those who tried to program the Bluetooth connection had no knowledge of the Bluetooth LE technology (GAP/GATT). The second challenge was, this software needed to be written once and, running everywhere(Windows 7/10, Mac, Linux) and a single button installation. For this, as project manager/advisor, together with the stakeholders, we collaborate in setting up the business case(website, how to .., etc.).

The first, which is still going on, concerns a Software Defined Radio(SDR) in the GHz domain for which I designed software(python & C++) for an Ettus E310, see: https://www.ettus.com/product/details/E310-KIT. The second project is about trying to detect asparagus also using this device. The back-end contains a Zync720 from Xilinx. For both projects gnuradio(see: http://gnuradio.org/ ) is extensively used. The OS running on the Ettus SDR is Linux(Yocto) which I cross-compiled on Windows. This way the project could, partially, be developed on Windows, using Matlab/Simulink as well. At this moment this project is on hold since some physical problems that were encountered need to be addressed first. A third project concerns the backend of a FMCW radar operating at 14 GHz. This backend drives the frontend and transfer the received data to a laptop via 10/100/1000 Ethernet were its processed by a Matlab GUI. The core of this backend is a Altera Cyclone V GX starter kit.\n\nAnother project, detecting asperges using Ground Penetrating Radar needed a test facility. I designed and build it. This test facility included a robot arm for conducting several hundreds repetitive measurements which I rented from \u201cUniversal robots EHV\u201d (https://www.universal-robots.com/). Since these measurements needed to be taken with very small incremental steps a mechanical problem arose. So called \u2018stick slip\u2019 which I solved by rearranging the applied forces and using nylon sheets to reduce friction. Special care, which involved some software changes and the use of a single sided spring mechanism, were required to keep the maximum forces, as a result of mechanical acceleration, below their maximum values. The use of wood is mandatory since metal would disturb the radar signals.",

It\u2019s a new type of network physics with a great future. The SDK incorporates a smart phone, a smart watch, two ear-buds and a smart wristband. My role was both assisting the system designer and architect, eliminating threads to the project before they occur, and providing a suitable Bluetooth implementation.

As the off-shore companies, like Boskalis, want a solution not relying on satellite communication, the weather conditions and possible high waves of the seas incur an additional challenge. For this a project has been started involving antenna(array) design with state-of-art hardware incorporating SDR. Presently experiments involve free bands like 446MHz-868(920)MHz - 2.4GHz - 5.5GHz(MIMO).
