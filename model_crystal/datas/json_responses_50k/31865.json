I have a PhD in Curriculum Studies and over 22 years of experience in higher education institutions, both in South Africa and the Netherlands.\n\nMy core competencies include learning activity design, learning engineering, embracing diversity and inclusivity, technology-enhanced learning, and curriculum design. I use the science of learning to inform my pedagogical decisions and to create learning environments that foster both learner and teacher development. My mission is to help educators reach their maximum potential and to prepare students for the complex and dynamic challenges of the 21st century. I am passionate about exploring the intersections of artificial intelligence, indigenous knowledge systems, and social justice in education.",
