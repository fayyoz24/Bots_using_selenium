    "summary": "I have a keen interest in the application of physics in the medical sector, and therefore, hope to one day work in the technical sector of the medical field. To accomplish this, I am currently studying Biomedical Engineering at TU Delft, mainly focusing on medical devices. Next to my studies, I am learning Japanese via Kotatsu, an online language education platform.\n\nBeing able to combine my studies with Japanese shows that I am self-disciplined, dedicated and good at time management. This is also proven by the fact that I have partaken in the International Baccaleaureate (IB) Primary and Middle Years Programme up until 7th grade in the UAE, having completed high school VWO Gymnasium level and IB English A level in the Netherlands, as well as completing the bachelor's Medical Natural Sciences with Honours, where having these characteristics is important.\n\nI am critical, patient and creative. During my free time I like to transcribe my own piano covers of songs that pique my interests and share them online. This takes a lot of time, as I make sure my covers sound just the way I envisioned in my head before filming and sharing them online onto my YouTube channel, Pok\u00e9TrainerLiam.",

The proposed algorithm can be used to observe diameter changes before, during and after stroke using image segmentation. From this, we can learn what happens during stroke and reperfusion in humans.\nThe second project also involved in-vivo two-photon images of brains. However, the goal of this project was to adjust a given code and create a user interface to calculate the velocity of blood flow in mice using these images. The algorithm is based on existing literature work, making use of the angle of red blood cell movement to determine the velocity.",

One of my tasks during the traineeship consisted of preparing patients for the external counter pulsation (ECP) procedure. This was done by connecting them to heart monitors and placing the ECP cuffs around the legs and base of the patients. At the clinic, ECP has been used in combination with chelation therapy to improve blood circulation in patients suffering from heart problems.\nNext to this, I had to do some minor administration work for the clinic.",
