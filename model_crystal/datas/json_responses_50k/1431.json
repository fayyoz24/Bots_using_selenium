    "summary": "With expertise in both spatial and transportation planning I analyze urban, regional and international issues related to public transportation and land-use, mostly in preliminary phase. Within Arcadis I advise and support clients from a broader perspective: with regards to strategic policy making, stakeholder management and business advisory. \n\nMy current focus is on benchmarking and strategic integration policies that support adjustment between multimodal transportation networks and land-use, such as \u2018Transit Oriented Development\u2019 (TOD) or the similar Arcadis approach named 'Mobility Oriented Development' (MODe). As part of the global MODe value proposition we created the MODex, a benchmark model for comparing 21 station areas worldwide.\n\nWith experience from earlier projects I am also familiar with (1) socio-economic statistics: executing quantitative and qualitative data analyses; and (2) stakeholder management: aligning different stakeholder interests, using stakeholder analysis.\n\nPersonal interest:\nI have a specific interest in socio-economic statistics and Big Data-tools that allow us to improving  socio-economic and spatial analyses (Power BI, IBM Watson). I aim for a sustainable, safe and healthy environment. My most intriguing experience was to work as a volunteer in a slum development program in India.\n\nSpecialties: \nRegional, urban & infrastructure planning, Transit Oriented Development (TOD), strategic governance, cost-benefit analyses, scenario planning (MIRT), environmental impact assessment (MER), Systems Engineering, public-private partnerships (PPP) and stakeholder management. \n\nSoftware:\nPower BI, Relatics, MS Visio, MS Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), Adobe CS6 (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), AutoCad, ArchiCad, Revit, Microstation, Sketchup, ArcGis.\n\nSkills: \nI am known for being an inspiring and committed team player with a broad, integral view on complex issues, eager to learn, creative, client focused and for having good analytical skills.",

The \u2018Rijngouwelijn\u2019 in the region between Leiden and Gouda has been used as a case study. \n\nThe research started with a preliminary study on the Dutch culture and system of spatial planning, the involved tiers of governance, their planning agencies, their legal powers and the role of semi-public and private actors. As part of the theoretical research integrated transport concepts such as \u2018TOD\u2019, strategic spatial planning models and the TIP-model for process management have been investigated. \n\nSpatial empirical research has been done according to mapping of the regional infrastructure and transport networks, their coherence with the programmatic functions (spatial and programmatic differentiation), spatial form, and the identification of station typologies. \n\nIn terms of governance, empirical research has been done to investigate the issues of decision-making around the project by doing several interviews with involved participants, and by mapping the institutional structure within the region. The research was completed with three alternative design proposals for the case study, according to the three dimensions (a spatial-, institutional- and process design).\n \nThis has been done within the Complex Cities graduation studio (department of Spatial Planning & Strategy). Involved mentors are prof. V. Nadin & prof. dr. W. A. M. Zonneveld.",

The program was given in addition to the regular specialism in architecture, the minor period of the HBO. I've completed this program with good results, which gave me direct admission to the TU Delft.\n \nContent: Architecture, Urbanism, Building Technology and Real Estate & Housing",
