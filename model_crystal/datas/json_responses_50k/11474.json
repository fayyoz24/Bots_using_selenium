    "summary": "Every nation defines itself in the way they communicate with one another. I attended the British School of Amsterdam that had over 40 different nationalities. The focus in the British School was very much on how to communicate with all these different nationalities. There I learned how important it is to listen to one another. When you learn the different aspects of all the nationalities: the backgrounds, cultures, beliefs and opinions, you gain a better and complete understanding. \n\nAs I grew to understand more towards global differences and opinions, I realised communication is one of the biggest influences in our differences in the world.  Since economies and societies will always strive for a diplomatic and united world, I would like to contribute to that by acquiring the skills to reach that goal.\n\nI then studied International Communication; as the global aspect ties in with my goals of understanding an ever-changing market and becoming a role model spokesperson to help others and their differences through conflict solving approaches or changing the communication structure within an organisation to adapt to their growth both internally and externally.\n\nNow, I have finished my Master Business Administration. Here I learned more about the doctrines of management and to further collect, analyse and build on statistics and research skills. With the new insights, methodologies and academics, I aim to advance my knowledge and expertise in both communication and management, and continue understanding differences and an ever-changing market.",

New media approaches had to be developed and in the end, we held a (fictive) press conference with a real journalist however, to test our knowledge and to attack any mishap in our argumentation or defence. This was truly a remarkable project and I experienced great enthusiasm throughout. ",
