Elisa's professional background as an Accountant was well suited to the Treasurer role. \n\nDuties included monitoring financial performance and position and providing a Treasurer's report and advice to the Board regarding financial matters at regular Trustee meetings. Additionally, the Treasurer oversaw the annual financial statement compilation process. The Treasurer was also required to oversee implementation of other legal projects such as a License to Occupy. Above all, as a Trustee, Elisa had fiducial duties to the Trust and its Beneficiaries. \n\nCarved into a Waikato hillside, The Sculpture Park at Waitakaruru Arboretum is a former quarry that has been transformed into a magnificent 17.5 hectare garden and arboretum. The rehabilitation started in 1991 to enhance the existing features: rocky outcrops, ponds, flowing water and broad vistas."
