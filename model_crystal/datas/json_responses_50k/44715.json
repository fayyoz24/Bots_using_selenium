    "summary": "Being innovative has a clear meaning to me\u2014figuring out answers to problems through technology in collaboration with other skilled engineers. I want to work towards making sure no electric energy is being wasted. Therefore, I have focused on studying power electronic converters and I also take a great interest in control theory applied to the electrical grid. My knowledge will be valuable for the recruiter looking to develop the next sustainable power system. Exploring new materials and concepts within power engineering is something I am enthusiastic about too!",
