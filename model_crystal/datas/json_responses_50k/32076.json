    "summary": "As an independent agile (scrum) project manager, it's my passion to deliver results an get things done. I am very goal orientated, work smart and never give up. The difference between success and failure? Don't give up! There is always a way, and together we will find it and reach the goals we set. I am addicted to results, approach challenges from an analytical and conceptual angle, compare possible solutions and make sure to achieve maximum buy-in from all stakeholders.\n \nMy excellent eye for detail and quality helps me to drive projects to a successful end. I deliver projects within budget and on time and like to turn Return on Investment into Return on Involvement. I am a business woman with a masters degree from IUM in Monaco and a bachelors degree from the The Hague University in The Netherlands.\n\nMy experience covers construction, retail, life style management and the service industry. I am fluent in three languages. I am not afraid to think out of the box and to come up with different and better solutions, but I always make sure I understand the risks of new and uncharted territories and how to manage them.",
