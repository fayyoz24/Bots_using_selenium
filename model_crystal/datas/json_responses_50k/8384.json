This carving process is complex and time consuming, and not always exactly reproducible. In this project I develop and optimise an alternative fiber-top sensor production method. I carve the structure right on the tip of the fiber itself instead of using a ferrule. Thanks to Align & Shine technology, the shape of the required structure is fabricated with the use of lithography. Semiconductor industry has showed us that lithography is the method for a high yield, high throughput production process.",

This carving process is complex and time consuming, and not always exactly reproducible. In this project I develop and optimise an alternative fiber-top sensor production method. I carve the structure right on the tip of the fiber itself instead of using a ferrule. Thanks to Align & Shine technology, the shape of the required structure is fabricated with the use of lithography. Semiconductor industry has showed us that lithography is the method for a high yield, high throughput production process.\nAt the Biophotonics and medical imaging group at the VU university in Amsterdam I am developing and adapting the micro/nano fabrication of fiber-top sensors using Align & Shine, thin layer deposition and reactive ion etching. Specially for the application of fiber-top sensor fabrication I have designed and build a reactive ion etcher and mounting components that allow the RIE etching of silicon nitride films on optical fibers. The final goal is to produce fiber-top sensors which are consistent in response, durable and can be utilised in many different environments. The project is led by Prof. dr. Davide Iannuzzi who has extensive experience with optical micro- and nano-based sensors.",

The sensor system, microfluidic chips where designed from scratch and developed to working sensor platform. The sensor was used to detect S. aureus bacterial DNA and was adapted for the detection TB. Additionally, the sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance sensing of DNA was drastically improved using gold nanoparticles as plasmonic labels.\nIn order to succeed this project I have designed various microfluidic flow-cells. Various fabrication pathways where tested. First flow-cells where made  from glass using lithography and wet HF etching, however this process was time consuming. As an alternative, powder blasting with very small AlOx particles was performed. Unfortunately this method results in very grainy glass surfaces making darkfield microscopy impossible. For the final method, parafilm was cut in a simple shape using a scalpel or more complex shapes using a knife plotter and placed between two glass slides. Using heat both slides where cured by the semi-molten parafilm. This design lasted throughout the project because it was very fast (5 minutes) and simple to fabricate and extremely versatile for the gold nanoparticle coated slides. By adapting the microscope stage with a peltier heating and cooling element the double stranded DNA could be separated in a controlled manner.",
