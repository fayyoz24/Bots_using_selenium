I also learnt mathematical methods from the field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, as well as numerical skills relating to data analysis in Python as well as implementing Reservoir Computers (a type of Artificial Neural Network).\n\nFrom this resulted my publication \"Revealing Network Symmetries Using Time-Series Data\" in the ICAND 2018 Conference Proceedings.",
