    "summary": "I'm an analytical virtuoso specializing in public policy and political analysis. My research includes the dynamics of coalition governments and sub-national governments, focusing on the multifold challenges to government responsiveness and accountability.\n\nAs a Ph.D. candidate, I have revolutionized research of Dutch local politics by spearheading the drive to obtain data and pioneer quantitative analyses that provide unprecedented insights. Using statistical software such as R and Stata, I decipher complex patterns with a wide array of statistical models. I stay on top of the latest developments in data analysis and causal research.\n\nMy work is not merely theoretical; it's deeply rooted in practical applications, transforming academic knowledge into real-world applications and actionable insights. For instance, I led the development of the online Atlas of Local Taxation and personally wrote the computer code for the Local Tax Calculator, both projects aiming to offer insight into local taxation to civil servants, politicians and citizens. Moreover, I co-authored multiple research reports for Dutch ministries and municipalities, providing them with a better understanding of taxation and the functioning of democracy.\n\nMy managerial experience extends to handling multi-year projects, such as my Ph.D. and the Netherlands Local Manifesto Project, for which I have gathered and merged data from many sources to allow quantitative research and automated text analysis of Dutch local politics. In addition, I have supervised a talented team of six for the annual Atlas of Local Taxation. These experiences have cultivated my project management skills, enabling me to lead, inspire, and drive projects to successful fruition.\n\nMy portfolio of essays and peer-reviewed papers, and my experience with teaching and presenting at seminars have honed my ability to communicate complex information to diverse audiences with clarity and nuance, both through presentations and in writing.\n\nOutside the ivory towers of academia, my skills position me as a valuable asset for research and analysis jobs in both the public and private sectors. With an unwavering commitment to excellence and a dedication to innovative thinking, I stand ready to contribute a distinctive perspective and drive positive change. With my Ph.D. dissertation nearing its completion, I am looking for a new challenge. Do not hesitate to contact me if you're interested in collaboratively unlocking untapped possibilities within the realms of data analysis, public policy, or democratic governance.",
