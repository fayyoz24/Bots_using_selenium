With a team of 9 stock planners (7 in Lelystad and 2 in Valkenswaard) we manage demand planning, stock value, stock rotation, stock availability and the entire operational purchasing process of more than 100,000 SKUs in the mentioned countries. Besides this we plan the components for our in-house production and determine the quantities to be produced. We of course  continuously cooperate with all other departments at home and abroad, especially the sales departments . \nBy developing KPI\u2019s, setting clear targets for every planner and reporting and discussing them with the team, we have achieved a stock value reduction of 15% and at the same time increased the stock availability of the  fast moving SKU\u2019s. We enhanced this by making a process for product lifecycle management together with Product management.  Another nice achievement was the introduction of  a new process for purchase order management which saved 130K yearly without increasing staff, because we could do the complete purchase order management ourselves and did not have to outsource this anymore. In Valkenswaard we have reorganized the supply chain planning  department which resulted in a reduction of 50% of the staff, stock value reduction of 20%  and a stock availability of the fast movers of 99-100% over the last years. This helped growing the business substantially. Furthermore, I was part of project teams of various successful SAP implementations and reorganization projects (at home and abroad). To mention one I was part of the team that implemented SAP in our site in Switzerland and at the same time integrating the inventory planning process successfully. Besides this, I am a member of the OMT of our company in Valkenswaard.",
