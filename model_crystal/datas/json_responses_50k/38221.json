Examples are linked to road safety, personal health care, secured wireless communications, lighting and consumer electronics. These applications concern very complex semiconductor systems with highly integrated technologies where digital, memories and analogue are funnelled in one piece of silicon. In these kind of applications, reliability and trustability are key factors which cannot be guaranteed without extensive test solutions. This may lead to expensive and unreliable test solutions when necessary preventive efforts are omitted. Within the ELESIS project, we have built a European research consortium that provides cooperation between leading semiconductors companies in Europe, small and medium enterprises that are dedicated to system test and tooling and well-recognized European Institutes and Universities. In this European research consortium, we will focuss on improving the industrial test infrastructure for Integrated Circuits, and building embedded test instruments for analog and digital circuits leading to safe, reliable, high quality and low cost semiconductors products in Europe. \n\nELESIS partners are: NXP Semiconductors, Infineon Technolgies, ST Microelectronics, LIRMM, TIMA, Presto Engineering, ATMEL, JTAG, Salland Engineering, iRoC Technolgies, Temento Systems, D4T Systems, CEA/LETI, University Twente, University of Porto.\n\nMore info on ELESIS:\n\nhttp://www.eniac.eu/web/downloads/projectprofiles/pp_call4_elesis.pdf",
