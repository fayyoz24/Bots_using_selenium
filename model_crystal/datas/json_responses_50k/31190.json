Augmented Lost & Found is an interactive solution that uses the power of HANA and SAP, and also uses non-SAP products. The application uses RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and an automatic categorization of lost items, so they can quickly and easily be analysed. Customers can search for lost objects through a SAPUI5 app, which is optimally displayed on mobile phones, tablets and laptops. Also it included a augmented display on which the lost&found object were projected which gave customers a 360 degree view of the items. This was presented during the DemoJam @ SAP TechEd 2015 in Barcelona. The DemoJam is a demo competition showcasing the creativity, passion and skills of all software developers. The rules are: max 6 minutes, max 2 presenters, no slides, no sales presentations, only running code presented live and at least one SAP technology in the mix. \n\nReference Material:\t \nDemoJam, Teched 2015 Barcelona: http://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/13844",

They are looking at IoT to help them better measure and analyse the quality of the beets and better understand how much of the crops have been harvested. This project is the first to understand what the capabilities are of the technology available. It will provide insight in which plots of land have been harvested and how long and at what temperature the sugar beets have been waiting before they were picked up.

The customers consist mainly of large supermarket chains. Currently Landjuweel does not control the supply chain and are dependent on the production of the potato farmers to fulfil the demand. This matching currently is a reactive approach since Landjuweel has no information on what the farmers are doing on their land.  To get better insight in the production of the farmers and how they are utilising their land Landjuweel is looking at combining the information in their ERP (SAP ECC) system with the information from the farmers (Crop-R). The SAP HANA Cloud Platform is used to combine the two datasources and provide reporting on this data. This also allows Landjuweel to provide information to end-customers around what has happened to the bag of potatoes they are buying in the supermarket. The project has been divided in 3 phases. Phase 1 has started which allows the end-customer to see the history of the bag of potatoes in the supermarket. ",

This\ndemo would need to show the capabilities of IoT and specifically the SAP HANA Cloud Platform. As the Netherlands is mainly situated below sea level it continuously fights with water levels. This concept was used as a base for defining a Dutch IoT case. It consisted of two water basins, which represented the outer water and inner water and height measurement of the water level. Besides this, also water quality was measured and a pump to regulate the inner water level. Through a SAPUI5 dashboard the different sensors were monitored and if required the pump could be turned on from the dashboard manually to pump the water out of the inner water basin. Additionally KPI\u2019s for water height could be defined to automate this process. The pump would automatically start and stop when a certain water level was reached. The case was well received and won SAP IoT challenge EMEA Winner 2016.",

Firstly cleansing the existing data from the decentralized legacy systems and conforming the data in one central location. Secondly a supplier portal in which the suppliers themselves could upload and submit up to date product information to Harvey Norman. The solution consisted of 3 parts. At the base was the SAP MDM solution. This provided the Master Data Management functionality to cleanse and store data provided by suppliers but also for the data that was cleansed. The second part of the solution was the SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE). This is a model-to-execute environment where the underlying processes, such as approval of new supplier information, were modeled and automated. The user interaction was via a combination of custom and out of the box MDM SAP WebDynpro for JAVA application components running on the SAP NetWeaver CE system. Using the MDM API in the WebDynpro applications, MDM functionality could be leveraged and used in the processes defined in the SAP NetWeaver CE system. To provide a coherent frontend for both the internal users within Harvey Norman and the external users, the suppliers, the SAP Enterprise Portal was used. Using Federated Portal Network (FPN) the SAP NetWeaver CE WebDynpro applications were made available in the SAP Enterprise Portal. \n",
