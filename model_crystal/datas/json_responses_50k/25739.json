    "summary": "My name is Timothy Lichtenberg. Everyone calls me Tim.\nI am a Netherlands based Product Designer who is currently modernizing how people manage their finances at www.flowyour.money\n\nAs a Designer I strive to create functional and meaningful experiences. I have a degree in Graphic Design and a rich background in helping startups, ventures and corporates to build well-thought-out products. I believe that the best work is done through clear communication and tight collaboration. Good design should act but not distract, providing intuitive solutions while improving the overall look and feel.\n\nIn my spare time I like to go out for a walk, explore new places, take photographs or enjoy a good read.\n\nFeel free to reach out, I am always open for a chat.\n\n(+31) 6 192 766 18\ninfo@timlichtenberg.com\nwww.timlichtenberg.com",
