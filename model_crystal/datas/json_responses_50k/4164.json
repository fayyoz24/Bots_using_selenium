On park benches, at stations, at traffic lights, along the canals, in the zoo, in front of various ministries....they popped up everywhere! They even appeared in other cities and countries like the Unites States, Italy, Spain, Germany, Great Britain and China. And they still are! Check out: www.movingpeople.nu/social\n\nThe ten miniatures represent real people and their moving stories. Small but tangible stories of human voices behind the endless numbers of refugees in the news headlines. These are stories that need to be told, with an artistic - but non-political - twist. The small figures are meant to move, to literally travel through the city. We show the human stories behind the overwhelming news footage and so-called 'swarms of refugees.'\n\nMoving People is a street art project in which everybody can show commitment to refugees and let their voice be heard in a creative way. If you do happen to find a one of the miniatures, you can take it with you and place it somewhere else. In this way you can contribute physically to the project by moving the miniatures around the city, country, or even the world. Move and be moved. \n\nMore info: www.movingpeople.nu",

The tent that hosted Lowlands University was filled completely for just about every lecture, some 1.000 seats per lecture. The media have paid elaborate attention to the lectures and \u2013 most importantly - the project was highly appreciated by the Lowlands festival audience.",
