From 2021, I started to serve as the Bachelor Program Coordinator in Economics and Business Economics and International Bachelor at Erasmus School of Economics.\n\nBesides the extensive expertise in data analysis and common financial databases, I gained a deep knowledge of administrative micro-databases ORBIS and AMADEUS, by Bureau Van Dijk  (a Moody's company), covering millions of companies globally. With my co-authors, I wrote ORBIS manuals on how to construct nationally representative firm level panels of ownership and financial information, usable for research purposes.\n\nMy other expertise includes corporate valuation, securing research and policy grants, policy advisory work, managing individual researchers and teams, and teaching and supervision of bachelor, master, and doctoral students.\n\nI served as a visiting scholar at the National Bank of Ukraine and the research department of the International Monetary Fund, Washington D.C. In 2016-18, I participated in the grant for the European Commission (in cooperation with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Eurostat) Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) Observatory Phase II to develop/update the methodology and data collection for tracing the deployment of KETs in the EU and other regions. \n\nI am open to career opportunities as\n1. Permanent full professor or visiting professor at a research university.\n2. A consultant / researcher position at a research/policy organization or think tank to conduct research or lead research efforts in my fields of expertise.\n3. Visiting teaching position at a finance or economics department to teach the large scale or seminar-(under)graduate classes on corporate finance and valuation, international finance, macroeconomics, and monetary economics.",

Specifically, the KETs Observatory will be promoted as a practical tool for the elaboration and implementation of Smart Specialization Strategies in the EU regions, providing valuable insights into the performance of the EU regions in terms of industrial deployment of KETs and thus helping regional stakeholders with their entrepreneurial discovery process.\n\nWithin this project, I developed the new methodology (see https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/kets-tools/kets-observatory/methodology ) and organized the data collection for tracing the deployment of KETs in the EU and other regions.
