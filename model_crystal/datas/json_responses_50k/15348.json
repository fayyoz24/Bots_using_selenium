    "summary": "Studio Dennis Parren is a multidisciplinary design studio that focuses on using natural and artificial light as a design material. With a team of three designers and a network of experts, partners and freelancers we create our work.\n\nWe design from the idea that light = everything. Without light there is no colour, and no life. We use light as a material to progress and innovate the way in which we experience, think about, and look at light. We use the mystery of colour and light to create new concepts, and use cases for light to innovate, educate, inspire and amaze.",

It is now something one can design, calculate and predict. Dennis' work concentrates on the effect of light, like shadow or reflection.  Everything Dennis invents, and builds around it, serves the precious commodity that light is. \n\nIf we're able to see a building as a bearer of light, a colour as a temporary interruption, shadow, colour and reflection as something you can control and design, if we can imagine how light would think, then we're able to achieve extraordinary results. This idea might sound strange, but is not, once you realise that light makes life, as we know it, possible. It's one of our main energy sources and the determining factor of our sleep and wake cycle. Without light there's nothing. With light there's everything. That makes light a unique material. One that is leading for Studio Dennis Parren.",

It offers a surprising variety of -- not just music -- but also literature, film, cabaret, ballet, theatre and comics. \n\nFestival director Eric van Eerdenburg was intrigued by the CMYK lamp and wondered if this lamp could be built on the festival premises, but then 20 times bigger. From scaffold tubes an 18 meter high tower was built. Within its construction a moving LED platform offered a shifting play of shadows and light. Moving elements, within the safety measures of the festival, made the project a very complex one. Despite its complexity, the collaboration between the Studio and the Lowlands team was flawless. \n\nFor the Studio, but for Lowlands too, this opened new doors, and a new chapter in a book. The Studio showed it was capable of realising huge projects and Lowlands showed it wasn't afraid to dream. And that makes Lowlands one of the most unique festivals in the Netherlands.",

Beautiful industrial buildings now contain a creative industry and one of the best art schools in France.\n\nIn 2015, the organisation offered the Studio an opportunity to build a light system. For this end we created two projects. \n\n\nGRADIENTS:\n\nDerived from previous work at the light festival Glow 2014, we made an improved version of it. White light contains all colours. The position and the shape of the objects also determine the colours. Light is understandable and calculable. Once you get it, once you understand light, you get to realise that you can use light like a painter uses his brushstrokes on canvases. \n\nDOTTED LAMP:\n\nA LED strip is a mass-produced product. It is quite common underneath closets, on skirting boards and other ungrateful spots. It's a half-product that spreads a nice line lighting, but it's not finished yet to admire it to its full extent. From this perspective the idea arose to create a lamp that would pay respect and honour the LED strip. The Dotted Lamp is a framework and the LED strip is clicked inside that framework. That way it creates a dreamy image, portraying octopus, a 'walking light' that keeps shifting its shape.",

To my big relief, working at Studio Bertjan Pot mostly meant creating things, the thing I loved, and still love most. It was good to see that this studio believed that one should work with and from possibilities, and the things you discover along the way. Thinking in possibilities is stronger and more rewarding than thinking in goals, in what you can achieve. If you think in possibilities it's harder to become disappointed. His work can be characterised by great designs, ideas and discoveries. It is good to see that all of these aspects lead to a successful studio.",
