    "summary": "With more than 15 years of experience in pedagogical sphere, want to continue my path in new environment...\nMy name is Viktoryia. I was born in Minsk, Belarus and a couple of months ago I made one of the most important decisions of my life. I moved to the Netherlands. The country I immediately fell in love with finding it as clean, picturesque and green just as my motherhood.\nAnd of course as a person who must and want to integrate in Dutch society I see myself here continuing my path in teaching.\nI always liked to study, always was a good student, especially when it comes to such subjects as languages or literature. That\u2019s why when the time of choosing the university came I with no doubts chose Belarusian Pedagogical University named by Maksim Tank in Minsk that I successfully graduated in 2010 having 2 specialties after graduation: Primary school teacher/ English teacher. In the Netherlands my diploma was approved equivalent to Master Degree by IDW.",
