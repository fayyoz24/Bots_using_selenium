    "summary": "The human brain is a crazy place, and there are two things that fascinate me most: product placement and growth marketing. First: the concept of the consumer logic and how rational yet irrational it can be. And second: the challenge of communicating in a way that persuades and convinces consumers, always requires optimization \u2013 so in the end you\u2019re optimizing for something both rational and irrational.\n\nI apply the same thinking in product marketing that I also apply in leadership, because whether you\u2019re connecting with consumers or with your team, you\u2019re connecting with the fun irrationality of their logic \u2013 in order to bring ideas together, influence and outcome, and also optimize and scale for future growth.\n\nI have always had entrepreneur spirit; this is something that allows me to work alone very well but also in a team where you can rely on each other and spar ideas to reach your end goal together. \n\nOutside of work, I like to take different sport classes, I find that this also challenges me in a way that makes me really happy. An hour where I can release stress and gain new skills ex) improve my reaction time with kickboxing. I also like to volunteer when I can, I try to help food kitchens and elderly homes when I can find some time. Communicating with individuals from such different walks of life is always inspiring to me and I find their stories so fascinating to listen to. But my most favourite activity outside of work is spending time and walking my dog, there is nothing like getting some fresh air, running around and seeing the joy on his face.",
