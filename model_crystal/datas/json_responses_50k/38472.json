    "summary": "I studied at the \"Academie voor Beeldende Vorming\" in Tilburg, the Netherlands. One could choose any direction which provided the opportunity to get aquainted with all the facets of the art-world; from animation to sculpture, from painting to bookprinting. In my final year I choose illustration and photography and intencified \"illustration\" at the Arts Institute Bournemouth at Bournemouth U.K. I finished by graduating Cum-Laude and received my license to teach the various art technics and Art History. \n\nAfter a period of teaching Art at a gymnasium I felt that I needed more than sharing and exchanging knowledge. I wanted to give my autonomous work direction: How does one work purpousfully when asked for by any kind of client? To further my ambitions, I started in 2008 at the Design Academy in Eindhoven. After following the design directions Leisure and Communication, I choose Man and Public Space as my main course.\n\nI aspire to combine my interest in widely varied areas. No design can succeed without thorough research. I possess the capacity to highlight details which are mostly unnoticed. Typical characteristics for my work are: Space, light and detail. Being a conceptualist, I create designs which awaken an experience by the observer.\n\n\nIn november 2012 I started my own company.",

In order to visualise time, we set about designing a \"Time-Line\". Starting point is the birth year of the oldest inhabitant of the city: the year 1900 . Next and of course the most imported thing: how does one get a large group of people, from all walks of life, on the move and keep them going in a reasonably orderly fashion ? Food ! Eating makes habitants relaxed . After that overture, discussion subjects should be put on the table. With all that in mind, we had started to see the \"time-table' as beeing a long table cloth !! The foundation of the meeting is now ready to go onto the table. The topics put on the table were; history of Eindhoven, history of the Philips lightbulb, development of the car, several interviews, picture postcards, changes of Eindhoven, and countless future ideas. Everything put down on the \"table-cloth\" in orderly fashion. The table-cloth is 14 meters long, every meter represents ten year. the last three meters are left blank, to be filled in by the \"meeting\" people !",

In a world so filled with details I have become a true collector and have a \"collection\" of \"jewels\" from a park. A public library is probably the ultimate \"collection\"; a place where everything is stacked together in very thin layers of time and subjects. All kept in orderly fashion: side by side. All the stories are clad in a shape that differs slightly per book. The idea that the shape of the book could be \"tailored\" on the story it contained handed me the starting-point for the idea of this project: A serie of ten books, that form together a group of stones who protect their secrets within; like a precious jewel before it's hewn from the rock where it was born. Together they form a new exploration for the book-shelf.",
