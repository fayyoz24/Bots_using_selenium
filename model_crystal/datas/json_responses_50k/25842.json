    "summary": "I am a graduate of Philippine  Normal  University,  where  I  took  up  Bachelor  in  Early  Childhood Education. It is from the same university that I took Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education for a year. My Bachelor on Early Childhood Education is recognized as DIPLOMA IN EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE & EDUCATION \u2013 TEACHING (DECCE \u2013 T) LEVEL of Ministry of Education in Singapore. IDW has recognized my diploma as a two year HBO bachelor program.\n \nI have been dealing with children that range from ages 2 \u201312 years old as well as adults in my 12 years of teaching. My first year of teaching was committed in educating young children aged 8. Another 2 years was with a company that caters to Koreans in various age groups up until their 60's who wanted to learn and practice speaking in English.\n\nThroughout my years of teaching, I have widened my perspective in different cultures thus making me open minded and adaptable to changes. I also enhanced social competency which aided me to deal not only with children with different backgrounds but as well as adults. During these years, I have also worked in partnership with our stockholders, the parents. I have worked closely with parents as I find it essential for a preschool teacher to collaborate closely with them to ensure the children's experiences in school are fundamental to their growth.\n \nI am willing to further expose myself to different cultures as well as learn Dutch. I am currently working as an administrative employee and I am looking for other opportunities here in The Netherlands.",
