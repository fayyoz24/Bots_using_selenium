    "summary": "I am a second-year master\u2019s student of Nutritional and Public Health Epidemiology at Wageningen University (NL). My main interest is in preventing non-communicable diseases, especially cardiometabolic diseases, through lifestyle changes. Contributing to research that assists the population to take a healthier and more sustainable diet is a goal of my career! \n\nI completed a BSc in Liberal Arts and Sciences with a major in Public and Global Health and a minor in Biomedicine at Erasmus University College (NL). During this interdisciplinary program, I also took various social science courses, including gender studies, political sciences, and clinical psychology. In the MSc program, I received extensive training in statistical analysis using R, STATA, and SPSS. \n\nCurrently, I am working on my thesis which explores the association between ultra-processed food intake and inflammation in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, capturing racial and geographical differences.",
