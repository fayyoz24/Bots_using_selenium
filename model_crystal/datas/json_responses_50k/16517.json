    "summary": "Growing up in New Zealand, I was interested in music from a very young age. At the age of 8, I started to play the clarinet, playing mainly classical music. My interest in different genres grew and I got the opportunity to explore jazz music in high school. This initiated a number of leadership opportunities, such as serving as their lead student ambassador of the arts around New Zealand. Wanting to explore more of the world and broaden my musical view, I did my Bachelor studies at the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide, Australia, with Dean Newcomb. I continued with Master studies with Roeland Hendrikx at Conservatorium Maastricht in the Netherlands where I currently reside.\nDuring the years I have held many principal clarinet positions in various project symphony orchestras and academy orchestras. These orchestral experiences sharpened my social and leadership skills. I am a person that has a high curiosity about human interactions, the sciences and critical thinking. Fact-checking and authentic performance accuracy play a major role in how I think and rationalise my musical interpretations, whilst also including my own artistry to find balance - it is all of equal importance to me and my work. The pursuit to continuously develop and be a better version of myself to serve the activities I love the most has been because of these curiosities.\nMusic gives me great enjoyment. Whether by playing Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto, engaging with colleagues in orchestras and chamber groups, or listening to a Mahler symphony or a John Coltrane album, they all give me a sense of fulfilment in life. I am sure my talents and experience are well-suited for musical organisations and match the requirements of this highly challenging industry.",
