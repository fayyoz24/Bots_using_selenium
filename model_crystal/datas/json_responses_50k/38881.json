The core aim of this thesis is to examine the diaries of the soldiers who fought in the Middle East and how accurate was their reports. These accounts will then be matched with news reports from newspapers such as the Daily Mail and/or The Times to see was there any significant differences. Additionally, theoretical concepts such as the \"timing narrative\", \"collective memory\" and \"censorship\" will be applied to get a greater understanding of how diaries and newspapers were composed during the First World War. From here, one should discover was there any misleading of news reports and why? or were soldier diaries providing inaccurate accounts due to the conditions they suffered (lack of food, sleep and illness)?\nMy tasks and research include:\n1: Searching through databases from the British museum to locate soldier diaries.\n2: Establishing a base of my findings of diaries from the British and Commonwealth soldiers.\n3: Collecting newspapers from various sites to collaborate with my findings.\n4: Collaborating with my supervisors with any updates of my research.\n5: Extensive and in depth analysis on the use of 40 soldier diaries throughout the thesis.\n6: Composing my findings into a 25'000 word dissertation.\n\nResults: Facts on the British involvements differed between soldier diaries and newspapers in regards to British defeat at Gallipoli and Kut. The theories applied to newspapers suggest the information within newspapers were altered by the British government to keep morale up. However, the theories applied to soldier diaries suggest the information also contained biased or inaccurate accounts. This was due to fatigue, illness and the time period they had to compose their thoughts into writing.\n ",

My tasks included looking after a group of teens from various countries around the world. I would create activities for the teens in order to assist in improving their English. I also had to work as a team member with other monitors in the camp in order to create stability and to make sure the camp was running smooth. This relates to taking night shifts and creating schedules so we would be organised. From this experience I learned valuable team coordination, time keeping and good social interaction amongst the teens, my work colleagues and bosses.",
