The company has a quality management system according to ISO 13485.\n \nThe company developed a proprietary new product for the embolization of uterine fibroids. The product, known as X-Spheres\u2122, was CE certified in spring 2013.\nThe distinguishing unique feature of the X-Spheres\u2122 is that the embolizing spherical microparticles are not only biocompatible but also radio-opaque. The spherical microparticles can be visualized through X-ray fluoroscopy, i.e. during the embolization procedure, and also afterwards. This feature will contribute to the efficacy and safety of embolization procedures.",

The first is the still-limited blood-compatibility of dialysis membranes, i.e. the propensity of membrane biomaterials to activate clotting in contacting blood resulting in adherent or embolic thrombi. The second bottleneck is the confined capacity of current dialysis membranes to remove protein-bound toxins from the patient\u2019s blood. KidneyPort strives to achieve these goals through the use of a new hydrophilic biomaterial \u201cSlipSkin\u2122\u201d. It is produced by one of the partners of this consortium (INterface BIOmaterials BV), and the biomaterial has already been studied extensively. The consortium will, therefore, take a pragmatic approach, with a focus on prototypes and their testing under realistic conditions. Our drive is that the SlipSkin\u2122 was found to be extremely suitable for use in blood-contacting medical devices, including prototypic dialysis membranes. Moreover, it is known that SlipSkin\u2122 can be blended with nano- or microparticles (e.g., of heparin, silver or active carbon) to produce bio-active surface coatings combining a high affinity for blood-borne toxins and non-thrombogenicity. \nThe KidneyPort consortium consists of three research centres; (i) University of Twente \u2013 MIRA Institute of Biomedical Technology \u2013 Biomaterials Science & Technology Department, (ii) Maastricht University \u2013 Biomedical Engineering FMHL and (iii) Maastricht University Medical Centre \u2013 Internal Medicine/Nephrology  and four companies; (i) INterface BIOmaterials BV, (ii) Interdos Pharma BV; (iii) Labo Group BV  and (iv) LifeTec Group BV.\nThe project is subsidised by the Dutch Kidney Foundation and Topsector Life Science and Health for a 4 year period (2014-2018).",
