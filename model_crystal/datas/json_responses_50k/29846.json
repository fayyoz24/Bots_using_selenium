    "summary": "As computer scientist and mathematician by training I am a full-stack data scientist and engineer.\nI'm a seasoned data scientist with extensive experience in statistical modeling, machine learning and big data analytics that thrives on working in cross-disciplinary teams and applying my knowledge to solve challenging and important problems.\nWhether it is the pre-processing or feature engineering of a dataset, optimizing the (hyper)parameters of my model, containerizing and building CI/CD pipelines to deploying the cloud infrastructure as code or implementing resources to monitor my models for drift detection, I am very comfortable with my prowess to write solid code for every aspect of the life cycle.\nFrom the exciting results obtained from a model project with stakeholders, new tools that can increase the velocity of developers to guiding juniors or mediors to write better code, I enjoy sharing knowledge, leading teams and help people get better.",
