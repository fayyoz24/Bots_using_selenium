The team was founded shorty after the revolutions in 2011 in Tunisia and Egypt to support the call for democracy in the region. By regularly organizing political and cultural exchanges the team provides an opportunity for a valuable learning experience for both Dutch and Arab participants. The team organizes and attends events both in the Netherlands and in the MENA region. In 2014 I was appointed chair of Team Arab Transition. The team consists of eight highly motivated young liberals with a keen interest in the recent political events in the MENA region."

ZEN was launched in October 2008 to ensure that the EU and its member states stay engaged on Zimbabwe and that the perspectives and recommendations of Zimbabwean civil society help shape its future policy decisions.\n\nSince its foundation ZEN has positioned itself as the main EU-Zimbabwe platform in which European and Zimbabwean civil society closely cooperate. The network enables its European members and their Zimbabwean partner organisations to address their issues and concerns at the main European institutions and EU member state governments. It does so by developing relevant, timely and adequate lobby and advocacy strategies, which include the publication of reports, expert meetings, (media) events and briefings.\n\nI am one of the five Members of the Board and together we determine the strategic direction of ZEN, keep an overview of the finances and serve as a sounding board for the secretariat.
