When in 1989 the position of artistic director became vacant, I was asked by the board to step in, which I did.\nMy main task is to continue the weekly rehearsals. It entails much preparationary work, both in short and long term planning. I am responsible for the artistic quality and continuity. Since a few years I also joined the board as director of the foundation Tirta.\nAs such I also am contact person for Tirta, and it's manager. My main 'management'-goal is to involve all members in the organisational and artistic activities of the foundation. All aspects of music making are important, and should be considered by all members together, not only by the boardmembers (who are also players).\nSo not only the music itself (both individually and collectively), but also preparing rehearsal-weekends, logistics for performances/public workshops, promotional activities, design/graphics, maintaining and acquiring props/costumes etc., artistic direction, CD productions etc.\nBeing no professional in management or even trained whatsoever, I'm very lucky to be able in Tirta to develope over the years just these qualities in me, which has proven to be very fruitful in many other engagements with other artists, institutions and other people."
