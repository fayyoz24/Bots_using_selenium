    "summary": "Hi! My name is Gerbrand van Dijk, and as a data analytics professional it is my goal to help organisations get the most out of their data. What gets me out of bed in the morning is pursuing a universal truth; I enjoy enabling fact-based decision making. I have studied in the business domain for 7 years, gaining a lot of contextual knowledge and international experience in the process. Additionally, my working experience allowed me to develop advanced analytics skills such as Python programming, SQL querying and various data visualisation tools and techniques. In essence, I find the ideal way to exploit my full potential is by driving value with beautiful data stories whilst also improving and analysing the systems that allow them to exist.\n\nPlease do feel free to shoot me a message and get in touch in case you see potential for a collaboration of any kind!",
