My work draws from my own cultural background and is often inspired by my own memories, knowledge and experiences. I personally believe it is of utmost importance to design meaningful projects that not only use intuition, but are also sensitive and genuine. I delve deeply into my research and enjoy connecting with people from different backgrounds, attempting to create a bridge between cultures.",

            "description": "The ostrich feather was once a highly valued commodity during the19th Century, as Victorian and Edwardian woman sought out big plumes to decorate their flamboyant hats. Since then, the feather has fallen from grace and now its main use is removing dust or in tacky carnival costumes. I aim to enhance the value of the ostrich feather, a very specialized product coming from the 150 year old ostrich feather industry in Oudtshoorn, South Africa. I hope to go beyond the aesthetic and decorative and rather return it to its former glory in a more integrated and practical way, within modern society where big feathered hats are no longer stylish.\n\nCollecting feathers from the ostrich is the removal of dead material and is the equivalent to cutting fingernails causing no pain to the bird. Currently in the worldwide ostrich farming industry, the animal\u2019s main purpose is to be slaughtered after only one year for their nutrient rich meat. Introducing an alternative industry where the ostriches are only kept for their feathers, could mean that they could live their full lifespan while providing feathers without deterioration in quality for up to 35-40 years. \n\nOnly the natural uncoloured feathers are chosen, as they would be found on the bird. By removing the central shaft, and only using the soft, thread-like barbules, the feathers can be combined to make a yarn that is then woven into a fabric. The soft, warm and incredibly light weight textural qualities of the feathers mean it can be used in a variety of practical ways.\n\nBy harnessing the qualities of the feathers and creating a new craft through these feathered textiles, it could not only save many animals lives, but also could create a new industry of economic value to the small deserted town of Oudsthoorn.",

This hand tufted and beaded carpet mirror my own position within the world and are a reaction to my own feelings of not belonging and being lost somewhere \u2018tussen wal en schip\u2019. It highlights the complex colonial connection and history that too often goes unacknowledged, is misunderstood, and is often intentionally forgotten. \n\nThrough my research I found the glass seed bead. The glass seed-beads used here, like me, are a product of colonialism. The beads are not, and have never been made anywhere in Africa. Historically they were brought in from Europe on ships and exchanged for goods, and even slaves. The European countries which made up my family\u2019s colonial past, are those which historically brought the beads to Africa. This makes the beads as much a part of my own history, as native South Africans who traditionally have used them. \n\nThis carpet represents the unseen and misunderstood realities of my fellow South Africans, who I grew up with. The drawing represents a certain person\u2019s reality, their \u2018home\u2019, which is then translated into a hand-tufted carpet. I find myself struggling to find \u2018home\u2019, being neither comfortable back in South Africa, a tourist in my own country now, and never fitting in in the Netherlands either. This carpet becomes a physical cross-over of culture and craft. Hand tufted carpet in the Netherlands by the Textiel Museum, and beading hand made in South Africa.\n\nThis project attempts to question personal identity and to apprehend racial constructs through the navigation and realisation of objects that honour craft and the memory of those challenged by this between place, somewhere \u201ctussen wal en schip\u201d.

As a white South African, I am frequently asked bizarre questions. \u201cIf you\u2019re from Africa, then why aren\u2019t you black?\u201d\n\nThe European colonists in South Africa produced a racial stratification that evolved, furthered and then resulted in Apartheid. Apartheid then ended around the same time as when I was born. South Africa is a young country, that has undergone a drastic change within the last 25 years. This shows how young the democratic country really is, which has triggered a crisis in my own identity.\n\nAs a white woman growing up in modern South Africa, you are inadvertently brought up to believe that you are inherently European; momentarily trapped in a \u2018foreign\u2019 land. Now, living in the Netherlands, I find myself grappling to construct my personal identity and navigate my white privilege.\n\nThis blanket depicts the unseen people, my fellow South Africans who brought me up, the domestic workers. The blanket highlights details of the domestic situation in which these people work, and of which I am a product. Each figure is hand embroidered by the Mogalakwena community group in Limpopo, South Africa. The figures have been embroidered onto a thick woollen, traditional Dutch Aabe blanket.\n\nI should not be ashamed of being white, but in a country like South Africa, unfortunately the colour of your skin defines you more than you would like to admit. This skin-tight connection with colonisation makes me feel guilty, even though personally I know I had nothing to do with it, I was born into this privilege. Creating this blanket was my way of acknowledging my white privilege and all the history that it brings with it. ",

The aim of this project was to bring to life a dying craft, like Taxidermy, which over the years has lost its relevance in modern society. Through this project, its new relevance is as a really powerful tool in the popularisation of science. Taxidermied bird species become tasteful household objects that illustrate the irreplaceable nature of endangered species. It intrigues and interests, by creating a more elegant, desirable object. The aim is to have it displayed and sold at natural history museums, where one could buy it as a whimsical moving object that represents their support for the important and relevant research that is constantly being done at these museums. If taxidermy can contribute to educating a new generation of people, about biodiversity and the effect that we have on it, as well as contribute to a better life for living animals through funding, this is already one step closer to the future.
