As part of this process, the Pro Bono Committee selects cases that are based on a list of criteria. Firstly the case must hold demonstrable social significance or set a legal precedent. Next, the party concerned must have limited financial resources and is not entitled to receive legal aid. We must also believe that we can provide clear added value through our specialist knowledge and expertise. Finally, we are careful to ensure there is no conflict of interest with our existing clients.\n \nEvery year, our partners and associates continue to play an active role in various pro bono matters, taking on cases that make a real difference to individuals, and local and national organisations. We invite you to read through the small selection of pro bono cases we have undertaken on our website at http://www.stibbe.com/en/csr/pro-bono.",
