    "summary": "I am a cultural anthropologist with a preference for a human-centered, decolonial and intersectional approach to the promotion of social, political and economic justice. As an anthropologist, I think I am very much aware of how oppressive systems such as racism, sexism or classism imbricate and intersect with each other creating structural, multifaceted and varietgated forms of (group-based) oppression and privilege. My interest in international development studies has taught me how the micro, meso and macro level are interconnected in the reproduction but also contestation of oppressive systems such as neoliberal capitalism, white supremacy/Western neocolonialist hegemony and the Anthropocene. By corollary, the personal is political and collective action is key to social change.\n\nMy primary goal in life is to be an amplifier agent for grassroots movements advocating for self-liberation from oppressive systems premised on progressive imaginaries of (incremental) system change in addition to institutional change. Since I was 13 years old, I have been volunteering in various roles to acquire experience in activism, policy advice, research, project proposal writing, campaigning, lobbying, raising the awareness of the general public, applying for funds, and event management. Overall, I am very passionate about essentially every cause related to social, political and economic justice. This for me is a lifelong commitment to what I think is the right thing to do. In all my endeavors, I always intend to use my privileges to contribute to a world with radical empathy, equity and inclusivity. By the same token, I always try to decenter myself when appropriate to give latitude for manouevre to those who possess lived experience in facing the repercussions of oppressive systems.",

If implemented, Equal Trade could contribute to the dismantlement of modern slavery, the termination of labour exploitation, the prevention and resolution of resource conflicts, disincentivizing corruption, and the mitigation and adaptation to climate change on the African continent amongst other things. Repatriating a substantially higher percentage of profit could be used for productive reinvestment in domestic industries, sectors and companies to buttress the capacity for economic self-sufficiency and thus support economic sovereignty. Also it would allow for more public expenditure on government services such as healthcare, social security programs, income support, and education.\n\nMy primary task is communicating the mission of the ETA by written word to different audiences such as politicians, lobbyists, NGO professionals, activists, academics, students and corporate actors. To support this primary objective, I am responsible for writing project proposals and funding requests.",

If implemented, Equal Trade could contribute to the dismantlement of modern slavery, the termination of labour exploitation, the prevention and resolution of resource conflicts, disincentivizing corruption, and the mitigation and adaptation to climate change on the African continent amongst other things. Repatriating a substantially higher percentage of profit could be used for productive reinvestment in domestic industries, sectors and companies to buttress the capacity for economic self-sufficiency and thus support economic sovereignty. Also it would allow for more public expenditure on government services such as healthcare, social security programs, income support, and education.\n\nMy primary task is communicating the mission of the ETA by written word to different audiences such as politicians, lobbyists, NGO professionals, activists, academics, students and corporate actors.

The project took place on a Chinese primary school. The children we taught were 11 and 12. \n\nInitially, it was my intention to set up a dialogue between the children, my interpreter and me, but my interpreter shortly told me how Chinese children are not particularly accustomed to a more egalitarian modality of teaching such as in The Netherlands. She taught me how Chinese culture is more hierarchical and reverent towards authority than Dutch culture. Hence, it became more of a teacher-student methodology to impart the severity of climate change on students' conscience. This required some intercultural sensitivity and competence.\n\nWe talked about the culpability of corporations with concerns to climate change considering their profit-oriented business models aiming at maximum productivity. Also, we taught about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, ecosystems, (indigenous and poor) communities, (low-income) countries and the world.  \n\nWhen the children felt more comfortable with us, I asked them for their input on what they could do to counteract climate change. Then we started learning from each other about the methods one can employ as an individual to diminish one's ecological footprint. \n\nWhat's more, we engaged in fun games impersonating animals threatened by climate change for example. Additionally, I learned about a garbage separation plan the local authorities were implementing a month later at the time. Me and my interpreterer therefore came up with fun games to make children more familiar with this mode of garbage separation. It was a wonderful experience and the children were very smart!"

Our students were made interlocutors in a cross-cultural comparison of the structural violence precipitated by colonialism, enslavement and white supremacy. We listened to the experiences of our students with racism, colourism, classism, LGBTQI+-phobia, misogyny and sexism as the violent implications of Brazil's history of colonialism and enslavement.  \n\nSubsequently, we tried to show how the structure of white supremacy for instance is a universal phenomenon given the expansionist agenda of historical colonizers. We talked about the knowledge we have on our countries violent pasts and the contemporary ramifications affecting the oppressed. \n\nIn the final stage of the project, we thought about little things you can do to address forms of oppression, to protect each other and to come together to spread a counter-narrative. In addition, we focussed on anti-bullying efforts against colourism or homophobia for instance. \n\nAll in all, we did not only teach, but we also learned a lot about how to navigate your own privileges, how to listen to different perspectives, how to identify cross-cultural patterns and how to determine intersections.\n\nPresent-day, I am still in contact with some students of mine. Through WhatsApp and FaceTime I assist them with their English homework assignments. Also, we still discuss forms of oppression and the methods we can use together to combat it. "

Working on that as a base, me and my interpreter decided on themes for each week such as family, cultural differences and similarities between Indonesia and the Netherlands, and career dreams. Together with my interpreter we taught English classes. Prior to the start of the lessons, we often practiced our presentation to facilitate teamwork.\n\nIn addition, we organized a craft project at the primary school at which we had taught. Afterwards, we sold the handicrafts made by our students for a small price to pedestrians, who were interested in the stands we made to showcase our national culture. Eventally, the money that had been collected was donated to two local founders of an orphanage, who wanted to invest in a renovation project for the classrooms.\n\nLast but not least, I organized a couple of auxiliary lessons for high school girls in my neighbourhood, who had requested English tutoring. A couple of times the girls came to me, so I could assist them with their homework. In these tutor sessions, I spoke in elementary Indonesian to communicate with them and they would try to speak English with me. I helped them with exercises and assignments. \n\nSidenote: I still teach them through digital platforms like WhatsApp and Facetime. Also my pool of students has slightly expanded itself. I am still occasionally assisting high school and primary school children with their homework at the moment."

It was also required of me to think of and enact creative teaching methods like dance choreographies, songs and games for the children. Occasionally, I needed to feed children who were physically disabled."

We held presentations offering additional teaching material concerning topics involving the LGBTQI+-community. We organized Purple Friday, an annual day that entirely revolves around LGBTQI+ awareness raising, the importance of anti-bullying and solidarity through fun activities. Lastly, we attended national GSA conferences for LGBTQI+ high school students and their straight, cisgender allies to share ideas and discuss progress in terms of awareness and acceptance of sexual diversity and gender diveristy."

I have been honoured to assist the girls and founders of the project for the organization and execution of an event intended to break taboo topics and to remedy the loneliness that inevitably is bound to being silent on these topics. Many people turned up and shared their stories. \n\nFinally, we recorded a video in which I acted as an experience expert on these taboo topics. I shared my story and my tips and tricks for self-empowerment, opening up to others and recovery. The video was intended to show people in similar positions that they were not alone and could contact us if they wanted to talk about it."
