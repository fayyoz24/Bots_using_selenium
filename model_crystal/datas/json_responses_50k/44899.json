    "summary": "4+ years work experience in the construction industry, overlooking Mechanical, Electrical and other Building Services. I have been involved in numerous jobs around Europe working on commercial jobs (e.g office retail buildings, airport baggage hall upgrades) and Hyperscale DATA Centres.\nExperienced and have been heavily involved in the delivery, installation and start-up of MEP equipment, as well as overlooking the design, installation, commissioning and handover of MEP works in projects.\n\nI have expressed a great interest in the practical end of engineering, working with teams, assignments and projects. I'm an energetic, eager and highly dynamic individual who builds strong relationships within teams and with peers. I am an accomplished communicator with a creative and innovative mentality while completing targets/objectives under pressure within time frames. I'm keen to learn from others and improve my skills to support me through my engineering career and wish to excel and demonstrate that further within other organisations.",
