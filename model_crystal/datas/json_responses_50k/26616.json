    "summary": "Being an international student in the Netherlands has lead me to embrace qualities of my character that are advantageous for every young person. Traveling around the world and being a part of many different environments showcased my independency as an adult, my responsibility and my leadership skills, that guided me through being successful in no matter what task I am carrying out. Water Management remains my biggest passion, because of how multifunctional the specialty is. There is a magnificent importance in working with nature which as a consequence affects the well-being of the present and future society. I believe that sustainable development is the term of the millennium and that humans should focus on it more often. My ambition is to contribute to the world global reinforcement with everything I have gained as a background and fully dedicate myself in spreading and gaining more knowledge, engaging as many people as I possibly can with my mission.",

My main responsibilities were taking care of the tender documents used for public procurement, as well as organising meetings with stakeholders and suppliers of the company. Moreover, I had the opportunity to prove myself as a HR manager in crucial situations, despite my status as an intern. This period gave me confidence, by improving my analytical skills, as well as my overall work ethics.",
