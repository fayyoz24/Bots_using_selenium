I have learned how to set realistic goals for our team and find sales strategies. \nFrom March to July (which was mostly during the sales period) I was a \"marketing manager\". This period involved marketing campaigns and promotions on Social media, direct selling and our website.\n-\nResults:\nThe ROI (return on investment) was 11.5% for all our shareholders.

Luckily my students all passed the pre-master and have done a great job, making my mentorship very smooth and a nice contribution to their student life. I learned how to motivate people in uncertain times, how to help them get clarity on their own thoughts and doubts, how to clarify complex tasks as part of courses and how to make sure they live a good life while studying hard.
