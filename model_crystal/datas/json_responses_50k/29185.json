Supporting a range of projects from city-scale masterplanning, flood risk management to urban water management, I focused on the use of green infrastructure to provide natural spaces for people that were rich in biodiversity and provided key sustainable water management function such as flood attenuation and water quality improvement. In this role I was part of a multidisciplinary team working with communities, stakeholders, regulators, and academia to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) into urban development in the UK.",
