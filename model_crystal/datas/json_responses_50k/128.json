    "summary": "Welcome to my profile where you will see and realize that besides being a passionate and creative professional with skills in research, teaching and collaborative work, I also develop in other domains of life. \n\nYou will also notice that not all professionals have the opportunity to exercise their degree in a single, linear, defined way, but they still can be up-to-date, professional, be open to learn different things, bring different/diverse/refreshing ideas and they never stop living up to their own standards of honesty, dignity and kindness. \n\nProfessionally, I like to work in challenging environments, with people from different sociocultural\ncontexts and in the clinical-social and educational research fields to achieve innovative synergies. I also advocate for work spaces with high psychological safety. This is, spaces where actions speak louder than words, and there is absolute respect and encouragement for Self-determination and Individual/Collective Dignity. \n\nMy main topics of interest in research are: human psychopathology, psychological development, education,  co-creation, social determinants of health, meta-analysis, human rights, fascism and ideologies influences in daily life. \n\nFor academic writing: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paula-Quijano-2 <<< \nBi-annual in Innsbruck as Aurora student Ambassador: https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/bi-annual-in-innsbruck \n\nEnjoy the reading \u00dc.",

I was selected to join a 2 months training that allowed me to get a grasp of the basics on theoretical and practical matters of teaching and pedagogy in the Colombian context (rural & urban). \n\n----- Socio-Economic context----\nAfter receiving my degree as a professional in Psychology (a degree that truthly educated me, and also allows me to move further in education, companies, research, counseling, etc), I went on exploring professional options that would allow me to do something meaningful and travel. While actively job-hunting as a Psychologist, I also applied to different positions to be a teacher, one of my dearest dreams.\nAs is well known by all, teaching is an underpaid job in many places, and in Colombia this is not the exception. Even though I was willing to take a teaching job in a remote place, with a salary significantly lower than the minimum wage, being a Psychologist without much professional experience (although this program seeks to give an entry to the work-world to many) was problematic and I did not get many offers to join a school. The reason? Some cannot see (not their fault) what a Psychologist can offer to education beyond diagnosis and tests. I was not the only one that did not got fair offers. Others took whatever was there in hope the conditions would improve in the future. \nAt the end, I decided to continue seeking job in my main area with the hope I would find many other ways to teach.",
