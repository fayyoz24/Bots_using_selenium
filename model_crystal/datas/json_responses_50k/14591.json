I am responsible for the development of joint business plans for the various categories working in close collaboration with the category manager and customer marketers to ensure an optimal integrated promotional plan whilst managing promotional investment. Communication with the field operations team and providing clear direction is pivotal, as well as constant follow-up to ensure the delivery of objectives as per agreement. My customer interactions also include the negotiating of trading terms, trade funding and managing the overall customer investment by category whilst monitoring customer performance, contribution and market shares. Dealing with Shoprite afforded me the privilege of a forward planning structured account and having looked after Massmart/Walmart which traditionally was less structured and more complex given the decentralised model has challenged me to be quite reactive and quick to make conscious decisions, however the greatest learning from both are if you build a trusting relationship that is mutually beneficial built on sound business understanding the job is a pleasure",
