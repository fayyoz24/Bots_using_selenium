    "summary": "Currently a combustion scientist in the Major Hazards Management Team based at ETCA - Energy Transition Complex Amsterdam). I provide expertise in thermally-/shock-induced ignition hazards, flame propagation, acceleration, transition to detonation, detonation dynamics and explosions. Previously, a CNRS Charg\u00e9 de Recherche (HDR) at the PPrime Institute (Poitiers, FRA) in the Fluides, Thermique et Combustion Department - Axe D\u00e9tonique working on fundamental and applied combustion research including shock-/thermal-ignition, flame acceleration, DDT, detonative propulsion, chemical kinetics, and Hydrogen safety. Held a Senior Postdoctoral Scholar in Aerospace at Caltech (Pasadena, CA USA) from Jan 2014-Nov 2017. I received my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Calgary in Canada in 2012, and worked as a heavy oil researcher for Royal Dutch Shell (Aug 2012- Dec 2013) in the same city before going to Caltech. While my research experience is primarily in CFD and analytical modeling of reacting flows I am always working very closely with experimentalists.",
