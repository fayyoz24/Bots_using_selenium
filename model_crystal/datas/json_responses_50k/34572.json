    "summary": "Sound & Music and sound is the core of everything I do. As an audio engineer I specialise in recording engineering, mixing and editting. I am also a proficient mastering engineer, audio post producer and video editor. This skillset means I can make almost any AV project a reality from start to finish.\n\nAfter gaining my bachelor of recording arts the school of audio engineering (SAE) in Amsterdam hired me as one of there audio staff members. After training audio students for 9 years and fulfilling various roles within the institute I now manage one of the top 10 recording studios in Amsterdam as well as operate 2 audio business; 20Twelve Audio and Audio Held.\n\n20Twelve is my first company I started back in, you guessed it 2012. Though its composition and mission have altered over time its main role is to provide freelance audio production services of the highest standard. Audio Held is my podcast editing company and with it I have edited and mixed more than 1500 episodes in a timespan of around 3 years. \n\n",

Our intern Chris has a good relation with the Dutch army and thus far we have been able to record and capture many valuable sounds such as .50 Cal machineguns, anti tank mines, Howitzer Artillery and man other weapon systems. Our aim is to have a proper recording for all systems available within the Dutch borders.",

Apart from the design of the rooms I have completed the entire setup of the studio together with the help of the SAE team. Now I maintain the high quality standard in the studio and coordinate the elite SAE students who engineer in the RBSA as regular interns. RBSA has seen some of the biggest names in the music world which is good for Red Bull as a brand and even more so for the experience of my engineers.",
