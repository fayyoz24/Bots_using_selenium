    "summary": "As an Account/Sales Manager, I have developed a keen eye for business opportunities and enjoy investing in solid long term relationships with clients and suppliers. Experience proves that creating long-lasting partnerships is more effective than winning a one time sales pitch. Being customer focussed and good at working in different cultural settings, I also like to be a team player and a trouble shooter. It is my ultimate challenge to set up profitable long term customer relationships. International projectmanagement was my step up to several commercial positions.\nSkills: Sales, marketing, customer loyalty, retail, logistics, export, project management and customer service",
