TOGETHER is the key word! Such collabs could subsequently decrease unnecessary obstacles & positively contribute to a decent future for all with respect to our planet. \n\nThe last 8 years I have been analyzing entrepreneurial-ecosystems & initiating support structures in various African, European and Middle East cities through our Dutch Embassies with the support of multinational companies, universities & organizations & of course my team (14).  \n\nIn addition to that I have been working on the development of a ''Meaningful Youth Participation Toolkit'' for our Ministry to ensure the voices of youth are heard and incorporated in our foreign policies & program's. \n\nCurrently I am working on the development of a global TVET & Higher Education program. I firmly believe that education is THE foundation for a prosperous and equitable society. \n\nMy aim is to gain additional understanding of strategic details of: educational & entrepreneurial ecosystems, system changes, youth, innovation & policies, private sector development & engagement, diplomacy, urban planning, climate resilience and adaptation in order to plan for the future.\n\nMy objective is to combine practice with research & apply knowledge into policies & program's that have a long term sustainable impact & strengthen the relations between the various actors with a positive output for people & planet.
