    "summary": "Logistics professional with over 15 years of experience in full-time roles, and an independent entrepreneur since late 2022. My career journey has encompassed various logistics functions, including sales, tender, and project management. Throughout this time, I have successfully concluded more than 100 projects and tenders, maintaining an impressive success ratio of +35%. With a distinctive specialization in airfreight, sea freight, and road transportation, I have focused on serving governments and non-governmental organizations with shipments to challenging destinations such as Mali, Central Africa, Afghanistan, Haiti, and Iraq.\n\nMy strategy for achieving annual profit margin increases of at least 10% goes beyond just streamlining processes. I have proven that my skills in commercial writing and tactical proposal presentation also significantly contribute to business success. By combining my expertise with the ability to craft compelling proposals and offers, I have driven the growth of my client portfolio and built valuable partnerships. In my capacity as a self-employed entrepreneur, I am leveraging this versatile experience to oversee implementation projects. I am committed to further refining and sharing my multifaceted knowledge as I assist my clients in achieving their goals. Together, let's strive for new heights of success!",
