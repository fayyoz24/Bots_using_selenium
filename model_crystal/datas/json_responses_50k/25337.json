This defines sites as being strategic, critical, and simply a supply site.  Those sites requiring expansion need to be identified and planned for as do those sites that are a candidate for closure.  My position works with the Business Units (BU) to identify and find new sites that are sometimes single BU and sometimes multi BU to support sales growth in developing regions of the globe.\n\nThe 5 Business Units should be motivated and driven towards Operational Excellence which will be accomplished via Shared metrics, Personnel development, and Process improvement.\n\nFinally, Akzo Nobel insists on having Sustainable Operations which are Safe and World Class in being Eco-sensitive as measured on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.",
