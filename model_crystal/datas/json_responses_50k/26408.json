I have grown from the person actually performing these activities to introducing the Deloitte team members and managing the process.  In this respect, progress of the project, commitment of the persons involved and quality assurance are my main responsibilities.\n\nSupply chain management:\nMy projects included a supply chain restructuring whereby the production of the goods was shifted from various jurisdictions worldwide to one location in the Far East.  This included a complete new business set-up and model of doing business worldwide using one central entrepreneur.  Our team has assisted the indirect tax feasibility study as well coordination of defining all compliance obligations for 13 countries.  This included VAT, customs duty calculation, customs and VAT optimization procedures, high level legal requirements and the draft set-up of a process manual to incorporate this in the international organization. My role was a combination of controlling the quality of the content as well as supervising the project and the coordination with the client.",

I have worked in the Rotterdam office until June 2007. \n\nIn June 2007 I shifted to the Amsterdam office.  The reason for this shift was, amongst others, that all Customs & Global Trade specialists working in the Amsterdam office had left Deloitte.  Furthermore, the new indirect tax partner in the Amsterdam office provided me the possibility to focus more on the processes and business needs of companies. As a result of starting up a new group in the Amsterdam office, I worked very closely together with the indirect tax (VAT) specialists.",
