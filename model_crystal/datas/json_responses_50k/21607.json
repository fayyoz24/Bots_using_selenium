A serious game is a game, in this case designed for a smartphone, that is not only designed to entertain but also to educate.\n\nThe target audience were kids 8-14 years old in Kenia and the game was designed for a low end smartphone. To some, developing for a smartphone in Kenia would seem like a strange idea but the smartphone ownership is growing much faster in Kenia as compared to the computer ownership.\n\nIn the test phase of the development Jouke and I travelled to Kisumu, Kenia to test the games with the target audience at several schools. The visits to the schools were arranged by our partner organisation Help Heal in Kisumu. The feedback was used to further develop our game called Usafi Kisumu (clean Kisumu).",

I worked and lived there for three months, the primary activity was the 'accueil du group'; the hosting of groups. The groups ranged in age from 10 to 21 and the size of the groups was around ten children. Multiple groups were from Paris and had some behavioral issues and were not adapted to the rural environment of Montendre, this was challenging but also very interesting and I managed well to connect with the groups and to make the most of their vacations.\n\nDuring the week that we would host a group, in the morning we did workshops and in the afternoon leisure and cultural activities. The workshops ranged from cultivating the grounds around the house (for later consumption) to building toys with bamboo, stone carving and constructing a tree house. \n\nHosting the group also involved cooking for everybody and keeping the house proper. All these activities were done together with the kids. The weeks with the groups were sometimes tiring but overall very enjoyable and enriching.\n\nThe team of hosts of which i was part ranged from 17 to 25 and consisted of many different nationalities. Working together in this multicultural group was very inspiring and helped me a lot to develop my teamwork and communication skills. To work together with people from different cultures and sometimes not (or only a very little bit) having a language in common challenged me to think different and connect in new ways.\n"
