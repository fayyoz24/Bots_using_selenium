    "summary": "I create digital resources for autistic children and am passionate about providing support and assistance for individuals with learning disabilities. I have also managed a team that launched and promoted 8 paid educational apps in the AppStore with more than 25,000 downloads globally. I have a well-rounded experience in product development and management, digital design and digital marketing of educational mobile apps. \n\nI'm a product Manager of Social Story Templates - a one-of-a-kind digital resource for free personalisable social stories to help autistic & neurodivergent children deal with everyday situations. Social stories available online are very limited and not personalised to a child's needs. Using my tech background, I started developing social stories in digital format.  \n\nI now publish one social story every week, each story is about a general problem or challenging situation faced by children with learning disabilities These social stories are sent out as an email newsletter, which already has many subscribers that include parents of autistic children, SENCOs, Speech and Language therapists, Occupational therapists etc.\n\nMy vision is to make these social stories readily accessible to every parent of a child with any form of learning disability and enable them to easily personalise the stories to suit their child's needs.\n\nAs a Co-founder of Dripl, I have also been part of the team that built, launched and promoted citizenship test apps for the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The British citizenship app \u201cLife in the UK Untangled\u201d ranked 7th in the Apple Store within the first 3 months of its launch. I am a migrant. I'm super proud that I played a part in helping 25,000 migrants, just like myself, secure their citizenship through this app.\n\nAt Dripl, I hired & managed a team of freelance writers to develop the content for Canadian and Australian citizenship apps. To ensure smooth sailing I set up efficient work assignment, management and reporting processes. For prompt, cost-effective results I proactively learned skills like recording and editing short videos, creating digital assets and social media campaigns. Other times, I felt the need for a more structured approach. For example, I enrolled in a web development boot camp to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as a boot camp for digital marketing. \n\nIt is my aim to create a more inclusive society by equipping parents with accessible and personalised resources for the unique needs of children with learning disabilities.",
