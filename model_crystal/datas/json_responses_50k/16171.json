My experience ranges from molecular biology to cell culture (including IPSC-derived and primary cells), to super-resolution 3D microscopy and animal work. I find problem-solving stimulating, and I strive to be a self-sufficient professional, so I can efficiently tackle different challenges to best support my team. My main interests are human health and disease, and alternative food sources.\nCurrently, I am looking for a new challenge and growth opportunity",
