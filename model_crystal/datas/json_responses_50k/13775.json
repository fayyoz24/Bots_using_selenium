    "summary": "My passion lies in the interaction between user and software. It has governed my education and career choices ever since I started my education in Web Science (a bachelor program that combines the fields of Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction). I was one of the first in the world to earn a Bachelor degree in this field, and was later awarded a cum laude Masters degree in Computer Science & Engineering tailored to user interaction as well.\n\nMy research as a PhD and Postdoc researcher focuses on the interpretability aspect of Machine Learning, enabling experts to understand the predictions of complex black-box models. I develop visualization techniques that combine the recent advancements of model explanations, with high-level visual analytics solutions. This work is carried out in close collaboration with Rabobank and Achmea insurances.\n\nNext to my academic career, I have got a strong background in industry, bootstrapping various startups, amongst which one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges of Europe and a top-ranked messaging app for iOS. UI/UX design has played a vital role in these positions.",
