    "summary": "\u2018Trust that little voice in your head that says: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be interesting if ..?\u201d And then do it. | So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the Safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. \u2013 Duane Michals | Mark Twain \n\nThis combination of words largely form the compass that I thoughtfully use to give direction to my lifepath. Preferably off-road, as pioneering, going somewhere nobody ever went before, is an essential driving force. Authenticity, passion, exploration, dedication and development are my core values. My fascination for learning new things, my broad range of interests and desire for going in-depth, have led me to gain many different (work) experiences and skills.\n\nThe (societal) mission that I strive for is to largely contribute to the development of harmony between people and the planet. I believe that this can be reached by creating consciousness, and with that respect, and general understanding amongst people about the functioning of the earth as a system, the importance of a healthy planet and the way towards this. Also, I am training with high ambition towards my goals as both a triathlete and speedskater.\n\nMy ultimate (life) goal is to use my role as a professional athlete, and the corresponding exposure, to contribute to the creation of (a consciousness and understanding about a sustainable, healthy and safe planet.\n\nIf you believe we are on the same path or if you feel like sharing a coffee for some mutual inspiration, feel free to send me a message. I am also open for collaborations and ambassadorships with sustainable organisations and companies with regards to my earth focussed athletic careers.\n\nProfessional activities: Research on climate related topics, educating about the planet and sustainability, column writing, photography and graphic design",
