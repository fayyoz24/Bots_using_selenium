    "summary": "Music is what I always pursued, and despite being a tough one to achieve, I\u2019m very close to where I always dreamed, and the journey it takes is the most beautiful thing, as it taught me how to be persistent, patient, and disciplined. I\u2019m that kind of person. When I want something, it will happen. \n\nI spent three years working as a Media Assistant in TBWA Advertising company (Buenos Aires) working together with brands like Nivea, BMW and Heineken. Later on I decided to travel to improve my language and musical skills and had a variety of jobs in different countries like Ireland, New Zealand and now the Netherlands.\nNow, after being working in hospitality for the past 5 years, the pandemic forced me to make a change in my life and direct it in another way, in which I could combine my experience with advertisement and the skills I learned during my 8 years of traveling, like planning and development, relationship management, communication, and of course, Music!\n\nIn the field of Marketing my specialties include Media planning, monitor media plans, reports, billing and research.\nIn the field of Music my specialties are Guitar and Singing, composition, audio recording, edition and mixing.",
