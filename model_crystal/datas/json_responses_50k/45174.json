Being part of their SIE team I was tasked with installing the most advanced EUV photo lithography systems at ASML customer locations all over the world. The role involves a lot of problem solving, structured & sequenced work method, organisation, working in a clean room environment, managing a shift work life style and extended periods of travel. Experience has also be gained at working on high power CO2 laser systems & optics, working with vacuum systems, control of hazardous gases and plasma qualification. There was been a steep learning curve but it greatly improved my hands on skills as an engineer as well as my working knowledge in the semi-conductor industry. It was very rewarding to work with such an international team.  \n\nChallenges include:\nSystem Integration, testing & Validation.\n\nTrouble shooting & data analytics of varied issues across a complex system of multiple disciplines from: Mechanical, Optics, Vacuum systems & software\n\nImplementation, participation & completion of projects in both technical and structural areas.\n\nAid in the move of EUV lithographic process from a new developing technology to mainstream production.",
