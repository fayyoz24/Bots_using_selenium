They are responsible for the quality & quantity of the retail offering in the cities in the province. They found that there are several challenges for mid-sized cities & their city centres: aging, changing consumer behaviour, internet retailers and a change in how we live, work & recreate. All this causes a high percentage of empty, vacant retail space, upwards from 15% to 30% in some cities. Their ambition is to bring this vacancy down to 6%. During several meetings, a target group was defined to focus on when it comes to solutions. They are the visitors & customers of the future and it is for them that we want to make our inner cities attractive again. The commission is aware that each city will have a unique context and subsequently, unique challenges and opportunities. The challenge was to come up with ideas to attract youngsters to the city centers, which can be adapted to cities sized 60.000-80.000 inhabitants throughout Limburg.",
