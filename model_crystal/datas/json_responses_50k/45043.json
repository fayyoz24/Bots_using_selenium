To test my hypothesis, I studied the agriculture of Sub-Saharan Africa, where gender equality is used a tool to increase the workers' independent access to capital and transform the most severely food insecure population into the stakeholders of resilient food supplies. What can the rest of the world learn from Sub-Saharan Africa? \n\nKey words: food security, agricultural capital, gender equality in Uganda; Sustainable Development Goals, structural, cultural and direct gender-based violence, cycle of poverty, gender yield gaps\n\nThis essay is a world study of Global Politics and Geography, two subjects I did not study in IB. Allowing a student to investigate a subject outside of their expertise is always a great risk for EE supervisors. Allowing a science student to inquire in two humanities outside of her curriculum - that is something unheard of in UWCSEA East before this project. Made possible by two outstanding women, the EE coordinator Uzay Ashton and my essay's supervisor Melanie Wilson, this essay is my tribute towards the prosperous future brought by gender equality. \n\nThank you, Ms Wilson and Ms Ashton! \n\n[Please contact me to view the publication]",

Yet, this job that urged me to adapt to a fast changing environment, prioritise, and manage time under pressure. \n\nI found purpose in the manual labour through human-interaction: be it comforting a client who is distressed by the fancy ambiance of the beauty salon, making their favourite beverage, entertaining their children; or abandoning my direct duties to rush for a lunch takeaway for hairdressers with packed schedules. Surrounded by adults who are immersed in brutal everyday and childish dreams, I grasped the importance of taking care of one another in little things. Putting the extra time to fold and perfectly align all kinds of towels in the hairdressers' and the cosmetologists' favourite ways, housekeeping a master's drawer according to their holy instrument arrangement.\n\nThe urge to complete everything on time and well made the job feel like a computer science lesson. \nHow do to convert a mixed pile of dried towels into folded columns, so that the towels have no crumbs and match by colour? Remember, ironing is lengthy and you can only fold one towel at a time, not fast enough for towels not to crumple under the pile's weight. \n\nSolution: \n1. Get a few chairs around: each for a unique towel cover.\n2. Open the dryer.\nRepeat\n3. Take a towel out and hang it flat on the back of its respective chair.\nUntil\n4. The dryer is empty.\nFor i = 1 to n [insert the number of sorted smooth piles]   \n5. Fold a towel and add it to its respective column on a shelf.\nEnd!\n\nEventually, I developed an algorithm for every duty operation and accounted for the inconsistent client traffic. In times of calm, I sorted and arranged the different types of cups and other barista supplies, so that their reachability is proportional to the percentage frequency of use. The precious time it saved me when 7 coffees and 3 teas are due at the same time.\n\nI am proud of my first job with a mop (^.^)_/ !",
