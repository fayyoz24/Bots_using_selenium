    "summary": "In a world of disruption and rapid change, it can be challenging to balance the need for short-term results with long-term sustainability goals. To meet these challenges, we need innovative solutions and new technologies that we can cleverly connect. But, in my opinion it must be approached integrally, not from one technique, one project, or one building, but rather by connecting all technological components and people involved -  to maximize their impact and efficiency.\n\nI am constantly seeking ways to innovate and contribute to the acceleration of green initiatives. In such a manner that smart buildings have the potential to play a major role in the transition towards a more sustainable future, and I am excited to be a part of this exciting field. Whether through the development of new products or the integration of existing solutions and services, I am committed to helping organizations create smarter, more energy-efficient buildings that are better for the environment and the people who use them.\n\nAt Kieback&Peter, I am learning to work with data analysis and IoT in order to design and implement these customized smart building solutions with integrated services. These solutions often involve the creation of dashboards that allow clients to access hard-to-reach insights and generate innovative solutions. Additionally, I am involved in the early stages of new projects for outlining of CO2-roadmaps for improving their sustainability.\n\nA broad but technical background in sustainability, coupled with my strong analytical and teamworking skills, has enabled me to excel in projects currently focused on smart energy measurement systems. Through various extracurricular activities and managerial experiences, I have honed my ability to work effectively in teams and have developed strong critical thinking and communication skills. My analytical approach and proactive attitude make me well-suited to tackling complex challenges, and I enjoy brainstorming and problem-solving with all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe work we do at Kieback&Peter delivers both short-term and long-term value as we help our clients reinvent themselves and become future-proof through smart building solutions. True digital transformation requires enhancing the smart-oriented capabilities of our products and services, and I am excited to be a part of this journey. While constantly developing myself, my goal is to inspire others to embrace sustainability and innovation. I believe that by working together, we can create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.",

I learned to build complicated planning\u2019s in challenging times like COVID-lockdowns, Christmas and Easter with excessive numbers of customers and high total product volumes. \n\nFurthermore, I redesigned the overall process in-store and supply-chain design in February 2020. We took the centralized technical theory\u2019s, provided by the head office as starting point and used is as a basis for redesigning the store process and inventory management. With my manager we totally rethought the daily logistical activities and internal store operations. We adjusted this continually and re-evaluated in order to achieve an even tighter planning with an improved productivity. With the ever changing budgetary challenges and restrictions in mind, I still try to analyse to optimising processes for more efficient operations every week.\n\nDuring the last two years I grew more into a senior management role and developed strong communication skills. Providing team and individual feedback and learned to delegate more to the younger and newer team members. I became better at viewing things from a helicopter view with a visionary end goal in mind. Therefore learning to set short term goals and priorities to achieve the bigger target.",

This research aimed to highlight the value of such simulations by utilizing real building data.\n\nThe ecoSimulation-tool makes use of Digital Twin cloud-technology (derived from ecoBuilding) and is the digital representation of the building for which the impact of energy saving measures is investigated. The Digital Twin uses artificial intelligence in combination with long term weather forecasts and building usage to evaluate and strategically predict the energy-flows. The research provided insight into the technical systematics, differences in interests at play, what an MVP should meet and what the roadmap could look like for the (further) development of ecoSimulation. \n\nThe research project 'Improving energy efficiency for stakeholders in the office building real estate market an ecoSimulation case' was graded with a 8,5.",

In return our students were keen on entering into broad discussions with the companies about issues that relate to the topic of the study. We are projecting to visit inspiring companies in the field of Sustainable Energy, Healthcare & Life Sciences, Financial Investing and Digital Innovation ranging from start-ups to large corporates."
