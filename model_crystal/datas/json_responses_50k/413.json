    "summary": "My vision is to combine unique music experiences with beautiful places to bring awareness about the heritage, art and culture of our world. I want to raise emotions through these audiovisual events, to arouse appreciation and to build sustainable relations between visitors and their environment. Moreover to bring people together and to indicate that we should support each other.\n\nI already collected expertise in tourism, marketing and events especially during my apprenticeship as management assistant for tourism and leisure, but also during my previous jobs and internships in the leisure industry in Germany, where I am originally from.\n\nI also benefit from my interest in international relations and intercultural communication and behavior and gained first experiences during my marketing internship in M\u00e1laga, Spain or my current study as leisure and event manager in Breda, Netherlands.  \n\nMy key skills are social media marketing and sustainable project management but also my positive mindset is always an advantage. I am organized, curious, enthusiastic, flexible and I like to be part of a team.\n\nBeside that I am an activist for Viva con Agua. I want to inspire people to do good for the world and to show how easy and fun it can be. Moreover I like to travel, photo- and videography.\n\n",
