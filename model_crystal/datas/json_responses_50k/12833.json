As a business partner we created a new support and service company EDBR (Energy Diensten Bedrijf Rivierenland), to balance and optimize the energy production, use and storage at different levels in the energy system (households, street or district, regional, national levels). Technology and infrastructure assets will be combined in a new governance approach to yield supportive tools and services for both consumers as well as business partners.",

We create a community of GP's, nurses, doctors and specialists, who, together with the home carers, share information and help high quality care, without going to a hospital. With technical support tools, wearable sensors to monitor continuous health, sharing information with a user friendly and safe communication platform, we try to organize integrated care in the best possible ways, over the boundaries of first- third health care organisations and we will try to prove the cost efficiency of real outcome based care.

BriteN develops a series of products: a  biomarker toolkit, to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional interventions, a translational Technology platform to study and monitor cognitive and metabolic development in animals, children and adults, intelligent and functional home cages and effective monitoring tasks, serious games and experience sampling to monitor the early development of spatial cognitive performance. With all these products we hope to get a better (mechanistic) understanding of the potential and functionality of nutritional ingredients and diets with respect to cognitive and metabolic development.",

It may however also serve as a fall back solution in dense populated areas, where the energy net is not fully equipped for heavy peaks in the energy demand as a result of demanding data-processing, or where crucial functions need to secured with a flexible back up system.

Products that are developed are a self care portal with personalized health and diagnostic data and treatment plans + advices, a medicin cabinet with feed back system and personalized apps, physical trainers with applied games and virtual reality in combination with health monitoring feed back and applied games to stimulate cognitive health, again with personalized feed back. With this set of support we aim  to create a platform where the quality of care and health impact is monitored. This can lead to a optimized treatment plan, with high impact on health treatment to be insured.  Overall, the project aims to reduce health care costs by optimizing between several health care treatments and products and avoiding hospitalization. ParkinsonNeXt  has the support of several insurance companies and is created out of the Foundation ParkinsonNet. The project is created with the financial support of GO-EFRO.  ",

In the technology development we combine and develop new chemical routes for chemical synthesis, radiolabeling and imaging techniques. By combination technology we aim to reduce the pre-screening by several orders of magnitude towards a few weeks. By reducing the number of probable candidates from a few thousand to a number of 10 - 100, we can reduce the cost of screening and drug development. The project is supported by GO-EFRO.",
