I prepared and participated the event as a director responsible for organising and managing the Dutch National Pavilion with the Global Contents Hall to maximise this theme.\n\nThe Dutch national government has been in full swing since the end of June 2014 with the joint support of the Korean festival organiser and the Dutch government (Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs) in order to proceed with the cooperation project after one year's preliminary preparation period.\n\nOn the first day of the festival, interest in various media such as radio, newspapers, magazines, and television has already been attracted to the Dutch Pavilion, and the issue of concern has been interpreted positively as a fresh design approach. This was the same for the general audience.\n\nMany of the contacts during the Seoul Design Festival broke the preconceived notion that the minds of Koreans would be conservative, and that they had a positive and positive attitude toward the ageing issue, It was an opportunity to experience. It was a valuable experience for Korean designers to have active interest in and activity on this social design.",
