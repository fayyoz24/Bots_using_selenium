    "summary": "I am an Asphalt Pavement Materials Engineer. I have 18 years research experience with a specific focus on asphalt materials, recycling technologies for asphalt pavement, self-healing systems for asphalt pavements and sustainable bio-based construction materials. I hold BEng and MPhil in Mechanical Engineering from Technological University Dublin (formaly known as Dublin Institute of Technology) and PhD in Civil/Mechanical Engineering from University College Dublin. I have a solid publication record and to date have been awarded > \u20ac1M in research funding and \u20ac67,000 in funding for teaching and laboratory activities. Between January 2015 and December 2016 I held a Marie Curie IEF Fellowship hosted by TU Delft. After returning to Ireland in January 2017 I have taken a post at Technological University Dublin as Strategic Research Proposal Coordinator within university Research, Enterprise and Innovation Department. I was responsible for promotion of research within the university and assisting academics with their national and international research funding applications. In 2019 I was awarded an Enterprise Ireland Commercialisation Funding to enable the commercialisation of a self-healing system for asphalt pavements. Project run from November 2019 until March 2021. The commercialisation is currently paused while technology validation is in the progress. In 2020 I was  awarded a MSCA Individual Fellowship for a project entitled: \u2018Advanced Solutions for Asphalt Pavements (ASAP)\u2019, with TNO as host institution and TU Delft as a partner. Project started on 1st September 2021 and will run until September 2023. ASAP project focuses on investigation and design of an alternative (bio) asphalt binder rejuvenator. I have supervised undergraduate, Masters and PhD research projects in TU Delft and have contributed to PhD supervision in UCD and TU Delft. My long term career goal is to become an entrepreneur and to introduce innovative and disruptive technology to the asphalt pavement industry.\u200b",

The SHARP project aims to develop a unique self-healing technology for asphalt pavements, whereby the encapsulated rejuvenator within the asphalt mix is used as the healing catalyst. Researchers at TU Delft have pioneered this technology by successfully developing a rejuvenator encapsulation method that thermally and mechanically survives the asphalt production process. Despite progress to date, the functionality of this self-healing technology remains unknown and as a result, self-healing technology is not accepted as standard within the road industry. The SHARP project builds on the TU Delft research to translate self-healing technology for asphalt pavements from theory into practice. \nThe project has five key objectives, to:\ni) select the most suitable, commercially available, healing agent, with emphasis on ecologically friendly \u2018green\u2019 rejuvenators,\nii) develop various encapsulation techniques combined with different capsule release techniques,\niii) develop a numerical model for simulating the release of healing agent from the capsule and its diffusion into binder in order to optimise the size, amount and distribution of the capsule,\niv) design an asphalt mix containing encapsulated healing agent and investigate its mechanical properties and\nv) plan the transfer of technology from laboratory to field testing.\n\nSHARP project website: http://atabakovic.wix.com/sharp01",

                    "description": "As a postdoctoral researcher in UCD my key responsibility was the management and further development of a research programme within the Transport Laboratory. This included: developing research ideas, investigating funding possibilities and developing industrial and inter-institutional collaborations. I also coordinated the preparation and submission of number of research funding proposals to the EU (7th Framework funding), National Roads Authority (NRA) and Enterprise Ireland. I was responsible for every aspect of these proposals including developing research consortia, compiling literature reviews, budget planning and coordinating information sharing between industrial and academic project partners.\n\nI also co-supervised two PhD projects, one MSc project and several undergraduate final year projects annually. My role was to assist students with laboratory aspects of their work, helping them to organise their experimental programme, troubleshooting, data collection and interpretation and reporting.\n\nIn terms of teaching in UCD, I have delivered several undergraduate lectures in the School of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering. I was also involved in a project which presented the laboratory components of the civil engineering course to students via a series of videos. The videos were made available to students via Blackboard (UCDs virtual learning environment) to facilitate their understanding of pavement design and management. I was responsible for every aspect of the project, including drafting and submitting the funding application (UCD seed funding), writing the video scripts, recording the videos and voice overs, editing the videos using final cut software, and finally, uploading the videos onto Blackboard.\n\nMuch of the academic administration dimension of the post has involved the co-ordination of an eight month work placement for fourth year students on the Structural Engineering with Architecture degree course.",

I led on a research project which involved the examination of the structural integrity of a crystal ball, which was displayed in Time Square, New York. Specifically, the project examined the structural integrity of the glass panels - manufactured by Waterford Crystal - when subjected to extreme weather conditions. The analysis was conducted using ABAQUS finite element software. I also designed laboratory programme for testing the structural integrity of the crystal panels and the effectiveness of its fastening system. The tests were conducted in the UCD Mechanical Engineering Laboratories.  Another project which I was involved in involved the design of a fastening system for a space shuttle ventilation box, research which was undertaken on behalf of the European Space Agency. My work as Development Engineer also involved preparation of contract proposals, report writing, team working and liaising with industrial clients.",
