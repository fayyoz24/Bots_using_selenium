The tunnel has two (traffic) pipes and is currently not equipped with a middle tunnel channel (MTK). \nTo enable the tunnel to comply with the National Tunnel Standard (LTS), it will be renovated. The work required for this purpose relates to civil engineering work such as the construction of a middle-tunnel channel and the renovation of the tunnel technical installations.\n\nRisk inventory based on risk sessions, preparations of safety plan and safety files (Integral Safety plan), substantiate and motivate design choices (structural, technical and organizational).\nPerforming of a contra expertise on asbestos research, research on chromium VI and other possible pollutions in dust and coatings.\n",

Most of the content consist of incineration ash (IA) and non-incinerable waste (NIW). Asbestos and treated industrial waste (TIW) are also being landfilled in varying quantities at certain cells. Due to the presence of asbestos, advice was given about the risk factors and control measures to be taken to prevent the spread and exposure to asbestos. A work plan has been drawn up, and employees are trained to recognize the risks and to apply the correct control measures.",

                    "description": "The new Metro project is mainly constructed underground beneath the Central Station and the historical centre of Amsterdam, and is divided in several subcontracts with international and national contractors. The metro line has a length of 9.7 km and was built with several kinds of construction techniques. It consists of an emerged tunnel, drilled tunnels, in situ tunnels, merged caissons, bridges, deep stations with diaphragm walls. During the construction several foreign companies were involved; communication took place in Dutch, English or German language. The activities performed can be summarized as follows:\n- Audits and safety inspections at all construction sites of the subway line;\n- Adaptation and implementation of a safety management system;\n- Review of work plans of the contractors and giving safety advice to contract managers;\n- Assessment / review of incident plans / emergency plans and preparing incident management plans;\n- Initiate and participate in consultations between the different co-contractors. Hazards have been identified in cooperation with the members of the design team. Where possible the hazards are eliminated or risk are reduced. For several (sub)projects a safety and health plan is written. The necessary control measures, design assumptions, or remaining risks are also directly communicated to the contractors so they can be dealt with in their Safety and Health Plan. \n- Consultation with the competent authority for environmental safety (Department of Environment and Supervision) and the Municipal Transport authority;\n- Consult with Labor Safety authority on the prevention of accidents;\n- Provide security recommendations to project management;\n- Track accident statistics and quarterly reporting of safety engineering aspects of the project;\n- Advising executive managers and supervisors of other disciplines.",
