    "summary": "I started my guitar lessons with the eminent guitar player/singer and song writer Anselmo Grau in 1989 in Uruguay. My intentions was to learn some chords to play Beatles but in my first day Anselmo played Villa-Lobo's Preludio N\u00ba 1 and from that moment I fall in love with the guitar. At the same time I took lessons with Mario Villagran an other great Uruguayan song writer and guitar player. In 1992 i continued my studies with Regina Carrizo. One year later I went for 1 year to the Escuela Universitaria de Musica in Montevideo (EUM) and open house classes with Abel Carlevaro (a major experience that I will never forget). In 1997 I came back to Uruguay after have been living in Sweden were I had a few lessons with the Swedish composer Staffan Storm, I continued with my studies in the EUM with Mario Paysee. Beside I took music lessons with the uruguayan composer Ulisses Ferretti and I study with Esteban Gil the traditional music of Latin America in the guitar, two work shops with Eduardo Fernandez and master classes with Magnus Andersson, Paul O'Dette, Shin-ichi Fukuda and Oscar Herrero.\n\n I have been playing in bands since 1992. My first \"band\" was a duo with Exequiel Caldas and later on we build up a trio with the collaboration of Pablo Grandal called \"Cueros\" for a 2 month European Street Tour in 1996. After that in 1997 I joined the uruguayan folk group Grupo Horizontes that was already playing since late 80', performing in several countries as Uruguay, Brasil, Argentina, Mexico, Cuba and USA. We recorded in 1999 the album \"Musica Latinoamericana\" a compilation of latin american folk music. In 2002 I joined the music project of Stephanie Rijsenaars \"Stefka Band\" recording \"Del Recuerdo de Amor\" and performing in Holland. Since 2006 I decided to start with my owen music project and invited Sergio Sinning to join Kixote Project releasing in November 2009 the album Music & Breakfast. In the present I'm more dedicated to the guitar teaching.",

                    "description": "My name is Gerardo Meny Collette. I was born in Uruguay in 1972. At a very young age I moved to Sweden, where I spent most of my childhood. As teenagers we moved back to Uruguay. When I was 15 years old, my cousin showed me how to play a song from U2. That's when I knew I wanted to play guitar, so I asked my mom to get me a guitar for my birthday.\nIn 1989 I started taking guitar lessons with my neighbor, a famous Uruguayan guitarist and singer. My intention was to learn some chords to play The Beatles, but on my first day playing Villa-Lobo's Preludio N\u00ba1, from that point on I knew I wanted to play more than chords on the guitar.\n\nRight from the start I teach the student the correct placement of the guitar. I emphasize placing the right fingers so as not to generate bad habits that get in the way of good learning later and make it impossible to play without effort.\nIn my lessons we don't just talk about the guitar. For me it is very important to get to know the person I have in front of me if I want to succeed in the educational process. As one guitar teacher told me, \"It doesn't matter if your students become soloists, the most important thing is that they become people who appreciate and love music.\"",
