    "summary": "Tech Principal Consultant at Thoughtworks, with a 13-year track record in different business contexts. I had played various roles such as: developer, technical leader, architect and strategic advisor for Technological Initiatives. I consider myself a technical generalist with a strong learner strength which enables me to switch contexts and get a deeper understanding of specific technical aspects based on prioritized needs.\n\nI am passionate about consulting at the strategy level, and being an active part in building the vision of teams that enable strategic initiatives. I am interested in topics related to security, cloud architecture, and technology platforms such as: OAuth and OpenId Connect protocols, API Management, APIOps, Service Mesh, cloud native and event oriented architectures.\n\nI enjoy blending technology with business, including purpose alignment of technology initiatives to fulfill business strategic objectives, communicating technical details of architecture solutions at different levels of detail, and working closely with business roles to connect technology decisions with business needs and priorities.",

With my team,  we created a tech talent framework focusing on a group of job families prioritized.\n\nThis talent framework, to be extended to additional families in the future, was composed by a capability model (capabilities and related competences with levels of proficiency expected per grade and role), career paths with grades and roles transitions, role accountabilities, and change management/adoption framework to implement the talent framework on different job families in the organization incrementally.  Additionally we provided a change management detailed plan and a high level roadmap to execute the recommended actions.\n\nWe established a method of incremental co-creation, were we worked with people from the organization we worked with on a day to day basis, first refining our proposal with an small core team that included our main sponsor to validate alignment and capture feedback, then as the next iteration, bringing the refined proposal to a larger group of focals that represented the different job families to capture more feedback. And finally, once we had all the parts, we ran some cross checks to validate consistency through all the models and we made the final improvements. \n\nAs a Technical Talent Advisor my main focus was facilitating this co-creation for the technical roles job families prioritized (i.e: software engineer, reliability engineer, engineer manager roles) and providing options for decision making.",

Then, knowing the business specific needs and technical solution proposed, I worked generating an initial backlog of stories to reflect the agreed scope.\n\nAs a Technical Lead I focused on the product architecture implementation alignment including the microservices internal architecture and integration configurations (component level referring to C4 model).  The solution stack included NodeJS, Fastify, Helm, Typescript, Go/Axios, Knex.  Some cross functional requirements I needed to focus on were logging and tracing in a distributed ecosystem using Istio, domain oriented clean architecture implementation, scalability of the solution in scenarios of high load, error handling and circuit breaker, integration with pub/sub and alignment with messaging standards.\n\nLooking for the best interests of my client, and given my previous knowledge of Authorization protocols and integration with CIAM solutions, l played an Advisory role for an external team focused in the integration with a CIAM solution, bringing visibility of risks and trade offs of different approaches the team was proposing based on my previous experience. Advisory work nature required alignment with multiple stakeholders and communication of the technical complexity in order to reflect additional work needed in the teams backlogs.\n\nAdditionally, there was an important time zone difference between the members of the team that required good sync and async communication to enable the daily workflow with a minimum overlapping.",
