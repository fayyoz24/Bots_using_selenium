    "summary": "I am currently involved in understanding the impact of climate change in the Terai region of Nepal and the interrelationships between river dynamics, groundwater, landcover and land use, and tigers. In this project, I develop agent-based models to investigate spatial and temporal scales and rhythms of continuity and change in river dynamics, animal behaviour, and societal routines. My main focus is to design integrated water-use strategies for communities and the wildlife living in and around Bardia National Park in a rapidly changing landscape and quantify values such as land sharing or sparing, survival.\n\nMy expertise lies in the design of self-evolving, self-healing systems with a Value-sensitive design approach. For my PhD, I designed an autonomous and self-organising mobile communication system that delivers the value of fairness, inclusion and continuity in a dynamic and disruptive environment such as disasters. I focus my work on the complex adaptive system design domain with a multidisciplinary approach to quantifying emergent values. \n\nI am trained as a multidisciplinary scientist, with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the West Bengal University of Technology, India and a Master's in  Networks and Distributed Systems from the University of St Andrews, Scotland.",
