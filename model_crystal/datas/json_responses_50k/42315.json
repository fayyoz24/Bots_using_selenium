    "summary": "Driving social impact through engagement with culture and the arts is at the heart of my personal and professional goals. I consider myself a fusion of creativity and structure, driven by a commitment to ensuring the right for everyone to participate in cultural life. Over the past 7 years, my journey has involved diverse research activities, building meaningful stakeholder relationships, and facilitating international cooperation. My passion lies in effectively communicating and translating best practices, developing and managing projects and knowledge-sharing processes, and promoting sustainable processes in the cultural and creative sectors. I have collaborated with public, private, and non-profit organisations as well as independent artists, both at the local and European levels. When not immersed in strategy-writing or colour-coding, you will find me exploring nature, enjoying a good book, and immersing myself in the arts.",
