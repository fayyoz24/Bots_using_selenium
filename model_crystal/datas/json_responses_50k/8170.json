    "summary": "Education is the most powerful weapon which one can use to change the world.\n(Nelson Mandela)\n\nI strongly believe that today's society shows us that the best way to contribute - be it in lines of work or any other matter - is by a sincere and honest connection on a personal level. What happens after that and/or because of that is a positive consequence of this connection...\n\nThe way I live my life: we live, we learn. Life is an ongoing learning process.\nThroughout my ongoing learning process I have specialised in the fields of leadership, education, communication, diversity and inclusion.  \n\nHere are some quotes that inspire me; they will tell you something about who I am, what I cherish in life and hopefully they will inspire you as well:\n\n* A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.\n(Nelson Mandela)\n\n* Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.\n(Steve Jobs)\n\n* Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful, a meaningful friend, or a meaningful day.\n(his Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama)",
