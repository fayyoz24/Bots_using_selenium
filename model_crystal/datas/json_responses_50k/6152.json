    "summary": "Hi! My name is Dennis. To me, educating yourself is more than getting a degree: it's about developing yourself as part of the world, as a citizen and as a person to contribute to a brighter future. Developing real skills and gaining valuable knowledge is achieved through questioning everyday things, challenging yourself and taking the opportunities to employ yourself in interdisciplinary and challenging projects. The difference between school and life? In school, you\u2019re taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you\u2019re given a test that teaches you a lesson. Keep on learning.\n\nAlways open to exchange ideas. Please feel free to have a look around or to contact me.",
