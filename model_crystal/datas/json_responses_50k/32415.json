    "summary": "I'm dedicated to advancing the world of ornamental research and breeding, with a particular focus on chrysanthemums. My expertise spans plant physiology, molecular biology, and genetics, and I lead research and development efforts aimed at enhancing the quality, yield, and resistance of chrysanthemums, contributing to the global cut flower industry.\n\nMy journey in scientific exploration has led me to esteemed institutions, including Wageningen University & Research, the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, and the National Orchid Garden of Singapore Botanic Gardens. During my time at these institutions, I delved deep into understanding the photobiology, molecular and physiological mechanisms of flowering in ornamental plants. I also explored innovative methods like genomics, metabolomics, tissue culture, and vertical farming for growing ornamentals.\n\nWhat drives me extends beyond the pursuit of knowledge\u2014it's the profound impact of our work on urban communities and the environment. I'm deeply passionate about pioneering sustainable solutions and contributing to the well-being of our cities through horticulture.\n\nI thrive on challenges, constantly seek opportunities for learning, and firmly believe in the transformative power of collaboration. As a curious and observant researcher, I'm committed to the betterment of individuals and the collective community.\n\nLet's connect, share insights, and explore new horizons in the world of horticulture. Together, we can bloom brighter.",

In India, it is a high value crop commonly known as sweet pepper or bell pepper occupies a pride of place among the vegetables, for its delicate taste and pleasant flavour. In India capsicum is mainly grown for its immature fruits. It is very rich in vitamins even more than tomatoes, especially in Vitamin-A and Vitamin-C.\nA number of constraints limits the production of capsicum such as low productivity due to poor yielding ability of genetic populations, imbalanced supply of nutrients etc. There is a need to overcome the impact of these factors in capsicum cultivation as it requires better supply of inputs for good plant growth and higher yields. \nThe role of horticulturists is important in tackling the troubles of plant population and disproportion in nutrition. The technologies on these aspects, especially low cost ones need to be developed so that such technologies are easily accepted and adopted by farming community. With this backdrop in view, an investigation was carried out with the following objectives viz.,\n\n1)\tTo study the effect of organics, inorganics and bio-fertilizers on yield potentiality of Bell pepper.\n2)\tTo compare the yield potentiality of Bell pepper under open and closed conditions.\n\n",
