Together with my fellow co-CEO and the whole BlueAlp team, I'm excited to be able to support BlueAlp on this journey. Through this, we will contribute in a positive way to a profound challenge of modern society - the way we deal with the plastic waste that we all generate. Plastics in itself are okay - they bring a lot of positives to society - however the way our modern world deals with them, once plastics have fulfilled their purpose, is where the opportunity lies. It is in this space that BlueAlp aims to make a significant positive contribution to the world in the years ahead.",
