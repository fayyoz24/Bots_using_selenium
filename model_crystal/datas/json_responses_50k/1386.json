    "summary": "I am an astrophysicist with 8+ years of experience working on teams/collaborations ranging from a few to a few hundred people. I enjoy all things survey related, and ultimately I use a variety of statistical and analytical tools to find and model dwarf galaxies and stellar streams, which have only a handful of stars among billions of contaminating ones. \n\nMy expertise is in resolved stellar populations in the nearby Universe. I mainly use statistical tools to mine for faint signal in large databases coming from photometric and astrometric surveys. More recently I am shifting towards spectroscopic surveys such as WEAVE and 4MOST, where I am coordinating one of the sub-surveys as well as helping with engineering aspects of these instruments. \n\nI also have a variety of interests in neighbouring fields such as multiple populations in globular clusters, the structure and star formation of the LMC, open clusters, and collisional dynamics. Outside of astronomy I am interested in Geology, mainly on Noble gases in Earth's mantle and finding impact craters using satellite images; neurosciences, where I have provided practical implementation of animal subject tracking using RFIDs and IoT technologies. Recently I have been looking into ways to get involved in ecology and conservation.",
