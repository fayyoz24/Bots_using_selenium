I investigated the binding affinity and nuclease activity of Cas9, both by doing labwork and working on a computational model of these protein-DNA interactions. \n\nI developed an interest for biophysics and computational biology, especially topics where I can combine these two disciplines.

The programming language used was C++.\n\nAbstract: In this research we analytically study the behaviour of multiple  cone-like inclusions of different orientations on a membrane. In the presence of surface tension, oppositely oriented inclusions attract each other where equally oriented inclusions repel each other. We show that, in order to minimise the total free energy of the membrane, three inclusions form an isosceles triangle shape. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that when putting multiple inclusions with different orientations on a membrane, surface tension causes them to self-assemble and form regular patterns.",
