    "summary": "As an electrical engineer, using technology to mitigate climate change has been one of the most challenging questions to answer. Over the last four years, I have tried answering this question by working on using machine learning and data science in the field of energy and climate. \n\nI have developed a wide variety of skills from my previous tech roles and from classes I am taking as a Master's student in Sustainable Energy Technology at Technische University Delft. Some of the courses I am taking include: Energy system optimisation, Intelligent Electrical Power Grids, DC and AC microgrids. \n \nI have previously worked in an ed-tech startup called Univ.AI, where I worked as a Research and Teaching fellow to build Machine Learning and Data Science courses. Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions. As a Software Engineer, I developed embedded software for air and pressure sensors for three-wheeler(specifically for the Indian market) and four-wheeler vehicles, which helped reduce vehicle emissions. \nI have interned in companies such as Power Research Development Consultants(PRDC) Pvt Ltd and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), where I learned about energy efficiency and renewable energy. \n\nIf you have any questions or would like a copy of my resume, I'd love to connect!",

The main aim of this project was to integrate Sun Sensors and use it for orientation of the satellite in space with various algorithms.\n\nAbout the project:\nOne of the main subsystems of the satellite is Attitude Determination and Control Sub-System(ADCS).\n\nThe ADCS is responsible for the orientation of the satellite in space. It takes various celestial bodies as a reference to do so, such as the Earth, the Sun, the Stars and so on. A Sun Sensor is a device that senses the direction with respect to the Sun. This can be as simple as some solar cells. The Sun Sensors measure the solar energy falling on their surface and through internal electronics determine the angle made by the Sun with respect to the sensor, which in turn is used to arrive at the Sun vector which is then used to orient the satellite in space.",
