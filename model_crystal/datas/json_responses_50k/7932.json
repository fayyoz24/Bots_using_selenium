    "summary": "My interest in tackling injustice and inequality have made me choose a very interdisciplinary academic background, which includes chemistry, international law and conflict resolution. This rather unique set of academic knowledge comes together in conflict over (access to) natural resources, varying from water to (precious/rare earth) metals, but has also proven valuable in the intrinsic interdisciplinary and complex fields of, amongst others, gender equality and sustainability. I have international work experience in the Latin Caribbean and adopted a flexible attitude, allowing me to work in very different environments varying from high level diplomacy to community based projects. I am able to connect people and build bridges. I am fluent in Dutch, English and Spanish.",
