    "summary": "After graduating in Land and Water Management, I have worked as a specialist, trainer, lecturer, project manager and project director in water resources development, in the Netherlands as well as abroad. Main subjects are integrated river management, irrigation and drainage, River Basin Planning, climate change adaptation, participatory planning, institutional development, implementation of EU water directives and the actual development of water management policies and plans. Management of planning processes is an important component of many of my projects. I have lead several integrated planning processes, involving many stakeholders, wherein water management played a major role next to transport, agriculture, nature conservation, public water supply, industrial development and other functions. I am used to working in complex project settings with many stakeholders, have a well developed sensitivity for the political and institutional context, and the drive to identify and realize practical and workable solutions.",
