    "summary": "I aspire to use computational and parametric design to advance environmentally mindful ways of engineering by focusing on structural geometry and workflow optimization.\n\nMy experiences in construction innovations involve researching concrete 3D printing as a Research Fellow at New York University Abu Dhabi, designing and constructing two full-scale solar-powered houses for Solar Decathlon Middle East (Team NYUAD, 2018) and Solar Decathlon Europe (Team SUM, 2022, 3rd place finish), working as a parametric designer for White Lioness technologies, and pursuing an MSc in Building Engineering at TU Delft.\n\nSimultaneously, I am refining how to combine my professional passions with conscious engagement with the communities around me. I presided over Advocacy, a student group that worked hand-in-hand with blue-collar workers in the UAE, organized free-of-charge math classes for 70 students in Latvia during a COVID lockdown, among other community-oriented initiatives in Latvia, UAE, Thailand, India, Argentina, Netherlands, and the U.S.\n\nMore can be found in my spatial resume: https://arcg.is/1e4LWD0",
