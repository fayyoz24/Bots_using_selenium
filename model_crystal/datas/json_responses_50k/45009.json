However due to the dynamic of the business, short term anticipation is sometimes needed.  \n\nFor the demand side of the planning I am liaising with internal stakeholders. Besides this, I am in close contact with the regional teams to support and align on the operational side of the planning.  \n\nRegarding the supply of packaging, I am the first point of contact for the suppliers. To ensure availability of packaging at the suppliers, demand forecast updates are shared with them. Furthermore I am involved in procurement tenders, reporting, planning improvement initiatives and innovation.\n\nOn one of the major innovation projects I have been rewarded with the Clint Miller Award (2019). This is an award provided on the global level of the enterprise.",
