    "summary": "I\u2019m a Dutch filmmaker and educator. I produce and (co-)direct documentary film productions in Europe and the United States with a focus on social issues. As an educator I teach with, through and about film in institutes of higher education.\n\nMy background in Philosophy greatly shaped my perspective and the way I work. Open-minded, curious and analytical, I like to dig for the deeper questions and methodically structure all projects I work on. I have a burning desire to discover, learn and share perspectives on issues that touch us all. Next to my own documentary films, I've helped numerous (non-)governmental agencies, cultural institutions and businesses create impactful media productions. \n\nA strong believer that films are a great instrument for learning, I aim to produce audiovisual content that can be used in an educational environment. My films are used by hundreds of universities in the United States and Europe. More than just creating films, I'm also involved with consulting and training on the use of media in an academic setting and have taught filmmaking courses in college.",
