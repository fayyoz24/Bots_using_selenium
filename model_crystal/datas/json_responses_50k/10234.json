Opportunity to rise to the challenge and become the next intrapreneur at Scania.\n\nOur team B-Ready made it into the bootcamp with the final 10 but unfortunately we didnt win with our final pitch in front of the business angels to get an investment.\n\nB-READY wants to take away this complex challenge for electrifying customers. We believe that the technology change itself is already a huge and still uncertain step for fleet owners who depend decades on the reliable combustion engine. If we want to accelerate the electrification within the transport sector, than we need to limit uncertainty and provide the feeling of control.\n\nHow does this work? An on site analyses results into a infrastructure readiness report, which highlights 4 areas (see below), each area will be evaluated in the context of one and another, to ensure an holistic approach and limit unnecessary cost. Deliverables? Recommendation on infrastructure optimization requirements to charge electrified fleet, including investment cost and lead times. It includes a set of options, including recommended partnerships (whereby we ensure reliability and fair prices).",
