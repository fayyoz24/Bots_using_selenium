The purpose of this project was to provide free access to Dutch language tips through a virtual learning environment for international students as well as newcomers in\nGroningen, based on a virtual city tour. In addition, cultural tips are introduced to develop the learners' cultural competence in a communicative context and resolve the cultural gap for international visitors in the Netherlands. While introducing different locations in Groningen and offering Dutch cultural tips through gamification, flashcard and matching function, and short communicative video clips contributed to task-based language learning for developing Dutch language skills. Therefore, the website provides communicative contexts through the chatbot and go-live features to integrate general daily life with taking risks for producing Dutch as a foreign language.",
