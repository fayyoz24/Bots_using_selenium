When you\u2019re dealing with such countries, the issue of the social relevance of your company is completely different from when you\u2019re dealing with a developed economy. I dealt with risks that occurred in some of the countries and mitigated them. Understanding risk is more than just a financial concern. One has to be mindful of ensuring that you\u2019re seen to be helpful and relevant to the local economies rather than just extracting profits by providing a service. You have to be involved and committed to the communities in which you operate."
