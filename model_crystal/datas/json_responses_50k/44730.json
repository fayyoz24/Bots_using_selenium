    "summary": "I started my master's degree in Sept. 2004, and obtained it in Sept. 2009. I spent the first three years discovering various fields of physics, chemistry and mathematics, and in the last two years, I specialized in device physics, which allowed me to learn more about semiconductor physics, laser physics and electro-optics.\n\nIn apr. 2010, I started working for the French Directorate for Armament, where I was a field test engineer for electro-optical systems.\n\nSince Apr. 2014 I have worked for ASML, first as a integration test engineer (first at operating level then preparation level). In March 2018 I have switched to a design engineering position on reticle-to-wafer alignment.",
