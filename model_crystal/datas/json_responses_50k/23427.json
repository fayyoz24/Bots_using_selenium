    "summary": "I am an aspiring Aerospace Engineer at Delft University of Technology, graduating in June 2023 with a Minor in Responsible Innovation from Leiden University.\n\nAside from my academic path, I have worked as a Systems Engineer at Team Tumbleweed. This position allowed me to create a model of the Martian terrain in Unity3D to analyze the spreading of a wind-propelled rover. Similarly, I have participated in requirement generation and developed my skills in Model-based Systems Engineering through the Capella software.\n\nAs a personal project, I began to experiment with beer brewing. Being always interested in the process of fermentation, this venture has allowed me to develop my business-oriented skills. Other than creating recipes, I developed a small brand by designing my labels and organizing the production and sale of these beers.\n\nI'm interested in an early career position in the field of aerospace engineering in the Dallas-Fort Worth area as a mechanical engineer, systems engineer, structural engineer, or aerodynamics engineer. Until graduation, I aim to continuously develop my technical and intrapersonal skills while remaining open to opportunities abroad.\n\nProficient: Python(scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, pandas), Microsoft Office, CATIA\nKnowledgeable: Capella MBSE, MatLab(Simulink), C#",

            "description": "The objective of the manned Martian aircraft is the rapid transportation of two astronauts\nover distances of at least 1000 km. The astronauts will carry scientific instruments and\ncollected samples, which must be stowed in the vehicle. If successful, the aircraft will alleviate\nlimitations on landing sites for crewed missions to Mars, enabling exploration of scientifically\nessential areas that are not accessible otherwise. Long-term, such a system can connect a\nnetwork of bases spread over the planet and enable a sustainable human presence on Mars.\nThe main constraints of the project, relating to the aircraft\u2019s operational capabilities and the available design space, allowed for the investigation of both conventional and unconventional designs. The top-level requirements of a 1000 km range, 400 km/h cruise speed, capacity for 2 astronauts, and an additional 100 kg payload led to the parallel development of 5 designs. These included an Airship, Flying Wing, Biplane, Tilt-rotor and Multicopter.\nFrom these 5 options, a trade-off determined that an electric tilt-rotor concept would perform best with the criteria selected. The tilt-rotor can take off and land vertically thanks to two sets of counter-rotating blades at the wing tips. These blades provide the necessary thrust to function as a helicopter when performing take-off and landing maneuvers and provide the aircraft the capability to hover. For long-distance flight, the rotors align with the wing and provide the required thrust to cruise, while the wing, with a span of 44.75 m, provides the lift required. Using electric batteries allows the aircraft to perform in Mars's thin, oxygen-deprived atmosphere, and installing solar panels on the wing\u2019s upper surface allows the system to recharge itself in remote areas without requiring any infrastructure. Next, the presence of life-support systems aims to complement that already present in the crew\u2019s suits, providing water and oxygen for long-distance flights.",

In this study, the non-ideal gas\ndata of a simulated flow through a radial inflow ORC turbine is analyzed. The aim of this\nanalysis is to determine phenomena happening in the turbine due to real gas effects. For\nthis, entropy changes, stagnation values, flow angles, and duty coefficients were computed\nand the Mach number throughout the turbine was analyzed. The work coefficient was 3.138,\nwhilst the flow coefficient before and after the rotor was 0.210 and 0.606 respectively. Shock\nwaves occurred in the stator, where the maximum Mach number was 1.3. The rotor was\nshock wave free. Using the real gas assumption, the total entropy change in the rotor is\n\u2212180.277 J/K. This value is due to the compression and subsequent ordering of particles.\nThe entropy change in the stator is 2.0167 J/K. The efficiency using ideal gas equations was\n82.195 %, whilst with real gas it was 78.207 %. For future investigations, it is recommended\nthat instead of simulated flow data, real flow data is analyzed to confirm if the model is\ncorrect.",
