    "summary": "Experienced Occupational Therapist with specialism in Sensory Processing observation and treatment by all children and in ICT skills observation and training by children with multiple disabilities. I need the challenge to work on (scientific) projects, to develop new instruments and to educating others. Beside my work in Healthcare I have a great interest in volunteer jobs in Wildlife Care or even joining scientific research projects about nature and wildlife. So maybe once I will get the opportunity to join such a project and use my skills for this goal.",

What will be the role of the tactual sense and skills when you are losing your vision and hearing? How can you use your touch and propriocepsis in your occupational performance? Is the Tactual Profile the right kind of assessment to start with or do we need also something else? All very interesting questions we are going to work on together with adults with acquired deaf-blindness, because they are the only ones who really can tell us what they need.",

From there all kind of collaborations are set up with European organisations to develop new expertise and with worldwide organisations in countries with less finances to provide training and share expertise with the employees over there. For the Westbank we are organising a serie of trainings for employees working with multiple disabled and visually impaired children. Together with a colleague and with support from the international program manager, we have given a training on the job. We went to Bethlehem in Palestina and from there we were part of live treatment sessions in 5 different centers with children with multiple disabilities and visual impairments. We guided the group how to look at the sessions and how to discuss the feedback we could give the related professionals about the case and their questions. We will continue with some private team sessions online to discuss some cases more in-depth.",

From there all kind of collaborations are set up with European organisations to develop new expertise and with worldwide organisations in countries with less finances to provide training and share expertise with the employees over there. For the Westbank we are organising a serie of trainings for employees working with multiple disabled and visually impaired children. Together with a colleague and with support from the international program manager, we are preparing a training about the working of the different senses with this target group and what kind of assessments you can use to gather information about this. And because of the Covid-19 pandemic we will give the training online instead of going over to the Westbank.",
