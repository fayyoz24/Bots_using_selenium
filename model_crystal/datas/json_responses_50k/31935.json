    "summary": "I am a multilingual and international oriented project manager, an efficient organizational talent, able to plan and manage complex projects from start to finish. I thrive on bringing organization out of chaos and leading my team and partners to successful accomplishments. I make a point of always getting things done, finding solutions by thinking out of the box and making a smart use of all resources. My way of working conveys calm and confidence, my communication style is positive and cooperative. My work experience in the field of non-profit (Academic and NGO) campaign leading, content production and project management formed me to be an excellent project manager, at ease when working within complex hierarchies and communicating within intercultural contexts.\nMy work experience in the field of corporate events helped me develop both strong procurement and commercial awareness, allowing me to interface with internationally based vendors and clients, and developing experience in budget sustainability.\nMy master studies in Italy and Canada helped develop and nurture my long held interest in global migration, trans-nationalism, expatriation and the issues which need to be addressed around these topics. \nMy personal experience as an expat, living most of my adult life in several countries, has sharpened my people skills: conflict solving, constructive dialogue and diversity awareness are skills I can comfortably base my communication and interpersonal relationships on.\nLast but not least, my life long passion for the performing arts, in particular theatre, has formed me to be a confident public speaker.",
