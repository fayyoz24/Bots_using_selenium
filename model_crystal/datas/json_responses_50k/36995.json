    "summary": "I am currently pursuing a PhD in Environmental Geography from the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. \n\nWith broad experience as a project manager, researcher, and educator, my research has focused on managing multiple-use landscapes for people and the environment.  I bring experience in international development and natural resource management from my time spent working for the US Forest Service International Program in Central Africa, as well as Tetra Tech ARD, and years spent as an agribusiness extension agent with the US Peace Corps in rural Mali and Burkina Faso.\n\nThis background contributes to my current project looking at landscape scale to manage wildfire risk in Europe in the present and future, funded by the FirEUrisk project (Horizon 2020). I will be mapping relevant areas in which certain land management strategies, such as silvopastoralism and brush clearing, could be most effective and using CLUmondo to model land use scenarios relevant to climate risk.\n\nMy master\u2019s research focused on forest health, invasive species management, and species distribution modelling at the University of Vermont\u2019s Rubenstein School. This research, published in the journals Forest Ecology and Management and Environmental Entomology, was funded by the US Forest Service and a grant from the Vermont Clean Energy Fund. The research contributed to the use of Leucopis spp. as a biological control for the hemlock woolly adelgid (Tsuga spp.) and understanding the opportunities and risks of invasive species transport in the wood pellet supply chain.\n\n I have experience working in English, French, Bambara and Spanish.",

These two species of silver fly from the Pacific Northwest (Leucopis argenticollis and L. piniperda) were examined for temporal and spatial resource partitioning patterns and niche characteristics that would applicable to the release procedures used in the eastern United States.  \nLeucopis spp. exhibited sinusoidal patterns of daily emergence when examined over a 29-day period, with peak daily abundances that were inversely related.  Spatially, however, landscape-scale and climatic indicators were not significant in predicting the presence of Leucopis spp. in the Pacific Northwest.  This adds important information about niche dynamics of Leucopis spp. in the Pacific Northwest, which may have logistical and operational implications for their use in the USDA Forest Service\u2019s Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Initiative.\nAdditionally, the potential opportunities and risks of using wood that has been impacted by invasive species and pests was explored through a literature analysis focused on three species posing a threat to northeastern US forests: emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, and southern pine beetle. Based on this review, I concluded that although opportunities for the use of this wood are sometimes recognized, the phytosanitary risks in feedstock pre-treatment are not being directly addressed in US-related literature.  These studies provide important evidence for adaptive solutions to forest pests that consider both forest health and forest economics.",
