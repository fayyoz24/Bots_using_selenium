A group consists of 1 mechatronic and 5 mechanical students had to design and produce a photomask alignment device which will be used in lithography process. The device had to allow x and y linear movement with an accuracy of 0.5 micrometer and z rotation movement with an accuracy of 0.0115 degree. My role in this project was a sensor engineer.\n\nSoftware :\n- Arduino\n- Eagle\n\nRelated skills :\n- Serial communication interface (RS-232, UART, and USB)\n- Analog circuit design",

This MISO control was tested in simulation and experimentally. \n\nThe MISO control that I implemented is statistically proven to be able to perform 50 times more accurate movement than the specification and increase the throughput with almost a factor of 3. \n\nAt the end, I also implemented my MISO control strategy in the industrial motion controller.\n\nWith these amazing results, I received a 10 for my graduation internship.",
