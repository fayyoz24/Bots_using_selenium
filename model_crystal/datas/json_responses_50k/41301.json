    "summary": "Expert in French Public Sector (especially culture and security) and graduate of the National School of Administration leveraging 10 years of experience in managing financial and strategic projects. I have a proven ability to improve processes and efficiencies and bring a pragmatic approach to problem solving. Thanks to my experience within the French administration, I have developed analytical skills as well as solid written and oral communication skills. As an energetic \u2018people\u2019 person with a flair for teamwork and motivational leadership, I enjoy coordinating teams and using my interpersonal skills to create a pleasant working atmosphere.\n\nRecently settled in the Netherlands to follow my husband, I am eager to put my dynamism and expertise at the service of a new public or private organization. \n\n***\n\nI previously spent 7 years in the cultural field, working primarily for the Ministry of Culture where I supervised several public institutions (such as the Centre Pompidou) in a multi-disciplinary environment. I have also worked for the National French library where I took charge of around 20 development projects. I used planning and project management, working with great autonomy while leading teams to concretely achieve results. \n\nIn 2017 I attended the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) for two years of schooling where I notably provided a support function to senior management (two directors and one prefect) and reinforce my expertise in public finance and public law.\n\nI then went on to lead 5 strategic level missions at the General Inspectorate where I collaborated with other inspectors and senior colleagues in the French Administration (2 missions of audit and 3 of control and evaluation). Among our main responsibilities, were: \n- to take an independent and critical look on public policies, usually linked to the area covered by the Ministry of the Interior but also broader; \n- to quickly understand complex subjects and to organize numerous interviews at all levels of the organization;\n- to write reports and formulize concrete recommendations. \n\n***\n\nPassionate about public policies and the building of common good, I am very curious and able to integrate very quickly into new environments. In my personal life, I like reading, music and sports, especially swimming and sailing. \n",
