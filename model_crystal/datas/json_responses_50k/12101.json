    "summary": "The wellbeing of people is my #1 value. My jobs aim to bring that value into life.\n\nAs ORGANIZATIONAL CONSULTANT at People Intouch, I help ethics, compliance officers, legal counsels and HR professionals in their quest building transparent business cultures by providing the SpeakUp\u00ae software system. Anonymous reporting of wrongdoing made easy and safe. Several of my clients: TUI, SBM, Randstad, Polestar, Arcadis, IKEA, Jumbo, Technical University Eindhoven, ASML.\n\nI enjoy empowering and challenging yogi's on the mat as YOGA INSTRUCTOR. I teach vinyasa flow, hatha, yoga nidra and kidsyoga at several places in Rotterdam. Wednesday during lunch break, I teach my fellow colleagues PIT yoga online since the start of covid. A great moment to bond.\n\nI was born and raised in Dordrecht, studied in Tilburg and Utrecht, and live in Rotterdam for over 10 years now. I have two master degrees; one in laws and one in business administration. And multiple certificates in yoga. \n\n#wellbeing #speakup #ethics #integrity #whistleblowing #yoga",

Including feedback on the Code of Conduct and 'Whistleblowing' Policy. \n- Who do we want to be able to report (suppliers, staff, etc.)? \n- In which case do we as a company want to encourage reporting (as last resort or specific categories of wrongdoing)? \n- Who will receive the messages once reported (HR, legal, managers, what department, in what country)? \n- How can we launch the software so potential reporters know how to speak up (communication campaign)?",
