    "summary": "Hi! I am Tabo Stekelenburg, a student-athlete on the Women\u2019s Rowing Team at UC Berkeley majoring in Public Health. I am interested in public health and community health because I spent the first few years of my life in Zambia and came into contact with different levels of access to health care. This made me realize that healthcare disparities exist and how it was visible in Zambia. I want to put in the effort to make this world a better place for people that are not getting the same opportunities as I\u2019m getting, which is the main reason I decided to major in public health. I considered going to medical school for a long time but concluded that I am more interested in putting effort into the bigger picture and system. This way I will be able to have a more significant influence and help more people. I am currently exploring career paths in public health and I am very excited for any opportunities. \nAfter finishing high school in Amsterdam with a cum laude diploma, I accepted an offer from the University of California, Berkeley to further pursue my academic and athletic career in The United States of America. Currently, I'm in my senior year, admitted to the Public Health major, while making 20-hour weeks of collegiate rowing. I went to the Under 23 World Rowing Championships for the Netherlands during the summer of 2021, made the first eight for Cal during the 2021 NCAA Rowing Championships, and attended the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022. Rowing taught me to combine a busy athletic lifestyle with the high pressure of studying at a top university like Berkeley, being efficient is necessary, and spending my time wisely makes me both a good rower and student.",

The 'Barlaeus Journaal' is basically a group of students with interests in presenting/filming/movie editing and we would make episodes about events happening that were connected to our high school. In the beginning, I was mostly responsible for movie editing, but we also had biweekly meetings to discuss our next episode. The last two years I was asked to be the chairwoman/president and that gave me the responsibility of keeping everything running. I put extra effort into recruiting new people and coming up with new and creative ideas. I also presented the show myself. This opportunity brought me a lot of experiences, mostly movie editing, using Final Cut Pro, but also working with autocue and cameras. It taught me to direct a group of people and create a motivating workspace, where everyone was welcome."
