Furthermore a dozen Collaborator members contributed in kind, mainly work or servers. And from all membership classes a Board of Stewards was selected to set the high level strategy for the collective.\n\nI worked on expanding the network, bringing new members on board, improve the services and organisation.

At the same time this proves to be a great learning environment to share and develop together new usecases and applications.\n\nAfter TTN started in Amsterdam summer 2015, we started gathering in Barcelona and formed TTN Catalunya. We have had many community meetings, dozens of training sessions, run a pilot programme with the City of Barcelona (2018), organised two hackatons etc.\n\nWe develop TTN.cat as an informal community to which all organisations and members can contribute as they see fit. When necessary we have three organisations that function as legal umbrella: the Free Knowledge Institute, the Guifi.net Foundation and femProcomuns.coop with whom we work to cooperativise the network, as the XOIC - the open community for the internet of things in Catalan.",

Here a movement is growing and flourishing for a social, just and sustainable society in which well-being and solidarity are at its centre. The Cities for Change forum has brought together 2.785 participants, 136 organisations, collectives and networks through 59 live events over a period of 12 weeks, to share, inspire, learn from each other, connect and work together.\n\nMy role has been to design a solution for making this happen online (November - December 2020) and then to coordinate its deployment and operation and train key people in its usage and transfer knowledge to share the administration of the various platforms.\n\nOur solution consisted of Decidim for running online democracy groups and the online forum, with live online conferences hosted on a dedicated server by The Online Meeting Cooperative (meet.coop), pipelining live streaming to the Decidim platform. \n\nWe have deployed the Decidim platform for direct democracy and online conferences with the help of Platoniq, experts in Decidim. Together with them we have customised the default platform and provided several improvements that have been fed back to the core software team. With the Amsterdam team we have run several training sessions and helped specific groups to run their own groups inside the platform.\n\nThe meet.coop team has developed a live streaming extension to their BigBlueButton platform, that allowed us to have session hosts run their conference room and stream it to Vimeo (or Youtube, ...) and from there live into the Decidim platform.",
