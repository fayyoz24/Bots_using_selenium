Here, the Timbertown Follies were born. They were a group of sailors who entertained themselves and their camp by putting on shows in the Music Hall style, which was hugely popular at that time back in Britain. The shows were a huge success, and the Follies became famous in Groningen and even the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nStichting Peerd and English improv comedy group Stranger Things Have Happened revive the delightful repertoire of the Timbertown Follies, and offer a glimpse of the less frivolous wartime realities beyond the theatre. This is a curious, entertaining, and moving story from Groningen\u2019s history, played by English and Groningse \u2018Stadjers\u2019, with musical accompaniment provided by foreign students from the Prins Claus Conservatorium in Groningen.\n\nThis original production premiered at the Noorderzon Festival on August 28, 2014, and continues to be performed in the Der Aa-Theater and other locations.",
