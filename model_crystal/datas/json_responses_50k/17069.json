    "summary": "Fresh urban development professional, specialised in qualitative local research, organising collaborative processes and developing action-oriented advise with human scale. I enjoy working on projects in co-creation with local communities, that contribute to green, healthy and thriving urban environments. I do this with enthusiasm, pragmatism, an integral perspective, and a friendly face ;-)\n\nMy fascination for the urban environment is fueled by my master in Urban and Regional Planning (Stockholm University, Sweden), that allows me to approach the urban environment from multiple perspectives. I am driven by the notion of environmental justice and the urgency to develop sustainable and equitable cities. I like to translate the bigger picture to local impact.",
