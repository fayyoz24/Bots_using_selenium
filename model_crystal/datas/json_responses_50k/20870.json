    "summary": "My international background, as a result of having been brought up in Indonesia, Philippines, Spain, Malaysia, China, and USA has provided me with a very deep-rooted international understanding, and thus my interest in international socioeconomic challenges has always been strong. I gained a bachelor in International Relations from IE University and took upon internships in the United Nations Security Council in New York and the Spanish Consulate in Shanghai, and also worked as a Trade Development Officer at the Embassy of Pakistan in Madrid. \n\nHowever, there was no denying that the biggest international challenge to come was that of Climate Change, hence my pursuit of a career more focused on Sustainability. I worked for almost four years at Club de Excelencia en Sostenibilidad (Club of Excellence in Sustainability in English) in Madrid. Club de Excelencia en Sostenibilidad is a business association composed of a group of large companies that promote sustainable growth from the economic, social and environmental point of view. Furthermore, during my time in this organisation I had the opportunity to participate in the Executive Program in Corporate Responsibility of IE Business School, as well as KPMG\u2019s Integrated Reporting Training. To specialise even further in sustainability, I participated in a Master\u2019s program in Environment and Resource Management at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. \n\nIn addition, this international background has further endowed me with a set of language skills, being a native English and Spanish speaker with a strong proficiency in Mandarin. My continuous involvement in various Mandarin programs highlights my enthusiasm to unceasingly improve my skills.",
