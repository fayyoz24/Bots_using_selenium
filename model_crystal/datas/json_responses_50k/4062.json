    "summary": "With 19+ years of professional experience in the space sector, and having worked in various ESA directorates (Technical, Earth Observation, Science, and Exploration), I am passionate about space technology, its development and management. I thrive leading the implementation of technology activities with oversight on the whole value-chain from R&D to flight systems, and its applications.\n\nAs a lead technology engineer, I am responsible for supporting the programme management with the definition of technology requirements and scoping activities, implementation of industrial contracts, coordination of technology developments and roadmapping, overseeing the end-to-end technology process. I am a member of the ISECG inter-agency Technology Working Group (e.g. Co-chair of the Autonomy, ISRU, and ECLSS gap assessment teams), and the Technology Network Exploration deputy-chair at ESA.\n\nThroughout my career I have conducted project management of various advanced space technologies in the field of Optical Communications, Optics, Optoelectronics, Contamination Control, GNC sensors, Robotics, ISRU, and Fuel Cells.\n\nOverall I have supported various ESA missions, in the fields of: Re-entry Technology (EXPERT), Telecommunications (ARTEMIS), Education (STRAPLEX), Earth Observation (ADM-Aeolus, EarthCARE, MSG), Science (JUICE) and Robotic Exploration (MSR, EL3, ISRU-DM) during various development phases, e.g. Feasibility, Definition, Implementation, and Exploitation.\n\nI also had the honour to receive the 2018 ESA Team Award for the Aeolus development and laser support teams.",

The applications that this sensor can serve range through the extent of contamination in space, the monitoring of fine dust particles in urban environments and measurements related to volcanic risks.
