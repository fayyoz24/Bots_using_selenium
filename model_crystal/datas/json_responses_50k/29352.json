It started life as a case study for graduate students, presented cinematically, with a strong script/storyline and a colorful cast of characters. However, a few film festivals (and awards) later, it has crossed over into the general Short Films category. Follow Clara as she comes from Romania to Amsterdam to manage a challenging team. Clara has to find ways to connect with each team member, including Oliver, the tax man who has been with the company \u201cforever\u201d, and bursts into song given the slightest provocation. Oliver is very resistant to Clara\u2019s management style at first, but if you watch the film you\u2019ll see how she wins him over\u2026and also takes a few tools from his toolbox as well. Seems old Oliver actually is a pretty savvy team player.",
