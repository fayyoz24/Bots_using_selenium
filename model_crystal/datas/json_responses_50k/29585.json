    "summary": "I write longform enterprise and investigative features--mostly about science, technology, the environment, and their intersections with business--for major news organizations. Reporting from four continents and Oceana, I've also written on health (including mental health), criminal justice, and more. My journalism has appeared in The New Yorker; New York Times Magazine, NYT Science, NYT Business, National Geographic, Scientific American, Wired, Nature, Bloomberg Businessweek, The Guardian (U.K.), Slate, Fast Company, New York, and many others. \n\nAs an editor, my work has been recognized by the Society of Professional Journalists, Society of Environmental Journalists, Association of Health Care Journalists, Columbia University, American Society of Journalists and Authors, Folio: magazine, and the Excellence in Financial Journalism Awards. \n\nCurrently on assignments for Bloomberg News, Hakai, UCLA, and a corporate client. \n\nWhen I'm not writing or researching, I'm listening to classic hip-hop and post-punk on vintage hi-fi, paddleboarding the canals of Amsterdam, or helping my teenage daughters realize their dreams of becoming professional perfomers.\n\nContact me through paultullis.net",
