    "summary": "As humans, we have one of the most complex interacting ways in the whole animal kingdom. This does not make us special, but it creates a sensitive mind-balance in between pragmatism and idealism and yet realism and irrationality. \nThese balances need to be always kept in mind, to avoid exceeding in one or the other direction. This also means avoiding time-loss on the wrong path, overthinking about details, or running too fast for the result.\n \nI am Sarah, and I am a Communication and a Digital Strategist. I try to apply this view both, in the Marketing field, and in the way I manage work among colleagues. The key to success is to find the best way not only to communicate to the world outside: respecting the logic, and the illogic, that drive our minds; but also, find the best way to work together as a team. Ideas are driven together, to keep a natural communication and yet create a well-analyzed marketing strategy. \n\nWhat about my life outside work? I am a swimmer, I love gardening, a passion that I discovered during the time of Corona, and I am exceptionally curious. I like to read and document myself on thousands of topics that I would struggle to list, as well as to discover new activities like new sports or crocheting. Yes, I go from black to white just basing on what catches my heart. I still love climbing for instance, even if I am really bad at it!\n \nJoin me here on LinkedIn and let\u2019s create a connection.",

The goal of the project is to obtain information about the comfort of users in a particular context; this information is collected and sent to a central system directly from the people who daily live in that particular environment and then, be cross-referenced with data from environmental sensors. With this method it is possible to understand the relevant variables related to the use of places, with two main aims: on one hand, to promote a more sustainable buildings management and, on the other hand, to direct users' actions towards energy saving through an increase in awareness derived from the information collected.\n\nThe context selected for the experimentation foreseen by the project is the Luigi Einaudi Campus (CLE) and the subjects which have been involved in this experimentation are students, teachers, and employees who attend and work in the structure. The Lab is maintained by UniTo professors, researchers, and user experience design experts. During the Lab, broader issues were also addressed, such as the theme of big data, energy network science, smart cities design.\nThe meetings represented the main phases of participatory design and, therefore, were divided as follows:\n\n1) Introduction to the living lab and basic concepts.\n2) Collection of needs of CLE users, through interviews and observation\n3) Brainstorming for the definition of the concept, storyboard, and scenarios\n4) Ideation phase of the identified solutions\n5) Definition of the functionality of the device\n6) Definition of interaction modes\n7) Introduction to the theme of the Internet of Things and relations with energy networks\n8) Introduction to the theme of big data\n9) Introduction to the design of the smart and sustainable city",
