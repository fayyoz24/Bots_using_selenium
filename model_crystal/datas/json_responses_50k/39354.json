    "summary": "My love for brands and strategic thinking got my professional career started with Brand Strategy at Brandia Central, Once Upon a Brand and Born, three branding agencies, while I did my bachelor in Media Studies in Lisbon and became a Master in Globalisation, Brands and Consumption in Sweden.\n\nThroughout my career I have been in different positions regarding branding and project management. I have seen and learnt by the client\u2019s perspective through my position at L\u2019Oreal; followed by an understanding of the relevance of social media through my time at BY; had the opportunity to be involved with the strategy and implementation of marketing plans for several brands and manage sales teams, suppliers and budgets at Roudolph Ari\u00e9; and finally got to manage clients and in-house teams in a collaborative environment which also boosted my creativity and project management skills as an Account Manager at A Equipa. In a more hands on experience, I co-founded Vobba - a e-commerce brand of baby accessories for children from 0 to 3 years old - where I am \u2018brand-everything\u2019 from product design, production, communication and management, a project that pushes me positively personally and professionally. \n\nI am a true peoples\u2019 person sensible to quickly understand their needs and with whom most empathise - you have no idea what people share with me, sometimes even too much -  giving me the opportunity to quickly start and last relationships whether personal or professional. \n\nAllied to great organisational and communication skills - I bring curiosity and creativity to everything I do. I am the type of multitasker that lives for finished to-do lists just in time to add new items - I am a doer and like to do it neatly with attention to every detail. As a big supporter of teamwork, I believe that great outcomes are only reached when the path is tamed together with many hearts and different minds. \n\nCurrently living in Amsterdam, I would love to put together my love for brands, people and management working with companies that believe and acknowledge that small changes can make big differences.",
