    "summary": "PROFILE\nThe best of both worlds; a young professional with passion for project management and a fresh engineer with a passion for technology. Both worlds came together during my management traineeship at ASML and strengthened both passions. The personal and professional development track of the traineeship make me the young professional as I am today. I am someone who brings fresh ideas, has a critical view on targets and likes to bring different perspectives to the table. In my work I look, both divergent as convergent, at issues to find the most suitable solution. I am someone with a heart for people and a mind that strives towards the best end results. Combining the heart and the mind gives a good quality of the process and a nice collaboration within the team.\n\nSKILLS\nMy knowledge and skills enable me to analyze issues, translate these into daily practice and fix them. I keep the  bigger picture in mind, act upon it and bring the people along in the process. In my work I seek professional vividness, clarity and compactness. As a manager and colleague, I am flexible and stress resistant. Next to that I communicate smoothly and am open to discussions on issues, objections and problems.\n\nAMBITIONS\nMy ambitions are developing, managing and executing innovative and ambitious projects. To achieve goals from the vision through knowledge, skills and transparency, with the underlying meaning that the work of the people and the interest of the stakeholders are in balance and future oriented.\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about me, my skills and ambitions, feel free to contact me!",
