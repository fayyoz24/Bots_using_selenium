    "summary": "I have extensive experience in structured debt funding for growth capital, acquisitions, management buyouts, development, and refinancing. I have worked alongside corporates, private equity, listed investment funds, and debt funds (senior and mezzanine), to achieve the optimal capital structure that supports their business or investment. \n\nMy experience spans across small private enterprises, utilities and institutional public-to-private buyouts; from bilateral corporate facilities to large syndicated loans. I have originated or supported transactions in Australia, Europe, Singapore and the US.\n\nI am a strong proponent of continued personal development. I also offer my time and skills as a coach and mentor, or to deliver training programs for junior colleagues.\n\nIn my downtime, I am an avid book reader (primarily on business, personal development and cognitive science), a keen participant in team sports, and follow developments in science, finance, technology, and social enterprise. My photography skills, sadly, remain rather sub-par.",
