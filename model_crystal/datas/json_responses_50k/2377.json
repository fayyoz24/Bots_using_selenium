    "summary": "In 2010 my eldest son started a study at the University of Maastricht. In the years after my three other children followed in Maastricht, Arnhem and Nijmegen. However, the quality of student housing in the private sector were pretty shocking to me: dirty, unsafe fire resistant, small rooms, high prices and noisy. I fell very uncomfortable leaving my children in such an environment. Fortunately I had already some experience gathered in renting out vacation homes, commercial places and homes for families. So it seemed a small step to re-use that experience and create high quality and safe housing for students while biasing a bit towards female students as they are most vulnerable. \n\nAll student home that I manage have as a minimum a kitchen with all needed appliances (sometimes even with a dishwasher) and other appliances such as a washing machine and a dryer. Also each home has a shared living room with television. Many homes have also a garden equiped with a garden set. Each house has fire safety measures such as (connected) smoke and CO detectors and fire distinguishers that are yearly checked by a certified firm.\n\nAlso at least every month the houses are cleaned by a cleaning service and I have a strict policy that garbage and other waste is collected and disposed by the students themselves. I also stay in contact with neighborhood to make sure that the students behave as good citizen and are not causing noise.\n\nSince the start of my studenthousing activities I have  accomodated at least 50 students. This has resulted in many happy students and parents, see a few of their spontaneous reactions elsewehere on my Linkedin page. When now a room becomes available I do not need to advertsie as in the student circuits my reputation leads to many students that want to hire the room.\n\nCurrently I have real estate in Maastricht , Baarlo, Tegelen, Groesbeek, Nijmegen , Arnhem, Bemmel, Delft en Mol.\n\n\n",
