It consists of functional training in all departments of the company, Sales, Marketing, R&D, Finance, Operations and HR. It furthermore focus on the ability of participants to grow themselves in becoming a leader in the future. This is done by exposure to current leadership and sharing of knowledge by current leaders in small and big group sessions. \n\nNext to training the trainee is expected to make a contribution to the business by completing projects identified as both learning opportunities as business changing. I got the opportunity to work in two different projects: \n\n- Shopper Activation Belgium (May -July 2017)\nShopper activation is the activity of engaging the consumer on the shop floor to make them decide to buy your product. Either through promotion or marketing in store. This particular project was focused on developing shopper activation routines for the Belgium market and identifying gaps for the recently launched  Heinz \"Seriously good Mayonaise\".  This resulted in a plan to increase awareness and drive distribution for the Mayonaise and a strategic plan for 2018 to align Shopper Activation in Belgium with best practises from other business areas\n\n- Absolute Yield Loss and Allergen Storage in the Elst factory (Okt-Dec)\nAbsolute Yield Loss is the difference in theoretical raw materials needed to make one product and the extra raw material actually needed to make a product. With the help of the PDCA method I  indentified the main causes of yield loss in the Ketchup plant in Elst and developed solutions to reduce the yield loss in 2018. Next to this I helped in improving the Allergen Storage by developing tools and models with SAP and Excel to increase safety and reduce the risk of incorrect storage.",
