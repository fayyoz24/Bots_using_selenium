The project is funded by an ERC Advanced Grant.\n\nIn 2015, the international community adopted 17 \u2018Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 as part of a global \u20182030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019. Can such goal-setting, as a new central approach in global governance, help resolve the pressing challenges of economic development, poverty eradication, social justice and global environmental protection? The GLOBALGOALS project has been designed to address this research question and break new ground in sustainability and global governance theories. GLOBALGOALS will offer the first and most comprehensive data compilation, network mapping and comparative institutional analysis of the evolution, effectiveness and future prospects of \u2018global governance through goals\u2019 as a central novel steering mechanism in world politics. Our five\u2013year study programme deploys a unique set of cutting-edge methodologies to assess and explain the steering effects of the Sustainable Development Goals through a detailed investigation of their institutional arrangements and actor networks, at international and national levels. GLOBALGOALS is funded by the European Research Council through an Advanced Grant and directed by Prof Frank Biermann. The core research team is based at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht University, with a wide network of project affiliates around the world.
