    "summary": "I have more than 30 years experience in illustration and art. My work has a recognizable style: strong, graphic images perfectly in harmony with the idea and concept. I did commissions for newspapers, magazins, museums, publishers and theater. I'm interested in what's happening in the world and want my work to play a role in it. I find my inspiration in art, music and literature. I am self-motivated, open to any kind of commission and work well under pressure. Next to my illustration work, I'm an artteacher at St Joost Breda and Den Bosch. The combination af teaching and creating is for me ideal; by explaining to others what's important in making strong, convincing and attractive images I can keep on developing myself. Being in contact with the younger generations keeps me inspired and up with the times.",

I also made the logo's for the exhibition.\nFor Expo Terracotta I've made an animation for the exhibition and website about the Chinese Terra Cotta Army. \nFor The Airbornemuseum I illustrated two personal stories about the war for kids. They use the stories to discover details in the exhibition by placing stickers, designed by me, on the right spot in the story. 3d figures and postcards, are also made by me.",
