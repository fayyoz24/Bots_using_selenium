    "summary": "With over 9 years of experience in marketing technology and more recently mobile app development (since April 2022), I am passionate about creating innovative and engaging social platforms that connect people with shared interests and values. I am the founder of Social Club Platform, a company that aims to build a variety of apps that cater to different themes, such as food, drinks, music, sports, and more.\n\nMy most recent app, Letslicious, is the first product of Social Club Platform, and it invites people who are interested in the food & drinks theme to meet like-minded others and discover new places and cuisines. I built this app using Firebase, Flutter/Dart, and SwiftUI, which are some of the skills that I have acquired on a side project during my full-time employment. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools that can enhance the user experience and retention of my apps, as well as to explore new opportunities and partnerships that can expand the reach and impact of Social Club Platform.\n\nI graduated as a business admin bachelor from University of Toronto where I learnt the crucial aspects of successful business stories. My goal is to achieve that success with Social Club Platform apps.",
