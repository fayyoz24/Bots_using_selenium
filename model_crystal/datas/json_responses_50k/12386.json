Also responsible for B2B customers, like loyalty programs.\nA combination of using category management tools and my abilities to create long term relationships helped growing our sales every year. Remington has become one of the major players in personal care in The Netherlands. Also after the introduction of Russell Hobbs in 2011, business growth is stable and consistent. I successfully introduced Russell Hobbs in all my mayor accounts after the introduction.\nBusiness development is an important aspect of this role, also to ensure annual growth.\n\nI really enjoyed the wide range of trainings and courses. Besides several sales trainings, I also participated category management course and negotiation course (by Scotwork). This combination helped me to become a reliable business partner who had more to offer then a Spectrum Brands consumer product.",
