To inspire everyone that they can be the change they want to see in the world, I2C was formed. \n\nAs part of the management team, I have been involved as an volunteer at I2C stalls at different events. I had various tasks across different departments, such as:\n\u2022\tCreating organizational structure.\n\u2022\tCreating marketing tools in order to generate donations.\n\u2022\tIn charge of recruitments.\n\u2022\tIn charge of operations\n\u2022\tTaking the lead during various events. \n\n\u2022\tIn 2013, I have been involved in developing the first international project at Inspire2Care. During this two-week project, we donated several necessary items for a blood bank, a retirement home, and an orphanage. \n\u2022\tIn 2014, I have been involved in developing the second international project at Inspire2Care, which focused on elementary schools and medical camps. At the schools, several workshops were given focusing on the importance of basic hygiene, a clean environment and professions. At the medical camps, free health clinics were provided for the local villagers. \n\u2022\tIn 2015, Inspire2Care organized its first independent event, which included 30 stalls and numerous children\u2019s activities. Being one of the two contact persons and the main coordinator, I was highly involved during the first stages of planning until the cleaning after the event. This event helped increase the organization\u2019s image, experience, and funds.\n"
