To my direct initiation and discussion with the Head of School of Aerospace Engineering, our team got funded \u00a32000 for the challenge. Our team is representing Kingston University for the first time at the annual UAS challenge. \n\nWithin the competition teams have to design, manufacture, test and code a fully autonomous drone system, which has to be able to carry out series of mission scenarios. These scenarios include; autonomous flight, character recognition, payload delivery and reconnaissance. \n\nAlthough, our hexa-drone design was not finished by the challenge deadline I have managed to gain valuable technical competencies through the project;\t\n- I had the chance to apply my theoretical systems engineering knowledge to practice, \t\n- Gained valuable interpersonal, leadership and management skills,\n- Through the documentation of various design phases (Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, Flight Readiness Review) I have increased my engineering report writing and presentation skills.\n\nMahmood Mohamed Hassani - Team Representation and Social Media\nLewis Musk - Manufacturing and Assembly\nKelsea Karim Lydz - Lead Programmer\nSharoz Ibrahim - 2nd Lead Programmer\nToby Studhleer - Logistics\nVladimir Vailonkin - Avionics and Electronics\nAndres Tiivas - 2nd Lead Designer\nGaspar Dombovari - Project Manager, Lead Designer",

The hazardous  material was replaced with another fibre composited material, with similar thermodynamic properties.\n\nConsidering the fact that I had no experience before in industrial refurbishment and engineering projects, or had no previous education regarding engineering in college/university level, I proved to be a valuable member of the company's leadership and overseen a few more projects for the Libyan Iron and Steel Company.\n\nInitially, I was personally responsible for the identification and measurement of the contractual pipeline system. Through the 9-month long project, I had to maintain and update work progression in databases and involved in the day-to-day communication with shift leaders for pipe identification. I was responsible for the insulation material ordering from overseas, based on my measurements. Later on, I created CAD drawings from the contractual pipeline system for the LISCO, because due to the local fights, the original and as-built-as drawings were destroyed. As the project matured forward, I began to contribute to the laboratory and sampling procedures as well.\n\nI firmly believe overseeing such a high volume industrial engineering project in my early career, helped me to develop an insight view of engineering project operations and management throughout I feel I have acquired the required motivation, interest, passion to chase further experiences in the field of Engineering and Science.",

During the event my main role was to engage with the audiance ranging from Primary School children to adult science enthusiasts, with an interactive 'clue finding scenario' describing the importance of the ExoMars mission and introducing the Raman spectroscopy imaging. My contribution to the project was to extend and enhance the interactive learning activities by Augmented Reality (AR) elements."
