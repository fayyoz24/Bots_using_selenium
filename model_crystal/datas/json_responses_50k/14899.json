    "summary": "Over the past 12 years I have filled numerous management positions in different forms. The common denominator between these posts has always been my dedication to elevate organizations and the people in them.\n\nI pride myself on being able to keep the big-picture or end goal in mind. I am without a doubt solution oriented and result driven. I am a true believer that together mountains can be climbed and by continuing to put one step in from of the other we can get there. I aim to stay positive and forward-looking, with a sprinkle of to put things into perspective.\n\nI am happy to share my knowledge and experience to help organizations develop and improve processes. And I\u2019m open to learn from the experiences of others and their views. I am interested in innovative technologies and see change as constant. If I'm asked what I excel at, it's the way I connect people to collectively pursue goals, without losing sight of the individual. By nature, I often take on a leadership role in a group. I am motivated to \u2018build\u2019 within organizations, whether that means renovating or expanding.",

In addition, I developed and implemented future-proof software systems that support the abovementioned processes, \nDuring the process of organizational change, I proactively involved stakeholders, as I acknowledge the importance of input and buy-in. After all, if there is anything that stands in the way of success, it is operating in isolation.\nI have supported the management (C-level) by enabling and creating quantitative, real-time management reports.\nAlso, as a manager I led an international team (+10 employees). I had full HR and financial responsibility over the resources of my department. \nFinally, I built a team based on the principles of responsibility and trust. Two pillars that are the foundation for delivering continuous high-quality results.",

To underline this, I will use two relevant examples.\nAt Philips I led a combined on-shore/off-shore team. The goal of our assignment was to set up a standardized program administration together with the customer, based on KPIs and SLAs, with the aim of enabling an apples-with-apples comparison for the management team regarding the state of the running programs. Within the team, the Dutch team members worked on the design and development of service processes. After which, the institutionalized process was transferred operationally to our colleagues in India.\nAt Ahold Delhaize, I was active in mapping the existing purchasing process business unit and optimizing it, after which a supporting software system was implemented. In doing so, I went much more deeply into the process and technology to offer the right solution for this business unit.",

And consider processes as dynamic and supportive of strategic objectives.\nThis was my first work experience after my studies. I was particularly motivated to absorb new knowledge and experiences. This has resulted in the development of an accredited training course in collaboration with colleagues, in which the basic skills of PMO are explained.
