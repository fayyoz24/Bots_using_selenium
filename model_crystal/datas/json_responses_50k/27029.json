Therefore to provide both high capacity and flexibility, the transport of wireless and wireline signals is converging into a common telecommunication infrastructure. In this project, we focus on the study of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) optical phase modulated radio-over-fiber (RoF) system, which is a promising solution to implement broadband seamless wireless-wireline access networks. One important feature of phase modulated, radio-over-fiber systems, is their robust transmission, high spectral efficiency and high dynamic range properties, not achievable by conventional intensity modulated systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive theoretical and/or experimental study of the performance of these WDM RoF systems has been reported yet. Furthermore, the stringent requirements of future communications links in terms of capacity, flexibility and multi-service support, motivate us to undertake a concise assessment of the ultimate achievable performance of wireline/wireless converged systems. The goal of this project is to theoretically and experimentally investigate the performance of multi-channel phase modulated radio-over-fiber optical links for the transmission wireless and wireline signals. The timely generated knowledge in this project will contribute to extend the state-of-the-art and to enhance European research excellence and competitiveness in developing solutions for future telecommunication networks.\"",

All-optical label swapping (AOLS) is a type of optical packet switching that is intended to solve the potential mismatch between fibre capacity and router packet forwarding capacity. To date packet label processing has been carried out at the electrical domain.\n \nHowever, in order to achieve full transparency at the optical node it is necessary to perform this functionality at the optical domain. Likewise, the node optical layer needs to implement the required \"intelligence\" to look up the routing table and forwarding the packets. LASAGNE project aims at studying, proposing and validating the use of all-optical logic gates and optical flip-flops based on commercially available technologies to implement the required functionalities at the metro network nodes in AOLS networks. The optical gates are implemented using the same key building block: Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) incorporating semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), which results in a really flexible and scalable approach in terms of manufacturing.\n \nA functional photonic router prototype incorporating all-optical label swapping and wavelength conversion will be integrated using optical logic gates and optical flip-flops. This photonic router is featured as modular, scalable, and with potential of large system integration, what is achieved employing the same key building block in all in-node functionalities. The definition of the architecture of the AOLS node should be consistent with the proposed network scenario and protocols used. Both technical and economic implications of the proposed AOLS node structure and functionalities over the existing GMPLS-based services or protocols, and future European optical networks will be assessed. Moreover, intermediate solutions between a circuit-switched network and an AOLS network will be considered.\n",

            "description": "In the past decade we have witnessed a remarkable advance in all-optical signal processing techniques and rapid maturity in the fabrication of compact all-optical switches. All-optical computing has been the holy grail of researchers since the invention of the laser. Even though general purpose all-optical processing is still a long way off, there are specialized applications in high data rate telecommunications and networking, where ultra high speed, low complexity all-optical circuits are ideally suited. The next key step in all-optical technology evolution is to develop the means to manufacture compact and low cost arrays of all-optical gates, that is, to develop the capability for the VLSI of all-optical gates. MUFINS combines the efforts of 8 European research groups as the first step in this direction. MUFINS aims to demonstrate 2 and 4 element monolithically integrated arrays of packaged and pigtailed InGaAsP, 2x2 all-optical switches on single InP substrates for operation at 10 and 40Gb/s.\n \nTwo integration techniques will be used. The first will use active/passive integration based on regrowth and the second will use the Active Vertical Coupling technique to produce arrays of all-optical switches. The performance of the discrete 2 and 4 element arrays will be evaluated in multi-gate all-optical circuits such as, Clock and Data Recovery, single and 4-wavelength Burst Mode Receiver, Full-Adder, a 4x4 all-optical Switching Matrix, etc. Finally MUFINS will demonstrate a 3 gate, 40Gb/s all-optical Burst Mode Receiver hybridly integrated on a PLC sub-mount. The choice of the evaluation experiments was such as to show that generic, multi-element arrays of integrated all-optical gates can find application in different domains. By drawing through different application pools, MUFINS intends to assure that the developed multi-gate elements can have an adequate market to support them as products after the end of the project.",

While the data payload is modulated on the intensity of an optical carrier, the wavelength of the signal is assigned as the first optical label level; the second label level is modulated orthogonally to the data, by DPSK (or FSK) modulating the carrier. Network and node architectures will be compared regarding performance and costs. Also the physical layer behaviour will be analysed. Key optical components and modules will be made: fast modulatable widely tunable optical transmitters, optical stacked-label swapper, label-controlled optical cross connect and add/drop node, and multi-wavelength 2R regenerator. The modules will be integrated in a laboratory testbed and in a field trial jointly with two running IST projects. \n \nOBJECTIVES\nThe main objective is to improve the throughput of packet-switched networks by novel optical routing techniques based on stacked optical labels; supported by:- to evaluate the network possibilities of optical label switching theoretically- to demonstrate high-speed modulation and fast wavelength switching of widely tunable lasers- to develop multi-channel 2R regenerators in a hybrid technology- to develop optical-label-controlled cross connect and add/drop nodes- to study monitoring and control aspects of optical-label-routed networks- to build a limited network testbed and to validate the key functionalities in a laboratory testbed and in a field trial- to contribute to standardisation processes.\n ",

Therefore, the Cognitive Heterogeneous Reconfigurable Optical Network must be able to provide effective decisions on:\n\nhow to route traffic, either through existing lightpaths, new lightpaths or triggering a reconfiguration process of the virtual topology;\nhow to assign resources, not only wavelengths, but also the most appropriate transmission/switching technique, optical launch power, modulation format, bit-rate, etc., thus relaying in cross-layer design techniques;\nwhich elements should be powered on/off and when.\nThe CHRON project is funded by the European Commission in the Seventh Framework Programme, under the Objective 1.1 The Network of the Future (FP7-ICT-2009-5).",
