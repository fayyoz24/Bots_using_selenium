My role at this school was teaching the children the basics of English and supporting medical checks, but also help serving and preparing food and play with the children to make sure the teachers also get some rest during the break. After lunch the school closed and I worked at an orphanage in Arusha called Cradle Love Baby Home. The focus here was mainly on playing with the children and giving them attention, but also helping with practical stuff."
