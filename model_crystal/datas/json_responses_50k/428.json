I linked these to scenarios of future climate change to identify vulnerable areas. Results can be used to identify which kind of interventions can work for whom (which kind of farmers) and where (in the country). \n\nTasks:\n- coordinating household survey data collection in Uganda\n- analyzing large, cross-country household survey datasets\n- developing geostatistical model approaches for household survey data\n- presenting results at international conferences\n- reporting results in scientific publications\n- organizing seminars, workshops, symposia\n\nSkills:\n- Team work & collaboration skills: Managing an interdisciplinary project on spatial livelihood assessments, which resulted in 3 publications with 4+ co-authors\n- Excellent analytical skills: Analyzing large scientific datasets, which lead to the development of 2 frameworks for country-wide livelihood & vulnerability assessments\n- Strong leadership skills: Managing intercultural teams for data collection in Uganda and supervising 2 master students\n- Organizational talent: Organizing the Wageningen PhD Symposium, the graduate school annual symposium, career orientation seminars and the chair group\u2019s lunch meetings\n\nPartnerships:\nThe work was conducted with the Plant Production Systems Group (Wageningen University) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) with local support by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Uganda. The research was part of the 'Policy Action for Climate Change Adaptation' project of the CGIAR research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",
