In this thesis we take steps towards\ninvestigating their internal structure with scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis\n(SEMPA). To achieve this, a method needs to be found to stabilize skyrmions without magnetic\nfields, since SEMPA is impossible in magnetic fields. We propose using an in-situ focused ion\nbeam (FIB) to achieve zero field skyrmion stabilization in two ways. First, we can make use of the\nFIB to disrupt the crystal structure of a sample, changing the fundamental magnetic parameters.\nSecond, we can use the FIB to remove material outright, which creates confining structures. An\nextensive set of micro-magnetic simulations is performed to investigate skyrmion stability and\nnucleation in confined geometries, and we show that skyrmions can indeed be stabilized in our\nsamples at zero-field. Before we are able to use the FIB in experiments, a calibration procedure\nis required in the form of domain wall injection experiments. We then investigate changes in the\neffective anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), as a function of the amount of\nintermixing caused by Ga+ irradiation, by studying changes in domains and the internal structure\nof domain walls with SEMPA. We find indications of a decrease in DMI with Ga+ irradiation\nand increased variations of the DMI and effective anisotropy, which is as expected for increased\ninterface roughness after Ga+ irradiation. The investigations into the domain walls are mostly\ninconclusive, but they give the first indications towards understanding how the DMI changes with\nGa+ irradiation. With the results of these experiments, we come closer to imaging skyrmions with\nSEMPA, since we are able to predict skyrmion stability in confining geometries and enabled the\nuse of a FIB to tune magnetic properties.",

This project was a part of my masters degree and has been graded 7,5/10.\n\nIn this project I investigated phenomena occuring along grain boundaries in skyrmion crystals. Skyrmions are magnetic quasi-particles with a whirling spin structure and are promising candidates for future data-processing devices. The material which was investigated was FeGe with a cubic B20 crystal structure. B20 FeGe is known for hosting skyrmions in a hexagonal array (crystal) near room temperature under applied magnetic fields.\n\nWith this project, I formulated a recipe for reliably creating samples hosting numerous skyrmions and I investigated methods for inducing grain boundaries within the skyrmion crystal. Skyrmion dynamics were observed with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in the Fresnel mode. Indications were found for thermally driven dynamics. Interesting skyrmion deformations were observed in 5-7 defects occuring along the grain boundary. These defects were further investigated with Lorentz scanning TEM in DPC mode. From the DPC images, indications were found that the deformed skyrmions were actually made up of two conjoined skyrmions.",
