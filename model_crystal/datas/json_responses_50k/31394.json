    "summary": "I graduated from Aalto University and Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2013 as a double degree in Naval Architecture (M. Sc.). My master thesis topic was how to use a 3D product model into global finite element strength assessment. I have also taken exchange studies at Delft University of Technology during spring 2012.\n\nI lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 2006 to 2009 when I move to Finland to continue my studies. In August 2011 I moved to Trondheim, Norway for 6 months and later on moved to Delft, The Netherlands for another 6 months before I return to Finland where I stayed 2 and half years finalizing my studies and working as a sales manager. In 2015 I moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where I worked as a sales manager for Latin America until the end of 2016. In August 2017 I started as a Sales Manager in Groningen, The Netherlands.\n\nMy working career started in 2010 where I worked on several different tasks from market research, to software development, customer service and customer training all over the globe. In 2013 I started in Helsinki, Finland as a sales manager for Latin America where I was responsible for sales activities. During 4 months in 2014, I stayed in Kobe, Japan helping with customer service, sales, and other related matters. During May and June 2015 I joined back the Kobe helping with specific customer projects.  ",
