    "summary": "The world is ours!\n\nThe biggest part of who I am is to be found in my international background. \nAs a son of a Surinamese father and a Dutch mother, I\u00b4ve also spent 8 years of my young life on the beautiful island of Aruba. At secondary school in the Netherlands, I directly chose an international approach, a bilingual course where most of my subjects were taught in English.\nAfter finishing secondary school, I followed a 4 year Bachelor of Business Administration, with a specialization in Leisure Management, Entrepreneurship, and City Marketing.\nMeanwhile being a lot on the road during side-jobs and my first two full-time jobs, I discovered my passion for the transition to autonomous e-mobility.\nDuring my 3 years of living in Barcelona, I\u00b4ve worked for two companies that are contributing enormously to this transition.\n\nI discovered myself to be multifaceted.\nBest described by the following terms:\n\n- Ambitious Team Player (Fair play)\n- Assertive (With respect)\n- Internationally Oriented (No boundaries) \n- Innovative/Creative (Eye for opportunities)",
