I coordinated the budget, funding and organization of work shadow exchanges for Artikel 1 Midden Nederland, Holland Expat Center South and the Gemeente Utrecht. These representatives travelled to a similar organization in a fellow Migrascope country (Estonia, Sweden, Germany, Lithuania, Slovenia and Germany) to learn about diversity and inclusion practices that they could implement to their own workplace. I organized a panel on diversity and inclusion where these representatives presented their findings to Dutch stakeholders to encourage them to create a more inclusive workplace. To conclude the project, I created an online question tree e-tool that is used to educate and assist migrants in the Dutch labor market.\n\nOutside of Migrascope, I wrote project proposals, searched for funding opportunities and hosted workshops.",
