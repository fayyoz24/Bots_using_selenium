Through collectively overcoming social challenges in education, energy and housing, it is our belief that we are undertaking global poverty on a grass-roots level. Through what has become the world\u2019s largest crowd-sourcing initiative dedicated to solving global social challenges, the Hult Global Case Challenge seeks ideas and solutions from the world\u2019s best and brightest future business leaders that will cause a step-change in the vicious global poverty cycle\n",
