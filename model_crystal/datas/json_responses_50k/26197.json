    "summary": "I have finished my Ph.D. at ITC, University of Twente, The Netherlands where my domain of research was in the application of SAR Interferometry and deep learning for detecting geo-hazard-related anomalies. Previously, I have done a Masters in Geoinformatics from ITC and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), ISRO, Dehradun. My master's research thesis was related to the detection and characterization of oil spills using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar data. My skills include image classification and segmentation using deep learning methods, SAR polarimetry and interferometry. I am also a programmer and like to code in Python, Java, and C++. Prior to this M.Sc. I have completed an M.Sc. in Physics from Indian Institute of Science, Education, and Research (IISER), Mohali, India, where my research thesis was in the domain of Computational Physics and Quantum Mechanics. I have worked with the Energy and Wetlands Research group at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore for a small project on wastewater remediation. I have also briefly worked in the logistics sector where I have developed customized inventory and fleet management software. I have a passion for exploring science, SAR remote sensing, quizzing, football, and above all, contributing scientifically to the betterment of the world.",
