    "summary": "As a passionate professional I get energized when I am connecting (with) people and can think about strategic change management. During my international studies I was lucky enough to meet people from all over the world, who unexpectedly confronted me with a strange truth; we are sometimes unaware of our own behavior. I find this fascinating, whether it is due to interpersonal or cultural differences or differences of opinion. Trying to understand and utilize these differences to enable change is something I truly enjoy doing. \nIt seems that, given the turbulent times we live in, getting people motivated to change is becom-ing increasingly more difficult. However, I believe that with proper human-centric design, well organized communication, and a good amount of genuine enthusiasm, any intended change can become a success. \nFrom start-up to corporates, I was able to have a look in the kitchen of many different companies, enabling me to learn about organizational structures and methodologies like the lean start-up, agile, and scrum. Additionally, it is important to me to have a job that matters and strives to be excellent in more than just profit margins. This is why I push for sustainability and taking responsibility in your work. \nFinally, I am a proud lifelong learner of anything that piques my interest, whether it is cooking, gardening, or learning how to implement new technologies at one of our clients. I would also love to learn more about circularity in business context. \n\nDid you read something that you like? Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out! \n\n----- \n\nThis is how my name is often misspelled: Coen, Koon, Coon, Cowen, Cohen, Kowen, Kohen, Peeters, Petters\n\n#Sustainability #PeoplePerson #Startup #Technology #Projectmanagement #Scrum #Agile #Analytical #Circularity #Passionate #Purpose #Lifelonglearner",

I got several hours every week to work on contact optimisation within the call centre. APG is currently one of the best rated call centres in the Netherlands and they aim to stay that way. After some time of research, I brought a presentation containing 4 points of improvement to the management team, of which I got the opportunity to implement the first myself.

After living in Europe for 21 years and never leaving the continent (with one exception: New York City), was 2017 the travelling year for me. In just 12 months, I visited Singapore, Indonesia (Bali), backpacked through Thailand for three weeks and lived in Australia for half a year. I enjoyed these international experiences a lot and hope that, with time, I will be able to add a lot more international experiences to this list! The plans are already there!\nDuring my travels, I learned how to think on my feet, deal with cultural differences and culturally sensitive situations, planning detailed and structured trips and dealing with situations that don't go as planned. I also learned how to have an amazing trip with minimal resources and being independent.",
