    "summary": "My background is in banking and financial services but above all I create a client experience second to none. Having worked in financial services for almost 20 years, I excel under pressure and thrive in a fast paced work environment. But as much as I love dealing with numbers and finances, my passion is serving people. I am curious in nature which gives me the ability to connect with people on a personal level. When coaching my team to serve the public, it is my job to help people understand it's not what you say but how you say it. Before you can deliver an exceptional experience, you first need to listen and empathize.  When you listen, you begin to exceed a client's expectations and you create loyalty. Client experience will make or break your business. I build teams focusing on the strengths of the employees who want to fix problems and make the world a better place, one customer at a time. \n\nLiving in San Francisco, I served a diverse population.  I take every opportunity to learn about people and their culture(s) to create an environment that feels like home. I hire, coach and mentor my team to do the same. \n\nIn my spare time I find opportunities to volunteer for organizations that help our local community. In San Francisco, I participated in Rotary International because I believe we have the power to make the world a better place. I have hosted financial literacy seminars and youth programs that encourage kids to make sound financial decisions. I believe we can create peace through service to others. \n\nMy career in banking began almost 20 years ago.  But it is my degree in Social Work that gives me a different perspective on banking and client experience. I am committed to building genuine, long-term client relationships which inspire trust.  \n\nI just bought a home in Rotterdam, Netherlands to be with my husband where his music career flourishes.  I am looking for a position where I can use my knowledge and expertise to bring profitability and client retention to a growing business. ",
