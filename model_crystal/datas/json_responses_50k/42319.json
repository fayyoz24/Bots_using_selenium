    "summary": "Mechanical Engineering master student, currently starting with the track Biomechanical Design at Delft University of Technology. \nThe bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and a full year at the Dream Team Project MARCH convinced me even more hat the medical direction of Mechanical Engineering is the direction I want to explore.\nMy ultimate dream is to improve the availability of prosthetics world-wide. The fact that some people in the western world already have prosthetics that can move when the user thinks about it, makes it unfair that people in third world countries do not have access to it, while they even need it more to lead a normal life compared to people in the western world who have more resources and a better health care system. I hope I am able to improve this just a little but during my career.",
