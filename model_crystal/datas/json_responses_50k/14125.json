    "summary": "If I only have 3 words to describe myself, that would be: Aquarius, energetic and thoughtful. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how knowledgeable you are in astrology, all you need to know about Aquarius is that the sign is highly associated with being creative, exceptional and self-reliant. As an international student in Media and Communication, I live by and perform those characteristics everyday. I seek every opportunity to develop, challenge myself and widen my horizon because for me \u201cto define is to limit\u201d (Oscar Wilde).\n\nAs the word energetic already explained itself, whenever and wherever, you will always find me as a girl who has a smile on her face and a lot of energy. I believe a positive attitude is the most important driving force to accomplish almost anything, therefore, I also want to radiate with people around me.\n\nLastly, as an oldest sister in the family, an international student who lives in an international environment, a representation of generation Z in a technological world, the word thoughtful has a meaningful impact on me. More than just being nice to people, thoughtful means to genuinely care and be aware of our surroundings.",
