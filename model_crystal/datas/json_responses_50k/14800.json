I wrote a Retransitieplan as intermediary between KPN and Zuyderland. Goal of the document was to record the strategy as well as activities and deliverables in case of a retransition of services. The report included chapters about strategy, financials, agreements, etc. During the assignment I created a draft framework for the Retransitieplan and discussed the framework with the client. My client was the procurement director as well as the legal director at Zuyderland. I conducted interviews with stakeholders at KPN in order to fulfil requirements. The Retransitieplan was accepted by the client director from KPN as well as my stakeholders at Zuyderland. Both KPN and the Zuyderland were satisfied with the result. I wrote a similar report at Siza, a healthcare institution. \n\nAt Zuyderland I designed Service Level Agreement documents based on ITIL V3. I was in the lead for this project, as two colleagues wrote the documents. My role was to review/quality control and client interaction. I interacted with stakeholders at KPN as well as Zuyderland.\n",

When we arrived the project at Ahold already failed and the contract with the service provider was eventually terminated. In 2009, Ahold HR Services initiated an HR transformation project (HR business process outsourcing) up until 2012 when the contract was terminated. We were asked to prepare a lessons learned report to review the entire process from the beginning until the termination of the contract in order to gain an objective view on what went wrong. Four streams were identified for the analysis: Selection phase, Contracting phase, Transition phase and HR processes. Experts on these streams each wrote their analysis in order to identify the different obstacles that Ahold faced. My role was to coordinate the project process and to obtain an overview on these four streams. I conducted interviews along with the experts, wrote interview reports and worked on the final report which was presented to the HR Director Europe.",

On the basis of the obtained information so called \u2018Service Towers\u2019 where we identified and distinguished core- and non core activities (along with a financial analysis that Ahmad prepared in Excel). Main challenges for sourcing strategy assignments were to determine the impact of the change of the IT landscape in relation with the rest of the organisation.

A lessons learned report to review the entire process from the beginning until the termination of the contract was the end result for this assignment in order for the client to gain an objective view on what went wrong (and in which \u2018stream\u2019 or parts of the project the problems lie).\n\n\u2022 Management Consulting\n\u2022 Global Sourcing Advisory\n\u2022 Shared Services and Outsourcing Advisory\n\u2022 Strategic Sourcing Management\n\u2022 Strategy and Selection Advisory\n\u2022 Market Analysis\n\u2022 Outsourcing business case\n\u2022 Outsourcing implementation\n\u2022 Vendor Management\n\u2022 Benchmarking\n\u2022 Contract analysis\n\u2022 SLA analysis\n\u2022 Sourcing Strategy\n\u2022 Tender selection\n\u2022 Service Provider evaluations\n\u2022 Contract management\n\u2022 BPO/ITO\n\u2022 Governance, Solutions\n\u2022 high level Benchmarks\n\u2022 Cost Price / financial analysis\n\u2022 Service Tower analysis\n\u2022 Intercultural Management",
