My research mainly focuses on using machine learning for the security and verification of microservice applications running on a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThe Assurance and certification in secure Multi-party Open Software and Services (AssureMOSS) is to produce a coherent set of automated, lightweight techniques that allow software companies to assess, manage, and re-certify the security and privacy risks associated with the fast-paced development and continuous deployment of multi-party open software and services (for which we introduce the MOSS acronym). Ultimately, we aim at supporting the creation of more secure MOSS software. More information on the project is available at https://assuremoss.eu/en/",

The algorithm was developed to be run on the usual laptop or desktop. As a smaller dedicated hardware device has less computational resources, modifications would need to be made to the algorithm. My goal was to investigate what kind of changes/improvements we would need to make to the algorithm in order to let it run on a smaller dedicated hardware device. The work that is done in this internship is used for my Master Thesis.",
