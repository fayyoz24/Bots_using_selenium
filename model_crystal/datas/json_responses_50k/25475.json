To this end, I worked on single-Higgs combination, H(bb)H(tautau) analysis, and developing ML algorithms for particle identification (Xbb/Xcc flavor tagging).\nConnecting experimental results with theoretical development, I study the phenomenology of BSM Higgs models at the LHC as well as in early universe cosmology, namely electroweak phase transition and baryogenesis.",

Schwinger's result works for a constant field, but the created pair will absorb energy from the field and cause it to decay. Using proper time path integration, WKB approximations, and point-splitting to cure UV divergence, I derived corrections to account for this back-reaction and studies the full dynamics of the system.\n\nStability analysis of magnetically charged black holes in the Standard Model - Supervised by  Prof. Ana Ach\u00facarro:\nBlack holes with a large magnetic charge can destabilize the standard model vacuum near the horizon. This is due to the interaction between the strong magnetic field and W bosons, shifting the Higgs VEV and restoring electroweak symmetry. My project was a theoretical exercise to see some detailed calculations behind these arguments.\n\nEffective Field Theory interpretation for Higgs production at the LHC - Supervised by Prof. Tristan du Pree and Brian Moser:\nThe larger goal of this phenomenology study is to predict deviations from the SM in cross-sections at high energies. Then, comparing the results with the LHC Run-2 dataset will constrain the EFT model. We performed NLO analysis for EFT interpretations of the VHbb process using the SMEFTatNLO package for MadGraph.",
