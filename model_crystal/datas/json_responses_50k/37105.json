In the two frequencies, one is high frequency and another one is low frequency. This frequency can be decoded by the decoder IC into binary sequence & processed by logic circuit by giving each key a particular operation like moving forward, backward, right, left etc. The robot is controlled by making call to the mobile connected to the robot. The benefit is that we can operate the robot by using any mobile with the working range as large as the coverage area of the service provider.\n\nAlso we have developed an android application that generates this tones, by this way we have saved money of calling the other phone (Receiver) to transfer the tones to the robot to accomplish its task.",
