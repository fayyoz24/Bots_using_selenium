    "summary": "Entrepreneur and Innovator, skilled in destination marketing and tourism management, with great interest in design and photographic art.\n\nMy passion for traveling, graphic design, food and photography led me to explore different professional opportunities. Though I now listed a variety of things that I am passionate about, there are two things that they all have in common: the element of imagination and creativity.\n\nUp until now, I have traveled to 20 countries on 4 continents, and lived in 4 countries other than my home country and my journey of exploration is far from over. I draw my inspiration from places I have visited and the otherness that surrounds me when on a trip.\n\nAs a youngster I started my professional voyage in gastronomy, where I fell in love with the arts of cooking. For me it was only natural that I had taken an interest in hospitality, leading me to follow an educative program in hospitality and to partake in internships in hotels in Spain and the Netherlands, where I gathered experience in guest services, retail and the basics of management.\n\nMy internship in Spain had stirred up my fascination for the tourism industry. Therefore, I started studying Tourism, through which I learned about sustainable practices within the industry, (destination) marketing, financial management and strategic management and the German language.\n\nIn 2021 I have completed a master in Lund, Sweden and was co-founder of a new venture, together with a team of 4 likeminded go-getters. My main responsibilities included, but were not limited to:\n\n\u2022\tOpportunity recognition\n\u2022\tMarket research\n\u2022\tProduct development;\n\u2022\tB2B communication;\n\u2022\tGraphic design;\n\u2022\tBrand building & management.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy creating graphic art as well aa cooking and when I am home, I love to spend time with family and friends. My variety of curiosities support my zeal for creation and innovation, which assist me in inventive problem-solving, and autodidacticism for personal and professional development.\n\nDo you want to know more about me?

To do so, I did extensive desk research with the team to list the pain points.\n\nThese pain points were condensed by identifying \"catalyst moments\" to uncover the core pains that would be addressed in further (online) experiments.\n\nI co-facilitated an assumption mapping workshop to map the riskiest assumptions around the identified core pains and conducted a series of online experiments through Facebook and Google Ads. This also included (ad) copywriting, creating several surveys and designing several landing pages to further (in)validate the core pains.\n\nUsing the validated core pains, multiple in-depth interviews were conducted with pre-pet owners and pet owners to understand their needs, behaviors and motivations. By combining the quantitative data with the qualitative insights, four distinct mindsets were created by applying mindset segmentation. This ultimately led to the development of an initial solution approach, which we tested through additional online advertising and by determining which mindsets could potentially be early adopters.",

However, for me, it did not stop at just following procedures and recipes, as I felt a personal responsibility to provide our guests with the best experience possible. \n\nDuring my work at Osho's Place, I always made sure to deliver service with a smile and I learned to think in possibilities when facing a problem. Also, I have faced several situations, in which I had to work under pressure and learned how to be even more comfortable delegating and coordinating tasks during my shifts.",

The marketing and communication plans were devised according to NBTC\u2019s strategy to combat overtourism on the one hand, but also to create more awareness for the lesser-known areas in the Netherlands.\n\nI have had the pleasure to support my colleagues of the marketing department in marketing areas in the Netherlands that would otherwise be unknown to international visitors by setting up online and offline campaigns, for the summer and winter of 2019. Furthermore, I supported my colleagues with the creation of press releases, newsletters, I personally guided influencer tours and directed campaign videos for Belgium, Germany & the United Kingdom and I was in direct contact with the partnering regions and provinces for the campaign. Upon completion of the parts of the marketing campaign, I created reports for each partner region, with the performance of social media and visits on their page on holland.com.",
