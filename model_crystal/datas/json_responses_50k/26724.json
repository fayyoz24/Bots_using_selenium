I'm curious minded and always want to know how things and processes work. I believe that learning is key to developing myself and to maximise my value and potential as a person. I see learning as a must and a continued path for my future career growth. I have creative problem-solving skills that allow me to break down complex tasks into meaningful insights and recommendations. I am happy working in a structured team environment or on dedicated individual assignments. I like to think of myself in terms of values: critical thinking, humour and kindness. I am seeking to use my chemical, research, finance and investment skills in a meaningful and lasting way within a company that shares values that align to mine.",
