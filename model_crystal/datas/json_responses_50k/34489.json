    "summary": "Vinozita is a #1 bestselling author, vocal coach, mindfulness teacher and event organiser. She was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina. Her mother was Marija Simonovic (opera singer/professor), and her father was Zoran Simonovic (film & theatre actor/poet). \n\nDuring her study at Prva Gimnazija in Sarajevo she was chosen to go to the USA as an exchange student. She graduated with honours from Marksville High School in Louisiana, and won singing awards in LMTA District Music Rally. She was admitted with music scholarship to Loyola College of Music in New Orleans, as well as the Northwestern State University in Natchitoches (majoring in Music Performance). When she came to the Netherlands during the following summer, she fell in love with the country. Therefore, she continued her education at the Prins Claus Conservatorium in Groningen, where she graduated Cum Laude, majoring in vocal and music performance Jazz/Musical. She had the honour of performing for the Dutch Queen Beatrix. Vinozita attended lessons by many acclaimed vocalists, instrumentalists and actors from Holland, Denmark, Brazil, the UK, the USA and Africa. \n\nVinozita is the founder/CEO of Vinni's Zangschool - an acknowledged private singing school in the Netherlands, attended by a record number of students (up to 73 individual vocal students per week). \n\nA sudden and profound shift in consciousness she experienced in 2014 changed her life completely. \n\nHer love of learning about different cultures has already led her to 32 countries on 5 continents. Since 2018 she also resides on the Greek island of Crete.\n\nIn 2019, her book You Are the Present: Waking Up From a Thousand-Year Dream held the #1 Best Seller Rank on Amazon for twelve consecutive weeks in the categories: Health/Human Relationships, Politics/Social Sciences and Philosophy/Incorporeality. It also reached the highest ranking in the Kindle Store Top 100 on more than one occasion.",

                    "description": "In 2014, Vinozita experienced a totally unexpected and profoundly transformative inner realisation. It changed her life completely, and her priorities shifted instantly. In early '15 she put on hold all her busy music-related work and social media activities, in order to explore and better understand the indescribably overwhelming joyful peace that didn't seem to have any tangible cause, yet had remained within her every day ever since.\n\nShe began researching Karma Yoga and Mindfulness, and attended educational retreats in Norway and Costa Rica (over 90 hours of live teachings from the #1 bestselling author Eckhart Tolle, as well as Qi Flow Yoga/Presence Through Movement sessions with Kim Eng). She extensively explores insights and various forms of meditation that are arising intuitively during her process of inner awakening.\n\nIn '17 and '18 she conducted a series of well-received and well-attended wellbeing coaching projects in the Netherlands, that were composed of mindfulness-based counselling, guided meditation, Qi Flow Yoga and music.  \n\nHer writings are replete with intuitive findings and descriptions of her 'baby steps' of inner awakening. Her first partial manuscript was warmly received by Tami Simon, CEO of international multi publishing company SoundsTrue, when Vinozita personally handed it to her in '16 as a gratitude gift for organising the Deepening Presence retreat in Costa Rica. This emboldened her to continue writing. In '18, her completed manuscript received encouraging feedback from the literary agency The Blair Partnership in London. In January '19, Vinozita's first book became an unexpected #1 Best Seller on Amazon.nl in multiple categories. It held this rank for 96 days in a row.\n\nIn December '19 she founded Bright Life Events & WellBeing Coaching.",

Live on Dutch TV she performed the song that was written specially for Her Majesty, and the studio recording of that duet song was handed to the Queen as a present after the performance. This performance received positive reviews from the newspapers. Vinozita felt privileged to sing with the international star James Taylor during his workshop at the Conservatorium, and she has also had other various television and radio performances.\n\nShe is a songwriter, as well. Her style is inspired by jazz, pop and traditional music. Five studio albums have been recorded with all music / lyrics / vocals / backing vocals / piano / keyboard and percussion by Vinozita herself. These CDs were published on a relatively modest scale and under her personal management, and they sold out.\n\nVinozita was honoured when she was approached by the former producer of the highly acknowledged DJ Tiesto for a collaboration. She was also featured in a conservatory advertisement during the renowned North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam, and was once on the cover of the yearly Prins Claus Conservatorium brochure.\n\nNevertheless, she has always had a preference for guiding, motivating and managing others - rather than having \"the spotlight\" only on herself.\n\nFor additional information and photo albums: Vinni Simonovic Facebook page*\nFor some of her music: Vinozita YouTube channel*\n\n*Kindly note that most of the information dates before 2015 due to her social media sabbatical",

Vocal students are given a unique opportunity to perform with highly accomplished live bands (acknowledged musicians of the Netherlands, Edison Award winners etc.). These students can also choose to accompany themselves on piano, guitar, accordion etc. or bring their own band to perform with. Because of the wide variety of cultural backgrounds* of these performing students, a large diversity of music genres sung in different languages is encouraged. Guest performances at some of these concerts are by well known singers and bands from the Dutch province of Drenthe - some of whom are Vinozita's former students. Besides planning, organising and managing these events, she is also a host / presenter, pianist and backing vocalist (if needed), as well as enthusiastic motivator and emotional supporter of the performing students. There is always quite an attendance at these concerts and Vinozita is recurrently approached by various venues for organisation of such events. \n\n*The cultural backgrounds of Vinozita's students have been about 70% Dutch, but also German, Finnish, Romanian, Turkish, Moroccan, South African, Sierra Leonean, Angolan, Surinamese, Argentinian, Mexican, Brazilian, Chilean, Indonesian, Thai and Indian.\n\nPhoto albums of student concerts: Vinni Simonovic Facebook",

She has taught hundreds of vocal students since 2002, and some of them are quite successful in the Netherlands, as well as in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Spain. She feels privileged to have had up to 73 individual vocal students per week - the largest number of individual vocal students in the Netherlands from 2008 to 2015. \n\nDemo recordings of vocal students Vinozita made in her studio (as a producer / arranger / pianist and/or backing vocalist) were aired on radio. She is often approached to be a judge at various Dutch singing contests, and has more than once been offered a position as a vocal / music coach at several renowned music colleges and academies in the Netherlands. In 2015 she was also honoured to be considered as a guest teacher at an educational music project at the National Conservatoire of Performing Arts in Victoria, the Seychelles. Besides being occupied with vocal coaching at her singing school, she was also giving master classes in the Netherlands. \n\nShe developed an elaborate conservatory preparation program for vocal performance majors. A number of her students have successfully graduated (or are currently studying) at Jazz Conservatories and Pop/Rock/Musical Academies in the Netherlands. Some of her vocal students have had number 1 hit songs in various European charts, and some are winners of popular Dutch TV talent shows with millions of viewers. Some of them are also winners of various prestigious Dutch music awards. \n\nMore information about her students can be read in the chapter below.",
