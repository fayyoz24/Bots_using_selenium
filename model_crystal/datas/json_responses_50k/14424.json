In the optical lab of BMPI, a two-photon microscope was already built. I set up experiments to test how well the microscope performs quantitatively. \n\nSome key aspects of my thesis were producing phantoms that replicate skin tissue in a biochemical lab, working with a high intensity Ti:Sa laser in an optical lab, understanding the physics behind a two-photon excitation microscope, and analyzing results to show certain flaws of the microscope such as astigmatism.\n\nFor a few months, I was really a member of this research group, actively taking a part in group meetings and scientific paper discussions, and observing how experienced members were doing their research, from which I learned a lot.",
