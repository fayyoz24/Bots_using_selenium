Main goals for this project was to design an as lightweight as possible and easy to manufacture torsion link. This was done in a group of 3 people. After that two groups were combined into one large group. With that group we had to design the rest of the landing gear system. We had to perform a research into existing systems and end end up with our own system. The end product was a report in which the calculations were performed on the system, including safety factors and dimensioning of the landing gear. Also a complete CATIA drawing was made to visualize our design",
