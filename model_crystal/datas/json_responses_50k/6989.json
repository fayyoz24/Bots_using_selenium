    "summary": "I have worked in a teaching role with senior responsibilities (on the verge of becoming an Associate Professor) in an illustrious medical college in India for 7 years after my post-graduation in medicine. In 2008 I took up the opportunity to invest in pursuing a PhD in medical education in the Netherlands, which was not then possible in India. \nI have been instrumental in setting up the department of Research in Education at VUmc School of Medical Sciences in 2012, and headed this department until 2020. I currently work as Professor on Inclusion and Motivation in Health Professions Education and Research Programme Leader at Research in Education at Amsterdam UMC-location Vrije Universiteit. I currently conduct direct supervision of 13 PhD students; 6 PhD students have graduated from my programme. I have been able to secure external funding (>1 million Euros) for research. My vison for education is to develop \u2018students for life\u2019.\nMy work in educational practice includes being a small group instructor in the Faculty of Medicine Vrije Universiteit Bachelor students, research internship coordinator for Research in Education for Faculty of Medicine Vrije Universiteit Master students, being a member of Committee Research Internships at Faculty of Medicine Vrije Universiteit and practical application of the research being done in my department into the curricular practices, serving as an Examination Board member (2013-2020), advising on important educational activities and developing a training course for students to obtain a teaching qualification.\nMy most significant achievements include being awarded the \u201cNVMO Best PhD Thesis Prize 2014\u201d in medical education, being welcomed as an International Scholar on Self-Determination Theory of motivation, being the Chief Organizer of the 7th International Self-determination Theory Conference, and being chosen for the Fellowship of Karolinska Institute Prize for Research In Medical Education 2019. \nI was a Visiting Professor at University of Indonesia for their Master of Medical Education programme from  2020 to 2021.
