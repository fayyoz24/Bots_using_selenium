The new world of work makes it possible for people to be more flexible in choosing where and when they work.  However, the biggest change will take place within each person involved. On the one hand employees will experience more freedom which in return requires them to take on and show more responsibility and planning skills. On the other hand managers will need to focus more on the end results and trust their employees to make the right choices in how to achieve these. Also the manager will need to keep the team spirit alive with everyone working in different locations and at different times.  \n\nTherefore, the new manager will be more of a coach and the new employee will be more of an entrepreneur. An optimal working relationship between them requires integrity, trust and honest and open communication.",
