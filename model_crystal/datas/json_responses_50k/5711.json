    "summary": "I am an idealist who wants everybody to drink sustainably produced coffee and bananas.  \n\nGrowing up in Honduras, I lived in a society that greatly needed change. Because I am half-Dutch and have a hardworking mother, I was one of the privileged kids to obtain a bilingual education and study abroad. Moreover, I wanted my educational path to focus on developing social-changing skills. Consequently, I studied International Development Management, where I learned how to lead a project, research, and manage stakeholders. Throughout my study, I developed an interest in agricultural-related products. More specifically, supply chain setups and coffee captured my attention. It did not take long before I encountered the system's flaws and counter-initiatives like the Fairtrade movement, organic production, Fairchain, and many more. This is how I got involved with ethical business and sustainable value chains. \n\nAfter living in the Netherlands for more than four years, the gap in inequality in this world has become very clear to me. Business, as usual, is enlarging this gap, and something has to be done. I am keen on social enterprises that are up to this challenge of disrupting standard practices to bring social equality around the globe.\n\nAs for my personality, I am an internationally oriented,  independent, and critical thinker.",
