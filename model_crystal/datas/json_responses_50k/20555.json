    "summary": "I have more than 7 years of teaching in diverse classes. Mostly, I teach students from preschool age to elementary but since my majorship is Special Education I basically teach students based on their mental age that includes adults as well in various and/or multilevel-classroom settings; private and public schools in the Philippines. (2011-2017)\n\nMy practice teaching was in Kaoshiung, Taiwan. (2011)\n\nAlong these years, I also became an Online-English Instructor for almost 2 years. (2011-2013) \n\nLast year of July 2017 I was invited to teach in Osan, South Korea as an English Teacher. I handled and taught students in a small group (ages 5-12) for 50 minutes per class. The classes were more like a play-group based, fun and interactive, hands-on and focus on daily- life skills environment where English was the medium of instruction.\n\n",
