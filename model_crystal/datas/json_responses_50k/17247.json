    "summary": "A decade ago, my journey as a software professional began with Java training. However, I never got the chance to work on real-time Java projects. Despite this, I can still comprehend Java code. After completing my training, I was assigned a project as an ORACLE DBA on my first day. Since then, I have worn many hats in various roles, including Techno-functional consultant and business analyst.\n\nI am an inquisitive individual who always wants to know the why, how, and what of things. \nMy experience in the technical field enables me to comprehend developers' language and act as a liaison between them, allowing me to understand business requirements both in traditional and Agile ways. Through my work with multi-vendor, multi-location, and multi-culture-based teams, I have learned that communication with the right stakeholders at the appropriate time is crucial for problem-solving.\n\nI love conversing with people and learning about their perspectives, and I derive immense pleasure from bringing together different elements to achieve a common goal. As someone who adapts easily and embraces change, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn. These qualities have also enabled me to work efficiently in Agile environments, where I serve as a Scrum Master, guiding my team to remain focused and shielding them from external distractions.\n\nIf you would like to learn more, let's connect and discover together.",
