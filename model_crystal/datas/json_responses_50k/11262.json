Opening and closing of the grab is controlled by introducing a speed difference between the hoist and the close drive. At the same time lifting a grab full of ore requires both movements to work together and perform a load balancing act during hoisting or lowering. This an in house developed control acting on both movements.\n\nThe trolley is a straight forward movement with a positioning control system. Depending on the current position of the grab and some other parts of the crane the trolley's target will be set to a safe value.\n\nAnother main movement, although not used so often, is lifting the boom. Lifting and lowering of the boom is done through an automatic sequence. The sequence handles all the necessary steps to lift and secure the boom or to lower and prepare for operation.\n\nThe gantry movement electrical and hydraulic specification were not yet finished. Therefore not part of my task.\n\nMy part was designing and developing the Siemens S7 PLC program for these movements using a Siemens 400-series with safety I/O. Connected to a PC running WinCC.",

By presenting a fictitious assignment where they needed to develop a particle system for a customer.\n\nThe problem was broken down in pieces they can understand. Every week we build a part of the problem. This was done live so they could follow the reasoning during the process and type along. Questions were addressed as they came up. Keeping in my the difference in programming experience the students have, which lay between 0 and 8 years.\nTopics passed during the lessons:\n- Using the team foundation services\n- Using the test capabilities of Visual Studio\n- Scratching the surface of WPF\n- Basic C# features and object orientation\n- Debugging applications\n",

By presenting the language in clear steps and using examples on subjects they can relate to, I've managed to get them engaged and interested.\nThe lessons were practical by nature starting with a short explanation of a keyword or a programming principle followed by an example which was made up on the spot. By going through my thought proces in a verbal manner, they could understand the steps involved in creating a program/script. Of course whenever something within these steps was not clear to the students the step would be broken down even further. Sometimes even spinning of a new example.\n",

While this is mostly C++ I've created a wrapper for Python. This way the testers could write tests using Python as their language. Which significantly lowered the entry level barrier. Some parts of the development were of course team efforts.\n\nTechnologies used were C++, Python, Qt as a library, PLC-Sim Advanced PLC-simulator from Siemens, Siemens TIA-portal, Siemens S7-1500 Series PLC's.\n\nWithin this time period I've been also acting as the Scrum master for approximately 6-7 months.\n",

These were my main projects.\nStarted learning the Pascal programming language by developing small utilities. Helping debugging some of the installed applications. This came in handy while troubleshooting at customer sites as a service engineer. Able to handle the electrical, PLC and PC related applications.\nLearned the C++ language. Started by porting the Pascal applications with some redesigning to fit the C++ programming paradigm.",
