    "summary": "I have a burning need to ask questions. And my favourite subject is people. I love discovering what makes them tick, understanding their motivations and witnessing their 'aha!' moments. \n\nIn my 8+ years experience at packaging design, integrated and digital agencies, I have been the bridge between brand and consumer. I help clients pinpoint their unique angle and tailor messaging and content strategies that will best engage their intended audiences at the right moment in the right way. \n\nI am always on the lookout for the new and fresh to add to my arsenal. Be it a human insight, a fun fact, or something wildly unnecessary (yet cool!) that could be of some use in the future.",
