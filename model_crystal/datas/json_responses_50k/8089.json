    "summary": "I am currently studying International Business at Maastricht University, one of the top university in the country and in Europe. International Business is one of the most competitive courses offered at the university and includes subjects such as Economics, Finance, Management, and other business-related programmes. \n\nThe innovative teaching methodology, PBL (Problem Base Learning) has enhanced my critical thinking and collaborative skills by always challenging me to think in team work scenario.\nNonetheless, Maastricht international rate has allowed me to be surrounded by different nationalities, thus increasing my international perspective and contributing to my development as an outgoing and\nopen-minded individual.\n\nMy working experiences have been a valuable supplement to my academic pursuits, enhancing my time management, communication, and organizational skills. For instance, as a consultant for 180 Degrees Consulting, I have been able to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world situations by working in teams on management consulting projects, competitor research, and financial overviews for major firms across the United States and Canada. This experience has strengthened my teamwork skills and time management abilities by allowing me to balance my academic workload and professional responsibilities.\n\nAs a Junior Analyst at Sigma Investments, I had the opportunity to attend numerous workshops delivered by companies such as ING and JP Morgan, in addition to many student-led activities. In my role as a Junior Analyst in Financial Services and Real Estate, I was responsible for conducting in-depth financial analyses and assessments of various companies, as well as developing investment strategies and evaluating market trends. Through this experience, I was able to sharpen my analytical and problem-solving skills, while also gaining practical experience in the field of finance. Furthermore, being a part of Sigma Investments allowed me to further develop my communication and teamwork skills by collaborating with other analysts to reach a consensus on investment decisions. Overall, my experience at Sigma Investments has not only deepened my knowledge of finance, but also prepared me to be a successful Analyst in the future.",
