Towards this goal, an extensive structural and statistical analysis\nof high-resolution protein structures available in Protein Data Bank (PDB) has allowed\nus to discern the geometric and structural basis of Sulfur mediated non-covalent\ninteractions. This study has given unprecedented insights into the role of Methionine\nand cysteine in protein architecture. In addition to the computational analyses, I\ncarried out some biophysical and biochemical assays to investigate the role of Ch-bond\nin molecular recognition. For this purpose, I carried out fluorescence spectroscopic\nbinding assays on the chosen model system \u2018Methionyl-tRNA synthase (MetRS)\u2019.\nDisruption of Ch-bond caused a four-fold reduction in ligand binding, demonstrating\nthe importance of Chalcogen interaction in ligand recognition.",
