    "summary": "I am a political scientist and international development specialist with a focus on conflict, peacebuilding, democracy, corruption, and anti-corruption policies, primarily within the context of sub-Saharan Africa. I also provide advisory services to governments and international organizations on strategies to promote peacebuilding and sustainable development in post-conflict countries.\n\nCurrently, I am the Chair of the Program Council and an Assistant Professor of Public Policy and International Development at Leiden University in the Netherlands. My roles encompass educational innovation, student coaching, community engagement, and research. I teach courses in public policy, international development, African politics, human security, and peace and conflict studies. I've received prestigious awards for teaching, including the 2021 Leiden University Best Teacher of the Year Award and recognition as one of the Top 4 Best Teachers in the Netherlands in 2022. In 2023, I established the Leiden University Future-Ready Coaching Academy (FRCA) to enhance student well-being and equip them with essential job market skills through soft skills training.\n\nBefore joining Leiden University, I held pivotal roles as a policy and development specialist with organizations like the World Bank Group, the United Nations, the British Council, and the Nigerian government. I've also taught and mentored students at institutions including Maastricht University Graduate School of Governance (MGSoG), the United Nations University (UNU MERIT), and the American University of Nigeria (AUN).\n\nRegarding my academic background, I have received interdisciplinary education, culminating in my Ph.D. in public policy, governance, and development from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, where I was honored with a scholarship from the United Nations University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree in international development studies from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, where I was recognized as a Clarendon Scholar. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Lagos in Nigeria, where I was a Chancellor Scholar. Additionally, I have recently enhanced my skill set by completing a six-month Coaching Certification program at the NeuroLeadership Institute in the UK.",
