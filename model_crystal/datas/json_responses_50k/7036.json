This encouraged me to develop \"Vandals.\" While traditionally associated with those who perpetrate destruction, defacement, or damage, our objective diverged greatly. We aimed to promote reparations, preservation, and conservation.\n\nRather than tearing down, we sought to uplift. Our focus was on utilizing available resources to rejuvenate deteriorated spaces in orphanages and schools around Maputo, Mozambique. We painted murals over dilapidated walls and structures and actively engaged the children in our artistic endeavours. Our efforts demonstrated that by embracing conservation and creativity, we could positively impact both the physical spaces and the individuals within them."
