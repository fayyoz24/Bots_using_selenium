    "summary": "Welcome to my profile!\n\nI am Jesse van der Plas, born in The Hague, work and organization psychologist and consultant at LTP. In my work I advise organizations to make better decisions with regard to the selection and development of their employees through insights from psychology and organizational sciences.\n\nMy passion in my work is to support my clients in such a way that they are able to perform their work as well as possible. I do this by advising on assessments, providing training and workshops and thinking about HR topics. My goal is to work together harmoniously, to keep on agreements and not to avoid any barriers. At LTP I am also the secretary of the works council. In 2019 I participated in the LTP Academy - an internal course focused on (personal) leadership.\n\nIn addition to my work, I enjoy singing in the Convivium chamber choir in Amsterdam, I do sports, I cycle through Amsterdam and I love meeting friends!\n\nDo you want to know more? Feel free to call or email!\n\u2706 +31 6 83 66 1305\n\u2709 J.vanderPlas@ltp.nl",

By adding an assessment to your selection procedure or development program, one reduces the chances of drop-out and increases the productivity and enjoyment of one's employees.\n\nHOW WE HELP\nLTP cooperates with various organizations from various sectors in the field of selection, development, career and (team) coaching. Our (online) assessments provide you with insight in personality, agility, intelligence, pitfalls and competencies of your (future) employees. With the data generated from these assessments, we can also help you with issues in the area of \u200b\u200bstrategic personnel planning and HR analytics.\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nI have had many different roles at LTP. I started as an intern in December 2014 as part of my master Work & Organizational Psychology and during that internship I developed an instrument to provide insights into risks related to integrity and derailments. Then I worked for two years at the Client Center of LTP. The Client Center of LTP is at the heart of LTP's online assessment services. With a team of service-oriented young professionals with knowledge of psychology and IT, users, customers, candidates and colleagues can contact them for questions, comments and advice about the best assessment solution. Since 2017 I have been working as a consultant in the LTP Online team in the role of psychologist, consultant and account manager for a number of organizations.\n\nRESULTS\nLTP is rewarded by its customers with a score of 95.4% customer satisfaction (CEDEO).\n\nKNOW MORE?\nDo you want more information?
