    "summary": "My dynamic role at Hourlux entails working with a portfolio of unique global brands such as QLOCKTWO, SwissKubiK, Scatola del Tempo, DaqiConcept, Wonder Machines and EMspec. The departure from the fashion industry to luxury accessories and interior objects has been a flawless transition due to my love of beautiful product and design. Marketing what you love is then akin to second nature. I apply a combination of established Marketing theories complemented by Digital Marketing tools to achieve key objectives.\n\nI\u2019m always researching and studying current trends and developments, not only in Marketing but also in Business Strategy, to master a holistic approach in my role. Being from South Africa and working within an international team with diverse cross-cultural influences, creates an energetic work space filled with ideas. I thrive on this. It drives me and always challenges my norms to think creatively and drive business to the next level.",
