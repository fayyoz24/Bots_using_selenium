    "summary": "For the last four years I've lived in the Netherlands, where I started out running a small, entrepreneurial firm providing consulting services for tourists traveling between the US and the Netherlands, and later became an associate within a holiday real estate investment company that renovated, owned, and managed numerous vacation and short-term rental properties throughout the southeastern US.  I am a graduate of Arizona State University with a Master of Sustainable Tourism, and previously earned a Bachelor's degree that focused on Cross-Cultural Psychology from the University of North Florida.  I'm currently living in 's-Hertogenbosch, and am now seeking a tourism, marketing, or sustainability career opportunity, preferably in the Randstad or Eindhoven areas.",
