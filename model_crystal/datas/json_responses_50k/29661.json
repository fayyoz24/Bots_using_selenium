    "summary": "My years at Mapper make up an interesting journey, both for myself and the company. Starting out as simulation engineer in the electron optics team, I have made considerable contributions to the design and development of our maskless electron lithography tool. By now I have done work on most subsystems of our machine and my System Engineering title is both well earned and descriptive. I have an inquisitive and analytical mindset and I love to dig deep into issues and find elegant solutions. Playing in a team or taking the lead of complex projects, seeing them through to successful implementation can be just as exiting. I am looking for challenges that give me the right mix of these possibilities.",
