    "summary": "\"What's the use of your education if you haven't created an impact in the world\"\n  \nI try to approach things from an entrepreneurial mindset, having gained relevant technological skills from my past experiences. I have won several hackathons and various technical competitions in the past year owing to a combination of my technological background, creativity, pitching skills, and business acumen.\n\nMy education in both electrical engineering and computer science has allowed me to be familiar with most aspects of both hardware and software. I am proficient in various fields needed in the development of a technological product from the ground up from low-level analog electronics, digital electronics, communication protocols, backend for data aggregation to high-level front-end interface for the end user & actuation with deep learning and network science at the top level.\n\nGot accepted for a D.Phil at the University of Oxford in the UK but ended up pursuing my Ph.D. at TU Delft (funded directly by faculty) allowing high flexibility in my research areas on the intersection of climate science, machine learning, and IoT. I graduated cum-laude in both MSc Embedded Systems and MSc Computer Science from TU Delft in 2022 owing to a period as visiting student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Senseable City lab which led to two papers (submitted to the journals Nature Sustainability and IEEE IoT). I further obtained entrepreneurship annotation during my master's studies. My specialization in the domain of optimization and networking aspects of embedded systems, and the artificial intelligence domain for computer science enables me to modularise and ideate based on raw hardware and software, from ground-up. I am mainly interested in IoT, hardware-based sensing, and applied problems in machine learning.",
