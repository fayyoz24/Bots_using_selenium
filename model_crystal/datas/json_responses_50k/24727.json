    "summary": "I'm an ambitious and goal oriented engineer. I work hard, set goals for myself and go out of my way to achieve these goals. I enjoy the challenge of new problems and try to tackle and analyze them until I come up with solutions.\n\nI have extensive experience with Python and SQL, having done countless projects with it. I enjoy working with scripting languages, whether it is for personal or professional use.\n\nIn a team environment I maintain oversight on all topics. Having led several projects in my academic career, I am able to communicate well with all members and external partners, keeping everyone up to date with the latest project developments.\n\nI graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I got my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2015, also at the University of Texas at Dallas.",

The purpose of the system was to remain at or near a constant 800 rev/min while disturbances such as AC/headlights turning on/off were applied. This caused a drop in rpm and was solved using various control techniques such as root locus, PID, linear quadratic regulators and feedforward control. I successfully achieved the design goals by reaching zero steady state error, fast settling time, low overshoot ",

The company needed a way to passively damp a rigid steel box that took measurements. The damping was needed to reduce noise and to get more accurate data from the tracks and GPS. We designed an isolation system that that reduced noise and disturbances of the provided vibration profile. We used tools such as SolidWorks, MATLAB, and Adams to model and analyze our design. We met every deadline and delivered a prototype vibration system to the company. ",
