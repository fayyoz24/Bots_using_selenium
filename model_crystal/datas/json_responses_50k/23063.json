    "summary": "Children are a huge value to the world for what we need to\u00a0appreciate and encourage them in a most loving way. To do so I believe that it is important to adapt to new practices and teaching strategies, all while keeping the main goal which is a well-being of a child. \n\nCreativity and motivation for learning were important to me while choosing different methods adjusted to cognitive development of a child and for encouraging their potential. Apart from providing safe and caring environment my centre of attention is on nurturing each child's individuality.  \n",
