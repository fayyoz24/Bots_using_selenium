    "summary": "German expat. Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Curious and resilient communications leader with exceptional skills in both strategy development and implementation, international project management, cross-team collaboration, stakeholder alignment and relationship building. Extensive experience advising leaders of multinationals, tech start-ups and scale-ups, and some of the foremost privately owned businesses across Europe. \n\nSupporting business leaders with developing and implementing effective stakeholder experiences. Focus on cultural transformations aimed at improving organisational health. Constantly challenging existing mental models, relationships, and taken-for-granted ways of operating as well as organisational roles and formal structures, strategies, goals and objectives. \n\nAs author of the book The Employee Journey \u2013 How to create a great employee experience, I aim to inspire leaders to create great employee experiences for their organisations, while the book itself was nominated as one of the best Dutch management books of 2019.\n\nThe work my teams and I have implemented over the years has received wide recognition within the HR, Marketing and Communications industry and I have won and been nominated for many leading industry awards. In 2020, I was named \u2018Logeion Communications Professional of the Year\u2019, a prestigious title awarded by the professional body for the Dutch communications industry. The award recognises professionals who have made an outstanding contribution to the field.\n\nMy personal mission is to shape the future of work and create a better, healthier future for everyone.",

That a 150-year history can be a strength and not just a weakness. That adapt or die is the new business mantra. That innovative and disruptive business models are being introduced every day. That the market now demands a pro-active and agile approach.\n\nThe result is FutureFit. Rolling out this year, it\u2019s is a journey in three stages \u2013 Touch, Tell, Sell (adapted from the McKinsey consumer decision model) \u2013 that aims to engage employees at the emotional, rational and practical levels. It\u2019s a journey in which Aegon stimulates and invites staff to use their imagination to think about a bigger picture and a bolder purpose. One in which we explain the differences and what\u2019s changing, rationally and emotionally. And in which we explain the impact on the business and what they need to do.\n\nThe journey\u2019s begun. There\u2019s a fresh wind blowing. Aegon\u2019s getting FutureFit.",

The campaign website with an online experience has produced the desired exposure and image boost in almost no time at all.\n\nLoads more qualified nursing professionals will be required if seniors are to continue receiving proper care in the future. Yet the elderly care sector\u2019s image amongst many students is a bit boring. Image campaign \u2018More than meets the eye\u2019, created for trade organization ActiZ and the Dutch association of nursing and caring professionals (V&VN), is meant to change that. The three interactive films at www.daarzitmeerachter.nl accurately portray the complex situations in the elderly care sector. Students watching them are challenged to make a quick assessment of the situation and take the right decisions as the clock inevitably counts down. The stories are taken right from actual practice and are shown as true to life.",

In particular, we made an inventory of the challenges and opportunities the various stakeholders envision when it comes to implementing the new strategic approach.

To ensure that all employees are even more aligned and understand what Philips stands for, the HR department wanted to kick off the new year 2016 with a meaningful and engaging internal employee activation campaign.\n\nThe employee engagement campaign we developed was linked to the overarching theme Philips communicates: \u2018Make THE difference\u2019. We focussed on the individual team member and how and where he or she actually made and will make the difference as a person. With the output, a selfie and a short description uploaded via the central Intranet, we showed and share how the personal purpose of colleagues across the globe matches with the purpose of the company they work for. \n",
