The regression affected the company with declining orders and a great revenue decline. \n\nChallenge: Ensure the company\u2019s revenue stream at all times and get them back on track in three months.  \n\nSolution: Implemented a proactive sales strategy model. It consists of three 90 minutes blocks. The strategy is based on the science on the human brain that is able to effectively operate in 90 minutes retaining a high focus. The 90 minutes blocks consist of LinkedIn, E-mail and Phone activities. These three strategies are closed in a loop repeating once a week making sure proactivity and monitoring of all prospects in the sales process. \n\nResult: Through hard work we gained the founders confidence back and created positive revenue in one month-time. The founders found joy in sales and achieved a positive sales spirit in just one month. They are now growing and working on their own with the implemented model with great success.",

We want to start interacting with our leads at an early stage and identify early adopters. \n\nChallenge: Marketing is expensive and risky in an early stage of any product or service. Pioneers often have to educate the market and second movers are taking advantage of that. We had to create a tool to close the gap between marketing and sales to make sure we go to action when our leads know enough to consider buying our innovation.  \n\nSolution: Market Automation is a very smart and effective way of reaching out to new prospects. We create an e-mail marketing program to educate and promote your new invention and are able to measure how the market is responding. With the data on every individual interaction with your e-mails and homepage we can sort your most mature prospects and deliver lists of sales-ready leads. \n\nResult: You save time and energy calling hot leads instead of making cold calls. You are relevant and of interest to your leads. It allows you to create value based on their behavior. You are able to continue your relationship with your customers after the purchase and persuading them to spread the word and create new leads for you.",

I suggested a strategy combining digital marketing with sales. My client has a great amount of knowledge in their area of business and I challenged them to use it to help people on LinkedIn to become healthier.\n\nSolution: Their customers are business people. They come through insurance agencies, search engines (Google) and corporate accounts. They suffered from office-work related injuries and they all use LinkedIn. We engaged in the online conversation on LinkedIn giving valuable tips about how to avoid problems like back pain, circulation, etc. through quick easy exercises and working environment suggestions. \n\nAction: We trimmed their LinkedIn account and did a workshop to get them started. Now the staff is sharing the responsibility to post short tips on LinkedIn on a weekly basis, 2 hours a week. \n\nResult: The client had a great amount of knowledge and value to share and positioned them selves in peoples mind helping them being healthy. We all know and promise our selves to keep care of our bodies but time-to-time we have to get some physical treatment. My client is keeping their followers healthier and gets a great amount of positive feedback when people interact with their posts. \n\nWhom do you think they go to when they feel they need professional help? The word is spreading like rings on water on social media and the stream of client is increasing. \n\nWe did some improvements on their website. We increased traffic through focused LinkedIn ads addressing HR-managers at big companies. Finally we implemented Market Automation (MA) and created highly relevant personal marketing campaigns addressing our prospects from LinkedIn. The Market Automation tool helps us sort sales-ready leads and allows a very effective sales process. We also use the Market Automation tool to increase customer care and loyalty.",

Sales was driven by:\n-\tPrint\n-\tTele marketing\n-\tGoogle\n-\tBanners\n-\tComparison sites\nA promotional letter followed by a phone-call that was supposed to lead to a meeting mainly drove the sales. The bank had to increase their share of market and sales. \n\nChallenge: Letters are hard to measure. How many read them? There is none existing action on them and the sales staff was calling blind to all recipients. The sales staff was loosing energy on negative not sales-ready prospects. Big sales teams with a high competence are expensive to maintain. The spending on Google is 1200 \u20ac/month. We had to do something to increase revenue and engage the competent sales team. \n\nSolution: We implemented a Market Automation (MA) strategy serving the sales team with qualified leads. We improved the website and added some call to actions e.g. clear buttons, a contact form and a whitepaper. \n\nResult: The sales team are now getting more qualified leads and are able to prioritize their leads by aggregated interest witch is measured by the market automation tool. The prospects are getting educated by mail and contacted by phone when they are ready to buy. The sales team is now signing more customers with less effort in less time. Above all they enjoy their work much more. The department has gained more business on their existing marketing efforts than ever before through the data gained from the market automation efforts. \n\nNext step: Create similar market automation program for the bank's remaining business.

Instrumental for our series B funding ($25M) and further international expansion to Germany, Benelux (on my initiative) and USA.\n\nEarned the global sales champion of the year trophy for the best sales performance across the whole business. The trophy is highlighting an individual contribution (150%) on a new market (no existing pipeline or brand recognition). The sales number was unbeaten for a couple of years until we moved towards larger enterprise sales and got more recognition for our brand on the UK and international WFM market. Dedicated the trophy to the teams that were making it all possible across all roles and parts of the org. Not only the sales org but also the R&D, Product and general admin teams. Fundamental for the later implemented customer centric organisation, breaking silos that can occur when organisations are growing fast (Bow Tie Model). \n\nFor a good culture to scale we need top performing account executives to recognise that they are the tip of the iceberg. Aligned the whole org on the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) by closeing the sales and product gap.",
