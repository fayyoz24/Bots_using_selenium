In this role I managed the administration of a number of HR processes, e.g. housing allowance, shift allowance, education assistance. During this period a new policy was developed for local staff transferring from abroad. \n\nIn 2001 HR teams were centralized and moved to the Central Office in The Hague. I worked within the Expatriate Shared Services team and provided transfer and payroll support to Expat and Local staff of several Shell companies in The Netherlands. Additionally I described the Expatriate Transfer process steps, which was used as guidance for the Shell Gas and Power from London to The Hague.",
