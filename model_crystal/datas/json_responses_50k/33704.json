    "summary": "A highly experienced management and business consultant with a strong focus on Supply Chain Logistics and Manufacturing for 15+ years and one of the founders of Quinso. \n\nTogether with 3 other SAP professionals with more than 20 years of experience, we started Quinso in 2010 out of the firm belief that SAP implementation and process optimization could be done better than what we had seen and experienced from our SAP background.\nNow, years later, Quinso has become a name in the SAP consultancy market and trusted adviser for many companies. We live up to our customers\u2019 expectations and this results in a successful customer experience they like to share with the market. \n\nI have a strong delivery track record and I am very result driven. My best results are achieved when leading a team while also operating within the team. Always trying to understand the business of the customer and become part of the processes they run. Cooperation between the customer\u2019s business team and the team of consultants is in my opinion key in projects and I take pride in combining these teams. \nAchieving the project goals of the customer at the end of the project is my main motivator. This is not only about delivering the best solution but also about a successful transition process in the project. It's this combination that will bring added value to our customers and will make them enthusiastic about their Quinso experience.\n",
