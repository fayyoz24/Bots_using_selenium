In the same period, I realized that my two boys weren\u2019t motivated about school and that affected them academically.  With the help of Alpha Springs Edu, my boys became excited about learning. Our younger son gained confidence, began taking the initiative to learn and did so independently. His grades are up, he\u2019s proud about his achievements, especially in math. Our older son in high school didn\u2019t like English class, especially essay writing. Within 1 to 2 to months of working with Mrs. Margaret, he became confident, started doing well and he\u2019s an A student up to date. Thank you Alpha Springs!
