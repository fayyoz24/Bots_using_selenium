    "summary": "Experienced physicist with a variety of experience in research, maintenance, and semiconductor manufacturing. I am currently working as a night shift process engineer in the dry etch module at Intel's D1 fab. In my prior role at Intel, I worked in heavy equipment maintenance and troubleshooting, also supporting the dry etch module. While working on my B.S.  in Physics, I conducted research in the area of solid-state physics developing new methods of energy dispersive x-ray diffraction at angles close to back-scatter. ",
