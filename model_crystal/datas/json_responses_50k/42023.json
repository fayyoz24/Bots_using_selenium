    "summary": "Since 2019 I am Managing Director of the Dutch Cycling Embassy: www.dutchcycling.nl. This Public Private Partnership represents a large network of almost 100 organizations offering the best of Dutch cycling knowledge and expertise, translating success stories from The Netherlands to countries and cities around the world.

I have been affiliated to the Urban Cycling Institute (UCI) of the University of Amsterdam and have worked at the Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis and at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. At the Dutch Cycling Embassy I support public and private organizations in creating the best conditions and solutions for cycling to flourish in countries and cities around the world.",
