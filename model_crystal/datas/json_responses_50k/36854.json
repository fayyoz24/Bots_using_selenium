This year the students from the Graduate Institute Geneva contributed with a policy report on the challenges the EU faces by developing and emerging powers in the WTO. During the academy we worked together with students from other universities in workshops dealing with current and future challenges for the European Union in a globalized world.\nThe report, a commentary by an NGO and our response were subsequently published in the Allianz Summer Academy Magazine (Issue 2014): Europe on a changing world order: future economic & political architectures ",
