    "summary": "I possess strong leadership, public speaking and intercultural communication skills gained through my diverse experiences while studying abroad and my cheerleading career. I take initiative in implementing my ideas and am always motivated to pursue my passion \u2013 demonstrated through my founding of the UCU Cheerleading Team in the Netherlands. \n\nAs I am especially fast at picking things up, I find myself easily adaptable to new environments and I welcome new challenges with positive energy. I am also keen on sharing my knowledge with others in any ways possible e.g. by being a cheerleading coach at Olympos Sports Center and a language tutor alongside my studies. \n\nI am passionate about broadcasting journalism and content creation (especially video production). I am ready to explore, create my path and put my skills to good use through various opportunities! Let\u2019s connect!",
