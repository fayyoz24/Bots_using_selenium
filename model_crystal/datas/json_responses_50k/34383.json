Its aim is to sensitize Europe\u2019s youth about the European project through the organization of a week-long annual simulation of the European Union\u2019s decision making process, bringing together participants from all over Europe and beyond. BMEU's 2017 edition took place from the 1st until the 6th of May. The 2018 edition took place from the 24th until the 29th of April.\n\nAs Editor In Chief, I was in charge of 3 journalists, each reporting from their Committee about the Committee's progress in making European regulations and directives. It was my responsibility to collect their findings in a daily newspaper, that was handed out to all of the BMEU participants.\n\nAs a Fundraiser, it was my task to promote our project with potential partners in order to collect sufficient funds.\n\nAs Head of Social Events, I was responsible for organising educational and fun social nights to bring the participants closer together.\n\nMore information can be found on http://www.brusselsmeu.org/."
