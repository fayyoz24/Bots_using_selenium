    "summary": "In August 2022 I have obtained my master\u2019s degree from Wageningen University and Research, with a specialization in nutrition and disease. During my studies, I discovered the close relationship between nutrition and inflammatory skin diseases, which quickly became my main focus. As my master\u2019s thesis, I researched zinc intakes in over 200 adults with atopic eczema. Seeing their experiences further assured me of the importance of nutrition in inflammatory skin diseases, which so far remains underestimated. I continued to develop my expertise during my internship at the Knowledge Institute for Nutrition and Skin (Kennisinstituut voor Voeding en Huid or KIVH). I reviewed over 300 scientific articles, in order to create a foundation for a course on nutrition and supplementation, which will be published by KIVH in the near future. \n\nIn November 2022 I started my own business ZK nutrition, which provides patients suffering from inflammatory skin diseases with comprehensive, evidence-based dietary care and education. My aim is to equip patients with knowledge and tools, which will allow them to get rid of the feeling of helplessness in the face of an unpredictable pattern of symptoms. Moreover, in the course of our collaboration, patients learn to treat their symptoms as important feedback that tells us a lot about what is happening in their body. \n\nYou can find more information about my goals and methods here https://zofiakowalska.com/en/ and on my Instagram profile @nutrition_zk",
