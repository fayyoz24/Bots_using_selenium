    "summary": "In a world where remarkable tensions and wonders can stem from diversity, I research how diversity can be managed where the latter can undoubtedly outnumber the former. I look into how human resource management is organized to promote gender and ethnic diversity. I find ways to improve diversity, in terms of numbers, and inclusion, in terms of provided safety and the successful participation of minorities in the workplace.  \n\nMost importantly, I aim to improve the experiences of all subgroups of minorities that often fall wayside to intersectional invisibility. Currently, my doctorate project is dedicated to the greater incorporation of intersectionality theory in the organizational sciences literature, and in the design of workplace gender interventions. \n\nI am eager to translate my research knowledge into advising policy changes and consultancy in industry. Outside of the office, I remain interested in diversity issues and would love to discuss it. If you\u2019d like to talk to me about diversity issues in the workplace, I can be contacted directly c.y.e.wong@rug.nl. \n\nI look forward to connecting with you! \n",
