These areas belong to my domain as policy advisor. \n\n1.\tStrategy & Policy \nAnalysis of vision on internationalisation at CPUT (shared vision, verifiable objectives, improvement oriented evaluations) \nObjectives and activities of CPUT\u2019s international partnernetwork (main characteristics, relation with overall strategy, internal commitment to bring partnerships alive)\nHow are strategy and policy reflected in education offerings (e.g. integrated into curriculum, study abroad, staff exchange possibilities)\n\n2.\tOrganization of services to international students\nCPUT\u2019s office of International affairs functions as first contact point. What are the benefits and challenges of such a model? How does the International affairs office relate to other units such as admissions office, academic departments and support services?\n\n3.\tTowards integration\nCPUT\u2019s objective is to create a thriving cosmopolitan center for cultural, social and political exchange. What kind of activities does CPUT\u2019s undertake or support to establish a community in which exchange of cultural, social or political ideas takes place. \n\nFurther, I delivered workshops/presentations on:  \nInternationalization  (recruitment, services, partnerships, international classroom: from strategy to action): From past to present. \nBuilding international Joint Programs: Why and How?
