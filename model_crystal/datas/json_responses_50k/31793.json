    "summary": "I am currently a pre-master student, on track to obtain my Msc in Financial Investments at Erasmus Universiteit, with a bachelors in International Business and a minor in trading digital financial assets, which I chose due to my interests in Fintech and venture capitals. In my experience as a finance intern at ASML, I grew a passion for financial process improvements, analysing data to fuel decision making, and providing strategic recommendations for real-life business challenges. I excel working in international, and culturally diverse environments due to my mixed background of South African, Portuguese, Greek, and English parents, living in South Africa and migrating to Cyprus, while continuing my studies in the Netherlands.",
