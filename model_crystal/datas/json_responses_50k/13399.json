I started my business by partnering up with  Original Europe Tours, they provide quality-walking tours in 13 cities in Europe. As a city manager my tasks included management of the team, schedule and financial reports. Recruiting and training new team members. Promotion of the company and tours through different communication channels, outreach to bloggers and communication with customers in order to offer the best experience of the city.  \nFrom November 2018 I also partnered with a tour agency from North Macedonia- Atlantis tours, and organise 4-day tours in Amsterdam for Macedonian tourists. As a partner and promoter of the tours I am in charge for the creation of daily programs, for communicating and scheduling with hotels and museums, as well as managing logistics and travel support. \nThis position helped to reaffirm my communication & customer care skills, and to gain experience in the travel industry, enabled me to learn the process of taking care of business in addition to working autonomously.",
