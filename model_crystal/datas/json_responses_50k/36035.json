    "summary": "I am a young ecologist with a strong interest for plants and their evolutionary past. For my bachelor thesis I focused on invasive knotweeds and tried to explain what makes these plants so successful in their introduced environments. Through a large plant-soil feedback study I investigated the effects of Japanese knotweeds on native plants species and additionally assessed the impact of these invasive plants on the biodiversity in the Netherlands. Moreover, I worked together with local provenances in a project to release a biocontrol agent to control invasive knotweeds. \n\nCurrently, I am finishing my master's degree in Ecology and Evolution at the University of Groningen where I worked on two research projects. The first research project involved several experiments examining the variability in morphology of plants and seed characteristics of Acacia caven between populations from Chile and Argentina. My second research project follows a very new field of research: the effect of microplastic pollution on natural environments. In this project, I am studying the effect of microplastics on different plant species from sandy grasslands (Natura 2000 area) through examining whether these species express more (oxidative) stress in the presence of microplastics and as this might influence the performance of the plants, if this eventually results in an effect on the whole plant community.  \n\nGraduating this summer.",
