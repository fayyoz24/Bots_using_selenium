    "summary": "I am a physicist, and I currently have three interests: quantum gravity, investments, and linux. The first interest is an open problem in fundamental physics, the second one is an intelligent strategy to achieve financial independence, and the last one is not only a fun but also an efficient approach to build a computer system.\n\nWith reference to quantum gravity, my approach is mainly related to mathematics. An imprecise way to characterize this approach is the following: It is a rigorous approach to quantum gravity. More specifically, a rigorous approach is related with a physical theory that works, but it lacks a mathematical formulation. In the case of quantum gravity, the problem is not even a matter of mathematical rigor since there is no such theory.\n\nOn the subject of investment, I study it in order to achieve financial independence. Toward this end, I invest only in what I understand; in other words, before buying or selling a financial instrument, I study its main characteristics and the current market situation. In order to improve my profitability, I am studying financial markets by candlestick charts and indicators. In this case, I program my own indicators and tools such that I can address the technical problems that arise.\n\nWhat about linux? Well, it began with my first computer \u2014 its operation system was Windows Vista. Needless to say, it crashed in such a way that I decided to test linux. Since that time, I am using linux. I began with ubuntu; I used it from 2012 until 2018. Then, I switched to manjaro (xfce) because my computer is not strong enough to run the new releases of ubuntu. Finally, I am using arch linux, which made me realize how well organized is a linux system. For this reason, I am interested in learning more about bash, x window system, window managers, and compositors. Thus far, I am really enjoying it.",
