    "summary": "I am a self motivated project manager who will always find a solution when challenges present themselves. Both in developed and least developed countries do I have experience in leading multi-cultural teams. Together creating oportunities for others is my passion. My calm nature helps me to perform well under stress and I am most at ease in mukti-cultural settings.\n\nKey qualities: eye for detail, financial management, people management, business development.\n\nAfter studying Social History (MA, Erasmus University), I decided to pursue my interest in new and different cultures and my passion to make a meaningful contribution to society by joining the international development community. Now, I have a decade of professional experience both in the USA and Africa with solid background in education, HIV/AIDS, youth \u2013 vocational and renewable energy programming. Particularly in promoting renewable energy I have gained experience by spearheading sustainability in programming by incorporating the private sector.\n\nI am inquisitive and love applied research. I take full responsibility and persevere to reach objectives. I am able to build relations at all levels and have a drive for fostering young talent. I think out of the box and have an entrepreneurial spirit. Given my coordinating talent I see myself as a programme and project manager. In these positions I also find space for my passion for numbers as I used to find space for this in attending MBA (financial and accounting) classes for fun concurrently to my studies.\n\nIn pursuing my career I remain committed to development would like to continue developing this interest in strategic analytical or management positions.",
