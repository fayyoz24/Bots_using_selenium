    "summary": "I am a bubbly, driven, multilingual English national living in The Netherlands. I have a Masters in Professional Translating for European Languages and Level 3 qualification in Community Interpreting. I therefore, translate and interpret from French, German, and Italian into English, within specialised fields. \n\nAfter completing my first Dutch course to A2 level upon arrival in the Netherlands, I now carry out small Dutch to English translations and proofreading too.  I thrive working in an international environment. I am experienced in project management, team management, as well as store & company growth on an international level.\n\nMy experiences abroad (France, Germany, Italy, Copenhagen and now, The Netherlands), means that I have a clear concept of internationalisation, differing cultures, effective working methods, new approaches to learning and development both personally as well as professionally. I enjoy helping others, encouraging personal development, solving problems and seeing projects evolve.",

We speak 100% in the foreign language, but our skills and expertise ensure everyone understands. Following our carefully tried and tested methodology, your child could leave the very first class responding to French, Spanish or even Chinese! The classes are suitable for babies, toddlers, and young children. I taught classes in primary schools and a local nursery. Working as a  tutor for lingotot further advanced my skills in teaching and learning. I improved in my lesson planning, implementation of new language learning schemes, behavioural management, pastoral skills, differentiation etc. I worked part time with groups of children as young as 3, up to the age of 10. The classes were largely creative, providing the children with good foundations in the French language through song, interactive games and craft activities.",
