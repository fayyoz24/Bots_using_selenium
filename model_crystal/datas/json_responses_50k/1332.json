The project encourages various stakeholders within the faculty (students, staff, study associations, and others) to share their ideas on diversity and inclusion. My main responsibilities included proposing and evaluating initiatives, communicating with relevant stakeholders, and exploring implementation options for the proposed initiatives. More specifically, I proposed the creation of a sensory room on campus which was later realized. My participation in the panel enabled me to gain an insight into ways of fostering diveristy and inclusion in the academic environment. I joined the panel again in 2022 and 2023.",

On the day of the event, our team had a 45-minute session with the company\u2019s representatives during which they were informed about the outcomes of their company\u2019s innovation scan and presented with advice on how to improve creativity and innovation in their organization. By getting involved in this project, I got a chance to further advance my knowledge regarding organizational creativity and innovation. Furthermore, I got to learn how to interpret a company\u2019s innovation scan report and provide actionable advice based on its outcomes.",

Integrating a digital aspect into our proposed solution was a crucial part of the process. During the event, we got a chance to interact with various business advisors and discuss our idea with them. We also attended a professional pitch training session. On the last day of the event, we presented our idea in the form of a short pitch in front of a group of judges. This project gave me an opportunity to further expand my professional and personal network, strengthen my pitching skills, and practice the development of solutions to real-life business challenges.",

            "description": "Joined Circle\u2019s Economy Knowledge Hub as contributor for the period of one month. Circle Economy is a non-profit organization that works with businesses, cities, and governments by helping them with their transition to circular economy. Their main focus are practical and scalable solutions that can accelerate sustainable development. Many of such solutions are presented in Circle Economy\u2019s Knowledge Hub - an online library of circular economy case studies. This open-collaborative library is accessible to anyone who is interested in contributing to the global transition to circular economy. I contributed to the Knowledge Hub with several case studies focused on sustainable projects in Africa. This allowed me to learn more about the implementation of circular economy solutions."
