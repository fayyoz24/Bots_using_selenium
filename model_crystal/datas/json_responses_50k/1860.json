With close to a billion people currently living in slums, accommodating a growing population, and improving dwelling conditions is a critical issue for society.\n\nThis challenge cannot be solved with a one-size-fits-all approach. Every city, region and country demand their own housing models and prototypes. That\u2019s why housing design needs to negotiate many aspects simultaneously to achieve sustainable urban environments and inclusive dwelling communities.\n\nThis course uncovers how social, economic and environmental factors are interrelated in the design of housing settlements. For this, the course dives into three key aspects that anyone involved in housing design should take into consideration: time, environment, and community. Each of these aspects will be examined through a specific design approach, respectively:\nincrementality, typology mix and clustering \n\nIn this course, each of these themes will be discussed in detail and exemplified by a new analytical approach to award-winning housing projects developed in different geopolitical contexts.\n\nThis course has been developed by TU Delft\u2019s Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). It offers a unique combination of videos, documentation of key case studies, animations, and feedback sessions. We will discuss options for affordable housing design, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries. We will take you through the intricacies of designing \u201chousing for the large number\u201d, as well as inspire you to understand your own context and the housing challenges you might be facing.",

Development induced resettlement demands a holistic approach based on an understanding of patterns of inhabitation and processes of community engagement. This is challenging, because of the shortage of socio-spatial analyses, and lack of actionable information that can be adopted by local actors. The main goal of the project \u201cAddis Ababa Living Lab\u201d is to improve the livelihood of Addis Ababa\u2019s urban dwellers using transdisciplinary approaches of analysis, planning and design. Accurate understanding of social, economic and technological needs and enhanced community participation is crucial. To achieve this goal, a contextually new co-creation model will be used \u2013 engaging a local university (EiABC), government agencies (i.e. Federal Housing Corporation), an NGO, local and international design and planning practitioners, and a local dwellers\u2019 community. The research will use tools and methods such as geomatics and visual ethnography in site surveys, life-cycle-assessment (LCA) to quantify buildings\u2019 sustainability performance, and Societal Cost Benefit Assessment studies (SCBA). This project will produce a policy paper, an actionable framework and build a pilot project on a test site as experiment and feedback loop. These research outputs will be used to impact decisions, for education and upscaling. The project positively contributes to several SDG\u2019s (sustainable cities, good health & well-being, education, clean water & sanitation, decent work & economic growth) and generates knowledge and tools to prevent negative feedbacks.",

Inquiry into historical and contemporary projects and conditions is the central focus of DASH. New types of housing but also existing models and changing trends are thoroughly charted and examined. The target is the future: with thought-provoking analyses, DASH aims to give new impetus to innovative housing design.\n\nDASH aims to occupy a central position in the academic community as well as among designing and commissioning parties. For clients, architects and academics, DASH is a tool for tackling the contemporary housing assignment in an innovative manner and for developing and disseminating new information on housing design. DASH aims to make an international contribution to housing design from a Dutch perspective.\n\nOver the past few centuries, the Netherlands has built up a housing tradition that is renowned throughout the world. With its periodical DASH, the Chair of Architecture and Dwelling, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, intends to bring the richness of housing design back on centre stage.\n\nDASH is published once a year. Each edition is devoted to a fundamental theme in contemporary housing development, with an introductory essay by the editor or guest editor responsible, followed by extensive, uniformly presented plan documentation of relevant projects from the present as well as the past.\n\nFour articles about specific aspects of the theme give historical hindsight and critical reflection on current development practices, complemented by two interviews with professionals and key figures on the chosen theme.",
