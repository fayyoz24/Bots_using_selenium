    "summary": "As a graduated MSc. Aerospace Engineer, I have always been highly motivated to help finding solutions to current challenges we face as a society through the use of my engineering skills and knowledge. Solving these problems in the most elegant way using different tools I acquainted during my career and studies is my goal. As a Global Field Support Engineer at ASML I am able to push technology in the right direction while working on the highly advanced and innovative EUV system. My expertise is on the metrology & sensors competency of this system. The engineering feel between the theoretical and practical part of engineering makes it possible to apply my knowledge and skills on a wide range of engineering fields. At ASML I am able to use this motivation to push the boundaries of innovation.",
