    "summary": "Thanks to my international and national experiences I have grown into the woman I am today. To paint a picture of myself in one sentence, I am; ambitious, a learner and a social being, and I can pride myself with my can-do, problem solving attitude.\n\nTeamwork makes the dreamwork, and I am a strong believer of this. Working together to achieve a mutual goal is something I look for in my career. That is one of the reasons why I love marketing, you can actually see the growth your company makes. This is why I know that my future lies within the marketing industry.\n\nEver since my first encounter with marketing during my university degree (International Business and Management, 2012-2017) I have been fascinated by it. This fascination has never left, only grown into my passion. During marketing classes I would be so intrigued by how we can influence the mind, that I decided to find my final thesis internship in marketing. I was able to land an internship at an event organising company in Australia, dreams do come true I thought.\n\nDuring my internship I got to see first hand how growth hacking worked. My thesis was on how we could get more visitors to our event. Together with the team we managed to sell out the event completely for the first time ever! This is when I new, my future is in growth marketing.\n\nAfter finishing my degree, now with a marketing thesis and bachelor of business administration in the pocket, it was time to discover the world. Having travelled for another year in Asia and Australia I new my next goal. Starting a career in the Netherlands, and not giving up on my dream of becoming a great growth marketeer.\n\nBeing back and landing a job at one of my favourite event organisers in the Netherlands (2019-2020) I couldn't be happier. I was Bookings Assistant at Art of Dance, and I was part of the marketing team. They wanted me to be the link between the artists (bookings) and marketing. Here I was helped with thinking and setting up marketing campagnes and I got to be creative with social media content. During these activities my heart starts racing and my passion starts to show.\n\nAll these beautiful moments and experiences make me know that my future lies in growth marketing. I am not one to give up, so I know it will happen. I am up for the challenge, you too?",
