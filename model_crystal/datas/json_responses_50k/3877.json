    "summary": "When I was a kid, I remember being constantly brimming with curiosity and questions about the natural world. I was fascinated about why the sky is blue, why the leaves are green, and how on earth it was possible people in Australia don\u2019t just fall straight off the globe! As it usually goes with receiving the comprehensive answers from our (very) patient parents, they only spawned many more questions. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve been able to hold on to this unrelenting curiosity which has instinctively led me to pursue a career in science.\n\nDuring my BSc at Avans University of Applied Sciences, I learned many of the skills necessary to work in a lab and got in contact with a great network of peers and teachers. However, I feel like I discovered my real passion during my first internship at the Novo Nordisk Center for Biosustainability. It was here that I was introduced to the captivating world of metabolic engineering! The idea that modifying micro-organisms on the molecular level could have such an enormous beneficial impact on the planet and the people that inhabit it, was eye-opening to me.\n\nWith a clear goal in mind, I enrolled in a master\u2019s program at Utrecht University with a focus on biotechnology. I dedicated both my internships during the program to further develop my knowledge in the field of fungal metabolic engineering. With all the experience and skills I gained while working in multiple (international) academic institutes over the past few years, and still so many questions left unanswered, I feel excited to take the next step and start a PhD at the TU Delft.",
