I loved working with project members, students, entrepreneurs, SMEs and startups as well as major industrial partners.  Together with an awesome team, I realised the implementation of communications strategy and successful social media. Next to this, I could make a difference as linking pin between European locations, driving campaigns and projects; addressing targets.  I loved working together, trouble shooting and coordinating international teams. Organising large scale events from A-Z next to small-scale workshops and startup meetups creating leads & deals & press visibility. Now, the goals are sharpened and the ground work has been done. I move on. Feel free to contact me anytime and let us explore the possibilities for cooperation.\n\nThe EIT Digital community is a collaboration of Large Enterprises, Universities and Knowledge centres with locations around Europe: London, Helsinki, Paris, Stockholm, Berlin, Trento, Madrid, Budapest, Eindhoven and a hub in Silicon Valley. The organisation is one of the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities of the European Institute of Technology. \n\nEIT Digital aims to create a new breed of innovators and entrepreneurs that can develop breakthrough ideas - supported all the way to the market. To realise this aim, Education, Research and Business are key in the EIT Digital approach. Since 2010, EIT Digital has consistently mobilised talents, ideas, technologies, investments as well as business across Europe and beyond. I was lucky to deliver my share in this dynamic process. Thanks to all the bright and gifted  EIT Digital Master School students. It was an honour to work with them and to coach them from out of the Co-location Centre Eindhoven.",

The branding of Holst Centre, setting the basis for the communications department and to create visibility for the WATS and SIF technology were my focus. The inauguration of the new company building was the catalyst to introduce Holst Centre to the ecosystem. \nTherefore I organised and coordinated a research exhibition from scratch. All the innovation lines were branded: about 13 top notch projects with their demonstrators were selected. The presentation and exposure of each project was designed to the smallest detail (artist impressions, posters, powerpoint, stand-pitch, look&feel of every stand, dress code). Merely 90% of the invitees attended the vibrant event (325+ pax). High level policy makers, Belgian and Dutch Ministers of Economic Affairs, were welcomed and they sustained on the spot, the collaboration with the inauguration of the building. PR visibility accomplished.\n\nLast but not least: the corporate Identity gift was a book 'Roads into the Future'. This is still an example of a marcom instrument which is able to envisage and translate a quite complex technology and visionary message into an attractive, interesting and understandable marcom tool for a broad audience. Interesting to know: a Taiwanese stakeholder published the book in Chinese.",
