Based on this research and an extensive analysis of competition and positioning I developed a watch brand. The brand was worked out on different aspects of brand building, next to generic strategic brand management tools (4C's, positioning, brand architecture, brand elements etc.) I used theories of Holt (Iconic Brands) and of Beverland (Authentic Branding). This has resulted in a unique watch brand that is focused on drivers. With a brand that was worked out in detail the difficult task started of developing a fitting design. I managed to design a few concepts that fitted the brand. One of these watch designs was worked out in detail. With the supervision of well known dutch designer Bruno Ninaber I made the watch using a conventional lathe and a modern CNC mill. All the machines were operated by myself (this includes programming and work approach). The result is a highly professional and working prototype of an innovative watch that fits the brand.  ",

The product was developed to serve the global express industry in order to save high costs that result from transporting empty ULD containers. The solution is still non-disclosed but suggests a collapsible ULD that is lightweight, easy to handle and with minor loss of usable volume.\n\nThis was a comprehensive (12 ECTS) product design project where a team of six industrial design master students combined their strengths, gained in three different master courses (i.e. strategic product design, design for interaction and integrated product design). From internal and external analyses, through idea and concept development, to product detailing, prototyping and a business model, the final design was delivered and received with great enthusiasm by the company and was graded with a 9 out of 10.

The goal was to raise money for a good cause (in our case the Leprosy Foundation) and it was also about having an adventurous self-reliant journey through Western Africa.  \n\nWe did not take the fairly accessible route along the coast, but a challenging and breathtaking route leading into the Western Sahara. In three weeks we crossed 8 countries, covering around 8900 km in total of which around 1200 km off road.  We raised EUR. 4000,- for the Leprosy Foundation.  ",
