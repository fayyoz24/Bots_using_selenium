    "summary": "Passionate and motivated graduate student, working towards a graduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at the Leiden University Medical Center. My primary research interest lies in the field of Lifestyle Medicine, where I explore ways to prevent and modulate disease progression through lifestyle interventions such as diet and physical activity. I strongly believe that lifestyle modifications can play a significant role in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, and I am dedicated to advancing this area of research.\n\nAside from my academic pursuits, I am also deeply committed to promoting scientific education among young minds. As a tutor for middle school and high school students, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with the next generation of scientists and researchers.",
