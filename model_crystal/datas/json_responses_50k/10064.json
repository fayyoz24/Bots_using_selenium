In addition, probably the biggest lesson that I've learned is that of commitment and persistency, which will carry you forward even if you hit upon rough times. Having said that, I've also learned the important entrepreneurial lesson of being brutally honest to myself in evaluating the business prospects for the business that I've built. I've fully utilised the opportunity that was there at the start of this business (solving thousands of customers' problems).",

Selling your product on the street is the old-school way, and a difficult one. The process of attracting the attention of people, making them feel an interest for your product, make them listen to your story, developing a connection, and closing the sale, is a very delicate process.
