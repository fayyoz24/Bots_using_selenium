    "summary": "Passionate and results-oriented Bioengineer who is dedicated to having a positive impact through my work.\n\nI am currently undergoing my MBA at Rotterdam School of Management, concentrating in international and sustainable business. Available to start work in January 2024 (sponsorship not required). \n\nAs Senior Program Manager at BIO Ventures for Global Health (BVGH), I managed diverse global health programs and facilitated product development pipelines. This ranged from advancing diagnostics and drug development for neglected diseases (SDG 3, 9, 17) to enhancing oncology diagnostic and treatment capacities in East Africa. I was also responsible for negotiating access to affordable cancer medicines between pharmaceutical manufacturers and African hospitals and governments (SDG 9, 10, 17). I served as the key touch point between multi-sector stakeholders and was responsible for aligning health solutions with both corporate CSR priorities and governmental strategic vision. I developed efficient reporting systems to consolidate surveys and assessments and communicated the results through peer-reviewed publications (links in my CV), company reports (internal and external), and impact/CSR reports for corporate funders. Through these experiences, I honed my ability to analyze complex health challenges, identify opportunities for improvement, and design tailored solutions that consider both environmental and human health implications at global and local levels. \n\nI believe that many of our global crises\u2014experienced thus far and yet to be faced\u2014stem from an issue of resource allocation and waste reduction. Ultimately, we live in an industry-driven world. While I have demonstrated my ability to implement positive change professionally and personally, I pursued my International and Sustainable MBA to arm myself with the business skills and experience to expand my impact to the private sector and align health and climate equity with multinational corporate strategy.",
