The analysis was carried out for the responsible design institute (China Railway Tunnel Design Institute). \n\nThe Shantou SuAi crossing consists of two identical TBM made tunnels crossing the main channel of Shantou Port. The tunnels connect Longhu district at the northern bank and haojinag district at the Southern bank and both accommodate 3 traffic lanes. The tunnels have an outer diameter of 14.5m and a length of approximately 3.5km. \n\nFor the cross-sectional analyses the displacements from the SHAKE2000 model where imposed on 2 adjacent tunnel rings modelled in 3D with DIANA. With the model the rotations in the segment joints, forces in the concrete and differential displacements between two rings were analysed. \n\nFor the longitudinal analyses the complete 3,500 km long tube was modelled with beam elements on which a propagating seismic wave was imposed. With this model the most critical sections along the alignment where identified. On those locations special seismic joints are proposed which can absorb displacements and therewith reducing forces in the tunnel lining. By installing the seismic joints on the right locations the joints openings between adjacent rings are limited to  guarantee water tightness.",
