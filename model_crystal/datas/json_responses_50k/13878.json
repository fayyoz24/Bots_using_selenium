(Leiden. Detroit, Utrecht). After teaching at high schools and universities he became educational reseacher at the Freudenthal Institute for Innovation in Mathematics Education (University Utrecht). Shortly thereafter het became leader and full professor/director of this institute. He initiated many new projects and activities like the Nieuwe Wiskrant (Math Magazine), National Mathematics Days, Math-A-lympiade, designed learning materials (Math-in-Context), designed curricula (mathematics A). At present he is senior designer of  a tablet based curriculum for mathematics for Pearson in the USA. \nHe also was member or chair of many national and international commissions (Mathematical Sciences Education Board (Washington DC), Chair of International Expert Group PISA Mathematics (Paris, Melbourne), Visiting Professor University of Wisconsin (Madison), Honorary Chair Mathematics Education Research Institute (Being).\n\nHe founded the Project Curious MInds with Robbert Dijkgraaf & Johan van Benthem in 2005, and as a result the Book \"Play Smart\" was published in Dutch in 2013. It is about the amazing talents of young children, their curiosity, their reasoning skills, especially in the area of science and technology. It offers parents tools to facilitate a more complete cognitive development.This book is also the backbone of the recently started Young Parents Academy (jongeouderacademie.nl).\n \nIn 2011 he won the Lifetime Achievement Award van de International Society for Design and Development in Education (ISDDE).\n\nHe has presented numerous keynotes and lectures in 60 countries over a wide variety of subjects.",

Parents will experience new and different ways of interaction with their curious young kids, look in a different ways are their cognitive capabilities, and facilitate a more complete cognitive brain development, complementary to school. This takes place in the context of Science & Technology (STEM). Serious play indeed!\n\nThe first meeting took place for March 11, 2013, and was a success: 'sold out' (100 parents) and great reactions. The second session took place April 17: parents and their young kids played together for two hours, eliciting many hidden talents. The third and concluding session in June made clear that the Young Parent Academy can be considered a great success. Therefore the local government (Katwijk) has decided that in the year 2013/2014 three YPA's (JOA in Dutch) will take place, together with workshops and conference. In the school year 14/15 JOA' are introduced in Velsen (Rheden) and Rotterdam (Dominicusschool). Other cities with advanced plans include: Velsen, Noordwijk, Arnhem and Apeldoorn.\n\nIn April 2015 a very special YPA took place at DECOS in their beautiful office in Noodwijk. It will be a XL session with a guest speaker, new clips, and collaboration with the science centers Space expo, Naturalis and Boerhave. In February 2016 the next version took place.\n\nYPA are in progress/have been held in Velp, Katwijk, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Noordwijk, Leiden, Kaag & Braassem. Inspiration presentation in various other cities. International presentations in Denmark, Germany and Poland.\n\nWebsite: jongeouderacademie.nl\nFaceBook:  JOA Katwijk",

One of the main objectives is to have parents look differently at the talents these children have, starting with their natural curiousity. Jan was director for 5 years from 2005/2010. After this period he continued in this vein by founding the Young Parents Academy which had a very successful pilot start in his native town of Katwijk, the Netherlands. The book that plays an essential role in this academy is: Play Smart.(de Lange, Feijs, Munk, Broekhof, Cohen de Lara (2013), Zwijsen, Tilburg, The Netherlands)",
