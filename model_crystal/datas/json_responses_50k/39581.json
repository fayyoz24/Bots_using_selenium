    "summary": "I'm an executive that (re)builds teams and the business strategies to make them successful. I champion innovative ways of working, healthy mindsets, effective approaches, and novel technologies. I'm passionate about finding innovative and pragmatic solutions, and I strive to create understanding and enthusiasm about adopting the new way forward.\n\n\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc08 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25?\nI go for challenges that combine a need for (disruptive) change, with new way of solving them, in organizations that cannot do so by themselves. Whether there is a technological shift, an (internal) political landscape, a changing market, a deeply ingrained culture, or a combination thereof.\nI work well in this complexity and chaos, and see creating a clear, pragmatic, and attainable solution to those challenges like creating a work of soothing art. \n\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2c\nQuantum Technology, Cybersecurity, Lobby, Agile change, Digital Transformation, USP's and business plans, Consulting, Education.\n\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\nIn my spare time I'm passionate about the performing and visual arts, ancient history and sciences, historical martial arts and tactics, and the Art Nouveau architectural style. I have side projects around AI generated Art Nouveau architecture, and leveraging AI and traditional methods to create scaleable sustainable agriculture. My work experience, volunteering, and passions reflect my fascination for combining opposites into a new unity.\n\nReach out if you need help changing your organization around, need advice on quantum technologies, grassroots politics or cybersecurity, or if you own an Art Nouveau house.",
