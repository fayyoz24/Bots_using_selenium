As a Delegates' Support Organizer, I was in charge of the well-being of all the delegates, from carefully supervising their application process, to committee allocation and to a non-stop support for delegates prior to, during and after the 5-day event.  \nBeing a member of the European Youth Parliament tremendously improved my critical thinking, public speaking, communication, teamwork and organizational skills, while simultaneously making me aware of the current issues that the European Union and its partners have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, thus helping me become an involved and dedicated European citizen."
