    "summary": "I am a researcher in the fields of hydrology and water resources management. At IWMI, I am part of the Hydroinfomatics group which leverages state-of-the-art remote sensing approaches and data processing technologies to generate timely and quality information on water availability and use, as well as sustainable limits to use. \n\nI hold a PhD in Hydrology from TU Delft and IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, The Netherlands. For my research on the practice and opportunities in re-operating dams for the environment,  I was awarded the 2023 Falkenmark Award for best PhD thesis by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). I also have an MSc in Environmental Water Management from Cranfield University, United Kingdom (2015 Atkins Prize winner); and a BSc in Civil Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (K.N.U.S.T), Ghana (1st class Honours). \n\nI have worked on environmental flows implementation, suitability mapping of solar pumps for irrigation using remote sensing data, the development of a decision support system for sizing on-farm water storage as well as hydrological and statistical analysis of floods for flood recession agriculture in northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. I also have experience using Bayesian Belief Networks in data-poor regions as well as carrying out trade-off analysis using optimization techniques.\n\nMy interests include hydrological modelling, environmental flows and water accounting among others.",
