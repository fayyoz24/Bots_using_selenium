In addition to that, I wrote manuals of existing and new applications. Editing, writing and testing of existing templates of Microsoft Word was also a part of the job (February 2010 - September 2012).\n\nFurthermore, by giving workshops and providing information I gave insight into the Bachelor Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at the University of Technology in Eindhoven to 150 students from secondary school. I thereby helped them choose courses in secondary school as well as a Bachelor track (September 2010 - April 2012).",

In three months time, my Chinese colleagues and me have developed a scoring tool in Microsoft Excel to evaluate the performance of local suppliers on monthly and quarterly basis. This tool is now being used to select suppliers based on their previous performances. The evaluation results will also be used to improve the relationship between the suppliers and VDL Enabling Technologies Group Suzhou in the future.",
