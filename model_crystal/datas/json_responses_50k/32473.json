    "summary": "While being against war in every sort or form, I extremely love this quote: \u2018You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time\u2019. Therefore, my objective at the start of any assignment/project is always simple: I not only want to understand who\u2019s on board, but I also want to spent time exploring any unutilized human powers we have as a group, team or department.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about starting with nothing more than a driving ambition, professionals/teams and a blank piece of paper. I anticipate eagerly to being the key enabler within the group, a driving force in creating a great vibe while crafting a purpose, vision and a strategy with a backlog of actionable tactics. \n\nHowever, the real work starts when the first backlog item goes into \u2018production\u2019 or sees the crack of dawn; even with the best strategy in the world, things will always be different in real life. I love keeping myself and the group energized during the entire journey.  \n\nMy professional toolbox is filled with the ability and willingness to advocate for and/or teach (self)learning, \u2018new\u2019 leadership, psychological safety, awesome storytelling, inclusiveness, feedforward & taking ownership. My approach is simple and non-invasive: I always strive to make teams and professionals shine, instead of making myself look good.\n\nLove this quote:\n\u201cMicromanagement is the motivational equivalent of buying on credit. Enjoy the product now, but pay a hefty price later\u201d\n\nCheck some of my professional articles here: https://jasperfortuin.com/blog/",
