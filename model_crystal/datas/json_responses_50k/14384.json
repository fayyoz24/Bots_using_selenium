A leftover code review was also provided.\n\nWe implemented different methods to understand our user and gather user data. We made experimentations on focus group, used A/B testing and usability tests. I made decidions based on these researches results.\n\nWithin the portal redesign were made:\n- The main page and Personal banking domain of the portal\n- Commercial banking domain\n- Privilege and Private banking\n- Loans with all back- and frontend stuff including tariff calculators:\n-- Personal Loans\n-- Mortgage\n-- Auto loans\n- Credit Cards\n- Debit Cards\n- Savings including tariff calculators\n- Bank's coins - still in use\n- Discount programs - still\n- Promotions and special offers - still in use\n- Interactive maps - still in use\n- Control panel (internal part of the portal)\nAnd lots of smaller things on the portal and for internal use.\n\nAfter project were completed and new statistic were gathered it was revealed that user influx and banking products sales were increased. Surveys also showed the increase of users satisfaction from the use of new services and design. So the goals of the project have been achieved successfully.",
