    "summary": "As a graduate of the Maastricht Science Programme, where I focused my studies mainly on biological sciences, I approach my work with a keen interest and attention to detail. This has been a great asset when studying for my NASM Certified Personal Trainer diploma and is something I carry into my work as a trainer. Having followed my passion for cooking as a chef for a few years in Maastricht, I also know what it is to work in a high stress environment and the necessity for proper exercise (and good food) to provide essential support to one's wellbeing.",
