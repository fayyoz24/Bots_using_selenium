Many children in this region hardly have access to medical care.\n \nPrimarily, Petite Cobi attends to malnourished children, either by providing milk powder and other nutritional supplements and/or by arranging good care.\nBesides malnourished children, we are committed to seriously ill children. Families are mostly able to pay for medicines for a minor infection or aspirin for the flu. However, when a child is seriously ill and in need of surgery, the costs are soon exceeding the family\u2019s financial possibilities. In situations like these, Petite Cobi offers a solution.\nFurthermore, Petite Cobi Foundation attends to handicapped children. Medical costs are covered by the Liliane Fund and Petite Cobi helps out with transportation costs and arranging appointments.",
