    "summary": "Originally from the Boston area in the United States, Adam Claussen is a composer, performer, and teacher with a BA in jazz performance and MA in film music.  During his undergraduate studies in jazz saxophone at University of Miami, Adam shared the stage playing saxophone, flute, and clarinet with the likes of Quincy Jones, Maria Schneider, Arturo Sandoval, Dave Grusin, Adam Rogers, Tom Scott, and John Williams among many others.  In 2017 and 2019, Adam received two Student Downbeat Awards for his original compositions \u201cAll Bets Are Off\u201d and \u201cMinor Conniption\u201d, and in 2017 he was named the winner of the BMI William Golstein Scholarship for outstanding work in the field of jazz composition.  In February 2019, Adam released his debut album as a bandleader and saxophonist entitled Arethusa Falls, featuring original works for jazz quintet.   \n\nIn 2022, Adam graduated with a masters degree in film music from Conservatorium van Amsterdam having scored several short films produced by the Netherlands Film Academy: De Hemelse Bloem (doc, Tessa van der Riet), Joan\u2019s Theme (fiction, Kiefer Eijckelhof), and Entertainment (fiction, Beek Groot).  The original soundtrack for Joan's Theme won the 2022 Keep an Eye Filmscore Award during the week of its premiere at the 2022 Keep an Eye Filmacademie Festival.  Ranging widely from jazz to orchestral to German Schlager, the music from each film is available on all streaming sites, and can be found under the \"listen\" tab above.  Adam has also featured as a session musician on the albums Nothing but Love (Just Friends 2018), and There, Back, a Tiny Hat (Fourth Degree 2021) as well as on the soundtracks of numerous short films.\n\nAfter composing music for the dance sequences choreographed by Thu Hang Pham in De Hemelse Bloem, Adam began a collaboration with international choreographer Anderson Carvalho.  Their first collaboration, When I Left the Room, \"is a research dance performance of bodies that acknowledge their interdependency. A reflection on identity, culture, and human relationships. Inside a \u201croom\u201d the bodies negotiate possibilities of being in togetherness and physically experimenting, exploring notions of adaptation, agency, and connectedness.\"  It recieved critical acclaim at its premiere in Capetown, South Africa, and went on to be performed at the 2022 Ubumuntu Arts Festival in Kigali, Rwanda.  Adam and Anderson are currently working on their next collaboration, The Intamacy of the Skin, which will be performed in 2023 in Haarlem (NL), Capetown (ZA), and Kigali (RW).",
