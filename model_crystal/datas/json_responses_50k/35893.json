    "summary": "I'm always interested in the incentive of people of why they make certain choices. \n\nHaving a background in Cultural Anthropology makes me aware of the fact that nothing is as straight as it might appear at first sight. There are multiple sides to every story.  I started to recognize that this understanding could come in handy in a huge variety of professions, and with a little creativity you could see the positive sides of what first appears as a problem.\n\nAs mentioned above, I am a solution minded person. How can I turn a problem into something profitable? How to tweak and turn till something is as efficient as possible. \n\nIf you want to get in touch, just shoot me a message!",
