    "summary": "Curious how your organization can benefit from renewing your mobility and business travel programs?\n\nAfter 12 years of experience from both a Corp. P&O and Purchasing perspective, I can help!\n\nAbout me\n\nStarting in 2009 within DSM, a multi-national company with over 20,000 employees worldwide, I had the opportunity to look after mobility, business travel and professional services programs. I covered strategic positions within Corp. P&O as well as within Purchasing/Sourcing, which allowed implementing new front-running company policies including the newest innovations brought by/developed together with, suppliers.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nIn 2015, implemented an employee \"Private leasing program\" which renewed the way the industry viewed car leasing. \nBy leveraging all (supplier) strengths, we were able to offer lease cars for those employees who were not eligible for a company car, at a price and service level beyond competitive (self-explaining). Private leasing gained popularity since.\nThe offer brings a 'green' car opportunity to many house holds, while enabling car-sharing options for the users. \nIn 2015 & 2016, I received Industry leading Awards from both a country as global level for this program.\n\nIn 2021, implemented the global \"Responsible Travel Program\" which fully renewed the need for, and way we look at business travel. The program delivers a structural 50% reduction of 2019 business travel levels, bringing a major -industry leading- contribution to sustainability, while delivering multi-million cost savings. The program is a key pillar into the companies \"Next Normal\" initiatives and includes a new (one pager) Travel Policy and new Supplier Program, supporting the individual employee decision making and alternatives consideration.\n\nMain learnings\n\nMy skills and passions truly come together when I see a game-changing opportunity. \nWithin mobility, this was the way the traditional market viewed car leasing. Within business travel it is the way companies define the need for travel - where the pandemic has given us all great lessons.\n\nI want to make an impact, and I see a major opportunity in the mobility and business travel area today.\nThe learnings from my roles within DSM, should also be available to others. Also, as the new business program spend within DSM will be far lower than purchasing roles normally cover, DSM and I have decided I will continue my journey outside DSM, offering my capabilities as independent consultant to other companies.\n\nInterested to work with me?
