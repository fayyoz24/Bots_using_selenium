    "summary": "I am a seasoned Java developer with 10+ years of experience. I have developed parts of monoliths but also microservices; manually deployed webapps on Tomcat and pushed Spring Boot apps to CloudFoundry. I have built frontends on JSPs with jQuery, and created SPAs with Vue and Angular; some applications talked to PostgreSQL, others to Cassandra.\n\nOf course I'm using tools such as Jenkins, Sonar, Jira and Maven to keep quality up. But to me, even more important than building the thing right, is building the right thing. Therefore I'm always challenging my team and business to get to know the problems of our end-users.\n\nWorking closely together with others brings out the best in me. The scrum projects I have been doing for various employers and projects thus give me the perfect environment to do my work.\n\nFinally, learning and knowledge sharing are very important to me. Staying up-to-date with industry trends helps me while resolving complex problems using a creative approach. Knowledge sharing gives me energy, and I learned that you always learn something new yourself.",
