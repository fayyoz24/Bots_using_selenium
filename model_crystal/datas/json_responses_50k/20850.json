    "summary": "I am a very social, communcative strong, positive person who feels that together you are stronger then on your own. \n\nWorking under some pressure and with deadlines is not something that I am afraid of, I feel that it can help you push yourself a little further than your comfort zone. And I see it as a challenge and opportunity to grow and excell in my work. \n\nI am a quick learner and think that two of my strong qualities are planning and time management. \nConnecting with other people and establishing a good communication is where I feel at my best.\nIt is when we can all come together and work on a shared goal you can achieve the best result. \n\nInteracting with people and help them to learn and/or achieve more is something I enjoy very much. The leadership role is not something I am scared off and is more often the role I choose to be in. \n\nIn my personal life I have had some challenges which helped me learn more about myself and let me be the strong, persistent, determined person I am today, of which I am very proud off. Giving up is not in my dictionary.     \n\nI would like to develop myself further in Finance and grown into a managing position.\nDeveloping my SAP skills even further is something I am very willing to do.",
