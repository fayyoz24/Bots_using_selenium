    "summary": "I am a Nigerian who has lived most of her life traveling and living in various countries. Before moving to the Netherlands, which I now call home, I lived in Nigeria, Senegal, India, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nI carried out research on the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on psychological health. I also completed my thesis on exploring the relationship between resilience and ACEs among Nigerian adults. This has allowed me to understand the importance of childhood experiences and being trauma-informed which allows me to adapt and find ways of working and helping my clients. \n\nAs a psychologist, the top priority for a healthy therapeutic experience is the therapeutic relationship with my client. I provide a safe space and a listening ear for you to communicate your story openly and honestly. In collaboration, the best therapeutic approach is tailored to your needs; client-focused.\n\nMember of the Dutch Institute for Psychologists (NIP)-238283",
