    "summary": "I am a seasoned IT professional with a positive and pragmatic attitude. As an experienced Application Manager I enjoy being the linking pin between IT Operations, the users and the business. I have a fast experience in team management, application management, release and change management, technical project management and software development. \n\nA project I did in India made me realize that I thrive in an international setting. Connecting with people from different cultures and working together as a team gives me a lot of joy in the work that I do. \n\nI am fluent in English, Dutch, and Spanish\n\nI am a strong believer in lifelong learning. I have a personal interest in programming. I follow courses related to Web Development, AI and Data Science. I also like diversifying my learning by doing things out of my comfort zone. During my sabbatical I took a 3 weeks Thai Massage course in Chiang Mai, a Barista course in Bali and a salsa course in Cali. You are never to old to learn Salsa! :) After the intensive course I still can\u2019t dance but that\u2019s okay. The point is to give it your best in everything you do! \n\nSpecialties: application management, functional maintenance, operational IT management, release management, change management, service management, problem-solving, connecting people, team building.\n\nCertifications: ITIL v3, BISL, ASL, SCRUM, Prince2",
