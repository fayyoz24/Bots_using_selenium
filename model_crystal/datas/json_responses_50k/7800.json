I always tried to make it an educational didactic experience through the use of applications, which had a very positive effect on Fatima as I achieved the interest of Fatima. On the other hand, apart from sharing academic issues with F\u00e1tima, I also managed to establish a relationship of trust, and in this way, to know her more as a person, to know her dreams, her tastes and what she does not like. Once the pending tasks were finished, with my classmates we organized games and went out with the other children and in this way we also offered them a moment of leisure and fun"
