My love for helping people was turned into a small part time venture that is busy growing rapidly by the demand that I created during the time that I spend working with individuals who struggle to get the jest of mathematics. My students are either in Primary School, High School, and most recently First year University students as well. \n\nA typical session with a student would be one on one. This ensures that the quality of the information being carried over to the student is of high standard and that the focus would be on the specific student only. Firstly I would start by going trough the most recent work done in class, I then go through everything again in detail to determine the main points of concern that needs focus.  \n\ni go through exercises from there work books and supply them with homework to do for the next lesson for quality control superposes. Once they have completed the homework, I clarify necessary aspects. Quality control helps the student to stay up to date with the work done in class as well.\n\nTo help the Student with his progress, I sent them a performance update on everything that they now understand and may be ticked off as a whole, and also a list of aspects that need more focus.",
