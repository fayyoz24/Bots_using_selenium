Following the drink from its birthplace in the mountains into young people\u2019s drinking circles in the city, I playfully draw together the richness of individual experiences, collective harmonization of alcohol effects and affects, and the flows and frictions of the drink\u2019s provisioning pathways. Doing so against the backdrop of both a national and regional problematization of alcohol and drive towards modernity, this study explores the different meanings, practices, and socialities afforded by Cap Tikus and its drinking circles, demonstrating the power of these socio-political movements for change and the youth resistance against them.
