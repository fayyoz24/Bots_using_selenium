    "summary": "Designing, planning, executing, and controlling business improvement programs has become my area of expertise since 2015. Specialized in Continuous Improvement, I have assisted diverse clients such as manufacturing company, banks, law firm, insurance, ministry, and construction company to improve their business efficiency, reduce operational costs, and speed up the end-to-end business process.\n \nAs of 2020, I took a break from full-time work to enjoy my first motherhood experience fully. Since then, I have been working part-time remotely; as a Lecturer for a private university in Indonesia and a Mentor for an educational start-up. Now, as my baby grows up, I am ready to move on to the next journey and return to work full-time. I am interested in a position related to change management, innovation management, and project planning and management. I am also open to other positions that suit my professional and academic experience.",
