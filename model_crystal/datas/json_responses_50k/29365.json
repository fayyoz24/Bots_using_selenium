Interactive video provides an opportunity to reach related content in one click and prolong the contact with the audience.\n\nPersonalization of experience is very important, but it is difficult to engage different types of audience with the same content. Interactive content provides each viewer with flexibility of choice and at the same time gives the content producer ability to analyze in depth the preference of their audience.",
