The following specific achievements are worth noting: \n- Main achievement in this period has been to not only centralise the application landscape internationally for Corporate Banking, but also use this with adaptions in the various countries for the Private Banking business line, resulting in a homogeneous systems landscape internationally. \n- A transformation of the IT organisation from a traditional department orientation towards an organisation working according to the Agile methodology. This \u2013 together with the implementation of related tools and procedures \u2013 meant a significant increase in pace of software delivery. \n- Another achievement was the deployment of key applications onto either an on-premise private cloud, as well as the use of public cloud technology, leading to standardisation of software products, and a more flexible way of developing.",
