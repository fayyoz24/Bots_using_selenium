(I have UPMA C.01.00501 certificate). I took a course from Scrum master.\nI am a purposeful, responsible, reliable and hardworking person. Thanks to the use of modern effective methodologies and tools in my work (methodologies of Agile and Waterfall, Scrum, Jira, MS Project, etc.) for project management, working in a team or on my own, I always achieve the set results on time.\nStress resistance and flexibility are the hallmarks of my character.\nAll this gives me unique competencies regarding the possibility of effective cooperation in the work of the Project Office (PMO).\n\nMy last position was the head of the Program for local modernization of telecommunications networks of Ukrtelecom JSC* using alternative telephony (FMC - Fixed Mobile Convergence).
