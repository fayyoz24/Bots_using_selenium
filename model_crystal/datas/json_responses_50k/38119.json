It focuses on public health issues of relevance to Zimbabwe and the African region. The unit's research group is multidisciplinary and collaborates with a range of local and international academic institutions. \n\nDuring my time at THRU ZIM:\n\nI led a qualitative study of the barriers that young men from poor urban communities face when seeking sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, as well as potential practical and policy solutions to these barriers. I conducted the study with two youth researchers from Harare as part of the Youth Researcher Academy. \n\nI co-authored the scientific article: \"Putting youth at the centre: co-design of a community-based intervention to improve HIV outcomes among youth in Zimbabwe.\" The article is published in the Welcome Trust's peer-reviewed journal: Welcome Open Research. \n\nI designed and conducted a survey to explore the usage of the free public-sector brand of male condoms among young people. Analysis of the results demonstrated that these were perceived as being of low quality, unpopular, and were used for polish and garters. I therefore conducted market research into attributes of product, packaging, and marketing that would improve uptake. This market research led me to oversee the design of a product that would meet these attributes, and the subsequent purchase of a million condoms for the CHIEDZA study, a cluster-randomised trial conducted in Zimbabwe of integrated HIV and SRH service. Prof. Dr. Rashida Ferrand has described these findings as \"prompting a significant shift in thinking by local agencies about condom programming in Zimbabwe\".",
