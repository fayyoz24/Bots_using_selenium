    "summary": "Facilitation Evangelist: An expert in the field of facilitation who actively promotes its importance and benefits. This person is passionate about the power of effective group collaboration and aims to spread the word, advocating for the adoption of facilitation techniques in various settings. An evangelist often uses multiple platforms, such as talks, workshops, and social media, to reach a wider audience and impact change.\n\nOpenAI.\u00a0(2023).\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0(September 25 Version)\u00a0[Large language model].\u00a0https://chat.openai.com\n\n****\n\nFacilitation combines the art and craft of making group collaboration easy. It's more than hosting workshops. It's more than a leadership skill. It's a way of life that we all practice in different ways when we host an engaging business meeting or gather friends for dinner.\n\nHave you ever felt overlooked in a crowd or felt a sense of disconnection as part of a group? \nThat's when the art of facilitation was missing.\n\nIf more people master the skill of facilitation, we can make significant changes in the world. Therefore, I am building an ecosystem for facilitators to leverage the impact of their work.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2e My WHY  \nBringing people together for new ways of being and doing to emerge.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My HOW\n\n** Cultivating the NeverDoneBefore Community as a skill-building ecosystem for facilitators: https://neverdonebefore.org\n** Creating customised facilitation training for teams and organisations\n** Offering 1-1 coaching and mentoring support\n** Offering agency services to connect master facilitators with organisations   \n\nhttps://workshops.work",
