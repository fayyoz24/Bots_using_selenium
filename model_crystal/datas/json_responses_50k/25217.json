    "summary": "I am a human-centered design leader and advocate for equity, as well as inclusive and diverse methodologies across digital platforms.  \n\nAs a unique hands-on leader, I have 20+ years in the tech industry, leading teams across industry domains: 30+ designers, 10+ engineers, and 30 products ranging from small startups to mid-sized to enterprise establishments.  \n\nI have a record of guiding teams to take products from conception to market delivery.  Amongst the companies and through design agencies, I drove digital experience design (DXD) that supported their digital transformations to include human-centric product development life cycles.  These companies include Intuit (TurboTax - US), Google (US - IOT agency), IKEA (INGKA - Sweden), VirBela (Metaverse - US), and Interpreta (McKesson + Centene - US), TIBCO - (US - agency), to name a few.\n \nI lead teams with a people-first agenda, honoring their growth and supporting their confidence, articulating design decisions that move the business forward with proven ROI based on data-driven strategies.  I seek out the hidden gems in each individual I lead, as doing so also brings out the best in me.  We can all prosper by creating a human connection and innovation through our digital products and supporting our design, tech, and business decisions that focus on belonging (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) principles.",
