    "summary": "Summary \n\nIn 2016, I graduated in higher education (HAVO) at the Berger Scholengemeenschap. In 2018 I graduated Athenaeum in the direction Science and Health (VWO with double profile, NG and NT) with the additional courses economics, geology and mathematical D (a course at the open university). Before Athenaeum, I graduated in higher education at the same school.  Because I\u2019m very ambitious and have a broad interest in beta and a bit in gamma courses, I decided to start the bachelor Medical Natural Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam in 2018. With this study, I develop a physical and biomedical view on medical issues and improvements. \n\nHow I describe myself? \n\nAs an open-minded problem solver who likes to challenge herself. My main driver, in this case, is curiosity. Without curiosity, you can never challenge or know the truth. I love working together and on my own, I\u2019m always open to meet new people and maintain friendships. Colleagues and friends will describe me as a personable, loyal, active person with good communication and excellent analytical skills.  \n\nBesides my study I do track and field in the Olympic Stadium Amsterdam, I am training for a half-marathon. In addition, I MTB and swim and more. I really like to train by myself in the dunes and forest or on the track with friends and others. \n\nMy next direction/ stop? \n\nIn the upcoming years, I want to wide my attentiveness even more and also want to specialize myself in directions that are within my field of interest.
