    "summary": "\u00a8Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u00a8\n\nIn 2016, I founded The Remote Trip (www.theremotetrip.com) to bring together a like-minded community of (aspiring) remote workers to work, live, and travel around the world together. We don't run any trips anymore, however, feel free to join our worldwide remote work community for free on LinkedIn and connect with other like-minded people here: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8737902\n\nSince 2018, I also developed a deep interest and experience in e-commerce, in particular Amazon FBA. This led me to launch two of my own private-label Amazon FBA products in the USA, and helping other businesses to launch and grow their business on Amazon in the USA and EU. \n\nAs the Head of Playbooks for Dwarfs.io (aggregator for Amazon/e-commerce brands), I've helped the company to grow from a team of 4 to 70 people and acquire 7 e-commerce brands in the first year. My main responsibilities were managing our team of six VA's, creating the scalable infrastructure for our Growth department by building a process- and project-oriented business, improving the company-wide way of (remote) working whilst working closely with all stakeholders of the company and CEO / CGO.\n\nWant to get in touch? Feel free to connect + message me on LinkedIn or send an email to amyfransz@gmail.com.\n\nSpecialties:  \n\nAmazon FBA product launches\nAmazon PPC\nAmazon product + keyword research \nAmazon trend analysis\nAmazon / Google SEO\nAmazon Brand Enhanced Content (A+ Content)\nAmazon review optimization\nAmazon conversion optimization\nAmazon listing optimization\nAmazon listing translations\nProject management (ASANA)\nProcess management (Process.st)\nVA outsourcing\nPrivate labeling\nGraphic design\nCopywriting\nImage and video editing\nCustomer service\nE-commerce\nFacebook Advertising\nSupply chain management\nEmail marketing\nWebsite design\nShopify / WordPress\n(Digital) Product Creation\nLead Generation\nSales Funnel Creation\nWebinar Marketing\nWordpress, HTML & CSS",
