    "summary": "I am a driven legal professional determined to give my contribution to a world with peace and respect of human rights.\n\nI started my legal career as a Judicial Defender in 2003. In collaboration with the Danish Centre for Human Rights, I represented victims and suspects in more than 20 cases of genocide and other crimes against humanity in Rwanda.\n\nSince 2007, I established my own law firm where, in collaboration with Belgian \"Avocats Sans Fronti\u00e8res\" and the Legal Aid Clinic of the University of Rwanda, I started to represent people in juvenile, gender and domestic violence related cases. \n\nI was part of the prosecution team in the case of the Prosecutor vs Callixte Mbarushimana in the International Criminal Court in The Hague. In addition, I worked for Africa Legal Aid which is a pan African Human Rights organization based in The Hague. \n\nCurrently I am working part-time as the Program Coordinator of the Great Lakes Program in The Hague Peace Projects. My main tasks include organizing conference, training and workshops for peace-builders and human rights activists.\n\nI have been admitted by the International Criminal Court to be included at the List of Assistants where I can work with a Defence or Legal representatives team before the Court. As an Independent Legal Consultant I work on other legal issues especially those related to immigration, asylum, mediation, arbitration. I am also very interested in international development law, investment law in business relationships between The Netherlands/Europe and Africa.\n\nI was awarded a Master of Laws, LLM, by the University of Groningen and Bachelor of Laws, LLB by the National University of Rwanda. I am solution-oriented, responsible and helpful to people.",
