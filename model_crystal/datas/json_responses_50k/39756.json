The goal is to find new and innovative investment and trade possibilities for these companies in Ghana. Deltares requisted us to come up with a business model that uses the water hyacinth - a highly invasive water weed - to create economic value. Our solution involved the production of biogas from the water hyacinth by affected local communities. Novelty in the proposed solution is the introduction of a purification, bottling and trading vessel. This vessel exploits economies of scale for the large capital involved with these steps in the biogas production, and also ensures regular maintenance and access to (international) markets. The vessel therefore tackles the main hurdles of biogas production and helps remove the water hyacinth where its negative impact is most severe. ",
