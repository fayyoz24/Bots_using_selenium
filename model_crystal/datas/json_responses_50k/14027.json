However, after 78 years, the first generation of soldiers, heroes and victims are slimming down. But we should never forget the horror of the war. Therefore we launched a new long term platform campaign with the key message: Keep the war stories alive, share them! \nWe produced over fifteen 2-minute stories, told by 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation war victims and heroes. On Spotify and radio (in program and commercials) we shared their stories. Supported by a TV, radio, video, social, outdoor and digital campaign. We also got a lot of PR attention in dutch TV and radioshows: stories were read out loud or played and people talked about the importance of sharing the stories. \n\nWe encouraged people to share their story so we never forget.

But, since this cancer has symptoms similar to a normal cold, people mostly ignore them which can be fatal. Paying attention and knowing the symptoms are therefor crucial. That\u2019s why we introduced during the Make Sense week: Oplettanol, the first remedy against head and neck cancer. This is a play on the word \u201cOpletten\u201d, which means paying attention in Dutch. The PR campaign was launched in a place where people come with similar complaints: the drugstore. The specially designed medicin packaging contains a leaflet with information from experts across Europe. With this knowledge, people can spot the symptoms of head and neck cancer faster. A nation wide PR and earned media campaign is launched with patients sharing their stories and health care institutions displaying the package and posters/flyers.",
