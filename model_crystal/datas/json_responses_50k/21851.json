    "summary": "I\u2019m a PhD in applied linguistics, specialising in higher education research and development. Within the past 10 years, I\u2019ve worked in Finnish, Swedish, and Russian higher education institutions, while living most of that time in the Greater Geneva area - and now in the cycling capital of the Netherlands: Groningen.\n\nIn my career, I\u2019ve had several different roles, including the one of a researcher, teacher, and communication specialist. In my research, I've focused on doctoral education, academic writing, and peer-mentoring of early-career researchers. My teaching activities, in turn, have revolved around academic writing, sociolinguistics, and English oracy skills for liberal arts bachelor students. Currently, I'm a Skills Teacher at the University of Groningen Language Centre (English Section).\n\nIn the past two years, I've increasingly focused on activities related to researcher development and academic writing. I've organised several in-person and online workshops targeted at early-career researchers around the world to develop their research and writing skills. In the future, I\u2019d like to pursue similar opportunities in the Netherlands.\n\nOverall, my career goal is to make researchers, teachers, and students rethink their current ways of doing, being, and thinking. In the context of scientific communication, I want to challenge and change how academic writing is currently being done and taught: In my view, academic writing shouldn't be about following a set of rules but about communicating your ideas creatively and by using your own voice.\n\nMy skill set in a nutshell:\n\u2705 Topics: doctoral education; early-career researchers; mentoring; community-building; academic writing\n\u2705 Teaching academic writing: value; audience; organisation; clarity; giving and receiving peer feedback; challenging the existing norms of academic writing; writing retreats\n\u2705 Qualitative research: ethnography; discourse analysis; interviews; surveys; content analysis; \"non-focus\"\n\u2705 Scientific communication: blogging for academic and non-academic audiences; press releases; presentations\n\u2705 Journal editing; proofreading (fi & en); translations (fi-en-fi)\n\u2705 Top 3 transferable skills: time management & organisation skills; written & oral communication skills; collaboration & mentoring",

            "description": "Although academic writing is one of the most important activities during doctoral studies and afterwards, courses related to writing or publishing are not typically taught extensively or systematically during doctoral studies. Instead, they are learnt through trial and error, from supervisors and peers, or through occasional workshops or symposia. \n\nYet, to succeed in academia it is impossible to escape academic writing, as it is the process that leads to publishing, and publications lead to promotions and research grants. The universities\u2019 stakes are high as well: Publication and citation numbers improve the rankings of universities, which again leads to prestige and increased funding on an institutional level. However, the development of an individual doctoral researcher\u2019s academic writing skills appears to come down to a series of lucky (or unlucky) coincidences. \n\nWith this project, I'm launching my interdisciplinary postdoctoral research on academic writing practices in Finnish doctoral education. Specifically, the project is for advancing and finalising three studies on academic writing and publishing, which are all aiming to \u201cmake sense\u201d of the \u201cacademic writing entanglement\u201d for doctoral researchers in the Finnish context.:\n\n1) How to support doctoral researchers\u2019 academic writing and publishing skills?\n2) How to make publishing-related decisions as a doctoral researcher?\n3) What is a \u201cgood, publishable article\u201d like?\n\nThis project will provide new, research-based knowledge on academic writing and publishing practices within the context of Finnish doctoral education. It will also offer valuable knowledge for those who work within Finnish doctoral education: supervisors, doctoral schools and programmes, and individual researchers who study doctoral education in Finland or abroad.",

            "description": "Early Career Higher Education Researchers (shorter ECHER) is a community of early-career scholars who share a research interest in the interdisciplinary field of higher education. ECHER was established in 2011. Since the earliest days ECHER has operated as a loose and mostly informal network of fellow academics, colleagues, and friends, and it has as such acted as a support network for junior scholars who wish to share experiences and resources, support each other, and expand opportunities to meet and collaborate. Our work at the moment is focused on the following activities: managing ECHER Blog, organizing discussions and events (see below), and disseminating information relevant for early-career scholars via social media and our mailing list. ECHER also works towards strengthening ties with other communities of similar character.\n\nIt should be stressed that ECHER is entirely independent and as such not part of any scholarly society. \n\nThe website of ECHER: https://echer.org/"
