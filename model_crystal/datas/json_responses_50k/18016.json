    "summary": "Hi, I am Samir Saberi\n\nMy mission in life is to clear the path for people. \n\nI do this by helping people and organisations to create the right environment for good decision making. \n\nAs an advisor, mentor, consultant and former executive I have learned that our ability to facilitate good decisions is the biggest lever we have to improve the effectiveness of our teams and organizations.\n\nMy aim is to help others do the same. Get better at the most elemental and high impact level: decision making.\n\nI also believe that better strategies, innovation and DEI efforts are critical for stellar performance.  By designing better decision architectures based on decision making and behavioral science I accordingly help you get: \n\n\ud835\udeab Better strategies \n\ud835\udeab Better innovation efforts\n\ud835\udeab Better DEI efforts\n\nWhy the focus on decisions? \n\nDecisions precede all action.  \n\nWhatever organizations do, all of them make decisions. They are decision factories.\n\nIf we want to create a step change in our performance and increase our abilities to face the challenges ahead such as climate change, better (access to) education and healthcare, clean energy, gender equality we need to improve the quality of our decisions.",
