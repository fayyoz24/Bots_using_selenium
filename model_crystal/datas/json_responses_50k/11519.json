INPER and its business partner \"Entrador\" supported both Erik and Dimitri and ASML in this project.\n\nProject challenge:\nThe key challenge was to identify best practices and best services processes to support the global ASML-upgrade teams in their day-to-day upgrade work at the customers premises.\n\nProject result:\nStarting practically from scratch we have delivered 8 key processes according to the customers standard (e.g.; ARIS-tool set).\nAs a result, the upgrade teams are able to improve their efficiency, process came available at a global level and......\n\n...... we were proud of our results!\n\nMore information:\n\nFrans Schreurs (INPER)\n+31 6 11008226\n",
