    "summary": "An optimist who'll persistently ask to find out more. Pleased to meet you! Currently working at IBM as a junior developer to support clients realize their desire to improve their IT landscape. The pace in IT is ferocious, and the wealth of opportunities astounding and I'm driven to contribute to that, whether by making simple but functional apps or working on a firm back-end structure to support it. All before going out with colleagues on Friday for a drink.\n\nMy background has furnished my analytical and programming skills. Furthermore, my interest in economics, history, technology and science among other fields stems from my belief that knowledge from any field can help someone grow and improve their own skills.\n\nDuring my studies I have pushed myself to take initiative, communicate and to work in teams. Among these I highly value communication as a way to improve cooperation between different people and groups through exchange of knowledge and opinions. Accordingly, presentations and speaking are skills I constantly aim to improve.",

Together with a working group we approached all PCs at our faculty and PCs at other faculties to learn from each other. This lead to a memo with guidelines and practical advice on how to raise awareness of the PC.\n\nPlayed an integral part in pushing for the development of new posters and a promotional film to raise awareness of the programme committee. The new poster, still to be implemented, is primarily one of my own design using Adobe Illustrator. It has met the approval of most PC members and the University. The film was my own proposal and was a project which I primarily directed, wrote, shot, played in, and edited. It has since been used by several organizations in the university.",
