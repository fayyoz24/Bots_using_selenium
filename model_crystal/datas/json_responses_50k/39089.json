    "summary": "In 2005 I graduated from the SPECO (Sports, Economics & Communication) in Tilburg and got my bachelor diploma in Economics. The last 6 months I had a very interesting internship at ABN AMRO Private Banking where I was responsible for creating, organizing and managing clienttreatment activities to acquire new clients and to further improve the relationship with exsisting clients.\n\nAfter my study I started working at Merchandise.nl in 2006, a very fast growing company, at which I was responsible for acquiring new clients. Besides that I was in contact with different production facilities in Europe and Asia. There I learned a lot about different production processes and how to manage them. \n\nIn 2008 I started working at COPA Football. A very exciting brand which has been one of my favorites for many years and still is. Here I started as production manager and I am responsible for all production processes for our different products, mainly textiles but also footballs, watches and leather bags.\n\nGoals: I find the different production processes involved in creating textiles extremely interesting and want to become more experienced. \n\nOne of my core competences is that I learn quickly and have a broad horizon, from people- to computerskills and am able to put these skills to use to further improve exsisting processes.\n\nSpecialties: Microsoft Office, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat, SPSS",
