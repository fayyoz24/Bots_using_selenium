    "summary": "\u201cWhen you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it \u2013 this is knowledge.\u201d - Confucius\n\nRelating to this quote, I would say that it is highly important to use the knowledge gained, no matter if it is gained in school, university, professional life, or while travelling. We can always gain knowledge and start using it. Additionally, I believe it is important to know the own strengths and weaknesses, to know what one is capable of, and what to work on. \n\nIn my own life I get motivated by reaching new goals, no matter if individually or together with a team. \nIf you work in a team, communication is crucial, also one can share knowledge and merge together different competencies to reach the best possible outcome. \nExactly this is the reason why I like to work in an international environment. Different cultures, people from different areas of the world, will all have different backgrounds, different experiences, and this can lead to a very well worked out final outcome. \n\nGoing along with this, the international experience is also the reason I chose to do the International Baccalaureate, work in totally different cultures in Australia and China, as well as to study and work in the Netherlands.",
