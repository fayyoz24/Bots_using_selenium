    "summary": "A love for sounds, colors, and shapes \u2013 for the sum that is greater than its parts \u2013 for the layers hidden beneath the obvious \u2013 for unconventional solutions to puzzles of everyday life. \n\nThese elements are at the core of my ever-growing list of job descriptions. I am a percussionist, photographer, music theater maker, and music educator. Whatever serves the purpose best becomes the medium. Often, it means having to learn a new craft.\n\nIt all started with a fascination for the endless world of percussion. In the music world, I found like-minded people. I adored playing Bach on the marimba and timpani in the orchestra but soon I realized that I couldn\u2019t stop imagining music in visual terms. From the day I performed Stuart S. Smith\u2019s \u2018Songs I-IX,\u2019 I knew that Music Theater was my thing. I love the tension between seeing and hearing, I love to think conceptually and to convey ideas that make the audience reflect.\n\nHaving a strong visual sense of music, I also started to explore music through the lens. I love that photography provides a different angle to experience music. I am driven by the search for the key moment - the moment that captures the true personality of a musician, might it be while playing or in a portrait. I love to show the energy that drives musicians from a perspective that the bare eye doesn\u2019t see.\n\nEver since I thought that music education is immensely rewarding. I believe that music education adds an enormous lot to a child\u2019s everyday life and education. Seeing that children grow up to be more accomplished adults with skills that they have learned in music lessons is a truly heartwarming experience.\n\nLast but not least, I sometimes happen to write a book, a course, or short essays, and I got the opportunity to work as a radio correspondent. By sharing reflective writings, I hope to build a little collection of ideas and concepts that can bring about a tiny change in society.\n\nAnd whenever I don\u2019t do any of these things, I take care of plants and garden or I renovate and decorate places.",
