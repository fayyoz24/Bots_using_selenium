    "summary": "\u2756 Summitbook is my consulting company centered around three roles - Speaker, Adviser and Mentor - serving both corporate and private clients. The mantra is simple; sharing experience, collaborating with a network of trusted relationships whose expertise I value and respect, and 'giving back'.\n\n\u2756 Before venturing into setting up my own company, for nearly 19 years I headed up the Prologis' Customer Led Solutions Europe team, managing global distribution space needs of several of Prologis\u2019 largest and most strategic European key clients \u2013 logistics service providers, technology, automotive and e-commerce companies. I provided the company access to existing and new customers in an effort to secure distribution center transactions. I ensured repeat business customers could grow within the global platform and could depend on a \u2018trusted partner\u2019 in emerging markets such as China. I was involved with the China-Europe \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d strategy initiative.\n\n\u2756 Prologis is the world\u2019s largest global logistics real estate developer, leasing 93 million square meter to 5,500 customers. It\u2019s customers manufacture and distribute the goods that make modern life possible. Prologis provides logistics real estate solutions that ensure efficient delivery of their products worldwide.\n\n\u2756 Prior to joining Prologis in 2003, I was business development manager at Kuehne + Nagel, overseeing development and implementation of new logistics services for airport operators, construction consortia and airport equipment suppliers, with airport construction projects in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Before that, I served as Director of Strategy and Business Development for Royal Schiphol Group and advised on airport and transport infrastructure projects at PWC corporate finance. \n\n\u2756 My experience covers strategy setting, business development, marketing, industrial real estate development and customer relationship management. I combine a strong network of personal, trusted relationships with a deep understanding of the world of global logistics and 30+ years of business development experience. \n\n\u2756 I received my MSc degree in Industrial Geography from Radboud University in Nijmegen and completed various senior management training programs at INSEAD, Cranfield University School of Management, Hult Ashridge Business School and Amsterdam Institute of Finance. I am fluent in Dutch, English and German. \n\n\u2756 I live with my wife and two adult sons in The Netherlands. I have always had a passion for global travel and discovery. Part of the year I enjoy staying at our Dutch Caribbean residence.",
