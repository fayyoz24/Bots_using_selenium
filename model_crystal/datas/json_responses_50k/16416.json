    "summary": "Recent graduate with a BSc in International Business Administration from the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Interested in working in a dynamic, international environment where I can optimize the knowledge and experience gained from my studies. \n\nFluent in English and Dutch, beginner in Spanish and German. Experience in client relations, data science, marketing and working under pressure. Skilled in adaptability, empathy, organizational, collaborative and intercultural communication, positivity and decision-making. I have a strong work ethic and I am excited to learn additional practical skills.\n\nIn pursuit of my passion for international environments, I have spend a semester at an Education First (EF) language school in San Francisco, California, as well as an online semester abroad at the Universidad del Desarrollo in Chile, during my studies. I also made the conscious decision to study at an international BSc program, which included only English courses. \n\nFor my current job, I deliver cars to clients for AutoAfleveren.nl, where I am in contact with lease companies and car dealerships, as well as the eventual driver. I inspect and deliver cars to clients, whom I then help with the practicalities of driving the vehicle and any remaining paperwork. \nIn pursuit of my passion for business, I have been the treasurer for the American Football Nijmegen Pirates, where I am also a board member. As treasurer, I handle budgeting, annual reviews and payments, as well as other, administrative, tasks.",
