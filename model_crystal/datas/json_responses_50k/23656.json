This was approached by qualitatively studying the effect of different factors on the nucleation efficiency of the non-photochemical process using unfocused pulsed laser in aqueous supersaturated solution of KCl. The factors investigated included wavelength, peak intensity, supersaturation, mixing, and impurity level of the solution. Each of these parameters were studied using high number of samples (80-100) to generate a robust set of results and to avoid the stochastic nature of nucleation.\n",

This was approached by qualitatively studying the effect of different factors on the nucleation efficiency of the non-photochemical process using unfocused pulsed laser in aqueous supersaturated solution of KCl. The factors investigated included wavelength, peak intensity, supersaturation, mixing, and impurity level of the solution. Each of these parameters were studied using high number of samples (80-100) to generate a robust set of results and to avoid the stochastic nature of nucleation.",
