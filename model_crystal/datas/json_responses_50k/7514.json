I graduated in Nutrition and Health Sciences (Wageningen University) and finished my Master in Public Health (Netherlands School for Public Health) in 1998. After a few years of research at TNO-Nutrition I started in 1991 at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) working on an international project on the prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. I contributed to the Public Health Status and Forecasts in 1993, 1997 and 2002. In 2002 I started working at the Netherlands Institute for Health Promotion (NIGZ). Main topics:  socio-economic differences in health, overweight, community development and risk behavior in youth. Between 2004 and 2010 I was manager of the department Youth (later Consultation & Innovation). At CBO, I was involved in several international projects in the field of Health Promotion and equity in health. Within the Netherlands, my main topics are local health policy and workrelated Health Promotion and  innovative approaches in creating 'Sustainable Health Care'. \nMy goal is to create more cooperative efforts in building a strong Health Promotion Network in the Netherlands with strong focus on Local Health Development and sharing of knowledge between Science, Practice and Policy.\nAt the NHG (Dutch College of General Practitioners) I am, among other things, responsible for supporting general pracititioners (GPs) in working on quality improvement within GP practice, with a focus on new thinking about Quality, based on a continuously learning environment. As (shared) programme-manager Prevention I am responsible for the activities within NHG on prevention in primary health care.\n\nSince 2019 I am board member of the platform for Public Health professionals in the Netherlands, PHned. \n\nSpecialties: Innovation in health promotion & Prevention; Cooperation between public & private partners; \nNetworking expertise; Translating policy into action; Workplace Health Promotion; Quality improvement in Health Care.\n\nWant to know more?
