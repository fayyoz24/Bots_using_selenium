    "summary": "Creative strategy consultant and manager with international board room experience. Sensitive to political and organizational environment, to mutual relationships and to political and organizational force fields and structures. Broad expertise in the financial side of policy making, financing issues and business cases (macro, international, business and financial economics, public and corporate finances).\n\nTranslates vision into action. Connector of peoples and parties. Searches and finds broadly supported solutions to complex problems. Networker who invests in relationships. Results-oriented bridge-builder with an eye for short and long-term objectives. Strategist with a keen eye, who knows how to switch quickly and take advantage of opportunities. Likes to think outside the box; likes variety. Attaches great importance to trust and to an inspiring and safe working climate.\n\nI perform well ...\n... in an environment where energy and dynamism thrive: I work intuitively, I am sensitive to mutual relationships and (subconscious) force fields, I can spot what is feasible and achievable, and what is not, I can name that and act accordingly; \n... where there is excitement, tension or 'hassle': I like to bring parties together, I explore what is shared and what not, and I realize broad support so that we can move forward together; `\n... in a freer role, where space is given to me to follow my own approach: I like to be visible, I know how to act as an honest broker, I can be a neutral chairman of warring parties; \n... by looking beyond the horizon, and tracking back the steps and actions that need be taken today and tomorrow to keep everybody on course for that dot on the horizon; \n... in tasks and jobs with a tangible result: I do not shy away from difficult questions, I dare to take a position, and am also willing to reconsider and move my position if that brings a broadly supported solution closer.",

This study concerns the vision of the national government, province and municipalities on the spatial planning, mobility and urbanization of the Utrecht region in 2040 and beyond. The national and regional authorities were somewhat opposed in their views, and I was able to bring them closer together. National and regional interests are not always aligned; thanks to various interventions, I have succeeded in bringing all authorities and other parties to one shared vision. \n\u2022 On behalf of the Utrecht region, I submitted an investment proposal (EUR 2.1 billion) to the National Growth Fund to relieve the pressure on regional and national mobility networks. I provided guidance to the municipality and province in the dynamics of the process and decision-making of the Growth Fund. \n\u2022 On behalf of the Ministry of IenW, I contributed to the establishment of the National Growth Fund and the connection of the fund to the existing policy instruments under the MIRT and the Mobility Fund.",
