    "summary": "My biggest strengths are my insatiable curiosity, my drive to learn and master new skills and my ability to quickly pick up new tasks. I easily get enthusiastic about all sorts of topics given that they are aligned with my values (amongst others sustainability and authenticity) and interests. I constantly seek new challenges, both physical and cognitive, to acquire new expertise and to stay engaged. In my opinion, what gives color to life are the experiences you make and the connections you form.\n\nI have a master\u2019s degree in biology where I\u2019m most interested in environmental & ecological research as well as in sustainability and planetary health. Studying biology has allowed me to participate in several research projects involving fieldwork in remote places such as the Andes Mountains in Ecuador or the Tropics in DRC which also sparked my great passion for traveling and for leaning new languages. At this moment, I work as a part-time research assistant in the field of evolution and adaptation of plants while at the same time pursuing a degree in Physiotherapy. \n\nIn my free time I enjoy engaging in various kinds of sports such as dancing and body work after having played Ultimate Frisbee competitively for several years. I\u2019m interested in mental health practices and the science behind human performance. A question I am continuously trying to find an answer for is how to live a life in congruency with human evolution while embracing the opportunities that technology and progress\u00a0bring\u00a0about.",
