    "summary": "When most people think of chiropractic, they think of neck and back pain relief. Of course, chiropractic is an excellent way to relieve neck and back pain, but this is only a fraction of what the original chiropractic is all about. The founder of chiropractic, DD Palmer, taught that altered nerve flow was the root cause of disease and that misaligned spinal vertebrae negatively affect nerve flow. He taught that restoring the vertebrae to their proper alignment would restore health. Chiro Brandon carries on this tradition, and more.\n\nAt Chiro Brandon our goal is \u201cto establish a balance between your body, mind and well-being of the spirit by allowing your body to properly signal internal messages in the regulation.\u201d We use a chiropractic method called the \u201cZone Technique\u201d, specifically, the Zone Technique is founded by Dr. Pete Goldman and built upon the principles of Palmer\u2019s real chiropractic, combined with the teachings of Dr. Thurman Fleet (1895-1983), as well as many of his other influences in healing, and metaphysics.",
