I participate in research and development and marketing. I use Matlab, Python, and SeaSonde software products to visually and statistically assess HFR energy spectra, wave, wind, current, and hardware diagnostics data and compare to a secondary data source. I also test and assist in evaluation of software. \n\nCollaborating with scientists at Rutgers University, we analyze wave returns from HFR sites along the New Jersey shore. Comparing wave height, wave period, and wind direction to nearby NOAA NDBC buoy output, we have learned that wind direction can greatly impact wave heights along the Jersey shore. Offshore winds create fetch-limited nearshore conditions that result in increased wave height with distance from shore. In contrast, onshore winds produce a more consistently homogeneous nearshore wave pattern. We are also analyzing bimodal wave conditions, which consist of wind waves and swell, and exploring methods for mitigating noise and interference.  \n\nFortunate to attend the Ocean Radar Conference for Asia-Pacific, I presented waves observations along the New Jersey shore (see attached DaughartyetalORCA.pdf) and developed a CODAR newsletter to describe the event for our partners and clients (see attached 2018_4th_ORCA_Asia_Pacific.pdf).",
