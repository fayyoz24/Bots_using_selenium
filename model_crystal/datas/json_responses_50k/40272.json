Our insurance customers are able to earn extra (cashback) rewards. The website is using Sitecore as it main platform, the mobile apps are custom development, native iOS and Android.\n\nI have two main roles at Onlia:\n- Product lead for our app (Onlia Sense)\n- Development lead for our development teams (web & mobile)\n\nRegarding Onlia Sense, I am responsible for shaping our roadmap and strategy and executing upon them. We work with a relatively small team, which enables us to ship new features to our users monthly. The team itself is very involved in decision making on what to do next, how to solve certain customer issues or what the right design is to approach certain new features. \n\nMy main assignment on the development side is to build an internal development competence. When I joined all our development work was outsourced. I have built a new internal mobile development team to build out our app (Onlia Sense) and I restructed and insourced web development by now working with a hybrid team of internal and external developers. This lead to increased owership by the development teams and improved collaboration with other teams such as marketing and design. \n\nFurthermore I manage both app and web backlogs and execution of the work by the teams. I make sure we work in a smooth agile process, priorities of the different teams and stakeholders are properly represented and acted upon and we release to production on a regular schedule.",
