    "summary": "As a strategy & proposition design consultant I work on the playing field of strategy & design. My focus is on building new ventures and proposition in complex environments. I am passionate about social impact and sustainability and focus within that field on Foodtech & Innovation as a means to tackling some of the most pressing challenges of today. Central to the work I do is driving responsible business and guiding the conversation on inclusivity and purpose-led results at clients.\n\nWithin the teams I have worked I take a role as connector of ideas and people and translate that into working concepts and strategies. I get praised for my high emotional intelligence, ability to work in a high-pressure context and energy, inspiration and motivation I bring to teams.\n\nAfter completing a study in Strategic Product Design (cum laude) I worked in the Blockchain space for several years. Working with a \u2018disruptive innovation technology\u2019 taught me a great deal on stakeholder management, ecosystems and scaling technical innovations. \nSince the start of 2020 I have been working in the Customer Strategy & Design team to work on a broader array of strategy project and proposition design. Here I further develop skills in building new ventures and take on increasingly more responsible roles. \n\nApart from my \u2018day to day\u2019 work I engage in activities that have a particular focus on making an impact on society. I hold a position in the Board of Advisory of the Deloitte Impact Foundation, led the Female Ventures Amsterdam team and was on the board of the Cultural Diversity and Inclusion network at Risk Advisory. At Deloitte I have been selected as the Dutch 2022 One Young World delegate. \n\nI am always interested in meeting new people and sparring about how to tackle complex problems. If you\u2019re interested in connecting feel free to reach out to me at aklapwijk@deloitte.nl.",
