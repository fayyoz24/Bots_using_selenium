    "summary": "I am a passionate Innovation and Marketing Scientist. My colleagues and I apply scientific methods to investigate how innovation- and marketing-related decisions affect firm and customer outcomes. My job is to answer some intriguing research questions through systematic investigation (i.e., with the necessary academic rigor) and, more importantly, inform others about the findings in a way that they can relate to. Therefore, it is no different than telling a good story. I hope that my stories will, in some way, impact society beyond just getting published in an academic journal. \n\nThe core of my research is about investigating the outcomes of firms\u2019 innovation responses to external environmental changes (e.g., an emerging technology or emerging customer preferences) \u2013 a.k.a Transformative Marketing as described by Prof. V. Kumar. Specifically, I am passionate about understanding the factors leading to the differences in firm responses and outcomes. At present, the outcome I am interested in is shareholder value. In the future, I wish to integrate a stakeholder perspective with my research. I employ various methods including natural language processing, machine learning, text analysis, econometric analyses of secondary & primary data, and meta-analysis in my research. \n\nWhen I am not lost in my research projects, I also teach Graduate (Marketing Management and Marketing Intelligence) units at the Macquarie Business School. Being an educator provides me a space to engage with fresh minds with new ideas and learn more about the discipline that I am so passionate about. It is also a very satisfying and humbling experience to know that I am helping to shape the minds of future leaders in my own limited capacity. \n\nOther than research and teaching, I am passionate about travel, movies, music, and reading. Before pursuing an academic career, I worked in the industry for over a decade in various roles across technology consulting, sales, and marketing. My industry experience is a huge bonus for me in my teaching as it helps me to share my experience with the students and make it more relatable. It also helps me in my research as many of the questions I run after are inspired from my previous experiences.
