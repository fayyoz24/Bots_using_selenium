The focus here wasn't on creating the smoothest design, but on increasing efficiency and effectiveness using quick wins since there are people in desperate need of financial compensation by the UHT. And of course the public and political pressure on the organisation were high as well. This required me to be pragmatic, realistic and flexible about what could be realised.\nAt the same time I also championed the outside-in perspective of the UX mindset instead of the traditional inside-out perspective. I initiated quick and informal user interviews to validate proposed solutions and also researched the effectiveness of the product after launch. The team could then incorporate these learnings into their next product development effort. I also incorporated UX into the Business Analysis process, to make sure not only business and technical interests were represented but also that of the employees that have to work with the product.",

After three weeks of interviews, analysing needs and building frameworks for understanding, we downloaded the insights to the EX team during a design sprint. After that the team started iterating with the insights we uncovered. I learned how to communicate effectively within a large consultancy firm, how to effectively tell our story in a way they were able to hear it and how to interview people from all ranks in the organisation.",
