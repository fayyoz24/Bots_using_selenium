Although I began in a support role for multiple projects, I quickly gained the privilege of leading international endeavors. Notable highlights include designing a private gallery for Foundation Sorigu\u00e9, participating in a superhigh-rise competition in Shenzhen, and leading a masterplan project in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil.\n\nTo further hone my skills, I had the honor of contributing to the prestigious New Amsterdam Courthouse project, from its inception to nearly its completion. Additionally, I had the opportunity to serve as landside architect for the Schiphol new terminal project, further expanding my expertise.\n\nToday, I serve as a project leader and project architect, contributing to competitions in Europe and housing projects in the Netherlands. Noteworthy achievements include designing the Lumiere Tower in Rotterdam, winning a competition in Prijkels, Belgium, and a confidential national institute headquarters project in Belgium.",
