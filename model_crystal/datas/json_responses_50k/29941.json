    "summary": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b\n\n\u270d\ufe0f I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of demand planning, inventory management, and pioneering the S&OP process. As an EMEA Demand Planner at Rockwell Automation, I'm on an exciting journey to create a meaningful impact by enhancing forecast accuracy, service levels, and ultimately optimizing inventory costs.\n\n\ud83e\udd47 With over 5 years of work experience in both India and the Netherlands, along with my educational background in Electrical engineering and a Master's degree in Operations Management from both SPJIMR (India) and Nyenrode Business University (Netherlands), I've seamlessly merged technical knowledge with management expertise.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 My skill set covers a broad spectrum, including long and medium-term materials planning, as well as fine-tuning inventory optimization. I take pleasure in generating financial value by crafting models using statistics, Python, and advanced Excel functions. Additionally, I bring a robust sense of commercial acumen to the table, making me a well-rounded contributor to the supply chain planning landscape.\n\n\ud83e\udd1dWhat sets me apart is my results-driven attitude, genuine passion for connecting with people, and my ability to relate to individuals from diverse backgrounds. I firmly believe in the adage that you're the smartest person in the room when you're taking a shower\u2014a reminder to stay humble and open to learning.\n\n\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate in the ever-evolving world of supply chain planning and beyond. \ud83d\ude80 #SupplyChainEnthusiast #ContinuousLearner",

This approach evaluates a probabilistic measure of the transient stability, instead of just a particular response to a specified disturbance. Due to the large number of simulations required, the application of a hybrid method to assess transient stability reduces drastically the computing time. A probabilistic version of the software package PSAT was applied to a test power network during the simulation time, the occurrence of disturbances and the subsequent protective actions are assumed as a stochastic process. Finally, the obtained results are discussed and some conclusions that provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of the system dynamics are pointed out",
