    "summary": "I am Rosa Vrij. I am 29 years old and I\u2019m a Netherlands based performance maker, visual artist and artistic researcher. I create interdisciplinary art in which I turn around the roles of the audience and the artwork. The audience is a cocreator and co-responsible in my search for the boundaries between the body and architecture. I\u2019m inspired by video games and board games, and the way in which rules are used to facilitate player interaction. I also love graphic novels, modular furniture and experimental book design.\n\nMy work is rooted in intersectional feminism. It\u2019s empathetic, poetic, personal, non-hierarchal and finds its meaning between the lines. I think the focus on economic value, efficiency and competition has gone way overboard in our neoliberal society. That\u2019s why I believe art plays a crucial role in connecting people to themselves and to each other. My work activates the senses so that the audience can meet each other in the here and now. \n\nIn 2016 I obtained my bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Arts, and in 2022 I graduated from the Master in Theater (Institute of Performative Arts Maastricht). My work has been shown in both the art and theater sector, at venues such as Over het IJ Festival (Amsterdam), TENT (Rotterdam), Odapark (Venray), Toneelgroep Maastricht and Bora Bora - Dance and Visual Theater (Aarhus, DK). Since 2022 I have been supported by the talent development platform VIA ZUID (Limburg). \n\nBesides my artistic practice I mentor starting artists and students and am involved as a talent development expert at several experimental art organizations, among which TimeWindow (Rotterdam). This is also where I have my studio. I like to think about structures based on solidarity and equality, to build on a fairer and healthier cultural sector.",
