I also acquired skills and knowledge in the PMP - defined project phases: initiating, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and close out procedures; and coordinated in-house construction efforts within Amtrak-owned and/or maintained right-of-way, including track, bridges, buildings, signals and communications facilities, and electric traction facilities.",
