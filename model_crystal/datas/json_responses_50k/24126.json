    "summary": "Meeting interesting people, trying new things, spending time on social media, researching, and writing: what do all of these things have in common? \n\nYep, that's right: I love to do each of these, and as someone who works with all things Marketing & Communications, I get to incorporate them in my day-to-day work.\n\nPretty cool, right? \ud83d\ude0e But I wasn't always on the path to this career field. My academic background is actually in Political Science & Business Economics, and content creation is just something I was passionate about alongside my studies. But after trying my hand at marketing, social media, and communications, I realized rather quickly that this was the life for me. I've now put my skills to the test in a number of different industries -- ranging from credit insurance (B2B), to education (B2B & B2C), to artificial intelligence (B2C & B2B), and so much more (B2B & B2C) -- and I couldn't be more excited to see what's next for me in this journey.\n\nOutside of my Digital Marketing work, I also spend a lot of time volunteering with expats and students as a mentor, translator, and tutor. As an immigrant who received very little guidance during their academic and professional career, I know what it's like to feel lost and uncertain, and I want to offer support to young professionals who find themselves in a similar situation.\n\nAs of 9 years ago, I am also an independent fashion model, collaborating primarily with up-and-coming photographers and sustainable brands. Modeling started out as a way for me to build my confidence, and it turned into something that allows me to meet new people, raise awareness for worthwhile causes, and offer exposure to brands and individuals in the fashion industry whose mission I support.\n\nSo, if you're...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Wondering what life is like in the Digital Marketing, Social Media, and Communications industries\n\ud83d\udc49 Trying to switch to work in those fields but aren't sure where to start\n\ud83d\udc49 Curious to know how to pursue work outside of your primary academic study\n\ud83d\udc49 A student/recent graduate seeking mentorship, guidance, or advice\n\ud83d\udc49 Just looking to get in touch about something else\n\n...Don't hesitate to send me a message! I'm only one connection request away \ud83d\ude0a",

In this conversation Marina discusses her transition internationally for schooling and work as well as her use of LinkedIn to network to grow her career.\n\nQUOTES\n\u201cI've never done anything with LinkedIn. Because I think as many people, I had the belief that like LinkedIn is just where you paste your resume. You say I'm humbled to announce my new job, things like that. But I was like, No, there's got to be something more to it.\u201d \u2013 Marina Krivonossova\n\n\u201cNetworking is huge here. And I mean, currently the company for whom I work, we organize, you know, a few annual conferences, we always place a huge emphasis on networking and the networking opportunities we offer. And we know our clients are extremely keen on that, they want to meet other people in their industry in similar industries, just in other industries, and networking is a huge thing for them.\u201d \u2013 Marina Krivonossova\n\n\u201cYou should really just push past the initial awkwardness of starting to post and start posting about what you're interested in, I would really say that you don't even have to pick a specific field of interest at the beginning, you should just start posting and see what feels comfortable.\u201d \u2013 Marina Krivonossova\u00a0\n\nAUDIO LINK: https://chanwithaplan.podbean.com/e/how-studying-and-working-abroad-can-change-your-life/",

The podcast was extremely short-lived, at only one season of four episodes. It was a very fun and interesting project to undertake, but unfortunately, it proved to be much too time-consuming for something that I was doing for free on the side, alongside my other work and volunteer projects. I hope that despite my departure from the podcast, GHRD continues to keep conversations going around this incredibly important topic.\n\nThis podcsat was even featured on BizCatalyst 360: https://www.bizcatalyst360.com/standing-up-for-human-rights/",
