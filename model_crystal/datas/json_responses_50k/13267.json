    "summary": "I'm motivated by the potential of design to make life better, piece-by-piece, by making everyday tasks easier and hopefully a little more fun. A career centered around visual and interactive design, creative strategy and storytelling, I'm passionate about learning, spreading and contributing to cultural expression all while influencing real community change. \n\nWith a vibrant energy and proactive approach, I flourish in collaborative environments but am just as self-motivated accomplishing things on my own. Though I specialize in designing for digital, I have a broad skill set that includes front-end development, creative direction, illustration, motion graphics, and video production.\n\nTake a peek at my portfolio:\nwww.jordynnmcknight.com",
