Provides a modular, customisable framework for numerical likelihood functionality and for prior density implementation. The package interfaces with external libraries for Bayesian computation and provides a suite of numerical algorithms for image computation via relativistic ray-tracing.The package is natively CPU-based, and built from a mixture of high (object oriented) and lower-level code: C extensions for Python (via Cython) to optimize away severe performance bottlenecks. It implements several core Python packages for numerics and visualisation; uses concepts such as inheritance, various descriptors, generators, and context management; is parallelised for several scales of computing architecture; is documented with Sphinx, including Jupyter notebook tutorials; and is hosted on GitHub. Implements: Python, C, Cython, NumPy, OpenMP, GSL, MultiNest, PyMultiNest, mpi4py, Sphinx+markdown/reST, Matplotlib, GetDist, nestcheck, SciPy, emcee, SymPy.",

Provides a modular, customisable framework for numerical likelihood functionality and for prior density implementation. The package interfaces with external libraries for Bayesian computation (nested sampling; ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling) and provides a suite of numerical algorithms for image computation via relativistic ray-tracing. The package is natively CPU-based, and built from a mixture of high (object oriented) and lower-level code: C extensions for Python (via Cython) to optimize away severe performance bottlenecks. It implements several core Python packages for numerics and visualisation; uses concepts such as inheritance, various descriptors, generators, and context management; is parallelised for several scales of computing architecture; is documented with Sphinx, including Jupyter notebook tutorials; and is hosted on GitHub. Implements: Python, C, Cython, NumPy, OpenMP, GSL, MultiNest, PyMultiNest, mpi4py, Sphinx+markdown/reST, Matplotlib, GetDist, nestcheck, SciPy, emcee, SymPy.",
