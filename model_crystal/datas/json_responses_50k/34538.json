The cliffs consist of Upper Cretaceous chalks of the Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation, overlain by the Seaford Chalk Formation. The study area covers between the National Trust Education Centre and the South Foreland Lighthouse in the east. The study consisted of 21 unsupervised days in the field, which included a discontinuity survey, measuring movement in tension cracks and sedimentary logging. The results were then analysed using lab testing and computer programs including the RocScience Suite. The study concluded by recommended how to reduce the risks the cliff fall hazards posed to the walkers on the cliff.",
