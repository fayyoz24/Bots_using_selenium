These models will be integrated in adaptive personalized behavior change interventions to increase adherence of the patients to their care program and improve their interaction with health professionals. A cloud-based Data Integration Service, collecting and processing data from personal devices and EHR/PHR in real-time feeds the decision support system.\n\nThe results of the self-management support system with respect to clinical parameters, awareness, acceptance and empowerment of the patient to participate in the care process will be evaluated in three studies in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.\n\nThe deliverables of the project will increase self-management capabilities and participation of the patient in the care process, resulting in better self-control and management of the disease. This will lead to better glucose management, thereby preventing severe episodes and long-term complications.",

This mission will be accomplished by setting up a multi-scale model to study the systemic interactions of the involved biological mechanisms (immunological/inflammatory processes, energy intake/expenditure ratio and cell cycle rate) in response to a variety of nutritional and metabolic stimuli/stressors. \nThe project aims at paving the way for translating validated multilevel immune-metabolic models into the clinical setting of T2D. Indeed, this approach will eventually generate predictive biomarkers from the integration of metabolic, nutritional, immune/inflammatory, genetic and gut microbiota profiles, as well as of clinical data, suitable to be translated into cost-effective mobile-based diagnostic tools.\nTNO is the leader of two work packages within this project. My colleague Albert de Graaf is the Senior Scientist involved in this project and these two work packages, my role is that of Project Manager within TNO. ",
