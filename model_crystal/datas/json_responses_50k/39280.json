    "summary": "I am a hard-working, Leisure & Events Management third year student with Social Innovation as specialization, who likes to explore new things. I have experience as a charity volunteer and I am looking for new challenges and experiences. My biggest ambition at the moment is to gain experience in the events industry, learn how to produce them, manage the stage and artists. Because of travelling and living abroad I developed my English skills and I am very open-minded. I like to explore and learn about different cultures. Recently I have started my own podcast about K-pop and Korean culture, with an ambition to evolve into my own radio show. I love concerts, music, fashion, make-up and dancing. I am interested in K-pop, Korean culture, music and fashion industry.",
