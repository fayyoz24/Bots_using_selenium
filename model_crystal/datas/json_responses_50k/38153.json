    "summary": "I am an experienced innovation and (contract) R&D manager in agri-food tech, lifesciences & health, in academia, government  and private sector. My background is molecular life sciences and my career has focused on improving quality, health, safety and sustainability in agri-food tech business management. Developed products included novel diagnostics and predictive management tools based on measurement and data analyses. Since my education at Wageningen, Michigan State and Gent Universities, I was involved in fundamental and applied molecular microbial diagnostics and data analytics for more than 15 years. Since the turn of the millennium my activities extended with contract research, knowledge transfer and implementation of innovative technologies in commercial settings. My innovation management positions at Agri-food tech companies allowed me to further broaden technical expertise, develop business development, data science and bussiness intelligence as well as strategic, finance and funding skills. This building a thorough understanding of the process from \u201cchallenge\u201d and ideation to product implementation.\nI am an associative, analytical and unconventional thinker with an innovative mindset and resourceful of creative approaches. I enjoy multi-factorial challenges that need taking the big picture into account and novel ways of thinking. I like to implement radical innovation smoothened, in a close to incremental way, without unnecessary disturbance of \"business as usual\". This all with a passion for creating impact with real value.\n\n@Picture; Banded-Orange Butterfly. Change is the only constant. Butterfly effect refers to a small initial change that can result in large differences in a later state.\n\nCore expertise:\nInnovation management, consultancy, coaching of professionals\nResearch & development, portfolio, programm and change management\nAbility to operate at the interfaces of science & technology, government  and commerce, \nDevelopment of instrumental (bio)chemical and physical analytical methods in foodchain and health\nGenotype-phenotype matching.
