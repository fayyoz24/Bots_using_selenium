    "summary": "With a background in Economics and a bachelor's degree in Communication Science from the University of Amsterdam, my career began in the Dutch public broadcasting sector with AVRO (now AVROTROS). I transitioned to Transparent, a fast-growing data mining firm, where I embraced the role of Sales Manager, overseeing the Benelux region and eventually rising to the position of Business Director.\n\nDuring my tenure at Transparent, Benelux sales surged by more than a hundred percent. Seeking fresh challenges, I expanded into the Nordic market, establishing Transparent as a leading AP audit company in the region. Later, my focus expanded to Southern Europe, where I spearheaded our presence in Portugal and made inroads into the Spanish market. Today, I'm proud to have played a pivotal role in the company's growth and success across diverse markets.",
