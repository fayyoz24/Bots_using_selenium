    "summary": "I'm an interdisciplinary filmmaker specializing in hybrid films and immersive projects, with a focus on animation and documentary. Due to my intuitive ability and high sensitivity, my antenna is tuned to trends and undercurrents in society. Social themes such as identity, individual freedom, autonomy, and self-determination are often the starting point for my projects.\n\nI consider my work as activist art for change. As a creator, it is essential to me that my projects have an impact on different levels and challenge people. Through my initiatives, I aim to bring subcutaneous issues, often from an outsider's perspective, to an adult audience. My goal is to bring taboo topics out into the open and encourage audiences within social and political arenas to reflect on them.\n\nA project is conceived, created, and produced together, never alone. Making a genuine connection is essential and serves as the foundation for trust, constructive collaboration, and the success of a project. That's why I'm always seeking alliances with other disciplines. This often begins with a cup of coffee and a casual, informal chat. I would like to extend an invitation to you to join me.",
