    "summary": "With over 20 years of experience, I work with companies to achieve their short- and long-term business goals using digital marketing programs that leverage the power of the media, industry analysts and influencers - globally.\n\nMy history includes enabling B2B and B2C technology companies to successfully launch new products and service offerings, attract strategic partners and develop strategic alliances, increase brand equity, bolster sales, obtain funding, achieve a successful M&A or IPO, as well as develop, manage and recover a company's valuable reputation. \n\nLooking at an integrated marketing communications approach, my skills include:\n-PR and Thought Leadership: Contributing to the US sales pipeline for European and LATAM companies\n-Community Relations: Guiding tech companies through localized efforts (US, Europe and LATAM)\n-Global Strategy and Crisis Management (internal and external programs) \n-Brand Building/Reputation Management\n-Social Media/Blogging Writing and Strategy\n-PR and Marketing Collateral and Content Development \n-Speakers' Bureaus\n-Events/Conferences \n-Awards Programs\n-Global PR (working with global partner firms and international media)\n-Training for Sales to Leverage PR\n-Website Strategy (educating media, analysts, employees and customers)\n-Cause Marketing (bringing together companies with non-profits)\n\nASK ME ABOUT MY FOOD BACKGROUND!\nI started reviewing restaurants while at UC Santa Barbara.  This interest put me in the kitchen dabbling as a pastry chef assistant with Montecito Confections - creating wedding cakes and desserts for a celebrity clientele.  A few years later, I worked with the LA Times profiling restaurants throughout LA County.  This led into creating PR and marketing campaigns for restaurants in Los Angeles.  Today, I work in the intersection of technology and food working with startups to promote their brands.",
