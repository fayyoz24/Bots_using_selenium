More specifically:\n\u2022 I got familiarized with collaborative learning and methods to unlearn and deconstruct my own bias.\n\u2022 I learnt about the Civil Rights Movement and African American history.\n\u2022 I learnt about social justice and intersectionality.\n\u2022 I explored the human rights condition of lgbtqi+, Latino/Latina/Latix, African American and indigenous groups in the American South while meeting their respective grassroots organizations.\n\u2022 I learnt about community engagement and empowerment. \n\u2022 I co-created a podcast about the interplay between community and gentrification in Atlanta.\n\u2022 I planned my own Action Project Idea called \"Law and Racism\" which I implemented in cooperation with @Generation 2.0 in July 2020.\n\u2022 I was part of a powerful multicultural group intending to social change.",
