I am comfortable working in any sector, but I have particular expertise in sustainability and corporate social responsibility issues. \nI am a CELTA-qualified English teacher, so I recognise and understand the many aspects of English that can potentially confuse global audiences. That perspective makes me a more empathetic and pragmatic editor, driven by readers' needs rather than strict editorial rules.  \n  \n",
