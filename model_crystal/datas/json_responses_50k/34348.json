Research shows a positive relationship between the amount of litter on the streets and residents\u2019 feelings of insecurity.\nThe focus in this project is on (1) manufacturers of snacks, candy and soft drinks and such for the redesign of packaging and (2) retailers and (3) fast food industry for the redesign of issuance of litter-sensitive materials.
