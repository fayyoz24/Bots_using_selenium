We do not strive to do business for fame or fortune. We love doing business because it keeps us connected. I work great with anyone in your team, and communicating with me is always a breeze. In marketing, I bring humanity to your campaigns, let\u2019s make them real, connectable. Let\u2019s work with what you have, or create something better, fast.\n\nI love making polished visuals to position your brand. I love strategising about how we can commission user generated content that positions your brand as warm and personal. Let's find a way to do marketing that works for you as a business, and for your budget.\n\nIf you care to shoot me a message because you'd love to connect. Tell me about your big dream, something you wanted to do for a while, but feel like you're too old, too young, too poor or whatever.\n\nI work with movers and wavemakers. People that forge their own path.\n\nI'm experienced in these industries:\n\ud83c\udfe5 Health\n\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffc Recruitment/Talent scouting\n\ud83d\udc83 Sport/ Dance\n\ud83d\udd8b Education\n\u2708\ufe0f Travel",

(and funny) I was able to grow the association from approximately 40 members to 100 and a waitlist! Here's what some of my students have to say: \n\nJyotika: \"for me it's you teaching me not to care and making me feel comfortable again whilst being me, every time I dance. I'll be forever grateful for that\" \n\nCarla: \"Joey's classes were always a lot of fun for me, at the same time I was able to learn a lot from his choreos and his way of dancing. Joey has great positive energy and is always encouraging his students during class, therefore creating a nice environment for me and others to grow as dancers.\"",
