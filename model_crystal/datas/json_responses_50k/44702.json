Due to the complicity of the measurement chain, this involves a the ability to switch a significant amount between system level and component level thinking. Beside these tasks, I was responsible for providing the acceptance documents for the newly purchased equipment and methodology documentation for the EuroNCAP accreditation. After the initial phase, the work changed to a role as ADAS test engineer. In this role, I was, together with a team, responsible for preparation a vehicle and perform a test program according to different Euro NCAP protocols, where this team consist out of 3 or 4 test engineers.",

I performed my thesis under the supervision of prof.dr. H. Nijmeijer and prof.dr.ir. N. van de Wouw. For my thesis I performed an extensive literature research on lateral control methods, modeled the lateral dynamics of a vehicle in a non-linear and linearized vehicle model, based on the error dynamics derive a control method which fulfills a large set of requirements, using the linearized vehicle model and proposed control method obtain a model of the platoon dynamics for n vehicles and use this platoon model to perform time domain, frequency domain analysis and string stability analysis and finally, implement the proposed control method into a platoon of two experimental vehicles and evaluate the performance.",
