    "summary": "As a Design Thinker and Innovation Manager I have a broad experience facilitating innovation processes from conducting research to implementing solutions within a wide variety of contexts and cultures. I bridge the gap between the client, the user and technology, often using available resources. Believing everything is possible, live testing is the best while iterating on the fly and loves it when a plan comes together. \n\nMy daily work with BetaBreak exist on persuading organisations to use Open-Source software on a Green, Scalable and Secure infrastructure.  In the field of design, I support teams to enhance application to fit to their organisations processes.",

I have conducted a pilot between the Gaza Strip and Israel; and between the Netherlands and Belgium. This project led to a commission in 2011 from the Dutch newspaper Nrc.Next to visualise the Dutch provincial elections.  The project has been published in Nrc.Next (2012) and exhibited at the National M.K. \u010ciurlionis Museum, Kaunas Photo Festival, Lithuania (2010). \n\nhttp://raoulkramer.com/index.php?/work/equidistance-ii/",

In June 1942 the Japanese Army decided to build a 415-kilometre railway by making use of forced labourers and prisoners of war. Sixteen months later the tracks were finished but also more than 99,000 people had died due to bad circumstances.\n\nLost Track takes a conceptual approach on this topic by combining archive material with contemporary photographs and self-written texts. The result is a visual investigation where the viewer is invited to make a journey through time via abstract landscapes and mysterious still-life images.\n\nhttp://raoulkramer.com/index.php?/work/lost-track/\nLost Track bij bol.com http://go.bol.com/tp/9200000020297180\nLost Track at Amazon http://amzn.com/9081576011\n\nBook & Exhibition",
