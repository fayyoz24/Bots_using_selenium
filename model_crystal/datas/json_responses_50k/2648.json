This paper shows the relation between donations and firm performance moderated by customer satisfaction. Donations can be viewed as a non-strategic activity, especially when the cause is not related to the core business of the firm. I find that firm performance is negatively influenced by donations when moderated by customer satisfaction. Donations can have a negative influence on shareholder value, especially since the firms money could be used more strategically.",

The high executive salaries and bonuses are thought to be partially responsible for the enormous risks that were taken by some executives. One possible solution for firms is to benchmark the peer performance to the focal firm, a compensation strategy which is called Relative Performance Evaluation. The aim of this research paper was to find out whether executive compensation is negatively related to peer performance. \n\nIn this study we elaborate on previous studies by implicitly extracting compensation data from the ExecuComp database and compare peer performance measures from the CompuStat database. The hypothesis will be answered by meta-analyzing previous studies and conducting our own empirical analysis of RPE. Our research contributes to the literature by analyzing RPE usage in the investment banking industry (SIC code 6211).",
