    "summary": "I am an internationally oriented manager, having spent half of my working life outside the Netherlands, my country of origin. Being married to a Brazilian, I spent altogether 15 years working and living in Hungary, Brazil and Germany. Acquisitions and divestitures during my professional career exposed me to various companies and company cultures (Anglo Dutch Unilever, US based family company JohnsonDiversey, private equity investor C,D&R, US publicly traded company Sealed Air, Bain Capital). With my core professional skills in Finance, I have been in charge of CFO jobs in companies ranging from Euro 5 million in Hungary to Euro 100 million in Germany, also having been responsible for IT, Purchasing and Supply Chain in various of these companies. For an interim period of 9 months I also exercised the general/sales manager job in Germany. I also am known for my more specific financial accounting skills, that I could exercise as financial service centre director between 2009 and 2017. From September 2017, I broadened my area of responsibility to Global Business Services in Diversey, this includes service centres in India, Romania and Mexico for all relevant administrative and back office activities of our US$ 2,5 billion company. Since April 2019 I act as EMEA controller, overviewing 30 countries with total sales of US$ 1,3 billion, also acting as statutory director for our European Principal Company and another 10 Netherlands based holding companies. I also am available for supervisory board positions in profit/non profit sector, I followed a specific post graduate course for this purpose. I can be contacted by e-mail: hermanwillemweber@gmail.com",
