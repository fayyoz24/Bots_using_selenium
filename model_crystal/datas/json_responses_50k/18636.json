    "summary": "My name is Tina, and I have a diverse background with Persian and Turkish heritage. I am proficient in three languages: English, Turkish, and Persian.\nI am a self motivated and a fast learner student that alwavs tries to broaden and improve her skills, and gain the respect of her peers.\nDuring my high school years, I focused on mathematics while also delving into the field of tourism management for a year. This led me to an amazing experience at the Land of Legends Hotel. Inspired by this, I decided to explore opportunities in a more advanced country.\nAfter an extensive search, I found the Netherlands to be an excellent choice for me. I sought out a university with a global perspective, and that's when I discovered Wittenborg University of Applied Sciences. Wittenborg has already provided me with valuable lessons, and I am set to successfully obtain my bachelor's degree this year.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working with diverse organizations, each offering unique and enriching experiences. For my internship, I had the opportunity to delve into the field of digital marketing at Fillyouin, where I gained invaluable knowledge. I am eagerly anticipating the wealth of learning that awaits me in future endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
