Although TCI is viewed as a traditional sector, innovation and change are as much part of the textile-apparel value chain as of any high tech industry. In this context the Convention brought together a number of excellent speakers from the entire apparel value chain as well as a number of eminent academics who focused upon how the decisions of consumers affect businesses today and in the future.
