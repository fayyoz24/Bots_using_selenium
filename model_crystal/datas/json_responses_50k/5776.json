The project aimed at reducing the blade bending moments using a bend-twist coupling by varying the fiber orientation angles. Tasks included:\n- Extending MATLAB FEM beam cross section analysis tool to assess a fatigue damage of an arbitrary structure. The modified software can estimate the fatigue damage of a wind turbine blade for the given load cases.\n- Deriving analytical solutions for the fatigue damage of simple cross sections and validating the extended code.\n- Incorporating the software extension in a global optimization framework programmed in python. This allowed the fatigue analysis tool to become connected to the other software and usable in the wind turbine blade design process.",
