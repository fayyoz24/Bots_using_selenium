    "summary": "I am an ambitious and innovative mechanical engineer from China who is always looking for new\nchallenges and opportunities to further improve myself. I am especially passionate about solving problems that have a high degree of complexity and technical difficulty, as these often require creative yet systematic solution strategies. In order to satisfy this passion, I have therefore been conducting scientific research as a PhD researcher at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Though my PhD research topic (aerodynamics of wind turbines) is different from my background in bachelor's and master's (building technology), this challenge broadens my perspective with research experience and improves my communication skills. Thus, specialisations include different building technologies (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning), wind turbine concept design and aerodynamic analysis and assessment, wind tunnel tests as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD).\n\nBesides that, I'm quite a sporty woman and a certificated fitness instructor. Travelling around the world also helps me keep open-minded as it gives me a chance to view varied sceneries and to know different people. I have been taking activities involved in giving back to society.",
