    "summary": "Professional Coach (PCC with ICF) offering group, team and individual coaching, with extensive experience from working and living across three continents supporting professionals, emerging leaders and executives through times of change. \n\nClients have described my coaching as a welcoming space that allows a helicopter view to understand where to focus the energy to create change. In partnership we find the way forward that serves your journey for learning and growth while respecting your cultural identity.\n\nThe clients and business partners I work with are spread around the world, geographical distance does not have to be a hurdle for a trusting relationship or an efficient delivery. I am co founder, founding member or team member/freelancer in organisations focused on working 100% remotely. I have had the pleasure of working in both large corporations and small start ups, as well as coaching in both. \n\nI am a member of Climate Coaching Alliance and believe we all have a responsibility to create awareness and change in regards to what is happening on and to our planet. Why is it that a majority of us find climate change concerning but only a fraction of us have conversations about it at work? or with friends for that matter.\n\nCommon topics brought to coaching change management, leadership development, career development, the personal brand, networking, cultural awareness and work culture, sustainability, entrepreneurship/business setup, work/life balance.",

What I took away was deeper awareness of my own privilege, but also a better understanding of how difficult it can be to understand privilege when you have it. \nAllowing a safe space to explore identity, bias, privilege and to identify ways to change one's thinking is beneficial and rewarding, in addition to being an important step in creating an inclusive environment.\nThe conversations are valuable to explore inclusive leadership, team culture or to understand one's role in a majority or minority contexts.",
