I had the lead in several projects:\n\nDeveloping and maintaining an off-line metrology analyzer:\nIt was my responsibility to get clarity in requirements, create and maintain the project plan, lead the development team of five people and communicate with the stakeholders.\n\nIntroducing an on-line metrology analyzer at a customer in the United States:\nI took part in the selection process and was responsible for the roll out of the selected software in the customers R&D environment. The selected software came from a German supplier and had to be customized to the customers need and ASML environment. The project involved a lot of international conference calls to align the stakeholders and get the final ok.\n\nDeveloping a new on-line metrology analyzer platform (Litho InSight):\nIn this position I was repsonsible for the development of a new software platform for a new on-line metrology analyzer. Together with architects and system engineers I got the requirements clear and lead three development teams of five person each. Two of those 'scrum' teams were situated in Dresden (Germany). As project manager I was off-course also responsible for maintaining the project plan and reporting to program management.\n\nManaging the integration and testing of the on-line metrology solution:\nAs release project manager I was responsible for timely integration of the different software deliveries of about six scrum teams. Alpha testing and maintaining the test environment was also part of my responsibility as well as keeping an eye on the balance between quality and time to market and advising the program team on this matter.",
