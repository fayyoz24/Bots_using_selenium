    "summary": "Communication\n\nIf I may describe myself in 2 words: Communication professional. More words? Up to date with the latest developments and possibilities. Online, offline, with images, with text, or all 4. AI or without AI. From prototype to pixel perfect product. From theoretical business process to practice. From listening to (re)action. Sending and receiving is communication. Seek connection through mutual understanding. Getting to know the target group.\n\nCreativity\n\nMany a path I have walked. Visual artist, graphic designer, journalist, business leader, manager, online marketer. The binding factor: creativity. Creativity makes my world more exciting. No visual art or marketing without communication and creativity. Whether I'm doing a graphic design, prototype for a website, making a social media post, having a conversation or sending an email: Connecting through creativity is my goal.\n\nSimplicity\n\nMy broad knowledge of online communication offers opportunities. Web design & development,\nonline marketing, data analysis (e.g. GA), social media, you can go in many directions with me. I am senior in some areas and junior in others. For me it is important to keep working from a beginner's mind. Seeing something as if it were the first time I saw it. I like simplicity.\n\nCommon ground\n\nTwo of my latest projects:\nThe website for Mixtbaby Rotterdam. I made the prototype, graphic design and texts and programmed the site in HTML5/CSS3 and javaScript. I am especially proud of Mixtbaby's icons and new logo.\nA second project is Solvenius. I made the prototype for the new website in XD and did online marketing for them. SEO, SEA, Social Media, Content Marketing.\n\nThe relevant links: https://v35.mixtbaby.com & https://solvenius.nl",
