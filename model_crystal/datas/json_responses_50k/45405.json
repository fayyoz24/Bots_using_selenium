    "summary": "I have a background in Biomedical Engineering with a specialization in Biomedical Physics. During my training I gained experience with: physics and application of medical devices, data-analysis, mathematics, documentation, experimental techniques and researching.  \n\nAfter graduation, I worked as an R&D test engineer and project engineer in international and multidisciplinary environments. During these periods, I worked on new product developments and product improvements. \nSkills, which I developed during my work, include technical project lead, communication with project team and stakeholders, methodical and analytical approach to projects. \n\nMy passion is to work on (technically) challenging projects. Seeing a project taking shape from scratch gives me a lot of energy. \nI think of myself as an eager and persuasive person who\u2019s always working towards the best practical and cost effective solutions. I take pride and responsibilities in my work and have an eye for small details.",
