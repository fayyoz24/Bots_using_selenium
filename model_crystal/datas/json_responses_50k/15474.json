In al my previous educational and work experiences, I found bits of myself. Now, finally, as a doctor I have found a role in which I can utilize all my characteristics and abilities, and that simultaneously provides a supremely meaningful occupation: to alleviate people's suffering, either by curing them or by helping them to bear their suffering and to put things into perspective.",

Her aim is to be both researcher and doctor, roles in which her inherent interest in science communication will continue to flourish. Aside from an interest in all things medical, her motivation for this move was sparked by an article she wrote in 2012 for the Dutch magazine \"Medisch Contact\" (targeted at doctors of all specialties), concerning breastfeeding problems and their treatment. Especially motivating was the finding that very little research concerning these  problems has been done, whereas many mothers cease breastfeeding within the first month against their own wishes. Her intention is to eventually change that situation for the better, based on multidisciplinary research into the possible biomedical backgrounds of these problems.",

It is not surprising that many people like to share their enthusiasm for, their curiosity about and also, at times, their critical assessment of what goes on in that world. These people, 'all people with a story about science', are hard to pin down. Some are scientists themselves. Some are communication managers, working at non-profit science institutions. Some are journalists, or exhibition-builders, or a combination of these. Yet others work in education, inspiring our young people to question the world around us or even to become scientists themselves or work in technological careers. Some work as volunteers, for instance science caf\u00e9s which invite scientists to come tell about their work. Others may not actually organize science communication activities themselves, but are active and interested users of science communication.\n\nFor all those people, who now meet each other only by accident, we propose to offer a place to meet, to share ideas, to improve the level of science communication in the Netherlands. This is SciCom NL, the Dutch Association of Science Communicators. As of the 3rd of September 2013, we officially exist. We will present SciCom NL at the upcomig Conference on Science Communication on October 1st in Rotterdam. Signing up for membership will start as of that date.",
