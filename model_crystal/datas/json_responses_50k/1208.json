    "summary": "I am a highly analytical, meticulous, self-motivated Senior Finance Professional, with experience in reporting, business planning and change management. \n\nMy background is in reporting and financial analysis and I am experienced at modelling financial outcomes and interpreting financial data by drilling down to business drivers, to develop a deeper understanding and to impact data-driven decisions. Examples include: cost analysis, with an objective to determine optimal cost base, profitability of products/business lines, profitability of distribution channels and return on equity analysis. \n\nMy work in change management has been varied, with my most recent experience as a member of the steering committee of the Finance Change Program for NN Life Insurance in Japan, and a member of the project team in charge to estimate synergies in the context of business integration.\n\nI am highly experienced at business planning. I excel at ensuring that strategic objectives are effectively cascaded and embedded into a business plan, proposing targets, consolidating inputs, setting contingency budgets, modelling financial outcomes and monitoring KPIs. \n\nAs a natural communicator, I possess the ability to adapt my style according to my audience and method. I'm comfortable engaging with stakeholders up to senior board level, where style needs to be precise and clear, and also communicating financial/technical information to non-financial audiences. \n\nI am currently seeking a role in change management in a financial discipline.",
