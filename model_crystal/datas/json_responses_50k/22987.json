    "summary": "My driving force in research is to apply modern and current knowledge in animal health which are instrumental in innovating sustainable solution for livestock production. Currently I am working on several projects to measure host-microbe response influenced by environmental perturbs in livestock species.  My primary goal is to support the 'resilience' of livestock in a sustainable manner that enables them to cope up with the challenges they encounter in their life time.  Meanwhile, my current focus is on gut health and intestinal functionality as influenced by the nutrition and living environment of the animals. My ambition is to apply acquired knowledge, that generate value for projects by inclusion of innovative pipeline and simultaneously gather sound industrial business sense.",

Further, we will investigate to what extent saliva (as non-invasive sample type) metabolite-profiles correlate with blood metabolite-profiles.

However, the overuse of antibiotics in farming and agriculture is a growing threat to human health. The EU-funded AVANT project is developing alternatives to antimicrobials for the management of bacterial infections in pigs. These include a gut-stabilising intervention based on symbiotic products and faecal microbiota transplantation, and feed additive products, as well as alternative feeding strategies targeting sows and piglets.

Poultry is the most organized sector in animal agriculture in India, worth Euro 14,500 million. Meanwhile, India wants to double its food production in the next decade and naturally the Indian poultry market is laden with opportunities.\n\nHowever, the poultry sector in India faces multiple major challenges, which in turn could open up opportunities for the Dutch entrepreneurs. For example, low productivity, lack of modern broiler breeder houses, lack of storage, cold chain and transport, lack of supply of quality feed, lack of quality standards in farm management and lack of processing facilities are some of the challenges of poultry secrtor in India that was identified by Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend (RVO) Nederland (2017).\n\nMeanwhile in India, welfare organisations ask for higher welfare state for chicken during production. In this regard cage free housing systems for poultry have proven to be commercially viable particularly in other developed countries including The Netherlands. As India is mostly self-sufficient for chicken production, the government has a leading opportunity to create a humane and level playing field for the chicken industries and legislate for cage free egg and chicken production.\n\nThe involved partners in the project have the knowledge and technology to support the transition to more welfare friendly breeder houses in India.",

For instance, farmers add antibiotics to animal feed, speeding up their growth and preventing them from getting sick. However, the overuse of antibiotics in farming and agriculture is a growing threat to human health. The EU-funded AVANT project is developing alternatives to antimicrobials for the management of bacterial infections in pigs. These include a gut-stabilising intervention based on symbiotic products and faecal microbiota transplantation, and feed additive products, as well as alternative feeding strategies targeting sows and piglets. Mathematical modelling tools with be used to estimate reduction in antimicrobial use by 2030 if these alternative practices are adopted by the pig production industry.",

            "description": "India is the third-largest egg producer in the world and the fourth-largest chicken producer in the world. Poultry is the most organized sector in animal agriculture in India, worth Euro 14,500 million. Meanwhile, India wants to double its food production in the next decade and naturally the Indian poultry market is laden with opportunities.\n\nHowever, the poultry sector in India faces multiple major challenges, which in turn could open up opportunities for the Dutch entrepreneurs. For example, low productivity, lack of modern broiler breeder houses, lack of storage, cold chain and transport, lack of supply of quality feed, lack of quality standards in farm management and lack of processing facilities are some of the challenges of poultry secrtor in India that was identified by Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend (RVO) Nederland (2017).\n\nMeanwhile in India, welfare organisations ask for higher welfare state for chicken during production. In this regard cage free housing systems for poultry have proven to be commercially viable particularly in other developed countries including The Netherlands. As India is mostly self-sufficient for chicken production, the government has a leading opportunity to create a humane and level playing field for the chicken industries and legislate for cage free egg and chicken production.\n\nThe involved partners in the project have the knowledge and technology to support the transition to more welfare friendly breeder houses in India.",

We received financial aid form  ZonMw to get access to expertise and facilities which will allow us to study the metabolic changes induced by a high level of dietary zinc, as model intervention, in piglets in the post-weaning period. Combining this knowledge with knowledge gained from transcriptomics on gut tissue and application of metagenomics technologies on intestinal digesta will provide us with a more integrated and complete biological picture of biological processes that underlie growth, productive performance and animal health. This knowledge may contributes to the development of dietary interventions to modify immune competence in livestock. ",

In feed phosphates, the contents of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury might be of concern, because they could approach the maximum values as determined by law.",

The research revealed novel biological effects of different protein sources, increasing our understanding of the interplay between nutrition, microbiota and the host. In turn this research has implications for animal production efficiency, which is linked to the increasing demand for animal protein to feed the growing human population.",
