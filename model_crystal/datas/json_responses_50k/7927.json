I performed an analysis of the available measurements, worked on improving and expanding the data quality and provided a single overview of the data availability and its related quality.\n\nBackground:\nSince 1998 NIOZ has had several Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) in operation under the TESO ferries that traverse a path between Den Helder and Texel. This unique dataset allows for estimating volume and sediment transports, amongst many other key variables that are important for the dynamics of the marine ecosystems in the Wadden Sea.",
