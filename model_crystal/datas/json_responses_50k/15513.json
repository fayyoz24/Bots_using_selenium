Their network office is in Amsterdam. \n\nMy work during this short period consisted of: networking, lobbying, data gathering, organizing regional and international meetings, attracting volunteers, searching for new helpline partners in the African region and new helplines in the Middle East. \n\nIn this period I have organized a regional consultation for the African helplines. Another result was that volunteers from the Middle East became introduced in the organization, and one of them became the coordinator for helplines in the Middle east.",
