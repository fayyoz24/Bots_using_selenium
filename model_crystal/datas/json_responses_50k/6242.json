    "summary": "Systems' Philosophy underpins my approach. Looking at issues, problems, anything at all - from a wide perspective of view points means that projects are more inclusive and outcomes much broader..\n\nMarketing and professional development, followed by management courses to underpin the experience, leading to a Bachelor of Science Honours'\u200b Degree taken when I was in my early thirties. Working with Logica, the Systems'\u200b Integrator, in the mid nineties, to SME's for e-Commerce advising and practical administration set-up expertise, I eventually took a London  Trinity four-month TESOL Certification in order to be qualified to teach English to speakers of other languages. This enabled me to give English-language professional presentation courses, one to one, to lady executives in the IT/ Systems'\u200b Industry (in Madrid)  given my business background and experience.\n\nI can offer personal development training for the basic CV as well as tutoring and elocution for personal, verbal presentations, in the English language. 'Learn your own story well, and practice its delivery in English;  you will be able to present yourself without having to use copious notes.  Short, medium and longer versions at your own fingertips so that you are never stumped for words when someone asks you to give an impromptu personal introduction'. Know Thyself. Be quietly confident.",

I am appalled at the UK governmental approach to make these forms so complicated, with 'specific' terms sought that the ordinary, honest individual would not understand and, therefore, innocently lose rightful benefits. No wonder that there are so many unclaimed benefits.  Have you ever seen any of the forms?  I have - they can be in excess of twenty pages with phrases and directions which are nasty and narrow;  in short, designed to deceive and cut people off. And it is only getting worse."
