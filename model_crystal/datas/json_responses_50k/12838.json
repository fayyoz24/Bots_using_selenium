    "summary": "While walking the Four Days Marches of Nijmegen I get to know new people, help them on their way, check my progress, and continue till I reach the finish line by tackling all possible setbacks. This same approach I take in my (voluntary) work: help others, plan, organise, and persevere till an optimal result is achieved. Due to my Artificial Intelligence and Applied Data Science background, and my experience with chairing board and committee work, I built a varied tool and skill set that I love to employ in developing applications that embrace the beautiful diversity of our world. I enjoy working on innovative projects that intersect multiple disciplines, and I believe that is the way to tackle the current challenges in this world. I am thus very happy to work at Nederlandse Spoorwegen with their big diversity in employees and complex challenges in one of the busiest public transport systems of the world.",

Pieters (UU), S.B. Dirks MSc (UU) and P. Woltjer (CBG).\n\nTitle: \"Utilizing linked open place data for entity resolution: a case study on Dutch genealogy at CBG\"\n\nAbstract:\nEntity resolution on genealogical documents is challenging due to spelling\nerrors, alternative name variants, and historic entity changes. Traditional\nmethods attempt to tackle these problems with string similarity methods,\nwhich this research proposes to extend by enriching the recorded features\nwith additional place information such as place URIs, coordinates, and country\nindicators. Based on a case study at the Dutch Centre for Genealogy,\nthis research contributes to extending entity resolution research, optimizing\nand enriching family history (meta) studies, and investigating which\nprivacy-sensitive passport request documents can be disclosed.\n\nFirst, linked open data sources are shown to retrieve unique place entities\nbelonging to recorded place names. Second, place, province and country\nname similarities are calculated as well as coordinate distances within a coordinate\nreference system that limits the distance distortions for the respective\ncountries. Third, the researched adaptation is shown to result in a significant\nchange in similarity values when a uniform weighting of feature similarities\nis applied. However, contrary to the hypothesis, the similarity distributions\nof compared documents that do and do not refer to an equivalent person\nentity could not be distinguished in a more accurate way. Hence, future\nstudies are proposed that expand on this research by supervised learning of\nweights and thresholds using validated candidate links from this research.\n\nKeywords: Entity resolution, Linked open data, Genealogy, Geospatial\ndata, Content similarity\n\nGrade: 8.8\nDuration: 400 hours",

Elgammal who at the time of my research was professor at the department of Computer Science at Rutgers University (NJ, USA), founder and director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory there, and founder and CEO of Artrendex. The secondary supervision was done by dr. M.W. Tangermann and J.

Even though my implementation does not achieve the expected results but suffers from common GAN problems, contributions are made towards the development and evaluation of such improved creative networks, and its societal relevance is discussed. A questionnaire for human evaluation is developed as I argue that objective GAN metrics give ambiguous results in the creative field. Furthermore, this area gives contributions towards Artificial General Intelligence, but also additional developments towards identifying deep fakes are required. Overall, my research together with follow up implementation improvements help understanding the possibilities and complexities of this intriguing field of creative computer-generated art.\n\nGrade: 8.2\nDuration: 505 hours",

For all these meetings we designed work forms ourselves to get informative and interactive discussions. Additionally, theme evenings are organised with talks about such topics for a broader and bigger audience and we educate our committee ourselves with professional training moments. Also, I together with two others am the founder of the Dito wide library with LGBTQ+ books such that people can find more recognition and educate themselves on topics. I was a member from June 2019 till September 2020, when I became the co-coordinator, and from December 2020 onward I took the position of coordinator of this committee. From January 2020 I also took the position of treasurer to keep track of our finances. From January 2020 till December 2021 I guided an introduction group with a diversity of people: different sexualities, genders, ethnicities, ages and life stages, and psychological backgrounds. This was thus during the COVID-19 pandemic and took a lot of flexibility while arranging these meetings because of multiple lockdowns, illness, changes of work forms and locations to make it safe (also online) but still interactive. To complete this series of meetings with a high level of education and safety also a lot of perseverance, creativity, and responsibility was needed and we did it very well according to the participants."

As a reaction to this, a group of members from all study associations of the Faculty of Science founded the Student Aid project. This included a lot of communication and official paperwork with the faculty and the university to be allowed to set it up, we recruited and with student psychologists trained the student aides, promoted it to the students that they are standing by to give support where needed (with also a university webpage), kept in touch with them and representatives from the university, faculty, and studies (and their study associations), and evaluated and improved the project along the way. A Student Aid is a fellow student, who is an easily accessible first point of contact if you don\u2019t know where to go for help, if you have questions, or if you want to share your story. They provide a listening ear or can guide you to solve the issue you are facing. Furthermore, they can help you find the right person to talk to, whether that is a study advisor, student psychologist or student counsellor. This way we tried lowering the threshold to seek for help. First a pilot study was developed to research the viability of the project and then it continued fully. After two and a half years of hard work and investment we trained new committee members to take over the responsibility of the project with their renewed insights and commitment. My involvement in the founding and development of this project in all its life stages shows my entrepreneurial skills, me wanting to help my fellow students with their wellbeing, communication and documentation skills to get the project approved by the university, and perseverance and commitment to make this project viable and get it running well."
