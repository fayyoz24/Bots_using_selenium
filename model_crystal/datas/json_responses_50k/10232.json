    "summary": "Extroverted, goal oriented and down-to-Earth Portuguese Mechanical Engineer. \n\nAs a student, I have always looked forward to learn more than what was taught inside the classroom. This mindset defined my track: from being part of the Formula Student Team and Mechanical Engineering Nucleus to doing internships during summer time and a final graduation assignment abroad.\n\nCurrently, I am enrolled in the EUV System Install Department at ASML as a Project Coordinator. In this role, I frequently travel to the customer site to support the local team and interact with the customer to make sure that the installation of the latest EUV lithography systems meets the expected quality and planned cycle time.",
