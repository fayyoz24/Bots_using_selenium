    "summary": "I specialise in designing and implementing tools to solve complex business challenges. Since 2010, I have worked as a project manager, business developer and product owner in the IT, advertising, and sustainability industries. Both in large companies (3M, Telef\u00f3nica) and start-ups (Xvii, Circularise, Synapbox).\n\nI have also co-founded four companies; among them, Bonalto (2016) has been the most successful. The company focused in the operational side of e-commerce and provided an end-to-end service for retail brands that needed to launch their online sales channel. During the first year of operation, the team grew to 14 people, while $900,000 USD and approximately 11,000 orders were processed through a suite of bespoke systems including logistics, order and warehouse management, customer service, payment gateways and shipping management.\n\nI sold my shares in Bonalto in 2019 to pursue a Master's degree in Innovation & Global Sustainable Development at Lund University. Throughout the 2-year programme, I learned about innovation models and processes, systems thinking, sustainability transitions and socio-economic history. My thesis is about how emerging technologies enable a circular economy model in plastics. It was recently awarded by Sysav, the leading waste management company in southern Sweden, and served as the base of the peer-reviewed article: Emerging Technologies Supporting the Transition to a Circular Economy in the Plastic Materials Value Chain.\n\nI thrive in work environments where experimentation, research, analysis and strategic thinking are present and encouraged. I enjoy working with people and serving as a facilitator of communication between parties. While I am not a programmer or engineer, I have a broad technology background that allows me to both see the big picture and be able to drill down into technical details if needed.",
