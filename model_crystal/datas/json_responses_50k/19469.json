    "summary": "As a graduate freelance dance-artist, I am always looking for new challenges to expend my artistic horizons. I choose to specialise in Choreological Studies. This analytical approach to movement, locates a place of clarity & communication which is at the forefront of my artistic ambitions in dancing, teaching and making dance.\n\nI would like to develop and expose my professional experience to promote contemporary dance-art, the study of human movement and the research and analysis of the development of Contemporary Performative Arts.\n\nTherefore I have interests in performing, teaching and making dance.\nFreelance dance teacher, dancer, choreologist, choreographer, advisor\n\nSpecialised in Contemporary Dance & Laban Based Modern Dance Technique, Choreology-Advisor for making dance, Improvisation & Composition, \n\nIn all three approaches my work aims to focus on the inter-relationship in movement between clarity and communication to produce dance work that can relate to others, either consciously or/and subconsciously.\n\nI also allow myself to be inspired by sociological, interpersonal and cultural issues, as well as artists from audio and visual disciplines and reflecting these experiences with my personal handwriting in dance and movement.\n\nThe work in the Netherlands, study visits and further education in New York and England have abetted to expand my knowledge of educational and choreographic processes for improvisation, modern and contemporary dance. I give courses and workshops for professionals as well as amateurs, children, and in schools. ",
