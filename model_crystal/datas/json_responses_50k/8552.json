After a trade-off, the best concept was selected, and an accurate and detailed designed followed. I lead the aerodynamics department of the project as the chief aerodynamics engineer. Finally, the results of the final design chosen were reported and presented to an international professional jury.",

Then we calculated the equilibrium temperature of the planets, including the possible atmosphere.
