    "summary": "\"A Tech Geek passionate about Social Impact!\"\nOn a mission to make Personalized Medicine accessible, for everyone, globally.\n\nWhy I founded OASYS NOW?\n\n   \"As a refugee from Iran, I had to travel from country to country together with my parents before arriving in the Netherlands. My mother, Anna, suffers from chronic diseases that need constant treatment, medications, and care. However, in every new country we arrived in, Anna had to go through a complete re-diagnosis before receiving the recognition of her disease and the appropriate care for it. Frustrated by this experience, I set out on a mission to build a better patient journey that could help patients, healthcare providers, and researchers worldwide.\n\nHaving worked with state-of-the-art technology in my research, projects, and Computer Science study at TU Delft, I envisioned a world where: \"each citizen is in ownership and control of their health data and has access to the best and the latest treatments, all-in-one platform, at their fingertips reach, personalized specifically to their each medical needs.\"\n\nIn 2018, together with my mission-driven co-founders, we established OASYS NOW to revolutionize patients' access to treatments by utilizing the greatest advancements in science and technology and empowering citizens with control over their health data.\n\nAt OASYS NOW, we help patients get personalized treatments by putting them in control of their data.\"",

We programmed mostly in Python and PHP and used GitLab hosted on our University servers as our Version Control, CI/CD, SCRUM, task assignments and more.\n\nOverall, it was a successful project. We managed to implement most of we had planned and learn a lot from working in a group and having Product Managers, supervisor, customers/Product Owers, SCRUM master, etc.",
