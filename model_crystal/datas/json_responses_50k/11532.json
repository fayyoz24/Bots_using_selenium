    "summary": "I was educated in mechanical engineering (MSc), graduated in logistics simulation and control technology and grew my roots in mechatronics system development at Philips\u2019 Centre for Manufacturing Technology (CFT), which is now part of Philips Research. Philips had arranged exemption from military service for me under a covenant between Philips and the Dutch Ministry of Defense, allowing me to start in January 1985 in the CAM-Centre of CFT as an embedded software engineer and gain experience as a project leader, of motion control and vision system (pre-)development projects for flexible industrial automation at Philips Display Components, Semiconductors (now NXP), and ASML in particular. \nIn 1991, I was appointed group leader of the Technology Programming & Projects Office of CFT.\n\nIn 1994, I moved to Singapore as expatriate chief engineer for Philips, in an endeavor to set up a local R&D organization in support of Philips\u2019 manufacturing industries in South-East Asia, with initial focus on mechatronics engineering and surface mount technology expertise.\n\nAfter my return to the Netherlands in 1997, I joined Philips Medical Systems as software development manager for Cardio-Vascular X-ray systems and later for Cardiology IT systems. I headed various combinations of software development groups, ranging from 25 to 95 engineers, and held responsibility for the product creation process, resources and competence area management, concept and feasibility projects and program management of several technical roadmaps.\n\nIn 2007, I accepted a senior operational management position in the Technical Automation unit of Atos Origin, which merged with Nspyre in 2009 and with Altran Netherlands (now Capgemini) in 2015. Effectively since March 2008, after I assisted DAF Trucks (PACCAR) as information analyst in the preparation of a new global vehicle programming and diagnostics platform, I assumed my position as manager of a business unit of around 45 engineers working in embedded software development projects for the high-tech industry in the south of the Netherlands, both in-house and in secondment contracts at customers\u2019 facilities.\n\nFrom November 2018 until retirement in June 2019, I assisted Altran Engineering at the Automotive Campus in Helmond as manager of the Body & Trim and Defense structural mechanical engineering teams.",
