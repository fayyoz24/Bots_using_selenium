    "summary": "\u25ba Mechanical design engineer at ASML (NL), the world's largest supplier of photo-lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. We make incredibly complex machines that allow the likes of Intel, Samsung & TSMC to print smaller, faster and more energy-efficient chips with a few nanometers accuracy.\n\u25ba More specifically I am working on the modules of the EUV light source that deliver high pressure liquid tin, to allows the creation of 50k tin droplets per second, each of which will be vaporized by a 30kW CO2 laser to obtain tin plasma which will emit the EUV light.\n\u25ba I am personally driven by learning, complex problem solving, creative thinking, innovating, working on cutting-edge technologies, and designing more sustainably.\n\u25ba I have x2 Master diplomas in Mechanical/Industrial engineering, from the ESTII (Technical University of Madrid, Spain) and the ESTIA (Bidart, France).\n\u25ba I am also fluent in French, English, and Spanish.",

It was the opportunity for me to sharpen my entrepreneurial skills as well as to attend the various workshops & lectures the accelerator was offering.\n\nThe venture we envisioned aimed at improving telemedicine for prenatal care by developing a smart portable pregnancy monitoring device based on the technology of electroactive polymer.\n\nAlthough I was involved in the various activities of business building (small team of 4), I mainly focused on the competition analysis and the definition of our value proposition.\n\nAt the end of the program I presented some of my takeaways from the experience during the final \"pitch event\" of the accelerator, and in front of some senior managers at ASML.",
