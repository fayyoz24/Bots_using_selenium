    "summary": "As a recent graduate from the European School in Luxembourg I am excited to embark on my next adventure in Maastricht where I will be studying 'Circular Engineering.' \n\nMany years of having the privilege to travel and live in various different countries have given me a glimpse into all the different cultures and people there are in the world. I'm grateful to have received such an upbringing and to have learnt that every person is unique and has their own story. I hope to continue my travels and learn more about our world.\n\nCurrently, my next steps are concentrated in the STEM area and set on becoming an engineer. But as I am someone who adores talking to, meeting new people and diplomacy my path may adjust itself to something different. \n\nRegarding the latter, please do reach out to me as I would love to learn about the different career paths people have taken to become who they are right now.",
