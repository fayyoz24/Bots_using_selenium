Employed full-time for European Union, H2020-ICT project \"Robots Understanding Their Actions by Imagining Their Effects (IMAGINE)\".\n- Worked in IMAGINE project, which was a collaboration of 6 institutes and 1 industry partner. The intention of the project is to enable robots to understand and learn the structure of their environment and how the environment is affected by the robot\u2019s actions. Specifically on disassembly tasks which are by nature harder than assembly tasks in terms of generalization, particularly for automatizing recycling of materials, which can expose danger to the humans. Our responsibility was on the Association Engine which models and reasons about the associative mappings between the scene descriptors, actions, action parameters, and action effects. \n- Participated at foundation of COLORS research lab, which gave me great responsibility in settling the lab and welcoming new members. \n- Did various experiments and demos with Baxter Robot and UR10 with Robotiq 3 finger gripper, including human subjects. \n- Volunteered teaching assistant for Machine Learning course,  my responsibility was grading the projects.\n- Hosted multiple lab publicity events for visitors (including fellow reseachers, national tv channels and high school students)",
