    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Mags! I am a storyteller, a rabble-rouser and a connector of people. I am also the founder of House of Hives and Editor-In-Chief of FEM Magazine. So, how did we get to this point? Let me take you on a bit of a journey!\n\nI started my entrepreneurial journey in 2013 when I co-founded SwanWaters, a platform for people recovering from emotional abuse. This is where my personal story and business first intertwined and I became fully aware of the power of personal stories. I learned some of those lessons the hard way, leaving me feeling exposed and anxious. So, I decided to help others tap into the power of their story, without the massive vulnerability hangover. \n\nThe platform has since lost funding, unfortunately, but the content I created for it has resulted in my book \u2018The Ugly Duckling Diary\u2019.\n\n**Founding House of Hives**\nWhen I first founded House of Hives, I wanted it to be a place where women would empower women, who in their turn empower women. Female empowerment squared. Although my team doesn\u2019t only include women anymore, this mission hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nI work with people who have greater goals than just running a business. They aspire to contribute positively to the world, shift narratives, and empower clients through their lived experiences.\n\nHowever, the realities of running a business can sometimes dim the initial excitement, leading to self-doubt and overwhelm. Questions may arise about the true impact they can make from behind their humble laptops.\n\nI believe in the power of collaboration to create meaningful impact and lasting change. Together, we can achieve more and uplift each other on our journeys of growth and transformation.\n\n**A world in flux**\nSince the founding of House of Hives in February 2020, the world has been in a state of flux, to say the least. It means we need more people to stand up and raise their voices and challenge the narrative.\n\nIn this world, I am committed to lifting those voices and creating a supportive environment for my clients and creating powerful collaborative connections that will create a ripple effect of impact throughout the world. \n\nI bring 10 years of experience with online marketing, a lifetime of writing and storytelling experience and my natural gifts to reframe your content and connect with people on a deep level to the table. All of that makes me the best ambassador your business has ever had!\n\nWith a little help from your friendly neighbourhood marketing maverick, you will feel empowered and encouraged to keep bringing light to this world!",

It is available on Amazon \n\nAubrey, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of you, my dear friend.\n\nWhen Aubrey suggested that SwanWaters publish her previous writings in a book I began reading and editing. It was quite an emotional journey for me, too. After all, we are both survivors\u2026 and reading each other\u2019s stories almost always have some emotional effect. It validates our own experiences, gives new insight\u2026 it can be quite an emotional roller coaster. Aubrey\u2019s writing always goes straight to the heart of the matter.\n\nAubrey is (as always) committed to writing raw and within the moment. There are no embellishments, nothing is made to look or sound better than it is. This is what makes her words so easy to relate to. \nEven after years of healing, almost every single chapter gave me some new insight, some new learning or healing.\n\nMaybe what I am trying to say is that the book will be an interesting read for anyone, anywhere on the healing journey. It will help people figure out what is going on when they still are in a toxic relationship, it will give you valuable insight into healing yourself, coping with the aftermath of abuse, and even give you support when dealing with continued abuse through the courts or other proxies.\n\nThe book is divided into sections that each deal with a certain aspect of Aubrey\u2019s journey. You can skip through the book and read the chapters on topics that are relevant to you at that moment. Maybe you are feeling you have a spiritual crisis, or dealing with an ex in court\u2026 just skip to the relevant section and get reading.",
