Subjects such as math, languages, reading comprehension, spelling, history and geography are subjects that children often struggle with. By supporting children during the learning process and evaluating their performance, I offered a helping hand on the achievement of excellent results. I often helped the children from deprived neighbourhoods, children with difficult home situations or children who have difficulties with concentrating and working independently. I've had a lot of fun with the kids and together we managed to achieve good results. I received an enormous amount of joy from the reactions that the children had when they found out that as long as they believed in themselves, they could make anything happen."
