    "summary": "\u2728 I would define myself as a passionate professional shaped by the privilege of a diverse environment and a love for learning. My curiosity led me to studying International Studies and Intercultural Communication, setting the stage for an exciting career journey.\n\nI began my journey in Talent Attraction in the midst of COVID-19. It was during this time that I discovered the tangible impact of communication and human connection in the workplace (both virtually and in person!); these became the main pillars of my work ethic, especially as I expanded my skills around talent attraction, candidate experience, and stakeholder management. \n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I'm excited about the prospect of making a difference within organizations striving to create inclusive, growth-oriented workplaces. My journey continues, and I'm eager to explore those opportunities ahead that will champion authenticity and enthusiasm. \u2728\n\n\n\ud83c\udf08 People first, Inclusion & Diversity Advocate \ud83c\udf08\n\nBorn in Spain, raised in Belgium, and currently with one foot in Belgium and the other in The Netherlands.\n\nGraduated in International Studies with a focus on East Asian studies, Gender, and Sociolinguistics, I also followed Intercultural Communication studies in French and Spanish at Utrecht University, and Politics, Society, and Economy of Asia at Leiden University (interrupted due to COVID-19).",
