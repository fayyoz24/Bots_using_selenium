Every year, together with my family, we buy food in India and distribute this in various places such as orphanages and non-subsidized hospitals. We buy groceries at the local shops and support the local restaurants to prepare a delicious meal. We also keep our selves busy in the Netherlands; Together with my brother on behalf of ''Rijschool Danny'' we help the Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam to organize fun events for children living in the hospital. I'm also financially supporting the Muscle Fund Foundation to develop medicines for muscle disease.\n\nIn addition, I founded the ''Zieners'' community together with a good friend. ''Zieners'' is a platform where we inform people of alternative news reports; such as alternative medicine, meditation, yoga and important news that is not shared \n",
