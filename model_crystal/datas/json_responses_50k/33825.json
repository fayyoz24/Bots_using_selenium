I was involved in projects from IT Security, IT Infrastructure, IT for Services, and IT Integration. The most challenging projects were:\n\n- IT Infrastructure Renewal: large global projects with the goal of selecting IT vendors and Telecom vendors to take care of Nokia IT Infrastructure. During this project I was part of the PMO for the project. We took care of the vendor selection process working closely with Procurement and Legal teams. It required a deep understanding of all types of requirements, so multiple stakeholders were involved (all the IT departments, business lines, R&D, central functions, etc.) Nokia\u00b4s Infrastructure is a complex environment and the project required a good understanding of the big picture.\n\n- IT Integration: during the integration between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent I was one of the project managers to manage the IT portfolio and the implementation roadmap for all the IT functions. Regular reporting was needed to the Global Integration Office.",
