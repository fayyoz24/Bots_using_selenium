    "summary": "As an enthusiast of learning, I find myself interested in all topics that entail a scientific explanation of a real life phenomenon. Currenty, I am in the process of becoming a Bioinformatician and Systems Geneticist who specializes in exploring the plant world and the phenomenological laws that govern it. \n\nWhen I look at the world around me including the air, the soil, the trees, and all the life forms entangled with one another in an inseparable web, I see an unlimited and untapped repertoire of data and information. The best possible means of extracting meaningful biology out of them is through high-throughput data analysis tools and pipelines. My aim is to specialize in this hybrid domain of biological and computational science to be able to contribute towards integrating this vast and diverse sources of data to understand how plant biology works on an omics scale.\n",
