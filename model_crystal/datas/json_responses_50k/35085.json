The project involved the research and design of an optimal third-space environment, process for creative problem-solving based on design thinking and formulation of a specific, team-based culture. \n\nEncouraged to be radical, we developed a 'pure' model far from commonly experienced corporate innovation environments with a human-centred approach to tasks which allowed us to explore a different way of working, which we called 'the future of work'. The resulting process was then piloted with the City of Hilversum as client and project known as Media Mile.\n\nThanks team: Gary Carter, Jefta Bade, Chris Julien, Yuri Knopper, Thomas Meijaard & BertJan Strating.",
