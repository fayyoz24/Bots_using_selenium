We are essentially a \u201cthink tank\u201d, developing visionary concepts and strategies for only four sectors: Property, Hospitality, Food & Beverage and Retail. After spending decades at the most senior levels with mega property developers and global hotel power players, we took that expertise and are using it to craft concepts and strategies that are informed, thoughtful and differentiated, borne out of our years of insider experience.\n\nWhen engaged on Property Masterplans, we plug in as an external Marketing team where we provide input into the overall master plan, develop a go-to-market strategy, provide input/guidance/training of the Marketing department and assist with recruitment. We have worked on Dubai\u2019s most iconic projects in our previous roles, as well as across geographies from London to Kazakhstan, on a wide range of mixed-use developments.\n\nWhen engaged on Hotels and F&B, we create and develop full A to Z concepts, incorporating every aspect of the business model \u2013 from its positioning to the design style of each of its spaces; to the kind of service and staff culture it imbues, services and amenities offered, the menu its chefs and bars prepare, the brand, uniforms, photography\u2026 This kind of commitment, the crafting of each single touchpoint, allows us to develop hotels and restaurants that are compelling and have longevity in the market. We can also provide a full analysis of existing hotels and restaurants in order to improve profitability and brand equity.\n\nWhen engaged on Retail we work on mixed use retail developments or masterplans to strategically develop a concept, retail mix, strategy and brand that is competitive in increasingly crowded retail marketplaces.",
