The company hosts the largest B2B (Alibaba.com), C2C (Taobao), and B2C (Tmall and AliExpress) marketplaces in the world. AliExpress.ru is the most visited e-commerce website in Russia. It facilitates small businesses to sell to customers all over the world.\n\nBeing a part of Alibaba Group I have been working on B2B services in AliExpress and Tmall. During this year I have successfully taken part in several projects:\n1) New registration service\nThere was a universal registration service for all sellers. My team had to adapt and localize this service for the Russian market. I conducted competitive analysis and guerrilla UX tests with sellers. I found weak spots, rewrote user scenarios, and changed the user flow.\nResults: the conversion rate increased from 85% to 92% in the first month.\n\n2) Reconstruction of the product posting interface\nWe had a lack of products from Russian sellers. Previously it took a long time for them to post products through the interface because of some UX troubles. The business task was to increase the range of products. I initiated a full-fledged UX research: collected all users feedback, conducted 8 in-depth interviews, and 5 UX tests. Finally, I redesigned the whole interface for the product posting flow.\nResults: More than 100 000 products were posted via the new interface for 3 months. Additionally, the support service received no requests.\n\n3) Homepage redesign\nOur support team shared several insights on the homepage. Based on these insights I conducted surveys and found out that Russian sellers expect different data and tools on the homepage. Currently, I am looking for a design solution for this task.",

It is the largest technology company in Russia and the largest search engine on the Russian-language Internet, with a market share of over 52%. Yandex.Market is currently one of the most popular marketplaces in Russia. It enables customers to compare prices and product features, check the feedback about the store and then make a purchase.\n\nWhile working for Yandex.Market I was creating a b2b product currently used by 27 000 active users monthly. Experienced team, streamlined work processes, UX laboratory and various research tools (preference testing, task-oriented, A/B testing and in-depth and contextual interviews) helped me reach great results: usability satisfaction ratings for the user interface in the last quarter of 2018 increased by 11%. In addition to my main responsibilities I took part in building a b2b design system - formulating guidelines, creating UI components.\n\nApart from that, I worked on the design project with the help of which sellers can calculate the potential profit from placing their products on Yandex.Market. This landing page was able to brought more than 1000 new clients for the 1st quarter of 2019. Compared to the previous quarter, I increased the number of new sellers by 9%. \nCase study is here: https://egorpermyakov.myportfolio.com/yandexmarket\n\nIn 2018 I took part in educational programs for developers at Yandex performing as Design Mentor. Together with participants we were developing new concepts for improved functionality of Yandex.Market. As a result, we created a new interface for sellers which helps them place their products on Yandex.Market.",
