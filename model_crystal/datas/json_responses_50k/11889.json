After university (MA History and Conflict Studies), my main learning school was 8 years of field work in the Southern Caucasus, serving as a liaison officer for civic peace and human rights initiatives across multiple conflict lines. Here I learned that the road to hell was often paved with the good intentions of various donors, foundations, charities and private enterprises; and also that combined efforts could result in effective investments in rule of law, confidence building and transnational civil society.  Similar lessons I adopted as policy advisor and project coordinator on urban security in the Netherlands, currently as an expert of the Council of Europe Intercultural Cities Network. \n\nSuch field experiences shaped my research perspective in the field of philanthropy, ranging from cultural charity traditions (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc.) to modern approaches of strategic philanthropy, venture philanthropy and corporate responsibility. Current research is oriented to rediscover and revalue this diverse legacy, such as my most recent book commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation, of the Dutch banker J.G.D. Wateler, the founder of the Carnegie Wateler Peace Prize, who also was a pioneer of social credit banking.\n https://www.vredespaleis.nl/lancering-boek-over-naamgever-en-geschiedenis-carnegie-wateler-vredesprijs/",
