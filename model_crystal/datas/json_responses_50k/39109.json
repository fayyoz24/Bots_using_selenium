The dynamic political and economic developments in East Asia after the Second World War have attracted a lot of attention internationally. The world was baffled first by the rapid rise of Japan, followed by the fast economic growth of \u2018Newly Industrialized Economies\u2019 such as South Korea and the swift emergence of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nJapan was, and still is, one of the region\u2019s leading countries in political, economic and cultural terms. It is therefore very important to pay attention to the role and importance of Japan in academic teaching and research.\nEast Asia is one of the University of Groningen\u2019s focus areas. The University has had a Center for Japan Studies since 2000, and in 2013 the Centre for East Asian Studies was founded. The Faculty of Arts offers a Minor in Non-Western Studies, which has a specialization in East Asia, in particular Japan. In addition, a new specialization in East Asian Studies within the Master\u2019s degree programme in International Relations was introduced in 2014",
