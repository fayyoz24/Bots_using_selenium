    "summary": "About text LinkedIn\n\nMargret Wibmer was born in Lienz, Austria. After her studies at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, she spent a large part of the 1980s in New York, a period that significantly formed her life and artistic practice. In 1990 she moved to Amsterdam where she is based since. Using various media such as photography, performance, video, interactive media and sculpture, she explores the human body and its situatedness within a social, cultural, historic, physical and digital context. An integral part of her work is the use of objects and handmade textile props as tools for creating relations.\n\nWibmer has exhibited and performed internationally in galleries and at venues such as Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France (2016); RMIT Design Hub, Melbourne, Australia (2015); Oude Kerk, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2015); Ishikawa Nishida Kitaro Museum of Philosophy, Japan (2013;) / KAI 10 \u2013 Arthena Foundation, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany (2012); Centro per l\u2019arte contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato, Italy (2006); Fashion Moda Gallery, South Bronx, USA (1988). Her work is included in public and private art collections. \nShe has been the recipient of grants and fellowships by Pollock Krasner Foundation, Mondriaan Fonds, Fonds BKVB, Prins Bernhard Cultuur Fonds, Thijlfonds, Stichting Stokroos, Fonds Kwadraat, Bundeskanzleramt \u00d6sterreich, Land Tirol, Fohn Stiftung and the Austrian Embassy. \n\nShe has been teaching in art collages in Europe, US, Australia and Korea, most recently at NAFA in Singapore. Since 2012 she is advising non-EU students at the Dutch Art Institute a.k.a. DAI Roaming Academy. \n\nShe studied Fine Arts at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and has earned a Master of the Arts Degree in Design from Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam. \n\nwww.margretwibmer.eu\nwww.dutchartinstitute.eu",
