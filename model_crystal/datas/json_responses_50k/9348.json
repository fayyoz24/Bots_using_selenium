    "summary": "I have been a Spanish resident in the Netherlands for 14 years. After many years of professional experience B2B in Spain and The Netherlands, I know first-hand the social and working culture of both countries. Their differences, their weak points, and their strengths. To successfully establish trade relations between The Netherlands-Spain, it is essential to interact appropriately with its people. Understand your customer, his language, and his idiosyncrasy. What he needs, his goals, and how to help him.\n\nOpen, intuitive, empathetic, and communicative person. I am passionate about establishing collaborative and trusting relationships with my clients. Always based on honesty and win-win. I rather prefer to work on solid business and long-term relationships, than on immediate and short-term success.\n\nI love traveling, whether it's taking a plane or through Zoom, Meet, Teams, Skype ...\nWe live in times of change and it is essential to adapt to them. In life and in business, flexibility is essential. Reset, refocus, restart, readjust.\n\nPlease contact me (crisdemiguel@gmail.com) if you\u2019re company wants to cross borders or just grow in ES/NL. No matter what your product is, if there is a will there is a way. \n",
