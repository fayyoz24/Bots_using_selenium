Together with the other engineers I will look at components that have a high risk of failure and incorperate reliability at an early stage of development. My field experience from SoLayTec will be very useful in this role. When the machine is finished and shipped to the first customer I hope to go with the machine as an expat and ensure that the customer is satisfied.",

However, I never came to implement the new algorithm on the old machines, because the new machines already needed attention from me as motion engineer. \n\nI was send into the field (Asia) to implement and test new motion ideas and I always came back with extra new ideas, not only motion related. My role as motion engineer developed in a role as reliability, service support and motion engineer. I researched data streams from the machine to find out of the ordinary behavior and analysed it to find problems and root causes. Defined solutions with fellow engineers and implement the solutions.\n\nIn the field I liked the interaction with the customer, especially the moment when a customer who started out as negative and only seeing problems with the machine, becomes optimistic and sees the opportunities he can create with the machine.",
