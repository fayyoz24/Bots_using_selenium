Subsequently, we established a partnership with a prominent European company generating substantial annual revenue. \nMy skills in email marketing, communications, LinkedIn, sales, marketing, structural engineering, lead generation, and business development played a crucial role in achieving these results.",

From the first days, David proved that he is a true professional with rich teaching experience. The training was easy and meaningful at the same time. David explains the theory very clearly, you can discuss any topic with him and feel support. I want to note the responsibility and involvement of David as a teacher, in addition, he uses a large number of his own materials for teaching. After starting to study with David, I no longer want to look for another teacher, because this is the highest level!\"\n\nJulia:\n\"Devid is really great teacher. We had English lessons twice a week for 6 months. During this period I improved my English and started to feel more confident on my working meetings. Devid is pretty structural and attentive teacher, he chooses the most interesting topics for student and makes big focus on practice. Also Devid has great sense of humor that I consider to be very important. Highly recommend for all who wants to speed up their learning of English with good and pleasant mentor.\"\n\nMaria:\n\"David taught me English for about six months. It was a productive time for me. David was attentive for my weaknesses in language proficiency, and the lesson plan was made to my needs. David has motivational skills, flexibility and responsibility.\"",
