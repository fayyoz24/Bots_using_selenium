    "summary": "Experienced manager with a demonstrated history of working in the airlines/aviation industry. Skilled in change and improvement implementation, connecting people and departments. Strong operations professional graduated from Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. \n\nNatural relationship builder and accomplished communicator. Loves to analyse risks and implement change as done with the mass influx of new cabin crew within KLM. Cares to connect people and departments to effectively organise change processes for the target group. With a background in communication, I have found more depth in structural improvement processes through my master in business administration. And my helicopter view comes in very handy.\n\nIn balance with myself and my environment, I have a well-developed sense of people, a clear understanding of relationships and a skill to operate with different cultures. Able to approach and understand issues from various points of view.\n\nI work from inspiration, alertness, fun and above all tranquility with an almost unstoppable amount of energy.",
