    "summary": "My name is Neli and I come from Bulgaria. I moved to the Netherlands in 2006 and after completing my Bachelor and Master studies I have had the chance to experience different work environments and team set-ups. \n\nProject Management\n\nHaving a personal contact with my stakeholders and customers is essential to me. \n\nI enjoy acting as a field agent and representing the brand externally \u2013 meeting new people, building and sustaining relationships, participating in strategic decision making and looking for win-win solutions. I am very ambitious and energetic.\n \nI dare challenging old processes if I believe they do not help the company move forwards. \n\nI like setting challenging goals, making a plan and taking the actions to achieve them.\n\nBut what I like even more is making people enthusiastic and engaging them in achieving these goals together.\n\nWriting\n\nIt's my passion to search for a deeper meaning than the daily operations. \n\nIn my free time I read a lot about topics like: personal development, happiness, productivity, corporate mission and strategy, leadership, employee engagement, improving customer loyalty and satisfaction. \nI also love watching TED(x) videos for inspiration. \n\nI have a blog and every last Thursday of the month I publish an article on my personal website: nelimesyova.com.\n\nBy sharing my personal experience and thoughts on basic and existential topics, I hope I can help you lead happier and more fulfilling lives.\n\nCurious to find out more about me and what I write about? Feel free to visit my website https://nelimesyova.com and don't forget to tell me what you think about the content I share and whether you find it useful.",

The TalentPitch and PreSelect make sure that candidates are carefully and efficiently selected based on the skills, competencies and intelligence required for the relevant position. This ensures that you will only talk to the right people. \n\nMy role at Harver was to guide the implementation of TalentPitch and PreSelect projects for clients mainly in the contact center branche but also in other industries. I was the first point of contact for the client and my responsibility was to make sure that the product was delivered within the agreed time and budget and the client experienced a smooth implementation process. I have guided implementations for various types of clients \u2013 smaller and larger commercial organizations, governmental organizations but also multiple municipalities. My latest two clients required also international implementations in Germany and Poland.\n\nAs we were a small team I often had to step into various roles. Besides project manager I also used to give training to the people who would be working with the test results and the back end of the tool, so I learned how to deal with a group of people who were often sceptical or resistant to change. After a product had been implemented I was also responsible for managing the client relationship. I have had regular contact with existing clients to see how things were going but also to perform and present evaluation analyses. Last but definitely not least all of us had to sometimes pick up the phone when a candidate was calling our support line with some technical struggles while completing the tests, so all in all very diverse role where every day was different!\n\nInterested?
