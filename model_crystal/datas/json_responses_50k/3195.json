Affects of the Journey to Work project on the partner organisations are shown through participants being offered employment in the Netherlands by their host employers, and Werkcenter benefited from improved working  relations with Scottish partners. It\u2019s excellent to see the impacts leading to various new projects being developed with other Scottish partners. It isn\u2019t completely clear whether learning outcomes were set by Werkcenter so that all learners had the same, or whether the student had their own input and these were more tailored to each individual\u2019s outcomes, however there seems generally a good range of outcomes covered with good methods of evaluating these.\n\nVery good supervision for participants is shown through quick assistance gaining health care when needed for one participant. Preparation seems good for the target group though more information on the language preparation provided would have helped assess this. It is positive that those not selected for the mobilities were supported in finding other suitable programmes. Various effective problem resolution systems are in place which is positive. It would have been good to have more information on exactly how participants were selected, rather than just the general criteria  for selection \u2013 was there an application or interview for participants? Communication between these long-standing partners appears to have worked well but there is no information on how this was done or how regularly. It is positive that learners have received Europass recognition.\n\nA good level of dissemination is seen throughout the project, not just at the end, and it\u2019s positive that there have been invitations received to talk about the project in Scotland and Europe.\n",

With a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning\u201d\n\nThe main objective of the PROFARM project is to experiment a model that can contribute to the well-being, professional/personal growth and the social integration of VET students with disabilities in the field of agricultural production. The final aim is to reshape horizontal integration through individuals with disabilities, their families, schools, social-health services and private partnerships, to facilitate the employment and social inclusion of young disabled persons through Social Farming (SF). More in detail, the project will focus on identifying cross-policy synergies and multi-professional partnerships to ensure integrated services in favour of the user/student as a person.\n\nThree international peer-review events will be organized to validate the project milestones, namely the MoU for the establishment of a Case management service \u2013 the PROFARM model \u2013 the policy recommendations. We are now setting up a pool of peer reviewers from all over Europe (and not only) and we would be glad to include you in such an expert team for the validation and exploitation of the project milestones.\n\nWhether you had already expressed your interest or this is the first time that you in get in contact with the PROFARM team, we would be glad if you could provide us with the proper information requested below.

The JC_Network is directed to showcase the mixed provision of job club services for young unemployed people between 19 and 30 years, still unable to find a job, falling into the social benefit trap and having lost any willingness to become active actors in their society. Therefore, the focus of the project will be:\n* Providing young people with a chance to meet with their peers\n* Start a guided process monitored monthly at the JC meetings\n* After one year being able to find their way in the social jungle\n\nIn order to attain this objective, the key involvement of youth workers will be fundamental to engage with youth realities locally and to provide the needed support in each JC that will be set-up. Therefore, a short-term training will be organized for those youth leaders whose international role will be enhanced. Accordingly, the birth of a network of JCs in Europe is to be fostered.",

It\u2019s clear that the Dutch are leading the pack in the EU regarding results in terms of percentage lowest people dependent on benefits. And that\u2019s even now while the economic depression is punching the EU and The Netherlands right in the face. The unemployment rate in The Netherlands is currently 5.8%. For example, this was 4,4% in April 2009, but is still very low. In the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Romania, Belgium and Croatia the rates are already up to 7,7%, 11,2%, 7,7%, 14,6%, 26,1%, 6,9%, 7,5% and 21,1%.

By using the EGUIDE platform & Peer Mentors, we will achieve a more effective process, as each adviser - before even meeting a service user - has a complete profile which will facilitate their further cooperation. This avoiding mismatches career and educational choices. Further, it increases the flexibility of our work since it is an internet-based tool that can be reached from home etc. The project will ensure that ICT-based tools will be put into practice in accordance with the common European Priority and that it will also be disseminated within the group of service users, so they also reap the benefits of ICT. ICT is essential in today\u2019s European society, whether you apply for a job or in everyday life for trying to contact authorities, banks, and stay in touch with people.",

It was designed to tackle youth unemployment in Edinburgh using a different approach. \n\nThe aims: To take 14 unemployed young people (in 2 flows of 7) currently accessing welfare benefits, with low aspirations & motivation on a journey towards employment using our 1-2-3 methodology, which consists of 3 phases:\n1. Intake & assessment (UK);\n2. Development  phase (6 Dutch Mobility experience weeks);\n3..Job mediation phase (UK).\nWe were very successful:\n*(12 of 15) 80% of the selected participants  sustained the assessment phase & were ultimately fit to work in Holland (target 70%)\n*(11 0f 12 ) 91,66% of the participants doing work placements in NL have returned to UK with the ability to socially participate & are 'job ready' or ready again for education (target 90%)\n*Currently (10 of 12) 83,33% of the participants who successfully completed the project are still at work &/or school after completion of FW2W (target 75%)\n*100% of the project referrals & participants have been evaluated (target 100%)\n\nThe 1-2-3 methodology, the collabouration with CCP & the approach of the Dutch host organisation DFOIW2W were used to support & guide the participants in acquiring & improving knowledge, skills & qualifications to facilitate personal development & responsibility, returning to school to obtain basic qualifications and participation in the labour market.\nIn our estimation the success of FW2W is a direct result of  amazing matching of outcomes to the Project aims and to the following key factors:\n*The intensity of From Work to Work Empowers\n*Personal Coaching & Mindset Approach supports participant\n*Emphasis on Own Responsibility ('own the problem')\n*A New Social Surrounding/Social Network provides a new start\n*Real Work helps the young person From Work to Work\n*Mindset from local to EU Job search\nResults were validated using Europass docs.",
