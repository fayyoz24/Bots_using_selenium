    "summary": "I graduated in 2014, receiving Integrated BS-MS degree with majors in Chemistry, from IISER Mohali. I was awarded INSPIRE Scholarship by Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India from 2009 to 2014. In my MS thesis, I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Angshuman Roy Choudhury (IISER-M) studying co-crystallization of active pharmaceutical drug ingredients with organic acids. I have successfully qualified GATE (Chemistry) in 2014. For my Ph.D. thesis, I worked with Dr. Santanu Kumar Pal (IISER-M). My research interest included the design of stimuli-responsive interfaces formed between liquid crystals and aqueous phases for applications in label-free biosensing. During my Ph.D. , I attended several national and  international conferences where I had presented my research work as poster/oral presentations. I have authored and co-authored nine publications in reputed peer-reviewed international journals such as JPC C, Langmuir, Analyst, ACS Omega, Liquid Crystals.",
