I provided thematic support on topics such as: women in politics, education, youth, gender, teacher training, capacity building, ICT, youth entrepreneurship and vocational education. \n\nSome clients, and short-term assignments include: \n- Avance Impact on behalf of SOS Children's villages (Avance Impact is a consultancy specialised in impact assessment | www.avance-impact.nl); \n- Edukans (A strategic cooperation between NGOs based in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi and the Netherlands. | www.edukans.org); \n- Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD works to promote peaceful, just and inclusive politics worldwide | www.nimd.org); \n- One Campaign (Campagning and advocacy organisation taking action to end extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa | www.one.org);\n- Partos (Dutch membership body for organisations working in international development | www.partos.nl);\n- NCDO (no longer active, www.ncdo.nl);\n- Institute of Social Studies.\n\nCountries covered in these studies were Bolivia, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Kenia, Peru, Tunisia and Uganda. Most studies focused on taking stock of results achieved in terms of outcomes and effectiveness of development interventions. Some focused more on fundraising, qualitative research and proposal writing, while others focused more on accountability and quantitative data analysis. I, for example, wrote a checklist on capacity assessment for a consultancy firm in ten days, which was approved and used a month later by an NGO in a granted fundraising proposals at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
