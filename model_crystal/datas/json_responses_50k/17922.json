    "summary": "As a sociology student, I find myself seeing plenty of 'societies' to observe in various shapes and sizes. From neighborhoods, schools and organizations to individual countries up until a global level. What interests me the most, regardless of the subject, is working with data. Through my affinity with technology in general, I easily pick up new methods and systems. I have a customer-oriented and professional work ethic that highly values self-reflection, as well as receiving and providing feedback. \nI would love working in a multidisciplinary, dynamic work environment on an international level.\nQualities: Adaptability | Assisting, guiding and advising | Creativity | Computer skills (IT, statistics, analysis, graphical visualization) | Discipline | Learning capacity | Sociability | ",

Since starting out as a runner and actor in 2010, by 2013 I would also assist in most aspects back-stage as well as 'in front'. This involved dealing with clients and customers as well as training and guiding junior members during activities.\nGiven my affinity with technology, I was also very active in PR & Communications, which lead to becoming part of the core group designing, planning and managing activities until after I switched studies and had less time available (2015). Regardless, I am still a member and participate when I can, usually assisting in managing during events.\n\nSome examples: Street theater on 'Cultural Sunday' (Enschede) | 'Theater op Straat' (Hengelo) | 'Proef-Eet' (Enschede) | Themed children's entertainment (BAM Festival, Hengelo) | Children's entertainment duo (Bikkel & Bret, made-on-demand themed shows and base shows) |\n\nApart from the events we develop by ourselves (new 'Sinterklaas' show every year) and those developed on request from clients, we have partnered with a range of organizations for special events.\n\nMy favorites: a 'Sinterklaas' Soap spanning two episodes (TV Hengelo, 2012 ) | a breakfast event in honor of the King's coronation in 2013 | a James Bond themed Murder Mystery night (on-request) | and a recurring horror event called 'Haunted Hause Hengelo': First developed for a neighborhood center, as of 2016 relocated to a small family theme park 'de Waarbeek'."
