Times that require structural changes at a massive scale, across all domains, for current generations and the next, to establish a sustainable future and social inclusion. \nThe projects I'm working on have just one goal: accelerate that change.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur for many years, I took most pleasure in working together with people who were intrinsically driven to push the boundaries of technological advancements and social behavior, no matter what risk or uncertainty they were facing. \n\nIn the years to come, I look forward to continuing working that way, to meeting new people who are putting in everything they have to live up to their dreams, for themselves and for others.",

We want our grandparents and children to really experience mobility rather than hear about it. \n\nMCC will be almost entirely run on renewable energy and implement innovative waste disposal, water management, and infrastructure management technologies that we so much hear about in the news and in Social Media but never actually see in practice.
