I was involved in validation of DNA methylation profiling in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Microarray. The techniques mainly included methylation-specific PCR and statistical programming using the programming language R. This internship provided a great educational experience and can be considered a next step towards becoming a successful biomedical researcher.",

The research aimed at identifying the molecular mechanism of selfish spermatogonial selection, a novel mechanism for the association between advanced paternal age and neurodevelopmental disorders.The techniques mainly included immunohistochemistry, DNA restriction analysis, PCR and bright field microscopy. This internship confirmed my passion for molecular medicine and provided additional motivation to pursue a research-based career in molecular medicine.",
