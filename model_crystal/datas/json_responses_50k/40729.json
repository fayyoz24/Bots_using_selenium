Because people with hunger are not the problem - they are the solution and can bring about the end of hunger themselves.\n\nWe change the mindset of women and men so that they become leaders for a sustainable end to hunger. Then, through our programs in education, microfinance, agriculture and health, among others, we provide them with the skills, knowledge and resources they need to break the cycle of poverty themselves. With a focus on women and with 500,000 local volunteers, we reached nearly 12 million people in nearly 11,800 villages in 13 program countries worldwide by 2022.\n\nAre you, your company or your company's foundation already participating? Invite me for a cup of coffee and I'll tell you more about the beautiful stories of change you can be a part of.",

She listens keenly and knows how to capture the essence of things in words. She gets things on track quickly and adequately. For Bisnez she set up the corporate identity, website and various other forms of communication. All this with a sometimes excessive sense of responsibility and a lot of passion.\n \nIn addition, she edited management documents for a number of years. These pieces became sharper, more pointed and direct without losing their original message.\n \nIn short, I grant you Annemarie. If desired, please feel free to call me.
