GLOBE International was originally founded in 1989 by legislators from the US Congress, European Parliament, Japanese Diet and the Russian State Duma with the mission to respond to urgent environmental challenges through the development and advancement of legislation. Ms. Jordan gestated the development of GLOBE while working with Congressman Jim Scheuer, a founding member, and left the Congressman's office in 1989 to establish the U.S. arm of GLOBE.",
