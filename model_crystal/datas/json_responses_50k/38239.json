    "summary": "Bachelors IBMS (International Business and Management) graduated from INHOLLAND University of Applied Science. After graduation started as (Online) Marketing and Communications employee at a start-up company. Afterwards given the opportunity to make a turn in career by working as a CDD (Customer Due Diligence) analyst at an international French bank. Reviewing cases remained exciting, so moved on in the same position but now for a international German bank. Then used the opportunity to grow internally, and thus made the switch to work as Compliance Officer.  I wanted to make a shift outside the Banking industry to a more Tech focused industry but in a similar role, so am currently working as Risk and Audit officer at Park NOW.",
