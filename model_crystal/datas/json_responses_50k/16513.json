The goal is to support journalists who want to produce in-depth stories which would not be possible without this extra funding. The Fund also awards an annual prize (Brusseprijs) for the best journalistic book and runs two journalist-in-residence programmes. The Dutch Fund for In-depth Journalism was set up in 1990 by an independent group of journalists and is funded by the Dutch government.",
