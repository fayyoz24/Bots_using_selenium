What a huge project, and completely new for me! I was chairman of a committee of architects (Van Bokhorst Architecten), constructors (Boers Veenendaal), engineers (Snetselaar Constructieve Ingenieurs), technicians (Techtron and ITN), and a lot of other (sub) suppliers. It was really a cool project with some difficulties like the new main reception. We had to take out some square meters of concrete from the lowest part of the existing building, consisting of four floors\u2026. It was really a pleasure working with Rik van Beek from Boers Veenendaal. What a phenomenal guy he is. What a work ethics. It was a difficult period for me that time. I was combining my \u2018normal\u2019 work, with this project and my son was suffering leukaemia. I must say Rik was really a moral support for me, besides his great expertise of constructing.\n\nA few years later we hosted the first <worldwide> live shows ever of The Voice of Holland in the new studio. Because I new all the bits and pieces I was contact person for Talpa (production company) regarding all studio facilities, traffic support, emergency plans etcetera. Really a nice project - with maximum four million live viewers on broadcasting television! Rik van Beek was also involved again with his new company Estivo. He arranged a permanent new cooling system for the studio based upon the air from outside. It worked more than perfect!",

I started with a simple PHP application to generate project numbers based upon year, month and serial number. In the PHP application we connected the number with a client name and a project name. Only the project managers could generate a project number, and the finance employees who made the invoices were the only ones who could finish (or close) it. A very simple system but it is still the basis of today\u2019s way of working.\n\nThe number is the basis <key> for hours planned, hours made <indirect costs were allocated based upon FTE per business unit>, purchases, invoices, courier drives, work in progress overviews etcetera. In the years that followed we first selected and implemented eSynergy from Exact Business Software (and phased out the PHP application), and later on we implemented also Timewax <planning software>. Timewax had a much better graphical overview regarding overall planning, and the user interface was much more friendly than the UI from Exact Software. I really can recommend Timewax as a product. Also the people behind the software are really client oriented. As an organization you can give feedback that in a lot of cases will be incorporated in future software releases. \n\nThe improvement of financial insights was huge and the following ten years the profitability grew significantly.",

            "description": "For more than ten years I held evaluation meetings with 200+ employees at Lukkien. A direct manager was always involved in the meetings. So in most cases three people were around the table. In the beginning it took a lot of time for me to set up a scorecard system based upon functions, KPI\u2019s (key performance indicators), years of experience, salary, etcetera. But after a couple of months I completed it and covered all the disciplines involved. Either when we held the meetings based upon the scorecards we experienced a lot of discussions about the exact scores (what is the performance difference between a score of 7 and 8?) and we experienced also that the interviews were a little bit staccato. We scored KPI\u2019s 1 to 10 and that was in a lot of cases more or less immediately the end of the interview. We used the scorecards one year and started later on with open interviews. No list of fixed KPI\u2019s, but open questions. How are you feeling? Are you happy with your projects? How are your team members? Etcetera. \n\nOur experience was that we got much more feedback from the employees. The atmosphere of the interviews was also much better than before. And of course when we as a management team had some feedback, we had enough opportunities to discuss this. I believe in systems, but based on this experience also very much in open discussions, with arguments. In the years that followed I believed also more and more in the People First methodology. People make or break a company. People are the enablers of innovation as Accenture published in their Technology Vision report.",

During 2018 we migrated the whole IT landscape in three steps to the cloud together with our IT-partner Hupra. First all workplaces were migrated to the cloud in order to improve security (Citrix) and management (rollouts, upgrades, user management), secondly we dismantled the server room and virtualized the servers and thirdly we moved the SAP backbone to two virtual servers, loadbalanced and with a back-up strategy. As a result: a state of the art IT landscape, ready for the move to the completely new \u201cThe Dutch Vault\u201d building in Houten. I can wholeheartedly recommend IT-partner Hupra since this is the second successfull Cloud migration during my career with them.",

The Royal Dutch Mint has been privatised since the end of 2016 - sold to Belgian industrial holding Heylen Group. The Royal Dutch Mint runs its operations flexibly, independently and in a market-oriented way.\n\nI joined the Royal Dutch Mint as Chief Financial Officer, with responsibility for the finance, control and HR departments. After a significant and succesfull financial reorganization I was asked to lead also the marketing and sales operation of the B2C e-commerce department, including customer services and IT. I'm very proud of the teams I lead today, the clients we work with and the transition we made together from a formerly owned company by the Dutch government with significant losses to a profitable and agile company with great appealing projects for a broad audience. We went from product focus to storytelling. A result of a significant insourcing operation of (Online) Marketing, PR, Graphic Design, E-commerce fulfillment/logistics and Client Services together with a consistent campaign strategy and great license agreements.",

Monthly (KPI\u2019s), quarterly and annual reporting was done in Dutch GAAP. Contract management (e.g. Conditions of Purchase, Non Disclosure Agreements, Service Level Agreements), lease agreements, mortgages, insurance policies and others were also part of my responsibility. I was the architect of project number based financial workflows <activity-based costing>. Result: significant costs savings, better allocation of costs and huge improvement of insights. And I managed the implementation of new ERP software (ExactNext, Timewax). Result: one workflow for the total operation, from quotation to planning, invoicing and P&L analysis. Working with bankers, lawyers, accountants, and many others to keep the business running was my daily job.\n\nDuring my years as Chief Financial Officer at Lukkien the profitability grew significantly.",
