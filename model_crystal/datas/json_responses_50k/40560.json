The written program is integrated with ActiveX with the idea that the program can be controlled with different types of operating systems.\nTo use the lightpulse generator during MEG or MRI measurements it is important that the part where the light pulses arrive is nonmagnetic. To realise this we used fibreglass wires to transfer the light from the generator to into the magnetically shielded room. To stimulate the different quadrants and to choose to stimulate central or peripheral, a plastic plate mounted in an aluminium frame is installed in the magnetically shielded room. In the plate are predrilled holes on fixed distances and angles to choose the quadrants\u2019 and a central or peripheral stimulation.",
