    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn profile!\n\nI'm \u00c1lvaro, a food enjoyer who founded his own wine bar in 2020. I'm currently working as a pantry cook in the Netherlands\n\nHaving been born in a small town five hundred kilometres away from the capital of Argentina, I developed a style of cooking that was not affected by geographical issues, such as long distances, which might hinder the supply of inputs. I am a strong believer in quality cuisine based on fresh and seasonal food, without restricting myself to a fixed, unchanging menu. My cooking and creations develop according to what the market offers, allowing room for innovation and daring combinations of flavours.\n\nI studied History at university for three years, a career that I never finished, but which I somehow continued to pursue by training young students for the IGCSE and Cambridge A-level exams.\n\nKeywords: Hotel Management - Cooking - Gastronomy - Waiter - Customer Service - Menu Development \u00b7 Food Demonstrations \u00b7 Budget Management - Hosting Events - Team Leadership - Teamwork - English - Communication",
