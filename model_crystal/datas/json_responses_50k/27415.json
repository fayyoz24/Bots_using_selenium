Throughout my time at IFP I worked closely together with the IFP consultancy firm Beicip-Franlab. I was contributor and leader in a number of interesting studies for NOC's and IOC's:\n\nI was leader of a 1-year consultancy EOR study with ONGC, India, on the giant Mumbai High Field. The study was conducted by a multidisciplinary team of 6, and focused on redevelopment by Water-Alternating-Gas injection (WAG/SWAG). The study included reservoir characterization, reservoir simulation studies, sensitivity analysis, SCAL studies, pilot design. The study was partly conducted on-site, including multiple progress meetings and presentations with ONGC. (The client ultimately decided to conduct an Air Injection Pilot)\n\nFirstly as reservoir engineer and later as team leader I conducted field development studies for the Giant Ghawar field, Saudi Arabia (Haradh sector). Work included reservoir characterization, reservoir simulation, and well pattern optimization with multilateral horizontal wells. Our recommended optimum length of the horizontal laterals was adopted by the operator. In this project I developed and applied a pragmatic and innovative approach to incorporate fracture swarms into a single medium reservoir simulation model. I also developed a technique to condition the reservoir model to a large PLT database.\n\nI was leader / Reservoir Engineer on horizontal well field development studies for the Sugmut oil field, operated by Sibneft in Siberia.  Work included simulation studies and optimization of the field development plan with horizontal wells. These wells were the largest Siberian oil producers at the time when they were drilled.",
