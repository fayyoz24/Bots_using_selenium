    "summary": "A zealous policy advisor with a dexterous experience of over a decade in agro-industry, climate-smart agriculture, food loss, and the introduction of innovative agricultural solutions. An earnest convener and a strong believer in correlative work relationships can create great teams as well as produce exceptional results.\nWith over a decade of experience, I\u2019ve gained a huge subjection in almost all the policy advising functions such as; collaborating on policy intervention, assisting with market entry strategies, sourcing funds from the Ministry to organize varied events, forming a strong tech team to support the farmers in innovating new applications, interacting with the operating team, as well as various teams in order to ensure a smooth working environment, etc.\nMoreover, I\u2019m currently working for the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands, focusing on international trade, with a demonstrated history of working in the government administration industry. Since I work in the Agro-industry every day is a challenging day for me, as I should work on the development of the agricultural sector which would benefit the farmers and abide by the regulatory policies of the local government. My current role is also engaged with duties such as; organizing meetings with the Ministry, frequently monitoring climate change, and also expanding the Indian markets with foreign vendors.",
