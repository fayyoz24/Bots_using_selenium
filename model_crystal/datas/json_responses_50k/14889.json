    "summary": "Integrated Marketing & Communications Specialist\nOrganizing, improving and executing your (digital) marketing and communications. With over 20 years of experience in digital marketing, media, and communications, I help brands to get the best out of their marketing and communication investments. Overseeing the current complex communication landscape and aligning your business and communication strategy with available tools, channels, tactics and emerging opportunities. \n\nOptimizing Customer Journeys\nMy strength lies in managing, aligning and integrating the different channels, tactics and specialties across the customer journey. Managing the customer journey with marketing and communication tactics is done with a growth hacker mindset. Based on a 360 analysis of all marketing and communication activities I review strategy and set priorities for optimization. Through experiments in every stage, I try to improve the total effect step by step.\n\nIntegrated Marketing Communications\nIntegrating disciplines, channels and specialties runs like a thread through my professional career. First by founding my own digital media agency in the early internet days and adding specialties like social, gaming, search and creative execution. By co-building the Dutch Isobar network (currently Dentsu) and integrating a network of digital agencies into a traditional media and communication agency. By building a digital practice group for an international corporate communications agency where I integrated digital tactics and specialties into corporate communications and PR. \n\n20+ years relevant working experience\nHaving worked in digital, media, creative and PR agencies I have built strong experience on agency side.  Working interim and freelance for the past 9 years taught me the organizational dynamics from a brand perspective. Combining the two gives me an advantage in working with agencies, or vice versa.\nI know how to align channels offline and online, how to adapt creatives to channels, how to make cross overs between disciplines such as SEO link building and PR outreach or aligning brand and reputation. \nThis professional experience gives me the ability to manage the complex marketing communication landscape. Connecting the dots for better results is what I love to do.\n\nInterested in my view of a truly integrated marketing communication approach? Or want to discuss your needs in the current communication landscape? Send me a message or give me a call?",
