    "summary": "For Frank, it was a logical choice to add Post HBO Business Administration as a study after studying HTS Information Technology. IT-systems are not a purpose for themselves, they should support customers and companies. Frank feels like a fish in the water when he can fulfill a bridge function between the business, the customer and the technology and when his creativity and sense of reality are called upon. Similarly, in situations where changes / projects are likely to get stuck.\n\nFrank has shown in his Sales and BusinessDevelopment roles that he can listen to the customer, translate customer demand into suitable solutions and vice versa. \nFrank has led organizations with a budget responsibility of XX million Euro and a span of control of more than 200 FTE, spread over several (international) locations. He has demonstrated at the Ministry of Justice that he can manage complex environments on a content, organizational and political level. As Operational Manager he has shown that he can lead a large group of people, take responsibility in a dynamic work field and manage quality and profit margin.\n\nHis strengths include organizing, managing and motivating teams and colleagues and quickly familiarizing himself with the environment. Frank likes to make clear agreements, partly because of this he is an example for his team members. He picks up his responsibilities, even outside his domain, if this is necessary for the intended end result.\n\nHis colleagues characterize him as someone with lots of energy, who is reliable, transparent, assertive, easy to approach and creative. He is politically sensitive, respects others' opinions and is results-oriented.\n\nDeng Xiaoping (1963): No matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.",

This contract was executed by various parties within Atos and third parties. Approximately 70-80% of the work was carried out in India, the other activities were carried out at KPN, third parties and at various (international) Atos locations. The span of control of our own employees was 200+ with a budget of around XX million per year. The various domains within the contract were process oriented, as were the associated KPIs. Solution times and availability were of course basic KPIs, but for the contract Business KPIs were also agreed, such as for example that a customer could leave the store calling within 5 minutes after signing his contract.\nIn between, Frank worked for 3 months on the start of a re-transition of the work from 90 FTE to an Indian party. This process had a difficult start because the definitions from the contract and the scope between KPN and the new party did not match what Atos and KPN had contracted at the time and had to transfer to the new party.\n\nActivities / results he has performed:\n\u2022 HR tasks,\n\u2022 Re-transition for 90 FTEs,\n\u2022 Implementation of the Atos GDP process,\n\u2022 Profit and Loss responsibility and guidance on (business) KPIs and SLAs,\n\u2022 Despite the reduction of the contract, Frank maintained the quality of the service as well as the profit margin.\n\u2022 Responsibility for the implementation of the Maintenance Audit, which ensured that the quality of completion significantly increased.",

The scope of these transition projects varied from 4 to 25 FTE per transition. A transition is and was nothing more than a project, hence with other milestones and deliverable (intermediate) products. The character was fixed price and fixed date. The most important point of attention in a transition was the employee that would became obsolete. These employees are the \"turkey for Christmas\". In general, these employees did not know whether they still had a job at the end of a transition or not. In addition, they were often unskilled in the English language and regarded the acquiring party as the evil outside world who understood nothing and the same for their own management. The crux for solving this dilemma was: 1-explain the to be obsolete employee what he will be facing when his work is gone (other job/dismissal), 2 make sure you are often together with the to be obsolete and receiving teams as much as possible and keep on checking with the individual teams.\n\nActivities / results he has performed:\n\u2022 Various Transition processes within time and budget,\n\u2022 Reallocation of employees.",

This was a collaboration between the Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs and the Kmar. At the Dutch Embassy in Accra, fingerprints were taken on a voluntary basis when applying for a Dutch visa, and a picture was taken of the face. For two months, my colleague and I compared live fingerprints and photos of passengers who traveled from Accra every working day at Schiphol in cooperation with the Kmar.",

Various products in progress were put on display for sale. The product Sibylle was sold to a Venture Capitalist. The product was housed in a newly established B.V. called Semergy.\nSemergy was set up during the internet hype where shareholders wanted to cash in on their investments as quickly as possible. Semergy was an Internet-related company that classified and presented unstructured information.\n\nFrank started at Semergy as Operational Manager with responsibility for the product development of the Sibylle product, the development of pre-sales activities and the company's full operational course of business. After a few months the director was dismissed and I was appointed as director Research & Development together with a Director Sales & Marketing.\nThe product Sibylle was sold at the time as a ready-made product that was ready for market after some small adjustments. The reality, however, was different. The product was far from market-ready, the acquired developers had been involved for a long time in executive and especially theoretical research into semantic classification and were perfectionists. Adjustments to make the product commercially available more quickly or to make it commercially more attractive encountered resistance and delay, but it was still the perfect semantic classification? Making the product ready for the market would take some time and the initial investments were not sufficient for this. In spite of this explanation, I have once again raised money from the investors to make the product ready for the market. In the end, Semergy ceased to exist at the end of 2001 and the product Sibylle was placed with one of the investors in the Anton Dreesman foundation.\n\nActivities / results he has performed:\n\u2022 Preparing the market for the product,\n\u2022 Pre-sales activities,\n\u2022 Profit and Loss responsibility towards the shareholders.",
