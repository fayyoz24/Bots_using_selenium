    "summary": "After having studied SPH (Social Work) at the HAN in Nijmegen, I have been looking for a long time to find out what I can do for others and how. I first worked with groups of children with different behavioral problems. After this I traveled extensively to gain a bigger world view, including to the United States where I studied English, to Bali where I volunteered for three months with street children and to Peru where I taught English for three years. Great experiences where I learned a lot about myself and others. But I had not yet come to what really touches me, my passion.\n\nUntil a NEI coach came on my path. I was in Peru and hadn't eaten gluten for three years because it gave me such a stomachache. That I knew the pains came from gluten hadn't come from the various examinations at the hospital, but from a homeopath. But the reason I suddenly couldn't tolerate gluten? She didn't know either. I heard about NEI from my sister and then did a session online with a NEI coach in the Netherlands while I was in Lima, Peru. The next day I was in an Italian restaurant eating pizza, and I've never had gluten problems again... \n\nWow, what an experience that was. During the session, emotions from myself, inherited emotions from my mother and even emotions from previous generations emerged that had an influence on me. This was the beginning for me to look differently to my physical and emotional problems, and to my behavior. \n\nI was so attracted to NEI that I moved back to the Netherlands in 2020 to follow the NEI Coach training with Jolanda Vleugel in Groesbeek. Now, with my NEI Praktijk Yvonne, I can really mean something for people in the form of integral coaching & therapy, to help people regain their strength, to believe in their own healing capacity and to be in balance again.",
