    "summary": "Hi there! Here a bit more about me: \n\nI am a sales professional with 2 years experience in the SaaS industry and full cycle B2B sales. Having gone through both outbound and inbound positions, I have transitioned into SMB sales in EMEA and recently tapped into Enterprise sales in the DACH region.\n\nHaving started my career as Stream's first official SDR based in EMEA, I not only learned to master outbounding strategies over the next months, but also was I involved in the interviewing and onboarding process of my future team. \n\nBeing a high performing SDR, I had the opportunity to move into inbound sales where I gained more in-depth technical expertise around our APIs, SDKs, and documentation while peaking to product managers (C-Level, VP Level, Senior Managers) and engineers.\n\nAs an Account Executive, I am using a consultative sales approach, using MEDDPICC. I have experience across the EMEA market and have recently taken on selling to Enterprise accounts in the DACH region.\n\nMy strengths lie in my multicultural experience and my structured way of working and communicative skills in four (and a half) languages English, German, French, and Dutch. Currently, I'm adding Polish to that repository (such a tough language, they have 7 cases!!!).\n\nI'm excited to step out of my comfort zone and go the extra mile. Hence, I strive to push my learning curve - and personal continuous improvement - in order to become an expert also in areas I'm rather unfamiliar with. Being of creative and curious nature, it has always been my passion to think outside the box and to find new, innovative solution approaches.",
