    "summary": "A young Theoretical Physics graduate interested in applying critical thinking and analytical skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy finding smart solutions to difficult problems. I am well versed with modern Physics technologies such as nanotechnology, laser physics, optical communications as well as have a strong grip on fundamental physical phenomena such as field theory and String theory. I also find immense pleasure in programming and analysis. I have experience of working with Excel, Python, C, C++, and Mathematica on various interesting projects within academics and in industry.",

Therefore, the Buddy program was created which aimed at helping refugee students with practical matters about living in the Netherlands and studying at the University. Each refugee student was paired with an existing student who would help them throughout the term. We also had some exciting activities in between and I also got the privilege of being part of the organizing committee of a fun quiz."

It is a student-run NGO that aims at the overall development of underprivileged children and provides them a fair chance in life. We organized education programs, skill development programs and provided financial support to send children to school. We also ran awareness campaigns in slums against child marriage and other social evils. To support the cause please follow: http://kartavya.org/"
