    "summary": "As a Product Manager at Mollie, I lead the Financial Monitoring domain with the aim of reducing risky merchants on the platform while maintaining a smooth lifecycle experience for good merchants. I own and manage the product vision, the roadmap, the OKRs, and the overall charter for the team. I also build products, platforms, and AI/ML solutions to proactively detect and minimize fraud and credit losses on the platform, as well as improve the efficiency of the Ops and Analytics teams.\n\nI have a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), where I also completed a Master in Management (MiM) term from ESCP Europe as part of an exchange program. I have over four years of experience in the Fraud & Risk domain, having previously worked as a Product Manager at Flipkart, where I managed the Trust and Safety domain and led the end-to-end AI/ML development in this area. \n\nI have co-founded a startup, filed a patent, published two papers, and won multiple awards for my academic and professional excellence. I am skilled in attention to detail, problem solving, and platform development. I am passionate about building innovative and impactful products that enhance the security and trust of online transactions.\n\nI live in Amsterdam currently with my bicycle, Museum Card, and PS5.",
