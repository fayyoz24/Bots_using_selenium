    "summary": "Being an IT professional for 11+ years I ended up specialising in managing/leading agile development teams with members coming from all over the world. My primary objective is to build a team(s) of experts and make them self-sufficient so that they can tackle critical scenarios with ease and minimum supervision. Majority of my time goes to planning upcoming epics and roadmaps while making sure the developers keep improving themselves by monitoring their growth path, empowering both the developer and the company. I also have a good name for loving metrics, because metrics helps me to decide on what the next action should be rather than just hoping for the best. Being a backend developer before and infrastructure specialist definitely helps in my current role as I can have a better understanding of the technical problem at hand independent of the language or services being used.\n\nI am a complete family guy and love spending my evening cuddling with my 3 year old daughter and reading books (not story but maybe some day).\n\nAs a hobby I used to play around with Arduino and python making my own robots that I can control over the dead with full video and remote power management solution. Currently my focus has shifted a bit towards making and flying FPV drones - takes me a bit closer to my once childhood dream - to be a pilot :)",
