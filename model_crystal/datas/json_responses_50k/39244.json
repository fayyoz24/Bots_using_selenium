In the first part of the research project a corpus was created with more than 1600 speeches given at the Chamber of deputies. The textual source was the official parliamentary reports released by the Chamber of Deputy. The corpus was composed by approximately 5 mil occurrences for a total of 91.000 different words used. Starting from this corpus the different member of the research project performed analysis following different approaches such as sociological, linguistic and statistic. The project was promoted by the Associazione ex-parlamentari (Association of the Former Members of Parliament) and was presented twice at the Chamber of Deputies of Italy. \n",
