    "summary": "I am a multidisciplinary recent graduate, excited to tackle society's greatest challenges. \n\nTwo years ago, I launched the digital start-up CarbonCancel, which helps people calculate, reduce and offset their entire carbon footprint. We strive to create a climate conscious community and a carbon-neutral world.\n\nDuring my dual master\u2019s in international affairs, I became fascinated with social inequalities, finance and the welfare state. I wrote my dissertation on the political-economic effects of pension and mortgage market financialisation in Europe. \n\nAfter gaining experience in the European bubble, I worked as a freelance adviser to The Ex'tax Project. This Dutch think tank aims to enable a tax shift from labour to natural resources, and turn tax into a force for good.\n\nThis year, I started the BoFEB traineeship at the Dutch Ministry of Finance, where I will work on financial-economic policy.\n\nI am always looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful societal change in an exciting professional environment.",
