Here, the magneto-resistance is from relativistic effect, while the spin-orbit interaction in GMR device is detrimental.\n\nWORKSHOPS and CONFERENCES:\n\u25cf  WIEN2K WORKSHOP 2009, held in Pennsylvania State University, America (Jun. 2009). \n\u25cf  PSI-K-2010 conference, held in Free University Berlin, Germany, contributing two posters (Sep. \n    2010).\n\u25cf  APS March meeting 2011, held in Dallas, America, representation on greigite, (Mar. 2011).\n\u25cf  DPG Spring Meeting 2012, held in Technical University Berlin, Germany, representation on  \n    CsO2, (Mar. 2012).",
