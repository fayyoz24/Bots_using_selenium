    "summary": "Ever since my study Clinical and Health Psychology, I have been interested in how people respond to difficult live events and factors that facilitate and hinder adaptation. Working as Associate Professor in Health Psychology, I apply these insights into developing and testing the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy and underlying mechanisms of psychological interventions (i.e., cognitive therapy, mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions). \nHereby I focus on mental ill-being (e.g., fatigue, depression) and well-being (e.g., positive affect, post-traumatic growth) and the role of emotion regulation, social support, mindfulness, self-compassion. This research is characterized by integrating theory and conceptual models, quantitative and qualitative methods (i.e., observational longitudinal studies, daily diary studies, RCTs, interviews), and  clinical experience. \nIn recent years, I became particularly intrigued by the fact that many people with severe physical illness and experiencing depression, anxiety, or fatigue, do not receive psychological care: what are their reasons for this, their care needs, and perceived barriers? With the aim to optimize people's informed decision making regarding the uptake of psychological care. Moreover, I started investigating the role of mindfulness and compassion in health care and communication. \nBesides research, I enjoy teaching on adaptation and stress (management) and, as a certified mindfulness teacher, offering lectures and training to patients, students, researchers, and health care professionals. \nI am Program Leader of the Health Psychology Research group, Board Member and Treasurer of the National Association for Researchers in Psychology and Health (ARPH), and Board Member of several grant committees.",
