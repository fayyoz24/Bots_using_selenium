    "summary": "I started sailing on general cargo vessels in 1996, as a cadet. After my training, I started sailing as engineer. After one trip, I decided I wanted to continue my career, as a deck officer and I am sailing as nautical officer ever since. In 2005 I upgraded my level of education to higher professional education, to gain my license Master all ships, No limitations. Since 2008 I am continuously sailing as master on container vessels and the last three years as master on a fast crew supplier in the renewable energy sector. During the last three years I have assisted the QHSE department with development of procedures needed in renewable energy sector, writing procedures and making amendments and adjustments in the risk assessments.\nAs I assisted the QHSE department with writing procedures and risk assessments, I found out that this part of the maritime industry is very interesting.  Due to a change in my personal life (child) and my experience of working on QHSE items, I found out that I want to change my career and continue my career in the field of QHSE ashore. \nIn my opinion: The crew must reflect, carry out and adhere to the QHSE standard of the company and charterer, to perform at their best.",

Our base was Esbjerg and every morning we left port with two teams on board. One team for cleaning inside the fundations, before the jackup barge arrived to install the turbines. The other team was responsible for replacing gratings on the towers, which were damaged due to the December 2013 storm.\nDuring our time there I was responsible for the following items: Following procedures stated by Vattenfall; Inductions of passengers, administration of daily works and communications with the APRO teams and Dan Tysk traffic coordination ashore.\nWe brought cargo and personel from Esbjerg, to the manned platform OSS and back.\nOn a later stage, we also carried a team of specialists, which was resposible for servicing the cranes on the towers.\nThe vessel is also equiped by the charterer to do survey works around the towers in the Dan Tysk project area. This  excists out of computers and a fundation to lower sonar equipment through the moon pool into the water.\n\nHalf way April 2014, I transfered to the sister vessel to complete my contract there. The project will be ongoing until September 2014.",

The NSO windfarm about 20 nautical miles N of Helgoland. We are based in Helgoland port and every day we set sail for the NSO windfarm with a RAT team and representatives from RWE, client rep and rep of manufacturerer of jackets. \nA work day starts around 07:00 in the morning and mainly back in Helgoland between 17:00 and 18:00. The windfarm is located, about one hour sailing from Helgoland.\n\nWorks consisted out off:\n1) Visual inspection jackets, integrety of jacket and check if jacket was safe for boarding.\n2) Put RAT team and other inspectors on jacket, who made a tour over the jacket and charted all damages which were found on the jacket. \n3) Informing coordination center, which is based in Bremerhaven, if the jacket is safe to board and other operational information which are essential for operating in the NSO windfarm.\n4) daily reports prepared and sending to the RWE coordination center and keep all parties informed about our progress.\n5) Act as guard vessel on site, while RAT team and other persons are on the jackets.\n\nIn this project we work in shifts of 12 hours. As we are sailing on the German Continental Shelf we are allowed to work max 12 hours/ day.\n\nFollow link Seazip.com for information regarding Seazip Offshore services.\nLinks attached to this project, reffer to companies which participated in this project",
