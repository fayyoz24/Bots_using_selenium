            "description": "To investigate the communication between multinational oil and gas company Shell and the Dutch government, Follow the Money (FTM) is gathering and scrutinizing many many documents. The goal of the Hackathon was to help FTM find the relevant documents sooner by using active learning instead of randomly reading all documents. In the investigation of Shell Papers, there is a call for help to the general public to search through the papers for possible ties between multinational oil and gas company Shell and the Dutch government.\n\nThe Shell Papers are gathered through different so-called Wob-applications (Wet openbaarheid van bestuur \u2013 translates to Government Information (Public Access) Act). The Dutch government is requested to share information. So far, FTM has collected 2500 documents, consisting of 17000 pages. That\u2019s a very long read, and it is only the first batch of documents: In total, around 150.000 documents are expected! \n\nData\nThe Shell Papers (in Dutch) consist of emails, documents, WhatsApp messages, governmental decisions, and many more types of files, which are retrieved from several different counties in the Netherlands. In a nutshell, it contains a very large proportion of all communication between Shell and Dutch governmental institutions.\n\nTrack 1: Data pre-processing\nBefore we can do anything with the data, there has to be some pre-processing. The raw data is quite challenging, containing much noise and little structure. Most data is raw email HTML, combined with a header. Documents are labeled on correspondence, reports, permits, governmental decisions, and particular documents.\n\nMore information can be read at https://asreview.nl/blog/asreview-hackathon-for-follow-the-money/",

While global demand might be met through current agricultural practices in the short term, these strategies are unsustainable for the long term. Globally, agriculture demands a radical transformation.\n\nTogether with students from Cornell University, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, China Agricultural University, University of California, Davis, and Wageningen University, we aimed to tackle challenges in agriculture.
