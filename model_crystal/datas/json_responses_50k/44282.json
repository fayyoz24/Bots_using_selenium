After the war I have been teaching in Ivano Frankivsk for a university (English), a primary school (German) and organizing workshops for UNICEF\n\nSome successes so far are:\n#Awesome kledingruilatelier; share the coordination of a clothing recycling / repair / centre, where we want all people to have access to good clothing, while helping the volunteers get back on their feet. Many of my interests and skills connect together here for me to learn how to manage, coach, inspire and build a business better.\n\nEdulin-Q: offering guest lectures to secondary and middle professional education (MBO) classes on subject that have impact. Topics include; Blood-, and organdonation, confidence & social media, menstruation.\n\nKorein Groep; organise several big events (100 children per afternoon), programs of workshops (12 kids), and trainings/presentations for employees. I like working with this company since they have an open minded view about children development and appreciate my low impact/high creativity activities.\n\nThe Hub Eindhoven for Expats; train, guide and supervise the volunteers who were working to keep the community centre for expats running for this amazing initiative. I've been supporting them also as volunteer for many years, just after the startup years. As it's very important for a city to welcome all these new individuals coming for their new home.",

This all while taking in account the 'rules' of the Dialogue; respect to each other, postpone judgements and research them while listening closely to each other. \n\nThis event has improved my understanding of the stories people are hiding from others, but which do explain so much about the hopes and troubles we all share. My duties are to guard the values of the Dialogue and to keep the talk flowing. Mostly I guide groups in November, but also I am asked several other times during the year.",

Also it utilised the talents & enthusiasm of some communication employees.\n- Upon deciding to leave I made, together with the previous input from employees and a board member / workgroup chairmen, key strategic subject about sustainability, which were accepted by the board and all the divisions directors as key policy plans from 2017.",

In this project the building corporation invited people to sign up as renters, before the houses and appartments were built in Genderdal. After about 55 households signed up, we had many workshop and meeting during the year to decide together how we want to live and how we can be sustainable together as a group. After time the project evolved and more things became clear. However the methods of deciding have changed during time, because it is not easy to decide things with 55 strong passionate people. From februari 2014 we are using the 'Sociocratic' method.\n\nMore information about this project (in Dutch):https://www.woonbedrijf.com/Nieuws/Artikel-598/\n\nFunction: Chairman cluster Integration\nAs many things needed to be worked out, we formed cluster (or circles) of different subjects. Before I participated in the cluster which handled the interior of the appartments and flats. After a change in method I decided to be the chairman of the interesting cluster of Integration.\n\nIn this cluster our duties are:\n- decide what the criteria will be for allowing new 'green' renters to join the complex\n- decide what the protocols will be for allowing present renters to move from an appartment to a house\n- how to make make sure / stimulate present renters to stay green and become more green/social\n- how to promote a sustainable way of living to the surrounding neighbourhoods\n\nMy duties are:\n- Refer questions from the members of the cluster Integration and the upper laying central circle from top down and down up.\n- Manage deadlines and todo-lists\n- Maintain the overview and review all the minuter (notulen)\n\nAs of December 2014 I am the chairman of the 'outside-area' (buitenruimte)",
