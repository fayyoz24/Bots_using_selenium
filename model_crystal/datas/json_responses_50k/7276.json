    "summary": "I am passionate about slow fashion, creative campaigns, and the circular economy. \u27b0\n\nThrough my four year degree in Creative Business, I am skilled to analyse issues from multiple perspectives and think of solutions outside the box. Studying and working in the Netherlands, Scotland, Germany, Japan, and Sweden have given me the strengths of adapting quickly to new surroundings and cultures. \n\nDuring my studies, I gained experience in working with intercultural teams and tackling challenges of real brands. According to my supervisors in Japan and Germany, I am a quick learner and can adapt smoothly with little direction given. \n\nI am certain that with my enthusiastic, humble and confident attitude I can be an important asset to a company.",
