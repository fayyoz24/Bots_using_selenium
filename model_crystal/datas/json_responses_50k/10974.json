            "description": "The bubble formation mechanism is highly relevant for many industrial processes including gas-liquid reactors and distillation. The introduction of flowing liquid allows for the necessary bubble size-distribution to be produced, which maximises the efficiency of these processes. Bubble formation with co-flowing liquid has only been studied for small ranges of needles. This work offers an insight into the effects of liquid co-flow velocity and gas flow rate on bubble diameter and frequency for varying needle dimensions, including inner diameters from 0.79 \u2013 1.68 mm. Bubbling in quiescent flow was first considered to gain understanding on bubble dynamics and regimes.\n\nExperiments were performed under constant pressure conditions for gas flow rates ranging from 0.42 \u2013 4.2 cm3/s on five different sized needles in quiescent flow and four with co-flowing liquid, the velocity ranging from 0.15 \u2013 0.37 m/s. Observations on the bubble formation process were recorded by a high speed camera and the bubble frequency was measured indirectly by a waterproof microphone. The\nsynchronisation of the two modes of acquisition offers strong validation of the results obtained.",

This information included the material properties used by the FEM analysts and the different formats required by each package. Based on this, I created a report offering an advise on the adjustments needed to the database and the different paths available in order to achieve the direct connection.",
