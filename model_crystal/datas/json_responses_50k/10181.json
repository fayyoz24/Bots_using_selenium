    "summary": "I am a motivated and dedicated professional with a passion for marketing. Originally from Malaysia, I completed my bachelor's degree at Chihlee University of Technology in Taiwan. I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Global Marketing as a second-year student at Feng Chia University.\n\nDriven by a curiosity to explore the differences between European and Asian marketing, I decided to embark on an international exchange program after my thesis defense. Currently, in the second semester of my master's program, I am serving as an exchange student at Hanze University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, focusing on international marketing.\n\nThis exchange experience has allowed me to immerse myself in a new cultural and business environment, broadening my perspectives and enhancing my understanding of global marketing dynamics. It has been an incredible opportunity to compare and contrast marketing practices, and market trends between Europe and Asia.\n\nDuring my academic journey, I have focused on developing expertise in various areas of marketing, including marketing strategy, e-commerce, business analytics, digital marketing, online to offline, Martech, content marketing and copywriting. One of my particular strengths is copywriting, and throughout my studies, I have been responsible for crafting compelling copy for assignments and competitions. Additionally, I have also been involved in generating ideas and creating scripts for advertisements and video content. One area where I excel is in copywriting, which is a valuable skill in today's content marketing landscape. \n\nIn my master's program, I further expanded my knowledge by delving into the field of consumer behaviour analysis. This involved studying research methodologies, and data analysis techniques to gain insights into consumer motivations, preferences, and decision-making processes.\n\nWith my passion for storytelling, my understanding of consumer behaviour, and my all the marketing knowledge have learned, I am excited to contribute to the marketing field",

Identifying target cities in Denmark for The DJ Company's initial market entry, based on factors like population demographics, local music scene, and major festivals/events. I selected cities that would provide the right customer base and opportunities for The DJ Company in its early stages in the market.\n2. Defining the target demographic and analyzing their online behaviors to determine the ideal target audience for marketing efforts. I outlined the key characteristics (age, income, interests, etc.) that make this group an attractive target, as well as where and how they engage online in order to tailor personal marketing.\n3. Mapping the customer journey stages and touchpoints to consider for digital marketing campaigns. I looked at the customer path from initial awareness to loyalty and advocacy and identified key actions and touchpoints at each stage (awareness, interest, consideration, conversion, loyalty, advocacy). \n4. Providing recommendations for improving The DJ Company's Instagram presence based on current best practices.\n5. Creating Instagram and website mockups using tools like Wix to demonstrate proposed improvements.\n\nIn the project i learned,\n1. Gain hands-on experience in visually bringing marketing strategies to life. I learned how to quickly ideate and iterate on different layouts and content presentation to engage audiences.\n2.The importance of mapping the customer journey to create targeted digital marketing campaigns\n3.

Traditional heuristic models are used for comparison purposes.\nThis research utilizes Markov Chain modeling to provide detailed insights into the influence of channels in conversion paths.",

I chose the salad and light meal brand \"The Greenery,\" which I worked part-time during university. The Greenery was inspired by the founder's study abroad experience in Australia. After returning to Taiwan, the founder brought those ideals back. Through a similar story and brand ethos, I designed stickers representing the brand. Each sticker features one of The Greenery's dishes. The stickers depict a family, representing the brand's broad consumer demographic. I was very happy to collaborate with an art student friend on this project - I sketched the concepts and he created the final versions.",
