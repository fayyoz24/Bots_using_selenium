The EU-funded interTwin project will codesign and implement the prototype of an interdisciplinary digital twin engine. This open-source platform will provide generic and tailored software components for modelling and simulation to integrate application-specific digital twins. The goal is to develop a common approach that is applicable across the whole spectrum of scientific disciplines to facilitate developments and collaboration. As a result, a consolidation of software technologies supporting research will emerge",

It was a collaborative effort involving more than 50 institutions. The original impetus for EGI-INSPIRE was the heavy computational requirements of big data users at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, where physicists adopted the paradigm of distributed computing worldwide to solve their big data problems. They used EGI to analyse the data from the Large Hadron Collider that led to the discovery of the elusive Higgs boson.",
