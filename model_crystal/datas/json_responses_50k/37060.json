    "summary": "I have spent 23 years working on stories. I started at the Sunday Times in Glasgow, as a news intern in 2002 (when David Beckham was England captain and the first Spider-Man film came out). I wrote stories about religious hatred in football and the abuse of migrant workers in the UK. \n\nIn 2003, I moved to Australia and worked at the Financial Review and Sun Herald newspapers as a sub editor, based in Sydney. One day during an evening shift I found a note on a fridge that said: \"Fancy an adventure in Laos?\" So, in April 2004 I was appointed English editor of the Vientiane Times.\n\nI moved to New Zealand in 2005, freelancing for the Christchurch Press before heading back to Sydney to join AAP as an online journalist. After a spell of freelancing, I joined Australian Penthouse in 2007 as a feature writer and editor before pivoting to the public sector magazine Government News.\n\nIn 2010, I moved to Asia, covering regional news for the Independent, Nikkei Asian Review and Global Post. My stories were broadcast and published in the New York Times, BBC World Service, CNBC and I contributed regularly to the Economist Intelligence Unit. \n\nI moved to the Netherlands in 2015, where I now work as a writer and producer. I help people tell stories. And sometimes I tell my own.",
