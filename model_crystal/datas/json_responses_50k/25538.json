    "summary": "Damian is an Associate Professor at the Eindhoven Univ. of Technology and Jheronimus Academy of Data Science, in s'Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. Damian completed his Ph.D. at VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands in March 2014 \"with mention\" one year in advance of a standard Ph.D. Contract. His research interests lie mainly in Complex Software and Data Architectures (with a focus on Data-Intensive Architectures, Cloud & Microservices as well as Machine-Learning & Computational Intelligence Architectures), Complex Software Architecture Properties (with a focus on Privacy & Security), and Empirical Software Engineering (with a focus on Organisational, Social, and Societal aspects with Qualitative Methods, social-networks analysis as well as Machine-Learning). Damian has published over 100+ papers in either Journals such as the Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) Journal, The ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) Journal, the IEEE Software Magazine or top software engineering conferences (such as ICSE or FSE) and top software architecture conferences (such as ECSA or WICSA). Also, Damian is an active contributor and lead research in many EU FP6, FP7, and H2020 projects, such as S-Cube, MODAClouds, SeaClouds, DICE, ANITA, DossierCLOUD, ProTECT, RADON, SODALITE, and more. In addition, Damian is IEEE Software and ACM TOSEM editorial board member, secretary of the TOSCA TC as well as secretary of the IFIP TC2, TC6, and TC8 WG on \u201cService-Oriented Computing\u201d.

            "title": "From Technical to Social Debt: Analyzing Software Development Communities using Social-Networks Analysis",
            "description": "An established body of knowledge discusses the importance of technical debt for product quality. In layman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms, Technical debt represents the current state of a software product as a result of accumulated technical decisions (e.g., architecture decisions, etc.). Techniques to study product quality limitations inherent to technical debt include technical data mining, code-analysis. \r\nNevertheless, quite recently we figured out that technical debt is only one face of the coin. In fact, social debt, the social and organisational counterpart to technical debt, plays a pivotal role in determining software product and process quality. Social debt reflects the social and organisational problems occurring in software development communities. Social debt reflects socio-technical decisions (e.g., adopting agile methods or outsourcing) and can compromise the quality of software development communities, eventually leading to  software failure.\r\n\r\nStudying and harnessing social debt is paramount to ensure successful software engineering in large-scale software development communities. This talk will focus on explaining the relations between technical and social debt while delineating techniques inherited from technical debt, organisational research and social networks research that could be rephrased to investigate social debt in software engineering (e.g., socio-technical code analysis, social-code graphs, socio-technical debt patterns, etc.).",

            "description": "Many architectural languages have been proposed in the last fifteen years, each one with the chief aim of becoming the ideal language for specifying software architectures. What is evident nowadays, instead, is that architectural languages are defined by stakeholder concerns. Capturing all such concerns within a single, narrowly focused notation is very difficult. At the same time it is also impractical to define and use a \"universal\" notation, such as UML. As a result, many domain specific notations for architectural modeling have been proposed, each one focussing on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modeling environment.\n\nThese considerations led us to propose DUALLy as a framework to create interoperability among ADLs themselves as well as UML. DUALLy allows architects to transform concepts of an architectural model into semantically equivalent concepts in other architectural models. DUALLy works at two abstraction levels: meta-modeling and modeling.\n\nDUALLy is implemented as an Eclipse plugin.\n\nThe main advantages DUALLy exposes can be summarized as follows:\n\nDUALLy works at two abstraction levels, providing a clear separation between model driven experts (the technical stakeholder) and software architects (the final users). The model transformation engine is completely hidden to a software architect, making DUALLy easy to use.\nDUALLy allows software archtiects to transform among formal ADLs and UML model-based notations and viceversa.\nSoftware architects can continue using familiar architectural notations and tools, and reusing existing architectural models.\nDUALLy permits both languages and tools interoperability.\nThe weaving models among two architectural notations are defined once, and reused for each model that will be made.",

Damian completed his Ph.D. at VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands in March 2014 \"with mention\" one year in advance of a standard Ph.D. Contract. His research interests lie mainly in Complex Software Architectures (with a focus on Data-Intensive Architectures, Cloud & Microservices as well as Machine-Learning & Computational Intelligence Architectures), Complex Software Architecture Properties (with a focus on Privacy & Security), and Empirical Software Engineering (with a focus on Organisational, Social, and Societal aspects with Qualitative Methods, social-networks analysis as well as Machine-Learning). Though still in his very early career, Damian has published over 100+ papers in either Journals such as the Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) Journal, The ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) Journal, the IEEE Software Magazine or top software engineering conferences (such as ICSE or FSE) and top software architecture conferences (such as ECSA or WICSA). Also, Damian has been an active contributor and lead research in many EU FP6, FP7, and H2020 projects, such as S-Cube, MODAClouds, SeaClouds, DICE, ANITA, DossierCLOUD, ProTECT, and more. In addition, Damian is IEEE Software editorial board member, secretary of the TOSCA TC as well as secretary of the IFIP TC2, TC6, and TC8 WG on \u201cService-Oriented Computing\u201d.",

                    "description": "An established body of knowledge discusses the importance of technical debt for product quality. In layman\u2019s terms, Technical debt represents the current state of a software product as a result of accumulated technical decisions (e.g., architecture decisions, etc.). Techniques to study product quality limitations inherent to technical debt include technical data mining, code-analysis. \nNevertheless, quite recently we figured out that technical debt is only one face of the coin. In fact, social debt, the social and organisational counterpart to technical debt, plays a pivotal role in determining software product and process quality. Social debt reflects the social and organisational problems occurring in software development communities. Social debt reflects socio-technical decisions (e.g., adopting agile methods or outsourcing) and can compromise the quality of software development communities, eventually leading to  software failure.\n\nStudying and harnessing social debt is paramount to ensure successful software engineering in large-scale software development communities. This talk will focus on explaining the relations between technical and social debt while delineating techniques inherited from technical debt, organisational research and social networks research that could be rephrased to investigate social debt in software engineering (e.g., socio-technical code analysis, social-code graphs, socio-technical debt patterns, etc.)",
