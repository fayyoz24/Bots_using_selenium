She drove international experimental research to achieve new breakthroughs and ideas at the interface between arts and engineering. Mechanical behaviour of complex anisotropic orthotropic materials was tested at all scales with innovative optical and mechanical techniques to analyse from deformation to failure behaviour.",

As a currently running case study, one of the Van Mekeren cabinets at Amerongen castle and the one at the Rijksmuseum are monitored by several Deformometric Kit -out-of-plan deformation sensors-placed at several spots on both cabinets in order to access reliable comparative measurements. Also the micro-climate inside the cabinets and surrounding the objects is monitored. Moreover, the global mechanical behaviour of the cabinet in Amerongen castle is monitored by full-field measurement using Digital Image Correlation. By monitoring these two cabinets during two year, substantial information is gained about the effect of the surrounding micro-climate on the mechanical response of the objects.",

Insight in the general condition of the objects was obtained by large-scale surveys of museum collections, supplemented by laboratory-based research, in-situ measurements of museum objects and numerical simulations. Cecilia supervised both the surveys of museum collections and the numerical simulation work. She was responsible for the experimental part. She set multiple international collaborations up, using ultrasounds and optical techniques. She was able to communicate with wide variety of professionals and succeeded to lead and set projects within the milestones",
