    "summary": "      \u201cBe the change that you wish to see in the world\u201d \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n      Growing up in the economic reformation period of Vietnam, I have witnessed many major changes to improve the livelihoods of the citizen. However, unsustainable development has paid the way for environmental degradation which is now a current headache of policy makers. \n\n      During my college years, I had a chance to participate in many organizations which enable youths to utilize their leadership capacity for the greater good of the society such as the Enactus team at Foreign Trade University Hanoi and Sponsor for Educational Opportunities Vietnam. These experience undoubtedly cemented my belief that aggregation of small changes can definitely create a great impact to our society by becoming a part of the social innovative trend, using positive power of technology and entrepreneurship to tackle the problem.\n\n      Currently, I am looking for a chance to take a deep dive in renewable technology and supply chain management as the next step of my career and I will show no hesitant to start from the bottom even if my background is general business and economics. \nFeel free to reach out should you have any question and thank you for spending time skimming my CV below!\n\n1. My Lifescore: 82/100\n\nI am experiencing success in multiple areas of life\nI am proficient at setting clear goals ( that's what helped you get where you are today)\nI am spending a majority of your time focused on getting ahead at work, but may have neglected fun and rejuvenating pastimes\n",
