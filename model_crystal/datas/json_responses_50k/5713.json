    "summary": "As a child, I was constantly intrigued not only by other cultures and languages, but also unknowingly back then by trade. One of my first memories, is going with my mother to the Costco superstore in our hometown in Mexico. This happened around the time NAFTA went into effect. I was fascinated by the diversity of the products and their journey from production to the shelf. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in International Business, and during my undergraduate years I developed a passion for languages and China.\n\nWith over 10 years of experience living and working with small to large companies in Mexico, in China and in The Netherlands, I have developed a deep understanding of the complete process of sourcing and buying in these markets and a strong network of Asian and European suppliers. I am passionate about leveraging this expertise in global sourcing and supply chain management to bring new products to market and make them available to consumers worldwide.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy travelling and exploring new cultures. In this way, staying current with global trends to better understand the needs and preferences of buyers around the world.",
