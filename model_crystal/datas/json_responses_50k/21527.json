    "summary": "In 2005 I graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, Amsterdam where my  final collection The Glorious End was nominated for the Gerrit Rietveld Academy Award, category design. I was the the  first fashion student in a decade to have been nominated for this prestigious price. After my graduation I have done various fashion projects in Berlin and Paris and have designed commercial collections in Shanghai. In 2009 I returned to Amsterdam to launch my eponymous label Quoc Thang (QT) during Amsterdam Fashion Week. Starting out as a label for both men and women, in 2010 QT focussed exclusively on menswear: bridging the gap between formal and casual. That same year a basic collection was launched together with a new brand identity. 2015 was the year of changes: a new design philosophy was applied and a new label named -No Where Man (NWM)- was presented. No Where Man focuses on sweat items in combination with niche prints and is a sustainable and made is Europe menswear label.\n\nQuoc Thang Studio works closely together with you. The QT Studio has designed and worked for other companies and of course for my two own labels. All these variety in work experiences has a common ground and that is creating collection imagery: the moment where all comes together and becomes 1 image- an image that visualizes and communicates. I am a creative and focussed designer with a commercial vision and I have a strong technical and sourcing qualities.\n\nMy work experiences are pretty divers, just like my interests; therefore I am very familiar with all different kind of aspects and needs of a fashion company, both commercially and creatively. For many years I\u2019ve worked for Dutch fashion designer Margriet Nannings- for her namesake women\u2019s label as well for her designer boutiques. For her men\u2019s shop I was e.g. responsible for the procurement of fashion labels like: Comme des Garcons, Paul Smith, Nicole Farhi, APC, Raf Simons etc. For her label I was responsible for the showroom and wholesale activities.\n\nAs a former teacher from the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, Miada in\nChongqing and the ROC in Amsterdam, it is in my nature to stimulate others to make the extra step: to motivate and inspire.",

By visiting the factory we work with, we develop a mutual understanding on topics like sustainability, morals and ethics. We can guarantee there is no child labour involved in producing our collection, nor any other inhumane circumstances.\n \nNo Where Man is refined and urban, the artworks are almost stilled, sophisticated. Various techniques are applied to place the different artworks; we choose the most suitable technique for each individual print to achieve the maximum result.

Vikings, fishermen, woodchoppers and adventurers are examples of these stereotypes. By using classic materials like sheer wool, lambs wool, tartans in combination with high tech materials, like light weight nylon or coated denim, a new and contemporary version of the primal man exists. Rough but always a gentleman.\n\n\nwww.quocthang.nl.",
