    "summary": "My Objective is to infuse A UNIQUE YET CONSCIOUS PERSPECTIVE, IMAGINATION and RELEVANCE to whatever we create. \n\nI am a Consultant Creative Director, Clothing, Furniture and Interior Designer with an extensive experience in the international fashion and creative industry, of which 20 years in the luxury segment. This long versatile cross-disciplinary experience has built my vocabulary and still fuels my inspiration.\n\nRefinement, innovation, and craftsmanship are the heart of my practice. Conceptual thinking, thorough research, and technique are my tools. I often use a narrative as a way to express concepts and strategies. \nMy search of excellence and balance is aimed at evoking emotions, triggering feelings, touching the deepest core of the person enter acting with [my] products. I search for tactile experiences to give rise to one\u2019s fantasy and imagination.\nI embrace work in progress, the effort and collective [team] excitement that lies in the process.\nMy ability is to connect intuition to thought and in depth analysis. This nourishes both creation as well as a synoptic development. I have deep personal knowledge of brand-building, [concept]design and industrial processes: I have physically taken part and interfered in proto- and sample development, as well as (industrially) manufacturing products on a small or much larger scale. My strength is to visualize and execute a vision or idea, as well as fully manage and direct creative ideas. I am a passionate and inspiring team player and/or leader.",
