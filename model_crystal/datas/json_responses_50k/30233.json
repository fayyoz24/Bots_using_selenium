    "summary": "I\u2019m a dynamic technical leader with in-depth knowledge of software development and architecture; promoter of Continuous Delivery practices and defender of Agile principles.\n\nI help others to unlock what's best in themselves. I guide team leads and managers on how to achieve collaboration, communication and empathy in their teams, and I drive a sense of unity in the organisation. I build the department's IT vision, and I inspire the people to make it their own.\n\nI believe a great leader is someone who sees that we can only be as good as people around us. Each one of us has a different background, different experiences, different skills. We're unique, and that's what makes us... Us. By surrounding ourselves with others, by interacting with others, we learn, we support, we help and get helped. We smile, we joke, we disagree, we overcome. We build relationships. We grow. We become a better version of ourselves.\n\nI share my great moments, and I share my mistakes. I also encourage others do to the same. In the complex world of business and software, we can only deliver if we trust each other, we have common goals, and we work together. I bring that mentality and I change the company culture by propagating those values.\n\nIf you want to get in touch, feel free to connect with me on or drop me a message on LinkedIn. I'm looking forward to it!",
