    "summary": "Hi, I'm Nontas!\n\nCurrently, I am working as a Software Engineer for ASML Netherlands. I belong to the Software and Platform Architecture group and my main interests are in Model-Driven Software Engineering, Testing, and Simulation.\n\nBefore joining ASML, I attended a two-year post-master program, called Software Technology PDEng, at the Eindhoven University of Technology. During this program, I worked on projects for major industries of the Netherlands, like Oc\u00e9-Canon, ASML, and Philips.\n\nI received my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras (Greece) in 2015. During my studies I specialized in Digital Signal and Image Processing.\n\nAs a student, I was a Microsoft Student Partner for several years. During this time, I led and co-founded the first and biggest offline student community of Microsoft in Greece (called StudentGuru Patras).\n\nFrom 2012 until 2015, I was an external partner of Greek Yellow Pages S.A. (a company that offers the most complete business directory in Greece), where I worked on the development of their mobile app for Windows devices.",

            "description": "One of the most common reasons for malpractice in medicine is misdiagnosis. The misdiagnosis of an illness may lead to significant delays of the treatment or even treatment for the wrong condition. The reasons of a misdiagnosis may be contributed to a series of factors by any of the involved parties, patient or doctor. The lack of time is such a factor. It\u2019s really amazing how little time a doctor will typically spend with a patient. In addition, according to interviewed doctors from several hospitals , it is common that the patients\u2019 medical records are not sorted properly, resulting in further time loss. Time is also wasted when a doctor needs to consult another colleague regarding a patient\u2019s case. The problems previously described led our team to develop the althaea system, a solution that can provide doctors, a radical new approach on a patient\u2019s health record system, with collaboration and portability features.\nTechnologies used to build Althaea, are (among others): Windows Azure (24/7/365 access to patients data in a fully secured infrastructure), Microsoft Surface 2.0 (giving doctors the ability to see patients' records in full HD with tons of details), Microsoft Lync (for a fully scalable collaboration infrastructure), Silverlight (web version), WPF (desktop & tablet version), Windows Phone 7 (mobile client)",

Our solution, is called PopUP and can be shortly described as a wearable airbag which is enabled when a fall is detected. In order to achieve this, it uses an accelerometer which constantly monitors the g-force values in all three axis and if their values are bigger than the predefined threshold, we can determine that the user is falling. When a fall occurs, the monitoring circuit (Arduino powered) triggers an electronic valve which releases, at once, all the CO2 gas (of a reusable bottle) and fills the airbag. Meanwhile, a mobile application (which is installed on user's cell phone) is constantly connected with the airbag (Arduino) through a bluetooth interface. When a fall occurs, a bluetooth signal is sent from Arduino and the application sends an SMS to a caregiver containing both the last known GPS coordinates of the user and his last known address and it also makes a phone call to one caregiver.",

In order to achieve this goal we created a website where the user/consumer can get and give information on the ingredients that are part of the products she buys. In order for someone to become a beNatural member all she has to do is to login to our site and voluntarily start providing information to our database about the ingredients of a product she bought. Through the help of many individuals we expect to provide a full scaled database over a period of time. With the help of the site, we can assist each beNatural member when in the process of purchase decisions. For this purpose, we created a mobile application that can be used almost anywhere (e.g. inside a supermarket). The user can ask the beNatural server about the characteristics of a certain product by providing its barcode. The system looks up the beNatural database and by consulting the lists of ingredients that belong to the user's profile, responds by advising on the purchase, according to environmental impact dimensions. Each user can create and edit her own profile which is constituted a) by the ingredients and products that she definitely and personally selects to avoid, b) by the lists with ingredients or products that are issued from respected organisms (i.e. EU Commission, WWF, Greenpeace) and she chooses to comply and c) by the standards, concerning the recycling of packages, she chooses to be informed.",
