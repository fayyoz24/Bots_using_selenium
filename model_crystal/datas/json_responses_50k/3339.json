Our project identifies what we call SDG+ goals, which include both basic and higher needs such as creativity, family life, health, or self-confidence. Based on these SDG+ goals, we select high potential social impact startups to whom we then deliver sustained growth through a curated set of growth service partners and a strong foundry model. \n\nAs such, Goodforce Labs does not only contribute to reducing social issues by incubating startups that have these at their core, but our model also allows us to create internationally competitive role models for local communities.",
