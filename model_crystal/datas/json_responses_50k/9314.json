    "summary": "As a programme facilitator for the Foresight4Food team at ECI, I contribute to advancing the global learning and knowledge brokering agenda of the Foresight for Food Systems Transformation (FoSTr) programme and facilitate strategic engagement among Foresight4Food\u2019s diverse range of stakeholders.\n\nI contributed to Cordaid's aim to realising sustainable livelihoods within inclusive and sustainable food systems. As such, I collaborate with Cordaid country teams to develop propositions, intervention strategies and operational knowledge on climate resilient agri-food systems. \n\nWith 2.5 years working for an inclusive agricultural sector in Myanmar, I am passionate about facilitating local and international partnerships for economic empowerment. With Myanmar currently under the military coup, my thoughts are with the Myanmar people facing the struggle of a lifetime for democracy.\n\nI graduated from the Wageningen University Master International Development with the specialisation Sociology of Development and a minor in Conflict and Disasterstudies. My MSc was finalised with the distinction 'cum laude'\u200b. My final thesis was called \"Encountering and Shaping Youth in Post-Conflict Liberia\", a case-study on youth-oriented empowerment interventions in Liberia.",
