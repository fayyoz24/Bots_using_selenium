    "summary": "As a postdoctoral researcher at Oklahoma State University (OSU), I am passionate about exploring the applications of nanomedicine and targeted therapy for canine cancer patients. With a PhD in Veterinary Biomedical and Clinical Sciences from OSU and a Master of Veterinary Science from Bombay Veterinary College, I have over nine years of research and teaching experience in veterinary and wildlife sciences. I have developed skills in radioimmunoassay, cell biology, and molecular biology, and have contributed to multiple publications and presentations on focused ultrasound, tumor microenvironment, and immunological effects. I have also received awards for my outstanding research, such as the Young Investigator Award and the WFC Student Research Award. I am motivated by the mission of advancing the field of veterinary oncology and improving the quality of life of animals and humans. I bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I have worked in different settings and cultures, and speak three languages. I am eager to collaborate with other researchers and clinicians to develop novel and effective therapies for cancer.",
