    "summary": "Thanks to my Bachelor degree in Erasmus University of Rotterdam, it is glaring that reviewing macroeconomics events and analyzing financial markets are endeavors I would like to engage in even more. While working in Aton as an analyst in Wealth Management department, I developed a strong interest in the field of capital and debt markets and I found this very intriguing and interesting, specifically reviewing researches of well-known investment banks, making portfolio decision based on data set and communicating with clients. Aton has $7 billion assets under management and I was responsible for $20 million of these assets directly and $150 million indirectly. Excellent results in 2020 and 2021 in terms of returns gave me the confidence that hard work, stress resistance, good teamwork and a bit of luck would lead to success. Furthermore, it should be mentioned how team cooperation is important for achieving an excellent results. I am grateful that I was surrounded by highly-skilled professionals with international experience. They helped me to understand the industry from the inside and were always ready to share their knowledge. It allowed me to develop as a professional by adding more practical skills to my theoretical knowledge from the University, especially using Bloomberg terminal in order to obtain a various set of useful data that assists me in decision making.",
