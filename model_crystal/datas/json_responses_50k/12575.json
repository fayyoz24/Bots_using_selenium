    "summary": "I am a young enthusiastic event and project manager with a background in Chinese Studies and linguistics.\u00a0\nWhen approaching a new event/project, I like working with a structured plan and taking care of all the details that might contribute to guarantee a most pleasant experience for all the attendees and users involved. Also, I am a very artistic person (I paint, practise Chinese calligraphy and play the harp) and I love the possibility to give freedom to this part of my personality also when I work, thanks to the endless opportunities that project management offers.\u00a0\n\nCurrently, I am working at Unknown Group,\u00a0an innovation agency based in Rotterdam. At Unknown Group, we unlock business opportunities, connecting startups and corporates. As an Event Manager, my role is to execute local innovation events in the Netherlands and to manage and coordinate the international Get in the Ring events, which are part of our global pitching competition for startups. As Head of Competitions, I also manage the themed competitions of Get in the Ring, which are focused on specific industries.\n\nThe several experiences I had in Asia alimented my innate curiosity to study social, linguistic and cultural differences at an academic level. Being Head of Competitions and Event Manager at Unknown Group is for me a great occasion to keep this curiosity alive, thanks to the daily interaction with our global network of innovators and entrepreneurs and a way to apply my academic and analytical mindset to project management.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",
