    "summary": "Currently I\u2019m studying the Organization Studies (GSMI): Organizing for Global Social Challenges (organisatiewetenschappen) at Tilburg university. Before this I was employed by EY, as an administrative contractor for the Eindhoven & Amsterdam office (audit planning department) and the domestic planning of the ACR service line. As a graduate of International Business & Management (BBA), I gained a profound interest in sustainability and the circular economy. And my primary goal is to contribute to a more sustainable (and circular) business environment. Throughout the duration of my studies I found out that I am organised, hardworking, dedicated, passionate and eager to learn. Besides this I experienced that I don\u2019t particularly have the nine-to-five mentality as I am willing to go \u2018the extra mile\u2019 to increase the work quality, and don\u2019t mind the associated long hours on exciting projects. The studies thought me to work in teams and solve problems as innovative as possible. I discovered this through a project (organised by the University of applied sciences) in Los Angeles, and a six month internship in Sydney, Australia. In group assignments I find myself in the position of managing/leading a group, as people see me as confident, trustworthy and hardworking. These skills provided structure to my (still young) professional life, as well as my personal life. And it also allows me to stay focused on both my academic and personal goals. In my personal life, I enjoy travelling and broadening my horizon. In addition, I like socialising with others and expanding my network. I am always working on my personal development through (critical) feedback from my surroundings and self-reflection.",

The primary focus aimed on reduction of vehicle use across the park, as well as contributing to providing a solution to the parking issues and at the same time contribute to CO2 reductions on commuting and business kilometres. \n\nFour topics were discussed, namely; The foreign approach on stimulating sustainable mobility, the current situation across the industrial park, the sustainable mobility approaches. And lastly, the impact on both the environment (in terms of CO2 emissions) as well as financial (dis)advantages associated with several, more sustainable, forms of mobility \n\nIt showed that driving electrically (besides the vehicle purchase) does not need to be more expensive than the fossil fuel vehicles. Besides this, the comparison with public transport was made, of which the busses drive on Green gas, and showed to have a lower negative (CO2) impact. It also showed that measures like a sharing network of electric vehicles, or organisational approaches on financial measures towards stimulating other, more sustainable, forms of mobility, which also know their financial advantages to both the organisations and the individual (the employee)",
