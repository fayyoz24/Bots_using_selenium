However, literature shows that individuals with an intellectual disability have the lowest collective employment rates. According to various studies, work provides validation of the self through the ability of earning money and being independent. Therefore, there is a need to increase the work participation of people with ID. One possible aid for supporting people with a mental disability is the use of technological advancements. \n\nTechnological advancements are increasing rapidly and are portraying the current world\u2019s characteristics. Information and communications technology (ICT) is getting more integrated in our biological systems and daily lives and is an asset for supporting people with disability. Various developments, such as apps for smartphones, smartwatches and tablets, robotics, mobile technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) play an important role in the daily lives of human beings.\n\nThere is a need to bring the world of technology together with the world of work participation and inclusion. The different views from these two worlds should be aligned in order to create a better understanding of the possibilities that technology can offer and to create awareness regarding the needs and barriers that people with MID experience in finding and maintaining a job. Therefore, the aim of the present  study is to examine in what way technological advancements can aid people with intellectual disabilities with finding and maintaining employment. ",

            "description": "Intuitive feelings of the GPs play an important role while diagnosing their patients, but it has never been explored for mental illnesses and patients with suicide risks due to depression. There are more than 200 classified forms of mental illnesses and are ranked as the leading causes of disability (disability adjusted life years- DALYs) worldwide. One of the most occurring mental disorder is depression and has the highest prevalence and incidence rates, causing the highest amount of disability on a global scale. Depression can lead to various limitations for the patient and in worst case scenarios it leads to suicide. A need for accurate diagnosis and treatment for depression is required in order to reduce the burden of disease. During consultations, the GPs deal with uncertainty and unpredictability in complex situations. As a result of time pressure, and the difficulty of diagnosing depression, GPs diagnose their patients based on a combination of analytical reasoning and intuitive assessment. The concept of intuitive feelings has been explored for a long time within the professional field of nursing and there is an increasing amount of evidence on the use of intuitive feelings by physicians.  The majority of the research puts focus on the use of intuition for the identification of straightforward physical problems, such as heart problems or serious infections. However, the role of the GP\u2019s intuition regarding suicide risk due to depression has never been studied among doctors and, therefore, is poorly understood. The main objective of the present study is to gain insights regarding intuition and to understand how GPs develop and enhance their intuitive feelings for the recognition of suicide risks caused by depression. Furthermore, this study aims to identify influencing factors on intuition that can be taught as part of a GP\u2019s education in order to enhance the use of these feelings.",

This agency underwent organizational and methodological changes in order to be able to provide the necessary care for the enduring safety of the children under its protection. Due to the organisational changes and decentralisation, responsibilities of the team managers shifted, which made it necessary for team managers to be able to fulfil their roles as team managers accordingly. Reflection has proven to be useful to achieve this. Therefore, video-based reflection-intervention (VBR-intervention) was executed at YPAA with the team managers and consisted of four aims. The first aim was to bring to light the good practices and occurring issues among team manager and validate them. The second aim was to stimulate an active learning position. The third aim was to create a shared view between the team managers on how to fulfill their role as a team manager. The last aim was to enhance the work methods of the team managers. A pilot study was conducted that evaluated the first two aims of this method among 3 team managers. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the VBR-intervention regarding the last two aims.",

This has been framed from a policy perspective in the term \u2018Responsible Research and Innovation\u2019 (RRI). In the Netherlands, the Rathenau Institute for Research and Debate on Science & Technology is engaged in this topic. One of their tasks is to give advice on science and technology matters to the government. The Rathenau Institute commissioned eleven students of VU University to research RRI within the iGEM student competition. In this competition, teams of later-stage students in synthetic biology create a new biological system in 6 months. Important in this is that the projects do not only focus on technical work, but instead the students also learn about the impact of their innovation. The aim of our study was to gain insights in the current practices of RRI within the iGEM student competition. For this, the student team conducted a literature study and ten semi-structured interviews with members, students, supervisors, and others, of the iGEM- community.",

Predicting equations are used because indirect calorimetry is time and money consuming. Furthermore, indirect calorimeters are not always available in every hospital or institution. Unfortunately, commonly used equations for predicting the total energy expenditure are not accurate, therefore the metabolic monitor is used in order to measure the total energy expenditure. To improve the currently used equations for predicting the energy expenditure (EE) targets without the need for a metabolic monitor, we hypothesized that the produced carbon dioxide measured by the mechanic ventilator can be used to determine the energy expenditure in these patients. We therefore compared energy expenditure in a prospective observational study. The comparison of energy expenditure was made between energy expenditure as measured with indirect calorimetry, using the Deltatrac\u00ae II metabolic monitor as the golden standard, to energy expenditure using calculated from the VCO2 values retrieved from the mechanical ventilator, the respiratory quotient of the received nutrition and the formula of Weir.",

                    "description": "Despite economic growth, 20% of the Dutch adult population can be considered as socially vulnerable. Vulnerable adults face persistent problems across a number of life domains relating to for example health and well-being, living conditions, economic status, or employment. These problems hinder people to actively participate in society, for example in finding a job, and place a large burden on health and social care budgets of municipalities. To support the healthy development of socially vulnerable adults, municipalities, charity organisations, and care and sports organisations increasingly invest in the development and implementation of sports programs. These sport programs are often seen as a means to bring about social change because of the ability of sport to teach life lessons, and to contribute to character building, positive moral reasoning and life skill development. This proposal builds on current practice and research in this field, which has raised new and important questions. Our aim is to investigate and enhance the societal impact of these programs by answering the following research questions: \n\n1. (How) do newly learned skills and competences in a sport context transfer to other life domains, like work, education, personal relationships, and a healthy life style? \n\n2. What are the critical elements of sport programs that facilitate the transfer of new skills and competences to other life domains? \n\n3. How can sport programs be more strongly embedded in an integral strategy at the municipal level to facilitate the transfer of new skills and competences to other life domains? \n\n4. What are the societal costs and benefits of sport programs for vulnerable adults?",

These advancements are integrating new areas in the lives of people in regard with their house or work. \n\nWithin the heterogeneous group of people with mental disabilities, those with a mild intellectual disability (MID) have a relative low work participation. The UWV has commissioned the Athena Institute to investigate what possibilities technological innovations can offer in increasing work participation of people with MID and the continuity of employment. The aim of the current study is to explore the possibilities that technologies can provide in finding and maintaining jobs for people with mild intellectual disabilities. \n\nA systematic literature review, interviews with various stakeholders, focus group discussions and backcasting sessions were organised in order to answer the main research question.",

A lot of decision-support tools are being currently researched, but in practice often the more intuitive reasoning can consciously or sub-consciously prevail. Intuitive feelings of the general practitioners (GP) play an important role in the diagnostic process, however, these feelings have never been explored within the context of diagnosing depression and recognising suicide risk. The incidence and prevalence rates of mental health issues, especially of depression, follow an increasing trend worldwide and, therefore, requires more attention. Due to the subjective interpretations of the GP, the two widely established classification systems (DSM-5 and ICD-10) can lead to the misdiagnosis. \n\nLiterature has shown that the diagnostic process of the GP is based on an analytical and a non-analytical pathway. The first pathway is evidence-based in which objective observations are made, whereas the second pathway is characterised by an uneasy feeling, making the GPs concerned about a possible adverse outcome. In medical decision-making, practitioners should find a balance between the aforementioned pathways in order to avoid diagnostic errors. Thus, in order to improve the use of intuition for the process of decision-making, we need to study it with which the global burden of disease can be reduced. \n\nThe main objective of this study was to gain insights into intuitive feelings and understand what factors are influencing the development intuition over time. A qualitative approach was adopted in the form of interviews that utilised the method of mind-map construction based on the socio-ecological model of health. \n\nThe perceptions and personal narratives of the GPs helped answering the main research question: \"How do general practitioner's intuitive feelings develop over time with regard to the recognition of suicide risks caused by depression?\"",
