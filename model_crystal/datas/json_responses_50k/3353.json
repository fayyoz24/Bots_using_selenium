    "summary": "A proven professional with 6+ years of work experience in business development, strategy, and project management roles in the engineering and renewable energy sectors. I have built strong communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills by working and studying in different countries (India, Oman, Dubai, and the Netherlands). My colleagues and customers appreciate me for my agile thinking and persistence.\n\nOver the last six years, I successfully coordinated the delivery of complex engineering and renewable energy projects and the launch of new high-technology engineering equipment in the market, with different internal and external stakeholders. I was able to deliver results across countries as well as coach and develop a team that could do the same.\n\nI am an MBA graduate from TIAS Business School, the Netherlands with a focus on Sustainability, Corporate Strategy, and Supply Chain & Operations Management. I would like to serve in job roles related to strategy, business development, or project management where I can utilize my business acumen, project management, customer engagement, and stakeholder management expertise.\n\nIf you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or email at nujra7791@gmail.com.",
