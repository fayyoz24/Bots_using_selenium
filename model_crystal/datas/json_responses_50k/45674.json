This European funded project  aims to reduce the unwanted airport time with 30 minutes and to improve the passenger experience.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative research are conducted to determine the real problem passengers might experience during their journey. Followed by creative sessions to obtain input and be inspired for the design process. The graduation project also includes several business cases to explorer if this service is interesting for KLM to invest in and how it should be implemented if KLM wants to continue the project. \n\nWith this door-to-door luggage service I succeeded to reduce the unwanted airport time with the 30 minutes and to improve the experience of passengers, specifically who travel by public transport to the airport.\n\nDuring the project I was part of the Product Development team of passenger services.",
