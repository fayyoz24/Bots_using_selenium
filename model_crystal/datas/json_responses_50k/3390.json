The model had good accuracy for the D-Band and E-Band.\n\u2022\tThe research was completed and is submitted to the AGU Radio Science Journal. \n\u2022\tFurther, an investigation to validate the concept of frequency scaling for D-Band and G-band was carried out. The results generated will be submitted to a high quartile scientific publication. \n\u2022\tAt present, the synthetic storm technique is being tested out for the Q-Band satellite-terrestrial propagation using the data collected from Alphasat mission.",

The proposed consisted of two QHAs, each fed with GCPW-QWPDs integrated feed.\n\u2022\tThe design complies with the GNSS-R system requirements by yielding high port isolation (>30dB), wide beam coverage, multi-angled 3dB axial ratio, and enables multi-constellation remote sensing. Besides, the configuration radiates proficiently (efficiency > 0.9) and provides an unprecedented theory to facilitate normal mode of operation with QHA.\n\u2022\tThis work introduces a peculiar approach to compute the axial ratio for asymmetric configurations. The design was fabricated and measured at the Antennas and Signal Processing Lab, University of Surrey. This development of this work was fulfilled in collaboration with the 5G Innovation Centre, UK, under the supervision of Prof. Rahim Tafazolli and Dr. Mohsen Khalily, and is extended for publication at IEEE communication transactions on antenna and propagation.\n",
