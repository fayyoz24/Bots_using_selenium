    "summary": "I am a critical social researcher, artist, and educator with a background in legal and cultural research combining qualitative and quantitative methods, teaching, team leadership, photography, post-production, and social media strategizing. I have been privileged enough to attend the top ranking universities in Canada (Toronto - BA) and the Netherlands (Utrecht - MA), respectively. During my academic years, I worked for academic, non-profit, and local governmental institutions where I learned the foundations of my research, outreach, and leadership skills. Individually, I've done freelancing within the creative industry in Canada an Europe for 8 years. From that, I learned to self-manage, market, communicate, and strategize effectively. My freelancing, in turn, has given me the interpersonal and savvy social media experience to enhance my capacities as a researcher and educator within organizational and institutional settings. What I offer is a critical and creative approach based upon a strong foundation of theory, practice, experience, and ambition for personal growth and societal change.",
