    "summary": "I have extensive knowledge and experience in systems for identity management and security, often involving smart card technology, but increasingly mobile-based.  I worked a lot with cryptography and Public Key Infrastructures.\n\nCurrently, I am working mostly on implementations of the new mobile driving license, based on ISO/IEC 18013-5. I'm involved as well with the European Identity Wallet, which will be based (among other) on the same standard. I am an active member of the ISO working group that created this standard and is currently working on additional standards that broaden the scope to other document types and additional use cases.\n\nIn the past, I worked on electronic passports and other identity documents, e-ticketing systems in public transport, electronic fee collection (or road pricing systems), EMV and other protocols from the payment world, NFC and mobile payments, and related systems. I also spent a lot of time on the European Smart Tachograph system, co-authoring the technical Appendix 11 to the Implementing Regulation as well as internal and external documentation related to the European Root Certificate Authority. \n\nI have done projects relating to designing and testing systems for identity management and security, but I am mainly a technical author, consultant and trainer in these areas. I have good knowledge of and experience with international standards related to these technologies, such as those from ISO/IEC, GlobalPlatform, ETSI, RFC etcetera. The same goes for system specifications such as Annex 1B / 1C (digital / smart tachograph), Doc 9303 (electronic passport), SDOA (Dutch e-ticketing) and many others. I was involved in international standardisation in the area of electronic fee collection and am currently contributing to standards for mobile driving license and mobile identification documents in general. Lastly, I have written many system specifications and test specifications for customers.",
