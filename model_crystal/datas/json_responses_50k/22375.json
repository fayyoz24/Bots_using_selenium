Through activities such as surfing and paddle boarding, our highly qualified instructors look to generate and provide a feeling of normalcy for our participants. By alleviating apprehension and fear around an activity, our FREE charity events and surf camps help to empower those who are disabled, reassuring them that there is no obstacle that they cannot overcome. By using the ocean, we are able to create uplifting personal experiences for not only the participant, but their families as well. At Ocean Cure, we understand that a disability/impairment is not only tough for the body in which it inhabits, but those around it also.  By involving participants AND their families, the waves extend beyond one individual, and into their loved ones to build a positive relationship and a common bond amongst families who are sharing similar experiences.\n\nhttp://www.ocean-cure.org/"
