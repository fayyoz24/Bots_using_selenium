Mostly the topics are about Finance, Strategy, entrepreneurship and business economics.\n\nGiving lectures for groups of students. Coaching them to let them finish an entrepreneurial plan. Helping them to initiate ideas, to develop it in a quick scan and training them acquisition skills, but also presentation skills (elevator pitch), financial management, structure to finalize it into a plan.\n\nBusiness economics is more basic. I will be teaching several aspects like estate planning, finance and playing an investment game. I'm constantly looking for working places where students can learn things in practice. So when you're interested, let me know.\n\nStenden is a very innovative organization. Stenden uses Problem Based Learning and is worldwide frontrunning in teaching competencies.\n\nFinally I'm setting up a new minor called International Sustainable Entrepreneurship. Students will have to work in a foreign (development) country for 6 months at for example a microfinance institution (MFI).",
