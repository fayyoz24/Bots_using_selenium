This department fulfills DNB\u2019s role of deposit insurer and national resolution authority. In this role I leveraged on my broad experience in the areas of policy development and international relations.\n\nKey areas on which I contributed included the development of funding strategies, resolution tools, risk sharing arrangements, communication strategies, governance frameworks and other measures that not only help strengthen the protection provided to depositors, but also enable orderly bank resolution while minimizing public costs. This is essential to safeguard financial stability.\n\nI had a strong focus on European cooperation, not only when it comes to coperation between deposit insurers and resolution authorities, but also concerning the future design of a scheme, system or mechanism for deposit insurance within the Banking Union.\n\nA further issue that had my particular interest was the frontier where financial innovation meets the regulatory framework and the design of our financial safety nets. It confronts deposit insurers and resolution authorities not only with challenges, but also many opportunities.\n\nWithin the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI), I was a member of the Core Principles and Guidance Council Committee (CPRCC) and the European Regional Committee (ERC).\n\nWithin the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI), I was a member of the EU Committee and the Banking Union Working Group (BUWG).\n\nI regulary contributed to various (ad-hoc) committees and working groups within the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).",
