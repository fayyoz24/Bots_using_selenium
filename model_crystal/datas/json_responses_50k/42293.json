EDUCEN is a consortium consisting of 10 participant organizations from 7 different countries.\n\nCentral to the EDUCEN project is the idea that cultures, the \u2019soft infrastructure\u2019, hold important assets to disaster-affected communities, disaster managers and disaster-affected people alike. Our premise is that culture and cultural diversity are not just a challenge creating barriers but are, in fact, reservoirs of assets that people have to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, cope with and adapt to disaster risks\u2013 cognitively and practically.\n\nThe overarching aim of EDUCEN is to build on existing European networks and identify actions to develop and support culture and cultural diversity. The networking and support actions, which are central in EDUCEN\u2019s approach, will increase the effectiveness of DRR design by including culture as a valuable component in all phases of disaster risk management: prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response and reconstruction. This will contribute to more resilient cities that can meet the needs of their various cultures and subcultures during disaster relief, hopefully leading to a lower number of fatalities while also reducing reaction time when disaster strikes.\n\nThis will contribute to more resilient cities that are able to meet the needs of their various cultures and subcultures during disaster relief hopefully leading to a lower number of fatalities while also reducing reaction time when disaster strikes.",

The ENSURE approach starts from recognising that for all considered hazards, most of the damages and most of the vulnerabilities arise from the territory, including artefacts, infrastructures and facilities.
