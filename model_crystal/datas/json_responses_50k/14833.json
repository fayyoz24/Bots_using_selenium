    "summary": "Entrepreneurship, technology and innovation are subjects where my passion lies. A solid background in Mechanical and System and Control Engineering from the TU Delft enables me to make the connection between engineering and manufacturing disciplines and the world of automation, robotics and data analyses. \n\nIn my current role as project leader of automation and data analyses related projects within Royal IHC, I am concentrating my efforts to find solutions for the shipbuilding and manufacturing processes to increase the quality, cost-effectiveness and flexibility by a technological and business driven approach. This role does not only require me to be excellent in my Engineering discipline, but to be a good motivator and sparring partner as well. \n\nI firmly believe in  the strength of small multidisciplinary teams which go beyond the borders of their own business too look for solutions and game changers which can make the difference for the future in business and industry. I am always open to meet inherently curious and interesting people.",
