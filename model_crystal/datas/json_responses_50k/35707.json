    "summary": "I'm the Marketing & Admissions Manager at SILC Academy, known for experiential learning programmes in Switzerland and France. I hold a Master's in International Business Communication and International Marketing, graduated with honours in 2021, and have a keen interest in leadership, online/offline marketing, and SEA, especially Google Ads and Meta.\n\nIn my role, I oversee a diverse marketing function covering online/offline channels, website development, sales of camps, and agent relations, among other tasks. I also help shape SILC's brand strategy. Every summer, I immerse myself in the vibrant world of our camps, where I oversee large cohorts of students and staff.\n\nThis experience fuels my unyielding enthusiasm for marketing, leadership, SEO, SEA, and design. I thrive in dynamic, multicultural teams, and my professional journey has traversed various countries and sectors, encompassing high-end hospitality, academia, education, and events.\n\nMy insatiable appetite for new knowledge, eagerness to explore fresh opportunities, and readiness to tackle emerging challenges make me a forward-looking professional who is always striving to enhance my skill set. I\u2019m equally passionate about forging connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds, particularly in unique and transformative settings.\n\nLet\u2019s connect and explore how we can collaborate to drive innovation and growth within the world of marketing.\n\n#marketing #sales #data #ads",

During that time, the new SHMS students get to meet their fellow colleagues. The host leaders work in guiding Host groups as well as assisting the Host Coordinators in organizing and conducting events, trainings, and administration during and after the Study Start Week (orientation week) for the first year students.  Each group consists of 10-15 new students headed by 2 Hosts (current Stenden students). As a Host leader, I supervised around 10 Host groups. This means that I was responsible for approximately 150 individuals. My tasks were to make sure that everything went according to the planning and when students had issues that were beyond the understanding of their Hosts, they were able to address me.",

It is one of the two beach restaurants with a permanent status on the beach. The restaurant was also awarded to be \"The Best Beach Restaurant in the Netherlands for 2017\".  During my time at this astonishing workplace, I got to learn about the finest hospitality. I learnt how important it was to appreciate the presence of our guests. I obtained skills that cannot be taught at school such as how to manage inquiries that might be obscure. Also, I learnt how to work efficiently together with my team even when it is busy at the workplace to make sure that everything goes smoothly. When it comes to what I enjoyed the most working in such a lovely restaurant was the fact that I had the freedom to talk to our guests, to make sure that they were having a peaceful lunch/ dinner - exactly what they came for: to relax and be happy.",
