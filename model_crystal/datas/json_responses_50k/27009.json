    "summary": "A person who brings efficiency and creativity to unlock all opportunities and challenges. I have cultivated strong skills related to Android/Kotlin Development and Project Management in the last 10+ years, working on both small and big teams, mostly based on an Agile workflow. I have a strong desire to accomplish my deeper goals of releasing the highest quality apps for my customers, giving support even outside of work if needed, as well as implementing cost-effective and streamlined operational process that benefit my company and also the stakeholders. Due to my 5 years at 100 Grams IO working on PSNGR, which is a mileage tracking application, and my experience with Vidyo, I consider that my core strength in Android Development is in Location Services, and Video Streaming/Image processing. But I am a fast learner, which is willing and wants to improve his code ethics, efficiency, and learn as much new things as possible, a new challenge is always welcomed.\nThe last 3 years, while working on Xelion, I was concentrated on Communication, improving my knowledge of SIP, WebRTC. Our plan is to make one of the best/most optimised communication apps. And with the inclusion of coroutines, databindings, dependency injection and many more, we believe that our goal is withing our grasp.",
