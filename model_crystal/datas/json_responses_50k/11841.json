The two floors are connected with each other by the use of an open staircase. \nOutside terrace can be visited even when it's a little windy and rainy (Istanbul is quite rainy every now and then), because it's covered by glas in between a wooden structure.\n\nFacade of lower floor is kept in tact, because of its historical value. Facade of top floor is new. Current one is in a bad shape and I wanted to make sure this building will catch some attention from visitors on top of the Galata Tower.",
