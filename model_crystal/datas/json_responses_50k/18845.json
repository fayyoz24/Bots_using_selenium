This work aims to bridge this gap by characterizing the mechanisms and wake dynamics of a cylinder with a flexible splitter plate. Measurements are made at different flow speeds to characterize the behavior of the wake, and Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) are used in flow diagnostic tools such as Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) experiments. Shake-The-Box (STB) is a novel LPT tracking algorithm that uses time-resolved experimental data to predict future tracer particle locations. The raw experimental data was processed to perform statistical analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition, and spectral analysis to provide insights to meet the thesis objective.",

The proper design of a wind farm is crucial in maximizing the power output (and hence, the cost-effectiveness) of the farm. Owing to the fact that wind turbines generate electricity by disrupting the airflow in their vicinity, the wind turbines downstream receive wind at lower speeds than the upstream turbines. Given the constraints, there is an optimal solution of a wind farm that produces the maximum power. This solution is arrived at by implementing greedy and random search algorithms.",

The wire subject to the flow is then cooled, the corresponding voltage necessary to maintain the temperature of the flow can be used to quantify the flow velocity. On the other hand, PIV is an imaging based technique where a small section of the flow is illuminated using lasers. A high-speed camera then captures successive images of the flow, which can then be used to find average displacement using cross-correlation. Using the pulse width separation of the laser and average displacement using cross-correlation, the flow contours can be reconstructed using interrogation windows.",

Plotting the lift and drag polar, change in transition point along the chord, etc. \n- Airfoil Improved Design: Optimizing chosen NACA airfoil to improve the glide ratio. This is also done manually in XFOIL. \n- Laminar Separation Bubble: At low Reynolds numbers the airfoil may develop a so-called laminar separation bubble.

In general, a winglet produces a force, which has a forward component because of the normal wash produced by the circulation over the wing tip. This forward component acts as a thrust force reducing the aircraft-induced drag, which is about 40% of the total drag in the cruise and 80\u201390% of the total drag in the second climb segment. Although adding a winglet to a wing may be attractive from the perspective of aerodynamic performance it also affects the wing's structural weight.\nTherefore, a pure aerodynamic optimization may result in a winglet with an unacceptable weight penalty. This additional weight may alleviate the beneficial effect of drag reduction. Hence, the design of a non-planar wing is a real multidisciplinary design optimization process. \n\nThe assignment is divided into three parts, namely; \n- The first part discusses the effects of the winglet on the induced drag and normal wash velocity.\n- The second part of the assignment assesses the effects of cant angle of the induced drag and bending moment, etc. \n- The last part of the assignment optimizes the wing/let system by reducing the objective function.",

Low cost carriers (LCC) emphasize on reducing operational costs while maximizing profits. This is achieved but cutting all additional amenities and focusing on core customer needs only. \n\nThis minimum cost model, however, has brought certain environmental and social challenges. Apart from the obvious emissions of the aircraft, the LCCs are growing faster than the aviation industry is in general, and therefore also faster than the infrastructure intended for aviation. This means that new airport constructions are needed, and existing airports are running overtime to accommodate the traffic. Socially, it is seen that the economic benefit gained locally due to the increase in travel is not universally applicable, which means that all regions might not see the promised growth from the new LCC routes and airports. LCCs also pose ethical questions in their treatment of employees. The morality of the LCC model is analyzed using the ethical theory of consequentialism, which states that anything can be judged as morally right or wrong based on its consequence.",

This, however, comes with an engine weight and size penalty. Propellers are inherently more efficient than turbofan engines. This is achieved by getting rid of the engine shroud. On the other hand, the aerodynamic phenomenon is now more complicated and due to the absence of the shroud and the engine sound is unconfined. \n\nDue to the complex nature of the aerodynamic interactions, a numerical simulation becomes unfeasible, therefore, experimental simulations are an effective tool to understand the complex flow phenomenon at a relatively cheaper cost and with the added benefit of collecting data and validating some numerical models. Thus the objective is the perform an experimental simulation and use the data to understand aerodynamic properties.",
