It also showed me how relaxing it is to paint and how it allows me to completely clear my mind and experience pure joy. Even if you think you cannot draw or paint, you can! Everybody has their own creativity inside. All you need is some courage to unleash that creativity and nurture it. Therefore, my mission with Creativithee is to unleash creativity among young professionals through watercolor, so they are able to truly relax and de-stress from their busy lives.\n\nWith Creativithee, I offer (virtual) in-company mindful painting workshops that help people relax by doing meditative exercises with watercolor painting. It\u2019s not about creating a masterpiece, but about finding relaxation, learning something new and stimulating your own creativity. I\u2019ve mainly given workshops at companies as Pinterest, o9 Solutions and ABN Amro bank to employees with different backgrounds and no artistic experience, who experienced the mental benefits of mindful painting. It\u2019s really for everyone to join!\n\nGo to www.creativithee.com for more information on company workshops!\n\nIn my own works, I currently create abstract expressionism art with acrylics based on my life experiences and lessons.\n\nFollow me for inspiration: \nwww.instagram.com/creativithee\n\n#creativewellness #employeewellbeing #worklifebalance #everybodyiscreative #clearyourmind #destress #abstractart",
