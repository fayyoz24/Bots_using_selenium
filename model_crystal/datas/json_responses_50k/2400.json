Daarmee respecteert en volgt SAIL de noodzakelijke maatregelen vanuit de bevoegde instanties. Met de nieuw aangekondigde maatregelen, inclusief een verbod op grote evenementen tot 1 september a.s., is het onmogelijk geworden om SAIL Amsterdam 2020 te organiseren. In zorgvuldige afstemming met de Gemeente Amsterdam, Port of Amsterdam, Provincie Noord-Holland en andere betrokken partners is de lastige beslissing genomen om SAIL pas weer te organiseren in 2025. \n\nWe bedanken iedereen die de afgelopen tijd zo hard heeft gewerkt aan de voorbereiding van #SAIL2020. \u201cMet pijn in het hart zijn we gedwongen deze beslissing te nemen, waarvan we overtuigd zijn dat dit de enig juiste is\u201d, aldus Arie Jan de Waard, voorzitter Stichting SAIL Amsterdam. \u201cAan alle liefhebbers die reikhalzend naar SAIL hebben uitgekeken, vragen we begrip voor deze uitzonderlijke situatie. Dank aan alle Tall Ships, het varend erfgoed, schippers, bemanningen, sponsoren, partners, vrijwilligers en het SAIL-team voor al hun ongelofelijke inzet en betrokkenheid. Samen met de Gemeente Amsterdam gaan we hard aan het werk om SAIL in 2025 groots terug te laten keren.
