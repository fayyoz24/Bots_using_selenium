When I get a grasp of my audience, I may also start trying hard to be funny and get a laugh out of you.\n\nOn my free time, usually during the week, I contribute as a software engineer to IT projects, so I have gained some experience in software planning, architecture design and implementation, mainly from big enterprise projects in telecommunications, online platforms and video delivery, but also in some pet projects over the weekend.\n\nI love cutting edge technologies and learning all these new ways of organising thought as a developer.\n\nI also like to invest on self-development so I dedicate some time to reading books about emotional intelligence, persistence, desire, determination, wealth and how to not behave in an awkward manner when meeting new people.\n\nIn 2014 I started taking some business and investment classes started to keep up to date with the stock markets.",

Easy to set-up email alerts and log access in the web interface.\n\nKafka\n\nA revolution in speed, ease of use and possibilities of data manipulation. Our central piece to standardise and enrich data with Kafka Streams/Connect and, now, KSQL.\n\nElasticsearch\n\nWe selected Elasticsearch as our timeseries database for its speed, cheapness in setting up, maturity and out-of-the-box integration with Kibana and other tools.\n\nPostgres\n\nOur partner in keeping important data organised and quickly relatable. Together with Kafka, they give us quick access to enrichment information.\n\nSpring Boot\n\nOur portal to external systems that send us data, or need to query our data.\n\nReact JS\n\nUsed to build the portal for humans that interact with our data.",
