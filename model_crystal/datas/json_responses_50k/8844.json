    "summary": "A hardworking and innovative Chemical Engineer with vast international exposure in chemical industry, a holder of a Master of Engineering degree in Chemical Engineering (MEng in Chemical Engineering) specializing in crude oil processing and Organic Chemical Technology, seventeen years of experience in chemical industry and University as a lecturer ; seven of which are at managerial level: (5 years as General manager Technical Services for Verify Engineering and two and a half years as Team Leader (Chemical production technologist / Chemical Weapons Inspector) in the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Experience as chemical production technologist / Chemical Weapons Inspector gave me global exposure to  a large number of national and multi-national chemical industries, in both the developed and developing world, inspecting chemical production plant sites to analyse their technologies to verify that they are being used for the intended purposes and not being used to produce toxic chemical warfare agents, which are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. The countries inspected include, but not limited to, United Kingdom, United States of America, Russia, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Netherlands, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Canada, China, Ukraine, Hungary, Colombia and Czech Republic.  The industries inspected include pharmaceutical production plants, pesticide production plants, detergents production plants and petrochemicals production plants. To date I have inspected about 140 chemical plant sites which translates to about 700 chemical production plants in about 40 countries which is rare industrial exposure for any chemical engineer.  \nI also have experience in chemical plant design, done the following projects: (i) Design of a plant to produce liquid fuels from coal, (ii) production of biodiesel from Jatropha seeds to substitute the imported mineral fuels and (iii) Plant to produce aluminum sulfate from Kaolin (Clay) \n",
