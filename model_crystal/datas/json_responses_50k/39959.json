Eafs merely contributes by supporting local organizations through conducting monitoring and evaluation or offering advice. \n\nIn 2013 for example Eafs provided advice in the Netherlands on topics such as the development of a training for talking with children in case of concerns and was involved in a short term project focussing on how to give children a voice in the prevention/intervention of child maltreatment.\n\nIn the spring of 2014 Eafs international conducted a qualitative study on the perception of parenting in Burundi and focused on specific marginalized groups of children and families (such as former child soldiers, street children, orphans, children accused of witchcraft and children born out of rape).\n\nIn the fall of 2014 an international exploratory study into the current m&e activities of an international volunteer parenting program ave been conducted. Focus of the assignment lies on the further development of m&e within the program.",
