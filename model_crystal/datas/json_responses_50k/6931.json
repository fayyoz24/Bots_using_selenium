    "summary": "I believe in the power of innovation and collaboration to build a fair and sustainable future for all. Over the past 12 years, I have effectively developed and facilitated projects to drive this change.\n\nLeading and participating in diverse projects where science, technology, and innovation converge with society, my work has involved collaborating with a range of stakeholders, from national governments to civil society and the private sector. This valuable experience motivated me to pursue a Master of Science in Innovation for Sustainable International Development, which I completed as a Chevening Scholar funded by the British Government.\n\nAlso a social entrepreneur, I was a co-founder of Cirklo, the first social innovation consultancy in Latin America, working with organizations around the world to create joint social and economic value. My main role was building a network of strategic partners that would allow us to push forward the transition towards a sustainable economy.\n\nMy goal is to design and execute more impactful collaborations and innovation projects, working together with transdisciplinary and multicultural teams, to build sustainable development.",

Over 150 participants representing more than 30 countries united as a community to tackle some of the most challenging issues faced by global refugee crisis including translation, job creation, education and food & water provision.\n\nOur project is Anatolia, a platform that provides children in refugee camps an opportunity to build up aspirations, knowledge and skills through a gaming experience. It empowers them to reach those aspirations, while turning them into agents of change able to help their families integrate to their fostering countries and recover hope.\n\nTo learn more about this experience, you can read  this Medium post: https://medium.com/@namilolo/what-i-learned-hacking-for-humanity-5963b53b3103",
