Doing so, the trainees develop a broad and diverse skillset and large network, which enables them to think beyond the departmental boundaries, and act as facilitators of the innovation process.\n\nThe trainees undertake three rotations of 8 months in different departments and roles, as mutually agreed upon by the trainees and the managers. During each stint of 8 months, the trainees work, on an average, for 70% of their time for the chosen department. Another 10% of their time is spent on trainee projects, which are TNO-wide strategic problems. Finally, the remaining 20% of their time is spent on personal and leadership development, through workshops, peer-based counselling, professional coaching, and networking sessions.\n\nTRAINEE PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN:\n- Impact First: Worked with a team to conduct several interviews with SMEs and the government. Worked to define a set of metrics to quantify the impact that TNO has in the world of SMEs.\n- Bring Sustainability Home: Worked with a team to suggest ways in which TNO can facilitate its employees to become more sustainable.\n- New Ways of Recruitment: Led a team to independently evaluate TNO's ability to attract and recruit juniors and finding new ways to attract promising talent in an increasingly competitive talent market.",
