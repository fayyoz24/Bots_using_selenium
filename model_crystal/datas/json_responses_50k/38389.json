DO NOT PM me about this pls***\n***FYI: send offers for recruits to the company email and NOT to me personally***\n***NOTE: I will decline network invitations without intro if I have not explicitly met you in person before***\n\nCall me a Developer, Designer, Programmer, Gamer, Snooker player, Digital painter, Technologist, Movie lover, Music lover, Art lover and general Geek. Combining the world of technology, science and art for work and pleasure is what I like to do.\n\nMy work comes together in the medium of web-technology. I have build a career around making the web-based projects happen. This I've done by using my technical knowledge to apply or consult, using my design knowledge to let it come to life and my project experience to get from point A to B.\n\nGoals and Ambitions:\n- Develop myself as a better software engineer.\n- Improve my skills as a graphics and user interface designer.\n- Participate in cool projects to develop web applications that change the world\n\nSpecialties: In my field (web-technology) my specialty is my non-specialization.
