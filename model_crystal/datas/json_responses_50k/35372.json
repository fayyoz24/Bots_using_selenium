ABT has more than 18 years of experience in the field of \"appointment setting\", generating qualified (new business) appointments for account managers.\n\nAt Active Business Telemarketing I worked as a financial intermediary assistant responsible for appointment setting with consumers and businesses that showed interest in switching mortgages, private loans, and revolving credits at their current bank or financial services provider, to one of the other 15 banks that ABT is partnered up with. Here I learned a lot about the business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) acquisition process. After 7 months, I was allowed to work a couple of shifts from home per week as a reward for my personal development.",

During my first month on the job I started off with B2C cold calling for Eon, one of the world\u2019s largest electric utility service providers. Afterwards, I started with a B2B project for Marktplaats, the largest online marketplace in The Netherlands, where I sold advertisements to SMEs and independent contractors.
