Throughout high school, i learned that my interest and passion lie in the field of life sciences and have decided to pursue my dreams to become a full-fledged researcher. I love the way that in biomedical research we never stop learning, and come up with new theories and are able to develop new techniques, ways of treatment, therapeutic targets etc. to ensure early diagnostics and better, patient-specific treatments. \n\n",

                    "description": "The main objective of my research was to provide insight on the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in NTD pathogenesis. Therefore, we wanted to observe whether there is a difference in Nestin expression in Tet1 null embryos in different strains. Nestin is known as an intermediate filament that acts as a cell marker for both NSCs and NPCs, which are abundantly expressed in the undifferentiated CNS during development. We suspect that Tet1 may indirectly influence Nestin expression by modulating the epigenetic state of certain genomic regions involved in Nestin regulation. Therefore, we compare Nestin expression in vivo between (B6x129) F1 (low NTD penetrance) and insipient congenic 129.B6 (high NTD penetrance) Tet1 KO mice. This can give insight into how Tet1 may be linked with Nestin expression in the neuroepithelium during development and whether this acts in a strain-dependent manner as well. It is expected that there will be a reduced expression of Nestin in Tet1 KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice.\nOn the other hand, we want to focus on studying the alterations in the folate transporters in Tet1 KO mice in hopes to unravel the connection between folate metabolism, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and overall epigenetic regulation. Folate deficiency increases the risk of the offspring developing NTDs and is important to research as underlying mechanisms are still unclear.  This thesis thrives to obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Tet1 and folate transporters. We hypothesize that loss of Tet1 in combination with adverse FA supplementation alters DNA methylation and histone modification patterns that can in turn modify epigenetic regulation and result in birth defects e.g., NTD.\n\nGrade 7/10",

There is no cure for advanced prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to currently available treatments. Alternative splicing is tightly regulated to maintain genomic stability in humans. \n\nIroquois-class homeodomain protein 4 (IRX4) is a TALE homeobox transcription factor which has been implicated in prostate cancer as a tumor suppressor through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional follow-up studies. In my research the functional role of IRX4 isoforms will be investigated in prostate cancer in vitro in order to improve early detection and result possible therapeutic markers for better treatment.\n\nGrade 7/10",
