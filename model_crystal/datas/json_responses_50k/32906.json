While there, I helped research, design, and assemble prototypes for a metering signal tester. During this process, I gained valuable experience in both practical applications, such as soldering and crimping, and design tools such as Altium and QCAD. \n\nThis work has given me a deeper understanding and appreciation for what a professional engineer does as well as furthering my passion for problem solving and engineering design. Thank you Nick, Andy, and the rest of the team at Vector AMS",
