I am part of the NWA (Nationale WetenschapsAgenda) project \u2018Dilemma\u2019s of doing Diversity\u2019 (DIDI), (lead: Marlou Schrover), focussing on 'doing' diversity in housing and community-based initiatives.

There is a huge, but underdeveloped potential of Linked Open Data and Social Media as crowdsourcing tools that complement regular data collection for decision-making. SmartGov will innovatively integrate these data sources with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), to enable quantitative modelling of complex problems and simulation of dynamic behaviour of factors underlying these problems. Hence, decision-makers and citizens can effectively utilize (currently inaccessible) Open Data, Social Media feeds and expert-based FCMs to simulate impacts of different scenarios and to improve two-way communication between governments and citizens. Building on systematic evidence reviews, the goals of SmartGov are: 1) to develop a set of user-friendly tools in accordance with legal frameworks, including a FCM-based data-integration tool, a Social Media engine and advanced visualization tools; 2) to test and implement the tools in cities in Cyprus (Limassol) and Spain (Quart de Poblet), and cities supporting SmartGov (Vienna and Amsterdam), and 3) to disseminate the outcomes throughout Europe. SmartGov dissemination will effectively build on networks of international organizations, e.g. EUROCITIES and Major Cities of Europe.",

            "description": "The primary focus of this project funded by Power to Change is the role and impact of community-based social enterprises in three European countries: the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. Community-based social enterprises (CBSEs) are distinct from social enterprises by defining their purpose, benefits and management in relation to communities in defined areas. The three countries selected are similar in economic circumstances, in the impact of austerity on traditional welfare support programs, and in a desire to develop and enhance the contribution of social and community enterprise to fulfill unmet needs. It is our hypothesis, however, that there are also substantial differences based on historical, cultural and contextual factors. In all three countries there is strong evidence that CBSEs have developed rapidly through innovative approaches to co-production and changing citizen-government relationships. Despite a continuing debate about the meanings and definitions of the sector, this project seeks to explore the similarities and differences between these countries, particularly where CBSEs are making a significant contribution towards urban regeneration and reducing inequalities and deprivation. The main project objectives are to:\n\n1.\tIdentify the national and local policy parameters in which CBSEs are located in order to identify how they have evolved and the legal, technical and political framework in which they operate in relation to broader societal and regeneration objectives;\n2.\tReview sources and levels of technical and financial support available from stakeholders and national bodies and to determine the extent to which these are critical to achieving sustainability and organizational objectives;\n3.\tDetermine through case studies the methods and extent to which performance outputs and impact are monitored and evaluated;\n4.\tGenerate findings and broader conclusions of direct relevance to local and national stakeholders, and the wider EU community. \n",

Tests of this quick scan in three post-war neighbourhoods enabled me to collect data for my master thesis. More importantly, Chiel and his colleagues learned me a great deal about research, consultancy and the complexities of neighbourhood (re)development.",
