Then we try to design a game in which we use regional crime rate prediction and the mathematical model of police deployment to combine the biased concepts we studied to show the impact of prejudice in the game and discuss how to eliminate this bias. Through the above work, we can give us a good feeling, let us understand the concept of prejudice more deeply, and reflect on the incompleteness and defects of machine learning algorithms, thereby further improving the robustness, efficiency and reliability of machine learning algorithms",

We've been using machine learning to train the system to recognize the different position, shape and number of hands. For this project, we've trying to play around with machine learning,combined with projection, in order to bring people to work together and more or less build a stronger bond with each other.",
