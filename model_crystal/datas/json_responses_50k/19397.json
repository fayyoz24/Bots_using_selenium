These components had to be built in plastic housings. The company did not have the expertise themselves so they hired Remco Rietveld to design the housings, test the prototypes, supervise the mould-making process and check the final products. Due to there being limited organizational layers, this process was completed in a relatively short time.\n\nFor a company in the orchid industry, Remco Rietveld developed a new line of products that makes it possible to grow more orchids per square meter and improves the overall efficiency.\nThis was accomplished by (among other things) analyzing the growth of the orchid in several stages.",
