    "summary": "My diverse knowledge and experiences show that I am employable for different kind of spatial projects. My ambition as an urban designer is, to create together a high quality and sustainable environment to live in, perfectly integrated in its surrounding, with a high user value. I always try to explore the sites in person and if possible stay there temporarily, to get to know the context, the identity, to analyze and finally translate this into a sustainable plan for now and the future.   \n\nTo realize these ambitions I prefer to work together with other professionals from related fields to develop integral plans and increase my own knowledge as well. I am creative, enthusiastic and take initiative. I work hard, goal and result oriented. I assist where necessary and have experience with leading and initiating projects, also international. \n\nProfessional knowledge: urban design, urban planning, policy, landscape architecture, architecture, historical analysis, favelas, deprived neighborhoods, urban farming, participation proces, water issues, sustainability, temporary/abandoned spaces, solar parks.\n\nCompetences: initiating projects, project management, committed, analytical, decisive, strategic, networking/communication, feasibility studies, out of the box, creative, innovative, organizing.\n\nIf you have a challenge for me, or if you want to work together with me, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me!\n",

We were not only present to research, analyse and design our ideas, but also to see whether we could already contribute with some small interventions to the community. And this happened; together with local residents and entrepreneurs we improved and created public spaces. Finally studio Urban Sprinkle organised together with Ben Stokke (masterstudent architecture) a workshop for the residents, which resulted in interesting visions and ideas. We have translated these results into scenarios for the community and presented these together with the former interventions and a model, for two months in the exhibition space of Barraco#55, a local cultural organisation in the community. \nThis project will be continued.\n",

It could be a first step in creating small, local and partly self-supporting networks and in addition it creates opportunities for a bigger biodiversity and improvement of the ecological and hydrological life of the city. Therefore I researched the possibilities of urban farming in the city of Eindhoven, together with Studio Synthese. What kind of initiatives are there already, what parties are involved and what are the problems the municipality is facing? We came up with suggestions for the municipality.\n",

This is also the case for the viaduct that leads the highway A2 across a recreational route. Together with Studio Synthese and local residents we studied the future role and function of the A2 viaduct. How can you extend the recreational route under the viaduct? And what can you do with this viaduct in terms of design and function? How can you prevent the viaduct from being a dark and unpleasant interruption? We finally came up with four scenarios for a pleasant and attractive viaduct which also contributes to its surroundings. ",

What is the future of the Veneto region in 2100, given the threats posed by rising sea levels, heavy rainfall, floods and drought? The Monti Lessini creeks form one of the three case studies of this project. They lie in between the ridges of Verona and Vicenza. A corridor of heavy infrastructure and dense construction formed by the A4 highway, the railway, industrial activity and settlements cuts them. The danger linked to the creeks is well known: the \u2018areas\u2019 heavy rainfall and the steepness of its valleys make the creeks a constant threat, for they often overflow due to uncontrollable amounts of rainwater and eroded sediment. The scenario proposed suggests creating north-south buffers along the creeks, that would make room both for the excess rainwater and for hosting basins, wetlands and woods. Living with water has been exposed at the 5th International Architectural Biennale in Rotterdam.\n",

I teach children in the age of 4 - 14 years, in general mathematics and English, but I also teach Portuguese, help them writing and reading as their education is way behind. Also I am helping to set up an urban farming project behind the school, not only to teach children about healthy food and nature, but also to improve the public space with more green in the dense favela."
