Emphasis was placed on exploring my own interests and options within different realms of management at a company level. This allowed for personal development and growth in management built around my assigned practical projects including: Innovation Management, Lean Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management. Related processes and organizational skills also played a key role.\n\nInnovation Management: This project (entitled \u2018Blue Value\u2019) reflects WP Haton\u2019s innovative business model of entrepreneur thinking. The project itself involved constructing a strategic handbook which listed key theories of management important to the company\u2019s core values centered on customer satisfaction.\n\nLean Manufacturing: This project focused on a new approach to fulfill customer demand at an internal logistical level to facilitate the flow of goods. I recognized how assembly line processing can be aligned to ensure products are delivered promptly through new ways of thinking. I devised a new logistic system where the pull of the customer dominates how the company stays lucrative.\n\nSupply Chain Management: This area of development focused on identifying the best supply chain solutions through \u2018Blue Value\u2019 by utilizing strategic suppliers who deliver goods on a \u2018just in time\u2019 basis. Approaching this from a management point of view allowed me to see how quicker assembly and the need for fewer suppliers increases profit margins.\n\nThe management skills of all three projects allowed me to foresee company growth opportunities through aligning our suppliers to our internal processing equipment and connecting to the customer while providing the best value.",
