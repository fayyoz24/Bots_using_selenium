We have a combined 35 million+ followers across subjects such as internet culture, memes, dating, cooking, sports, feminism, LGBTQ, religion, fashion, and more. The significant audience overlap between them allows us to reach millions of people and have them accept our narratives as the new truth.\n\nAs the CMO, I spend my time obsessing over finding patterns that lead to social media success, continuously optimizing the management and growth of communities. This includes aspects such as employee training, content format creation and production, community branding, A/B testing without harming the community, market analysis, and running futuristic content and growth strategy experiments to ensure we continue to pioneer social media.\n\nWe publish 60 posts a day, 365 days a year, resulting in 4.5 billion annual content views and some of the highest engagement rates in the industry. This allows us to execute marketing stunts with unbeatable ROI every month for clients or our temporary brands.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/viral_potion/?hl=en\n\nNote that most communities have been acquired and are no longer under our responsability.
