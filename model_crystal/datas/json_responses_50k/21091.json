I write words with attention and intention. \n\nI have collaborated creatively with various clients, such as top-10 performing fashion and interior design brands, a renowned Dutch museum, creative artists is the electronic music industry, and the list goes on.\n\nBesides writing words I offer Dutch to English translations, (and English to Dutch) which I have done for various Dutch cities. \n\nMy experience in retail, customer care and contact, and product knowledge, allows me to understand the customer mindset \u2013 I understand the importance of connecting to deliver a message that resonates. \n\nThe 10+ years in retail have provided me with the necessary expertise in KPI\u2019s and targets, time management, collaborating with peers and stakeholders, establishing client relations, and individual and team performances.\n\nDiligent managing has made me reach team and individual targets (i.e. KPI\u2019s and NPS) and personal achievements (high rated appraisals and promotions).",
