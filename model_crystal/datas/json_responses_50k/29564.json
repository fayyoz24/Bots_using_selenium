    "summary": "I work as a Technologist Dynamics & FEM at Philips Engineering Solutions. Previously worked as a Project Engineer in the analysis and measurement group within Mecal Semiconductor Product Development BV at Eindhoven, The Netherlands. I graduated from TU Delft as a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering with the specialization of Precision and Microsystems engineering. \n\nMy key areas of interests are mechanics, dynamics and optimization; be it an automotive system, a high-tech system, a micro-nano device or for any other business including mechanical system/ component analysis. I can also work as a project engineer and a product analyst.  Recently I have also started working with data science/analysis. I plan to adopt mechanical analysis techniques to incorporate the benefits of data science field. \n\nI continuously thrive to contribute to society by applying my knowledge in research, sustainable development and innovative concepts. Drive for the continuous improvement of myself and taking risks is always allowing me to look forward and implement my knowledge for the betterment of the society I live in.",

When the load acting on a bearing is estimated with help of the measured deformation of a bearing, it is called the load sensing bearing. The concept is useful for many applications, but till date accurate estimation of load acting on the bearing is not avaialble. Task of my work was to include the information about the mechanics and the first principles of mechanics in the estimation algorithm.",

The main problem with the current design of heater is that it bulges at higher temperature.

In this project the structure was evaluated, both, statically and dynamically. In dynamic condition the analysis was done to incorporate the effects of passing cart, external wind and the possible earthquake.\n\nFor analysis, different numerical methods were employed. For finding eigenvalues, eigensolvers like - orthogonal deflation, Lanczos method were used and to include dynamic effects time integration was done using newmark scheme, modal superposition, modal accelaration and base excitation. Results of each method were compared and discussed. \n\nFurther sensitivity analyses of eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies were done. At last it was analyzed that whether the generated code can be deployed in parallel to reduce the computational time or not. \n\nFor the subject (50% Project + 50% oral exam) I got a grade of 9.5/10.

The year 2011, was the first year of participation for Team Stallions. The aim of the event was to design, present and manufacture an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) that can survive a rocky terrain for 3 hours of endurance run, after qualifying through Brake, Acceleration, Steering, and Oil Spill Tests. In the preliminary rounds, around 200 teams participated, of which around 80 were allowed to go forward and fabricate the vehicle. Our vehicle finished overall 19th nationally in its maiden attempt. In the subsequent years of participation, after the strong foundation laid in the first year, the team had one many awards such as Best Innovation, Go-Green and Highest Acceleration awards. ",
