My research explores the ways in which female empowerment and sexuality are represented and enacted in the context of funk carioca music, and analyses the potential tensions between female agency and sexual objectification in this music genre. I aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of gender dynamics, power structures, and cultural production and consumption of music in urban marginalised communities and how this reflects in societal attitudes towards women.\n\nAmong others, collaborating with the local Brazilian NGO Viva Rio.",
