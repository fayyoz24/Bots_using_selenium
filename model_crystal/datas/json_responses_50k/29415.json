So was in charge of making sure the room was clean, that the kids would take their shower/sleep/ go to the activities. If a child had nightmares or would get sick or had an accident during the night, I would be in charge of taking care of it \n- Skills that i learned: - learned to me more responsable, taking charge \n              - Working as a team as we would organize activities and so I needed to work with the other teachers \n- being flexible/adaptable"
