I continued with Troop 130 until reaching the rank of Eagle Scout in 2020 - this is the highest rank achievable in Scouts BSA and is quite an honor. I volunteered for community-related service projects on many different occasions during this time. Some examples of these projects were helping at food kitchens, working with food banks, collecting food donations at local shops, doing general community projects, cleanup of historical monuments and sites, and helping where help was needed. I enjoyed this time very much and was very grateful for the great life lessons  learned during my time with scouting."
