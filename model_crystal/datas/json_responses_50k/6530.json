By integrating classical and pioneering hypotheses on the aetiology of AD, this translational, multi-level approach will identify novel (epigenetic-based) loci and pathways to be used in order to better diagnose, prevent, attenuate or possibly reverse AD\u2019s pathophysiology. In EPI-AD, academic partners collaborate intensively to offer a well-defined and balanced research and training programme to young researchers. The benefits for the participating young researchers are: 1) exposure to different academic partners which will create a balanced and sustainable network for the rest of their career; 2) participation in different workshops and meetings will broaden their scope of different knowledge resources; 3) access to state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise from leading scientists with academic, clinical and industrial backgrounds; 4) an international multi-disciplinary training environment which is an optimal preparation for an international (European) research career; 5) high quality guidance which will leads to the optimal use of talents of researchers; 6) a strong sense of European citizenship which encourages researchers to work in an international (European) context; 7) the research environment offering the latest technologies and methodologies.

EMiN wants to exploit wider competences and resources by recruiting excellent students who will be given the opportunity to learn techniques in biotechnology, biomedicine and imaging that could be valued to employment in clinical settings and industry. EMiN guarantees an outstanding international research training program in Translational Neuroscience. Specific expertise in various disciplines related to Neuroscience will offer the educational and research expertise for interdisciplinary training of the students. The partners will supply laboratory space and infrastructure and the opportunity to get access to foreign expertise within a joint framework. The Master degree will be organized as a joint degree program and therefore contributes to the Bologna principles.  The active collaboration with industrial enterprises leads to exchange of high-tech knowledge and expertise between academic and industrial partners. The Dutch government supports this project as it contributes to cross border educational cooperation. Role: project manager.",
