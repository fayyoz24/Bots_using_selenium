Current frameworks for drought monitoring and water accounting focus on the natural boundary conditions and therefore offer little help in distilling human influences on drought. This project combines insights from socio-hydrology and water management to produce an entirely new approach, incorporating the study of water-related human dimensions (D1), socio-hydrological dynamics (D2), and the structuring of dialogues (D3) among actors. The project will develop and test the integrated, participatory 3D Drought Diagnosis (3DDD) toolbox. We will investigate nested scale levels, related to local water resources and virtual-water transfers together with actor networks of users, managers, traders, and policymakers.\n \nTest case is the semi-arid, drought-affected north-east of Brazil. The 3D Drought Diagnosis toolbox will be developed to extend existing drought monitoring frameworks to provide contextualized information in drought-affected regions worldwide. We will demonstrate how proposed drought management solutions perform with regard to cross-scale synergies and trade-offs in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2, 6, 10, and 13. With the support of national and international partners, our project will contribute to the development of the South American Drought Information System and the Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Global Water Partnership (GWP).",

The Accelerated project builds on this research to advance a methodology for monitoring the impacts of watershed management interventions using selected indicators of hydrological performance. The project is partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MoANR) and IWMI (international Water Management Institute), and operates at four study sites in Ethiopia.\n\nNERC Innovations Water Risk project \u2013 CARISMA (Catchment Risk Assessments using Multi-Scale data)\nThe aim is to develop a framework methodology for integration of community-led hydrological monitoring in areas of data scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa with remote sensing information, to improve assessment and understanding of catchment water balances. The project focuses on two river basins, one each in Ethiopia and Tanzania.

The research involved field hydrogeological investigations (surveys of wells, springs and rivers; surface and groundwater sampling for chemistry, stable isotope and radon-222 analysis; ground-truthing satellite imagery; pumping and recovery tests on hand-dug wells; river flow-gauging; geological surveys; etc), recharge assessments, and numerical modelling; including simulation of future changes to climate and land use.  Much of the data required for the numerical modelling was collected from a community-based monitoring programme.\n\nGroundwater in much of rural Sub-Saharan Africa is only just beginning to be utilised for irrigation rather than relying on rains.  It is thought, as occurred in south Asia, that an increase in the use of groundwater, converting subsistence smallholders into market farmers, could have a profoundly positive impact on poverty alleviation and gender equality.   \n\nThe project was in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).",

The role included desk studies, hydrogeological, hydrological, and meteorological modelling and report preparation.  Previously, the role included organisation of daily works, managing local staff, selection of suitable materials, installation of rock fill, drainage infrastructure, clay liner, geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL).  Throughout the Azerbaijan projects, on the spot design decisions had to be made regarding method of working, blasting patterns, slope stability and hydrogeological issues.",
