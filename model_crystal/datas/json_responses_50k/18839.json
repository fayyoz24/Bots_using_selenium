            "description": "According to the National Solar Mission of the Government of India, 100 GW of solar is targeted for installation by 2030. Out of this, 40 GW is set aside for solar rooftop installations. To achieve this ambitious target and to assess whether these installations will meet the electrical requirements of Indian households, it is necessary to study the technical and economic feasibility of powering residential households in Indian cities using solar rooftop installations. To assess the same, the Pune Municipal Corporation is studied. In the first part of the study, the total solar insolation received by Pune per year is calculated. The monthly, seasonal and yearly tilt angles are documented and yearly tilt angle is used for further analysis. A collection of sample buildings is selected from each ward and the BFA ratio for each ward of Pune Municipal Corporation is calculated using satellite imagery from Google Earth Pro. The PVA ratio is derived from literature review and total area available for installations of solar panels within Pune is calculated using the two ratios. The total installation area and the calculated actual solar insolation are used to estimate the total number of electrical units produced by residential rooftop PV in Pune. It is concluded that solar rooftop installations can meet 25.47% of predicted residential electricity demand of Pune for the year 2020-2021. In order to promote residentials to adopt solar PV, one building is modelled to study the economic feasibility of rooftop plants. A CAPEX model for a rooftop PV system is developed for a sample twelve floor residential building. Design of solar module mounting structure is proposed and overall output for the building is calculated. It is concluded that the it will take nearly 4 years for a modern residential building of twelve floors to have returns on its investment.",
