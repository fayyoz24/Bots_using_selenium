    "summary": "I aspire to forge meaningful connections, advocate for change and find solutions to sustainability challenges. I believe that through understanding our interconnection with eachother and the natural world, we can gain deeper understanding into how best to collaborate, and where to intervene to find solutions to complex challenges. Such solutions require considering not only global systems, but also local context.\n\nEquipped with research and analytical skills through my BSc(Honors) in Biochemistry, I have always been passionate about solving complex challenges, and understanding how changes on a small scale can ripple through into large scale, systemic change. \nThrough working in the travel industry I nurtured valuable skills in international teamwork and building relationships. I gained invaluable global perspective, and witnessed first hand the impacts of climate change on the environment and communities.\n\nMy passion for sustainability, transitions, and governance has grown from this experience. I have written blogs on various areas of sustainability, and have completed my Masters in Sustainable Business and Innovation at Utrecht University.",

As Global North countries engage with GH2 developments in the Global South, there is uncertainty surrounding energy justice for the Global South, and how power relations may shape developments. \n\nThe research employed a qualitative case study approach, considering how the Netherlands and South Africa are engaging in GH2 developments in South Africa. Interviews were supplemented with participant observation and document analysis, and results were embedded in the broader Global North-Global South context. Results were structured according to three dimensions of energy justice, namely distributional, recognition-based and procedural justice; with cosmopolitan justice added to account for the scale and scope of considerations. Dimensions of power recognized in Global North-Global South development research, namely knowledge, funding, and partnerships, were used to understand power relations.",
