    "summary": "I have always been enthusiastic about different cultures, apart from contemporary art which has always been my number one passion.\nI love art. I would always like to devote myself and my time to art business and anything related.\n\nI have studied at GIOCA (Graduate Program of Innovation and Organization of Culture and Arts ) program at the University of Bologna in Italy. \n\nThe program mainly focuses on three main areas of administration: economics, law and management. The core knowledge is laboratories providing a practical approach to creative industries (film, music, performing, visual arts, and fashion industry etc.) and an enhancing training in sociology, art history, music, urban planning and information technology.\n\nI have a full-time 4-year Bachelor degree in Finance. However this does not take away my passion for art, especially traditional and contemporary Chinese art and other forms of Asian art, thanks to the fact that my father has inspired me a lot as a modern Chinese artist. At the same time, the finance background has always enabled me to look critically into  the situation which I am in, which I believe would be crucial in the art industry.\n\n\u2028I am always willing to learn and I am a fast learner when I am working with different people no matter if it is a language or a new technique, new skills.And because of the fact that my father himself is an artist, I always have chances to visit different types of artists in the art regions in Beijing, Shanghai and other parts of China, including the 798 art district and Songzhuang, the emerging art districts in Beijing.\n\nI have lived in Europe, specifically Italy, for around 3 years. And I have been living in Saudi Arabia for around 1 year.",
