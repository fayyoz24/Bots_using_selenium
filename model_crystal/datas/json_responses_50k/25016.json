They have been kept well for all visitors. But what is their actual value?  Value is a versatile concept: many types of value exist such as emotional value, historical value and financial value.\n\nThe same sort of objects that the museum preserves, can be bought on online auction sites like \u2018ebay\u2019. What is their value on those sites? Are they also special within that environment? What objects are most valuable to our curators? What is their historical importance? And finally, what objects do you, the public, consider extraordinary?",

I am passionate about light and lighting. Over the years I designed many lighting fixtures, often for clients, but also independently. All lights are developed out of a fascination for the experience of light and sustainability. In my design management praxis, together with the client I not only focus on design, but engage with content, policy, finance and marketing, which are important aspects too. Good design is not an aim in itself, but an extension of a holistic vision and strategy. The way things look is connected to all expressions of an organisation, including printed and digital media, product and interior design, and these are always a reflection of its core values.",

All of this to underline Zetel\u2019s objectives: to initiate, develop and preserve original chair designs. Zetel is an ideal organisation with a lively network of designers, design courses, critics, cultural organisations and private users/collectors. Getting to know others and strengthening existing connections are two main reasons for participating into new projects. Zetel is a private initiative and develops its projects through collaboration.
