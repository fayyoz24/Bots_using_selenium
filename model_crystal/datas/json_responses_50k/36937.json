The conference is organised in partnership with the research group Network Cultures of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.\n\nGlobal developments in digital currencies and monetary flows are taking place at breakneck speed. Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, the emergence of parallel banking systems and the decentralization of monetary transactions impact ideas about the future of money and the banking system, but they also expand the playing field for criminals.\n\nMany cities are increasingly confronted with suspicious investments in real estate, hotels, restaurants, clubs, and other businesses. This phenomenon is particularly urgent in global cities like Amsterdam, where many different monetary flows converge.\n\nThis European conference has a unique nature and scope. It brings people together from a wide range of backgrounds \u2013  civil servants, scientists, engineers, journalists,  artists, bankers and entrepreneurs \u2013 to discuss topics related to the future of digital money, and illicit financial flows in particular.\n\nTo address these themes more than 40 speakers will be giving keynote lectures and will debate with each other on stage. The speakers include Bill Browder, Eric Smit, Francesca Bria, Bastian Obermayer, Klaas Knot, Misha Glenny, Joris Luyendijk, Saskia Sassen and Galia Benartzi.\n\nhttps://www.flyingmoneyconference.eu",
