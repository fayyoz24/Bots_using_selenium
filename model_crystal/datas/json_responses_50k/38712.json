    "summary": "I currently work as an senior lecturer at the Department of legal regulation of economic activity of the Financial University (Moscow). I teach private business law and European business law at bachelor and master's degree courses. My current lecturing interests concern the \"challenges to free competition in the sphere of the digital economy\" including :\n-the challenges raised by disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Blockchain;\n-the challenges raised by restrictive contractual practices such as geo-blocking, contractual restrictions imposed by manufacturers to online retailers, contractual restrictions imposed by online platforms to their professional users,  restrictions on the use by retailers of online price comparison tools;\n-the challenges raised by restrictive exclusionary practices of tech firms in dominant position such as the refusal to deal, predatory pricing, margin squeeze (self-preferencing), tying and bundling.\n-the challenges raised by exploitative practices towards consumers such as personalized pricing, excessive prices or unfair terms on consumers by dominant tech firms.",
