    "summary": "I am a hard working man born and raised in Ethiopia. I naturally grew up becoming negotiative and having a flexible behaviour. I put my effort to become well spoken in English language by making a lot of self study. \nI have a strong team spirit and co-operative manner to bring collective changes in a given company. I have a capacity to mobilize workmates to achieve goals of a company.\n\nGetting good education in Ethiopia is not as common as it as for Dutch children. That's why as a teacher, I love to teach English to children so I can give them a good start in life. At the same time, the students teach me a lot as well, which I love because I am determined to keep on learning all in my life.",
