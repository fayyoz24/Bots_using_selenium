    "summary": "Hello! Welcome on my Linkedin profile, I am glad that you get to know me a bit better! \n \nIf I had to describe myself in three words: energy, caring and ambition. I am the one colleague that is always energetic.\n\nWith a background in hospitality and a passion for food, I believe food can be a climate and customer-centric solution. I want to help food-agribusiness to measure and quantify use of resources, because I know what is measured can be managed. I enjoy understanding and analyzing data to identify possible solutions that enable firms to innovate while serving the planet. \n\nThroughout my education I have stepped myself in new countries, new industries. But what I know : I love food, numbers love me! I drive for more responsible business and guide conversation on purpose-led results. \n\nThe fun part? I am very curious (I ask loads of questions). My key strength also lies in my ability to design interactive and meaningful presentations to transform information creatively.\n\nThere are a couple of other things that could hold your attention:  \n\u2739 I am a food activist within EIT Food\n\u2739I grew up in Paris (France), traveled in 42 different countries, went to do my Bachelor in Brussels (Belgium), studied in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and worked in Cabo San Lucas (Mexico) & Guernsey (Channel Islands). My journey around the world somehow built my great flexibility. \n\u2739I enjoy learning languages. My favorite language is Spanish and I am currently learning Dutch \n\u2739I am an active member in the sustainability community: FutureFoodMakers, Net Impact Amsterdam, Young ImpactMakers Community\n\nMy ideal company is one that uses food as a climate solution, is one that takes action to provide a better future for our environment and people. \n\nMight you be interested to know more about me (and me about you), feel free to contact me at dorin.chloe@gmail.com",

I aid customers in reducing their debts\n\nAs a E-commerce payment specialist, I focus my activities on\n- risk minimization - I stop customers from accumulating debts to minimize risk that payment won\u2019t be collected. Thanks to debts and profitability analysis, I apply soft or hard measures on the customer's account in order to manage retention growth. \n- operational processes optimization - I reduced time spent on 6 processes by improving SQL queries within one year (deactivation, fraudsters, duplicate customers, C2C proof of delivery, loyal customer, Christmas, reactivation). I identified better sources of data in order to make faster decisions. \n- anti-fraud mechanism - I created a process to screen low solvency/abusing customers, saving  \u20ac 470k/year. Aside, I build a database of postal addresses with suspicious behavior.\n - automated installment plan - I created from scratch a payment schedule tool answering the customer\u2019s need for payment flexibility and communication in inflation times.\n- Pushed for pay-by-link api integration. It gave debtor a more optimal dunning which reduced customer service interaction around impossibility to pay via bancontact/sepa payment method",

It was a unique opportunity for me to embrace two mixing cultures and learn about:\n-How to satisfy customers from the USA? \n-How to adapt my European working style to a Mexican one?\n\n\u2605I developped a great curisotiy for the Timeshare concept. I was able to shadow salespeople and learn uspelling techniques (that I could use in my daily work too). \n\u2605Working with such friendly and warm culture boosted my mood. It stimulated my drive to create memorable experiences and enhanced my complaint management skills. \n\u2605Looking closely at working procedures, I was able to identify ways to reduce time at check-in. \n\u2605In addition, I learnt a language that today I cherish everyday.",
