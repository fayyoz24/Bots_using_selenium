    "summary": "My biggest passion is to help people. People in my community know me as \u201cthe helper.\u201d I love to connect\npeople, solve problems, make things work for them. Positive energy, empathy, strong engagement, sense of\nresponsibility, and well-developed intercultural sensitivity are my strongest driving forces. Going the extra\nmile is second nature. Being highly organized and structured, I have my focus on improving protocols where\npossible and I enjoy working according to plans while remaining flexible to adapt and pivot without losing\nsight of the big picture. Having built my experience in the Netherlands over the last 15 years in HR and\nfinance, marketing, communication and event planning, the time has come for the next step in my career. I\u2019d\nlike to deploy my professional experience working for either a relocation desk within a large, multinational\ncompany or as a staff member in a relocation agency here in the Netherlands. Please note that, as EU\nnational, I can work for any employer and do not need a work permit.",
