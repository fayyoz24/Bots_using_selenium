    "summary": "I specialize in analyzing network wars in conflicts and the relationship between development and security in post-conflict states. My research and projects have so far focused on how global economic forces have impacted the lives of non-insured individuals in the Great Lakes region of Africa, as well as the interconnectedness between global governance and dense networks in conflict zones. In my free time, I undertake extensive research on the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and the DRC, as well as human rights violations against the Palestinian population. My unwavering passion for these topics drives me to seek a research position in the field of network wars studies and contribute to local reconstruction efforts.\n\nLanguages of communication: Vietnamese (native), English (advanced, C1 equivalent), and Japanese (conversational, N3 equivalent).",
