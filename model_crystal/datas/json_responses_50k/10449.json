With a 500\u20ac worth red Volvo, team \u201cDesert Daisies\u201d drove across The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and The Gambia (a journey of over 7000 KM, with a lot of offroading) in merely three weeks. In Banjul (The Gambia) we auctioned off our vehicle for 1630\u20ac and donated the money to Solar Foundation the Gambia. This local foundation offers sustainable solar energy to hospitals and schools in remote villages in West Africa. Participating in this challenge was a great, eye-opening, educational, fun and out of my comfort zone experience!",
