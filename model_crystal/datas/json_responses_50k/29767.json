International cooperation,\nincluding collaboration in research but not limited to this, is an integral part of the Commission\u2019s policy in all areas\nof the Action Plan. However, despite the fact that international collaboration has been made so far; there is still a\nchallenge of filling knowledge gaps with less industrially advanced nations in order to enhance quality of life and\nindustrial competitiveness in those areas where Nanotechnology has the potential. European industrial players\nand research organizations seek new collaborative agreements in order to share risks and explore new market\nopportunities. On the other hand, Latin America has started new nanotechnology development programs in the\nlast ten years. However, according to national agencies, the investment in nanotechnology R+D and the results\nachieved remains now relatively unpretentious.\nThe main objective of NMP-DeLA project is to develop a series of activities between European and Latin\nAmerican countries, aiming to strengthening the local research and training potential, as means to achieve the\ngoal of deployment of Nanomaterials technologies on those areas of major social challenge in Latin America:\nenergy, water and Health. This will be achieved through:\n\u2022 Networking, education and training in Advance materials (nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials and new\nproduction techs).\n\u2022 Building new skills, aiming to enhance and strengthening the local knowledge in Latin America about\nnanomaterial technologies.\n\u2022 Boost synergy with local/regional policy and cooperation programs related to advance materials.\n\u2022 Exchange of best practices, build capacity in nanomaterial-innovation and technology transfer in cooperation\nwith central and south America.\n\u2022 Contribute toward the United Nations Millennium development goals.
