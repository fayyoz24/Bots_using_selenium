It considers all aspects of the product development lifecycle and supply chain. \n\nI developed a marketing strategy for YouK based around building brand awareness on engaging social feeds, generating user sign-ups and building relationships with the brands featured on YouK. This resulted in YouK's user base growing from 0 to over 2,000 monthly users within 6 months.\n\n\nAs part of the leadership team, I led discussions about how to create the overall YouK score assigned to each brand. I conducted an in-depth supply chain analysis of hundreds of brands across all consumer divisions.\n\nI worked closely with our external development team to drive the look and feel of the web app, and to ensure a smooth, transparent development process for the web app. This involved creating & prioritising initial development requirements and thereafter managing changes in the scope due to budget or time constraints. Through a user-centred planning process & extensive communication with testers, I outlined intuitive designs with high levels of usability. I conducted focus group events to obtain real user feedback and constructively communicated this to our developers. \n\nI am confident in communicating high-level & technical information to a wide audience. I planned and hosted the launch event and spoke at press events in Edinburgh, including at the Google Digital Garage.\n\nI planned & delivered campaigns for social media as well as major media outlets such as Good Housekeeping, focussing on multi-niches to capture engaged sectors of the market. \n\nI built YouK's blog on WordPress and improved SEO using a combination of Yoast, keyword mapping and technical design.\n\nI developed creative marketing solutions, such as establishing a YouK Awards initiative, to celebrate local brands & boost brand awareness, whilst creating backlinks to improve SEO performance.",
