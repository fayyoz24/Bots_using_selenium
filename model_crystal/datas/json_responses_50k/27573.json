    "summary": "I'm a curios an ingenious mind interested in energy and matter interaction. I became mechatronics engineer to understand the principles of how technological products sense and act over energy & matter.\n\nI am open to challenging roles and adaptable. My top 3 strengths are being highly independent, a good listener & reliable. My carrer anchor is service and dedication to a cause and my drive is to deliver functionality.\n\nMy story:\nInfluenced by the tropical sun from my hometown, the photovoltaics phenomena capture my attention. Thus I followed 2 internships at R&D centers on material deposition of films. Brainport region is the cradle of vacuum technology so I eventually came to study my MSc in Plasma and Materials Processing group where I gained insight in thin films topics and surface characterization. What caugh my eye was the diversity of vacuum systems in the cleanroom and the variety of sensors and actuators on their instruments.\n\nThe last 5 years I have been doing integration at module level of semicon products in all NXT, NXE, EXE and inspection portfolios. This means lots of practical experience in CR. My career has taken me to workcenter in US and customer location in VHV.",

The project consists in the characterization of optoelectronic properties and composition of MoO3 films deposited by plasma-assisted ALD. Techniques such as SE, XPS, XRD, FTIR and RBS were used to compare the deposited films with the state of art thermal evaporated method. Investigation towards partial or total replacement of organic HTL such as P3HT in a planar n-i-p perovskite solar cell configuration was pursued. The results indicate that plasma-assisted ALD offers alternative routes to control the composition of the films thereby enhacing stability of the devices by minimal efficiency cost.",
