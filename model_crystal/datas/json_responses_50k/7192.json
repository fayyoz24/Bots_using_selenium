Besides this I am also active as a cyclist and from 2023 riding with JEGG-DJR Academy.\n\nTogether with the team and people around me I put a lot of passion and effort into my sport, every day!",

I'm experienced in modeling for life drawing, figure, sculpture and portrait and really enjoy working with various artists from all levels. Whilst living in New Zealand I regularly modeled for Vincents' Art School, Inverlochy Art School and the Wellington School of Drawing. In the Netherlands I work with ArtEZ University of the Arts, teken- en schilderschool TINT and the ZaadeL Makerij.\n\nSchool director Cynthia Bowles from the Wellington School of Drawing left the following reference (July 2019):\n\n''Dieske is a kind, mature and completely reliable model. Over the last 5 - 6 months we have had the privilege to work with her in both portrait and figure drawing classes. Her athletic figure has clear anatomical definition, revealing skeletal landmarks and muscle groups.  \n\nHowever, in addition to these attributes, Dieske is one of those rare models who has a natural grace and presence, which is such an inspiration to students. In recent months she has been the subject of some of the school's best works.\n\nI recommend Dieske to you wholeheartedly and though we have lost her it will be good to know you would gain a world class model.\n\nI have enclosed two drawings of quick warm up sketches of Dieske from portrait class. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.\n\nKind regards,\nCynthia Bowles''\n\n(Art works and drawings upon request)",

Mostly in Indonesia (where I also lived for 6 months in 2016), Nepal, Laos, Vietnam, Canada and New Zealand. Spend much time hitchhiking, volunteering at NGO's, working abroad, learning new languages and staying with locals. \n\nAll this time I traveled mostly by myself, lived very minimalistis and with very little money, had 10/15kg luggage and have gotten myself into challenging situations many times which in the end always worked out. It's hard to just describe here how valuable all these experiences were but for sure I have further developed skills like my creativity, problem solving abilities, intercultural knowledge and understanding, independency, flexibility and my outlook on both the world and life in general. During my travels I wrote some blogs about my experiences which you can find on www.dieskekruisselbrink.com",

This was an important start in changing my perspective on the world and its global topics. Through all kinds of big and smaller actions (i.e. sponsoring, outreaching to media, selling homemade things at local shops/associations) I raised more than 3000 euros in just three months to make the trip and donations to local projects possible."
