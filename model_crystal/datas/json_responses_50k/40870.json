In this study, the impacts of land use in Costa Rica are examined using functional diversity. Functional diversity is a multitrait, multidimensional approach to looking at species diversity in regards to traits and relative abundance. his study and the data collected provide a brief assessment of functional diversity as an indication of ecosystem function as well as a comparison of functional diversity based on land use and intensification, i.e., forested areas and agroforested organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica. Functional diversity generally decreases across a land intensification gradient, but implications of organic agroforestry in terms of functional diversity are also considered.  ",

Additionally, a fellow intern and I developed an H2 matrix based on IBL strategies for garden educators to evaluate and adapt their own lesson activities along IBL pedagogy.\n\nFor my Masters Thesis Project, I formed a project team of volunteer garden educators in the Natuur en Millieu Educatie Programma (Nature and Environment Education Program) to design, develop, and pilot test aspects of a school garden digital app as a case study.. The project team, led by me, utilised aspects of Teacher Design Team strategies as well as Design Thinking to explore and implement digital tools in support of garden education. The development of this app prototype sought to address discontinuity across the links between school, home, and the school garden with the aim of promoting better student and parent engagement.\n\nFor more information about either projects, please contact me. :)",
