    "summary": "I believe that the environmental challenges the world faces have never been greater or more complex. No one knows how much warming is \u201csafe\u201d, but we do know the climate crisis is already harming people and ecosystems around the globe. Recent events indicate that the climate crisis will face stronger political headwinds in the years ahead. I have always been passionate about connecting people, making people better and helping people to enjoy life more \u2013 I actually spent the last 20 years doing so, be it in a different setting. The climate crisis is going in directions that will reduce the quality of life for many and possibly most people, so whatever I can do to help reduce the problem simply makes me feel like I am giving something back.\n\nI am Managing Director Europe and Executive Board member at Acre. We are the undisputed market-leader in global Sustainability Executive Search, Recruitment and Advisory for more than 20 years and we have  built a community of talented, dedicated professionals who daily create social and environmental value, while promoting good business.\n\nAt Acre, we work with the most aspirational businesses with the potential to make real change; from those who are just starting out to those who are well on the journey to crafting a legacy. As pioneers of sustainability recruitment in 2003, we utilise our extensive global network, enabling us to provide talent solutions that are designed to deliver this change. We find talented people and develop their skills to make a true impact in ambitious, progressive organisations. The result? Businesses equipped to build resilience, adapt and manage the risks involved in tackling climate change.\n\nIn addition to my role at Acre, I am Climate Reality Leader for the Climate Reality Project, a diverse group of passionate individuals who have come together to solve the greatest challenge of our time, founded by Nobel Peace prize laureate and former US Vice President Mr. Al Gore. We are activists, cultural leaders, organisers, scientists, and storytellers committed to building a sustainable future together.\n\nI have been a non-exec director for A.I.I. Greeninvest, a boutique investment firm based in Athens, Greece and committed to creating a greener and a more sustainable world. Currently open to other NED roles. And finally, I am a passionate vegan triathlete.",
