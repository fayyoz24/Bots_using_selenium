I've always strived to learn more and become flexible enough at coding to create a unique, reusable, and generic paradigm within the language I'm actively using. My latest journey and challenge is to learn as much as I can about architectural designs, implementations, and integrations and implement pure, cost-effective, and reusable architectural designs on the AWS Stack.",

They strive to improve themselves through hard work and constant studying.\n\nSecond & Third Year:\nI used the second & third years to explore new paths, study new material, and apply previous bare-metal experience into an innovative cloud sector.\nFrom creating architectures for front-end projects (Gulp). Backend projects (Lambda) and full architecture designs and implementations on the AWS Cloud Stack (Serverless). Up to date, I designed about 7 Serverless Architectural designs and implementations, created a new methodology called Micro-Architectures, and have worked on about 10 to 15 projects. The internal components for these architectures range from basic S3 and Lambda structures to more advanced Bots, Async Queue systems, and machine learning implementations.\n\nFirst Year:\nThis year was used to get an in-depth perspective on most of Swipe's products, Explore the coding patterns and restrictions used within these projects, Learning how each developer within the teams prefer to approach problems/solutions and to apply my coding parameters and experience on new projects to improve old, incorrect or deprecated standards and infrastructures. \n\nTeam:\nThe Swipe IX team is impressive. Up to date, I've worked with front-end developers, back-end developers, and an architecture developer. What I've learned is that the team is passionate about improving themselves, learn more, and improve their skills in not only their assigned departments but different departments all over Swipe. There were some bumps in the road with bad implementation, but that's the learning process, today I'm glad to say that we ironed those bumps out and the team synergy is more significant than ever.\n\nDuties: -- Limited Characters --",
