    "summary": "Thanks for your visit!\n\nI am very happy with my choice for the bachelor study in Liberal Arts and Sciences. That study taught me to think critically about challenging problems from different angles in order to arrive at holistic solutions.\n\nBy analyzing I like to create an overview to know why I do something and what is the most strategic and efficient way to achieve my goals.\n\nI keep a close eye on innovations and new developments and I look very practically at how I can implement these in my own work to optimize processes within the company or my own actions.\nI am very result-oriented, so by creating an overview, integrating new developments, and analyzing processes, I can achieve good results with targeted strategies.\n\nAn example of this is the efficient turnover growth of uitgetypt.nl of more than 40% under my leadership, while at the same time reducing overhead hours by 50%. Uitgetypt.nl was rewarded in 2018 with the FD Gazelle label (Dutch recognition for growth).\n\nAs a person, I am very curious and I like to learn something new every week. With the new skills and knowledge, I hope to have a positive impact on the people around me, society, or nature. I also like to connect different people and ideas, the creativity that comes with it gives me a lot of energy. A nice interplay between inspiring and being inspired.\n\nI always enjoy meeting new people and exchanging thoughts. If you are interested in a (virtual) cup of coffee, please send me a message at matthijsbookelmann@routecirculair.nl\n\nInterests: Biomimicry, creativity, innovation & innovation processes, minimalism, doughnut economics, social entrepreneurship, circular economy, nature, ecosystems, resilience, data-driven decision-making, and strategy.\n\nExperience with: entrepreneurship, innovation, data-driven decision-making, SMEs, customer development, operations management, strategy, workshops.",

SMEs are critical to regional economies but their capacity for success can be limited by insufficient access to data and the inability to analyse data to drive innovation and improved results. FBD aims to strengthen those SMEs and foster innovativeness in the partner regions.\n\nFBD will work with SMEs in partner regions in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, sharing knowledge, ideas and regional experiences to support SMEs to become more data-driven and better informed about the economic, technological, policy and supply changes that will shape their futures. FBD will create a virtual transnational horizon-scanning and knowledge transfer (HSKT) hub connecting 6 hubs in the partner regions to support sustainable SME growth, innovation and productivity.",
