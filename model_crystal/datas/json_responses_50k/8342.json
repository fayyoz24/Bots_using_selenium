    "summary": "Considerate and conscientious team player who has a high level of creativity, resilience, curiosity and \neagerness for knowledge. \n\nBesides an internal pursuit of field-expanding research, passionate about the clinical field of Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine. Furthermore, I am also interested in coding and the subsequent technical applications, partially as a left-over from my previous study in Computer Science. The digital era we live in, and notably with its rapid pace of development, is what makes me believe that e-medicine will transform healthcare. In the future, I would love to act as a bridge between physicians and the implementation of such technical applications. \n\nWhen I\u2019m not at work and in denial about having a social life, I am pretending (and only just that) to be a decent tennis player or race cyclist, watching history documentaries, planning my next trip abroad or diving into the emerging world of e-sports.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201cIf you believe, you can go a long way in life and I did that: I kept believing\u201d - Roger Federer, Wimbledon 2017",

We also endeavoured to embed evidence-based approaches and ethical debates within our events. \n\nIt was more than a pleasure to serve this society and its members. We\u2019ve managed to host over ten events with great success, including workshops, masterclasses and symposia! I would like to wish the upcoming boards all the best.",
