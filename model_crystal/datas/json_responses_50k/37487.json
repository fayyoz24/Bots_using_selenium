With the emergence of cocos as a substrate in the 1980s, the need arose to have control over quality, product developments and delivery reliability. From this realization, Shakti Cocos B.V. is one of the first companies in the world to have started with own production factories in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the headoffice in The Netherlands and local partners on the own production facilities in India and Sri Lanka, Shakti Cocos B.V. focuses on the production and development of Coir Substrates. Next to the standard ways of production and packing, Shakti Cocos B.V. is specialized in custom made sollution for mixes, treatments and packing.\n\nOne of the inventions of Shakti Cocos B.V. is Shakti Amla\u00ae, Cocos with a low pH. This makes substrates of pure cocos suitable for crops that require a low pH such as Blueberry, Raspberry and many others.\n\nCheck what Shakti Cocos B.V. can do for you on www.ShaktiCocos.com and contact us via info@ShaktiCocos.com",
