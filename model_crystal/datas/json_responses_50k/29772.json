    "summary": "A purpose-driven HR Professional with a diverse international background.\n\nAfter finishing my high school studies at a math and science gymnasium in Bulgaria, I left my comfort zone and departed for my bachelor's studies at the University of Bradford (the UK) in Human Resource Management.\nWhile studying, I worked at Google as a Sales Representative, as a student job. In 2019, I successfully finished my studies and wanted to experience the working environment in Bulgaria in the field of HR.\n\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I realised that this is the perfect time to further grow my personal and professional competencies with a Master's degree, which can complement my highly-specific bachelor's studies and help me pursue my goal of being a leading figure in the HR world.\n\nOnce again, I challenged myself by moving to the Netherlands to follow a MSc degree in International Business and Management at the University of Groningen. After 2.5 years of a Pre-MSc, an internship at Tesla as an HR Coordinator, and my MSc study, I successfully completed this chapter of my life.\n\nAt the moment, I am building my experience in the field of HR, and learning Dutch to fully integrate into the Netherlands.",
