    "summary": "I help startups and scaleups differentiate and scale through innovative business design, marketing & strategy.\n\nHaving had over a decade working as both an intrapreneur and entrepreneur leading product development, marketing, and innovation teams inside international companies and startup environments, I know first-hand the struggles of getting products to market and building viable business models and brands to support them. \u200b\n\nThroughout my career, I've successfully managed dozens of new products, brands and businesses from startup to multi-million dollars per year in revenue. I have a first class honours degree in marketing, and have also been trained in design thinking, design sprints and workshop facilitation techniques through top institutes and training bodies including IDEO, Google Ventures, and Strategyzer.\u00a0\n\n\u200bI have a collaborative and inclusive style to my work. I emphasise the importance of customer insights and validation early, and incorporate this as part of my consulting work.\n\nOriginally from New Zealand, I now help companies from around the world virtually from my Amsterdam based location.\n\nFeel free to get in touch about: \n* Customer empathy and developing consumer insights\n* Developing go-to-market strategies\n* Market validation and testing\n* Market positioning, brand and marketing strategy\n* Business Model Innovation.  \u200b\n\nhello@saskiathornton.com\n+31 636 11 57 20",
