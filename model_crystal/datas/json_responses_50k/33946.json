    "summary": "International Head of HR, Talent Acquisition Director and HR freelancer for Senior level HR positions.\n\nWith my 15 years of strong international experience, I bring a wealth of global best practices which can help shape and structure your organization and/or HR department. The last 10 years I have worked with C-suite / Exco members and directors, thus I am accustomed to advise and support at those levels, however I am comfortable working across all levels of the organization.\n\nLiving and working in 7 countries has given me a tremendous amount of adaptability and flexibility. Skills which come in handy when starting-up and scaling organizations. I have experienced it all: from the start-up where I was the very first hire - who put the HR department and all hires in place - to the scale up with hypergrowth - +2000 people in 2 years - to strategic business partnering in mature FTS500 multi-nationals.\n\nWith my 10+ years of experience working in the United Arab Emirates, I am very familiar with Middle-Eastern (working) culture and labor laws.\n\nI bring a unique blend of International, European and Middle-Eastern experience to the table and practice HR at a strategic / tactic level. In addition, I\u2019m quite entrepreneurial and ambitious, currently running my own company in the Netherlands where I offer freelance HR consulting services (however I am available globally). The business always enjoys this commercial mindset from an HR professional. I\u2019m focused on results and deliverables and come with excellent recommendations. \n\nI enjoy organizational design, Strategic international HR Management, setting up Talent Acquisition functions, diversity & Inclusion, wellbeing and women\u2019s wellness. In addition, I also provide (career) coaching and corporate workshops/lectures around requested topics.\n\nAre you looking for your next HR director, Talent Acquisition Director or do you have an exciting HR freelance assignment? Then to not hesitate to reach out!",
