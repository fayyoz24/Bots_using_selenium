    "summary": "Bart ter Haar Romeny (1952) is emeritus professor in Biomedical Image Analysis at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands.\n\nHis research interests focus on:\n\u2022\tfundamental computer vision research into robust algorithms for medical image analysis, and make them work in practice; \n\u2022\tmulti-modal and interactive 3D visualization, with special attention to diffusion tensor imaging of brain connections and networks; \n\u2022\tblindness prevention, in particular by diabetes screening from retina fundus images.\n\u2022\timage guided surgery, directed towards deep-brain stimulation in neurosurgery\n\nHe received the MSc degree in Applied Physics from Delft University of Technology in 1978, PhD from Utrecht University in 1983 in biophysics. He was co-founder and associate professor at the Image Sciences Institute (ISI) of Utrecht University (1989-2001). From 2001-2017 ter Haar Romeny was professor in Biomedical Image Analysis at Eindhoven University of Technology, and from 2011-2017 also distinguished professor at Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. \n\nHe is inspired by trying to understand the fundamental mathematics of vision in the brain, and applying the results. He authored a widely used interactive tutorial book on multi-scale computer vision techniques (written in Mathematica), edited a book on non-linear diffusion in computer vision and is involved in (resp. initiated) a number of international collaborations on these subjects. He is author of over 250 refereed journal and conference papers, 12 books and book chapters, and holds 3 patents. He supervised many PhD students, of which 6 graduated cum laude. \nTill mid 2022 he was President of the Dutch Society for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing and has been President of the Dutch Society for Biophysics & Biomedical Engineering and the Dutch Society of Clinical Physics. He is reviewer for many journals, conferences and science foundations, and organized many international Summer Schools. \nHe is senior member of IEEE, Fellow of EAMBES, Honorary Chair professor at the National Taiwan University for Science and Technology, associate member and visiting professor at the Chinese Brainnetome consortium, Governing Board member of IAPR, and chairman of the Dutch Society for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing.\nProf. Romeny is a gifted speaker, and has delivered many keynote lectures at major international conferences and workshops. He annually teaches the Dutch national PhD course in brain-inspired computer vision.",
