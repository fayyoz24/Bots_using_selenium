This method is being used successfully in many applications and for a significant amount of time. The limitations, however, of this approach is that gradient descent can suffer from local minima problems.  To overcome this problem in this project training of neural networks using evolutionary algorithms is explored. The networks are built from scratch in MATLAB. Initial results indicate that training using EA's is better for a small set of features.  For larger feature sets, the results are not so promising. There is, however, a large scope for hybrid training (combining EA+BPSGD) using hyperparameter tuning and parameter control techniques. Also, performance for various activation functions can be explored, particularly, the variants of RELU. CUDA implementation for speeding up the genetic algorithm computations is also done.\n\nKey Concepts and Technologies: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO), NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), Back Propagation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (BPSGD), MATLAB, speed up with GPU, Python.

Interference data collected from experiments conducted inside a car under various scenarios has been analyzed, and modeled using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The objective of the project is to use these models to simulate realistic and dynamic interference effects, which can later be used to develop scheduling algorithms to mitigate the effects and improve Packet Reception Ratio (PRP).\n\nKey Concepts: Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Wireless interference,  Bit Error Rate, Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), MATLAB.",

Testing is done by comparing outputs from actual software with those obtained from simulations in a virtual model under identical input conditions. Developed libraries for auto generation of test case documents and automation scripts from the data obtained from simulations, which are used to interact with machine software in Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) testing. Developed Simulink libraries and flow charts to simplify development of a virtual model. \n\n\tAbove process is knowledge driven in contrast to the previously followed data-driven approach in the formation of automation scripts, thus making them more maintainable and adaptable to changes, thereby improving overall stability in the process.",
