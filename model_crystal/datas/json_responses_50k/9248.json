    "summary": "I am a highly motivated and goal-oriented team player with 1 year of experience working as a Data Protection Officer for an American company operating within the European Union, specifically in France and Ireland. I hold a bachelor's degree in European Law, with Privacy as one of my core subjects. My educational background has equipped me with strong analytical, attention to detail, and writing skills. I am also proficient in Microsoft Office products (Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, Excel, and Outlook).\nThroughout my work experience, I have developed essential skills in effective time management, organizational abilities, multitasking, adaptability, and leadership. Given my involvement in confidential situations, maintaining confidentiality has become second nature to me. Furthermore, my diverse experiences have fostered a proactive and dynamic attitude, along with a client-oriented and rigorous approach to my work.\nIn my most recent role, I communicate fluently in both English and French and have gained expertise in using CNIIL software (PIA) and performing a Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIA). Additionally, I will officially become a certified Data Protection Officer having successfully completed the DPO Certification course at Maastricht University.",
