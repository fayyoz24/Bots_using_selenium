    "summary": "I am an inquisitive and a frank person, eager to learn in Automotive industry. I am fervent about automotive technology and my interests are aligned towards ensuring the automotive safety by adhering to the safety standards.\n\nI constantly think of ways to improve the mobility landscape and make it safer and affordable. Love the idea of working in a start up / own startup, because it gives me freedom to pave my own way and vision. \n\nCurrently dedicating my time on - Intelligent Mobility to make Autonomous driving safer, EV landscape and Vehicle Integration. \nThe new technology and what we develop, surely is going to have a big impact in the direction of different ways of developing Autonomous Driving. \n\nI share the same thought of making this world a better place to live in for the future. My only wish is that I never stop learning and explore as much as I can. A firm believer of, future beholds great things!\n\n\"\u200b It isn't a question of profit vs non- profit. It is about, how do we live?\"\u200b   \n",
