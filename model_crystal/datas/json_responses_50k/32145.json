    "summary": "It is not my goal to improve the world, I'm just a thinker. Contributing ideas and sharing thoughts is what keeps me busy these days. Not because I think my thoughts are true, but because it makes other people think which then benefits my thinking. This way we all move forward together.\n\nAs former CEO of an Online Marketing Agency (Traffic4u) and a Development company (bGenius), I\u2019ve been able to work closely with many nice and bright young people. I\u2019ve learned a lot with and from them. But what I have also noticed is that our current education system provides our youth with a lot of theoretical knowledge, but it does not teach them how to think for themselves. I think this is a missed opportunity. \n   In our rapidly changing society, in which the concept of authority has nearly disappeared, and in a time when legal rights seem to be more important than moral obligations, I feel being able to think is an important skill for survival. I advocate a human world instead of a digital one.\n\nEvery person can think him- or herself into a depression, but the challenge is to think yourself happy. I am certain this is something anyone can master with the right help.\n",

Both leading digital marketing companies within the Dutch market. As CEO I've been able to give guidance to talented young people and together with them I've been able to build strong companies in which knowledge, quality service and customer satisfaction are fundamental values. I'm very proud of the things we've achieved together. \n \nI've always been convinced that the development of talent is a key aspect of growing a sustainable business. Being able to flourish talent is extremely important and it's something in which one should invest continuously. That is what we have been doing and because of that, Traffic4u and bGenius have grown into two mature companies, with great innovative capacities and an impressive list of clients in online fashion, retail and travel.\n \nI can look back on an exciting career within a extremely dynamic organization and a very inspiring environment. I got the chance to develop both my professional and my personal skills in a way that has made me the professional I am today. The knowledge and experience which I have gained, I would like to use to help start-ups.",
