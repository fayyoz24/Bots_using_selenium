    "summary": "I am a physical geographer specialised in GIS and Remote Sensing. I've been lecturing since I obtained my MSc in Physical Geography at Utrecht University in 2002. During my PhD about the integration of remote sensing in spatial dynamic modelling of soil moisture I got experienced in Python and using the PCRaster framework for map algebra, dynamic modelling and data assimilation.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012 I worked at the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) as a researcher in spatial dynamic environmental modelling. I participated in projects related to water quality modelling, land-use change modelling and the use of remote sensing for urban applications.\n\nSince April 2012 I am appointed as senior lecturer in ecohydrological modelling at IHE Delft. In my teaching I actively promote the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and open data by young professionals in the Global South and help them to become innovative entrepreneurs. \n\nI'm currently involved in many research and capacity development projects such as projects for the implementation of spatial data infrastructures (SDI) for sharing open access data, Citizen Observatories and remote sensing for water productivity and water accounting. I'm also coordinating eLearning support for IHE Delft partners and am coordinating the IHE Delft Professional Training Programme.\n\nAs a QGIS Certified Lecturer I develop OpenCourseWare, Online courses, short courses and tailor made trainings in GIS. I'm first author of the book QGIS for Hydrological Applications - recipes for catchment hydrology and water management. I actively participate in the QGIS and FOSS4G community and a board member of the Dutch QGIS User Group. In April 2022 I established QWAST-GIS to offer coaching, consultancy and training on open source GIS.",

There are many but fragmented initiatives and networks in place, therefore we will not create new but will consolidate existing networks of scientists, decision makers, practitioners, citizens and other key stakeholders into an effective, problem-focused knowledge sharing mechanism via an overall coordination platform: the Africa-EU Innovation Alliance for Water and Climate. We will support them in identifying appropriate social innovation and technological solutions for key water and climate change challenges. We will take Africa-EU cooperation in this field to a practical level by sharing (non)technological innovation for local challenges, thus also identifying and boosting sustainable market and investment opportunities. Demand-driven, problem-focused Action Groups will share knowledge between the identified stakeholders and networks at all scales to effectively identify and address vulnerabilities. We will make extensive use of existing/emerging communication channels and events (EU/African platforms, conferences, social media) to streamline Climate Change issues into water-related networks to raise awareness about their impacts and propose adaptation measures.\nWe will re-enforce and valorise Water and Climate Change research and social innovation (R&I) cooperation between Africa and Europe through a mix of forward-looking and bottom-up innovation and road mapping techniques. We will identify demands, opportunities, and constraints at different levels and develop strategic advice (short term demand-driven R&I outlook and long term R&I agenda) for improving Africa-EU collaboration. This will help policy makers to create a consistent approach to bilateral cooperation between Africa and the EU in the field of innovation for water and climate.",

Ground Truth 2.0 will demonstrate the technological feasibility, the sustained use and the societal and economic benefits of such citizen observatories. The ultimate objective is the global market uptake of the concept and enabling technologies.\n\nThe thematic focus of the project is on flora and fauna as well as water availability and water quality for land and natural resources management. Ground Truth 2.0 uses validated mobile apps and social media analytics to collect explicit and implicitly sensed citizen data. As such, citizens (and not just scientists and professionals) are enabled to share data about the environment and to take on a new, crucial role in environmental monitoring, decision making, cooperative planning and environmental stewardship. A movement from data sharing to knowledge sharing.\n\nGround Truth 2.0 will use a trans-disciplinary methodology which recognises the importance of real-life interactions between people and technology to shape a successful system. This methodology brings together the social dimensions of citizen observatories with their enabling technologies, so that the customisation and deployment is tailored to the envisaged societal and economic impacts of the respective observatories.\n\nGround Truth 2.0 builds on various citizen observatories as well as earth observation and land-use modelling projects undertaken with participation of Ground Truth 2.0 consortium partners. The consortium partners present a good mix of industry, SME, NGO, government, research and academia to ensure the worldwide commercialisation of the Ground Truth 2.0 concept. Ground Truth 2.0 is led by UNESCO-IHE and is running for 3 years. The project is funded by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 689744.",

This goal is consistent with the HE system reform adopted in Maghreb universities (MA, DZ, TN). Through this JP Maghreb and EU Universities will integrate academic community and will lead to more effective transfer of knowledge, teaching/research skills-methods from EU partners to PC. The objectives of the project are planned to be achieved by development of new courses on open source modeling using Maghreb partners experience and needs and EU partners advanced technologies. The Maghreb hydroplatform will be created in Maghreb and accessible online for Maghreb & EU partners for PhD course trainings, perform studies, water project design and share data via SDI. Relevant capacity building activities are foreseen to support the newly created hydroplatform and to train Maghreb teachers: staff mobilities, new courses, teaching laboratories & library resources upgrading. Target groups of students and staff will follow the programs through mobilities; and first group of this study program will graduate from partner universities, during project implementation and after the project end to ensure sustainability. The sustainability of the project results will be ensured by incorporating the new courses into partner universities and new trainings for available water centres in the 3 MAG countries. Government support will cover costs of teaching/maintenance and further resources are ensured from offered trainings to water \ncompanies.",

It will integrate available global earth observations (EO), in-situ datasets and models and will construct a global water resources re-analysis dataset of significant length (several decades). The resulting data will allow for improved insights on the full extent of available water and existing pressures on global water resources in all parts of the water cycle. The project will support efficient and globally consistent water management and decision making by providing comprehensive multi-scale (regional, continental and global) water resources observations. It will test new EO data sources, extend existing processing algorithms and combine data from multiple satellite missions in order to improve the overall resolution and reliability of EO data included in the re-analysis dataset. The usability and operational value of the developed data will be verified and demonstrated in a number of case-studies across the world that aim to improve the efficiency of regional water distribution. The case-studies will be conducted together with local end-users and stakeholders. Regions of interest cover multiple continents, a variety of hydrological, climatological and governance conditions and differ in degree of data richness (e.g. the Mediterranean and Baltic region, Ethiopia, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh). The data will be disseminated though an open data Water Cycle Integrator portal to ensure increased availability of global water resources information on both regional and global scale. The data portal will be the European contributor to the existing GEOSS water cycle platforms and communities. Project results will be actively disseminated using a combination of traditional methods (workshops, papers, website and conferences) and novel methods such as E-learning courses and webinars that promote the use of the developed dataset.

This technology analyses a number of future risk factors starting from modelling through to assessing the political and socio-economic environment to recommend solutions, which are tailored to the local conditions. This technology has been pioneered and developed in the Netherlands and has been used around the world as a means of providing countries such as Benin with an effective way to safeguard itself against its water challenges.\n\nFor IWRM to be effective in managing Benin's water problems, having access to information is critical. A core element of the delta technology approach that supports this is that of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI), which acts as a water information hub. This information hub will offer the capability to streamline and share real time data that will be available for all relevant stakeholders in the Benin water sector. This enables more effective IWRM and forward planning to help prevent future water events from causing damage and hardship for the population.\n\nThis technical assistance was in the frame of the Multi Annual Strategic Plan 2014-2017 of the Dutch Embassy in Benin.",

The project started 1st May 2009 and will last 56 months until 2013. The project will develop innovative rehabilitation technologies for soil, groundwater and surface water to cope with a number of different priority contaminants (nitrates, pesticides, chlorinated compounds, aromatic compounds, mixed pollutions\u2026) within heavily degraded water systems. Methods will be developed to determine the (long-term) impact of the innovative rehabilitation technologies to reduce pollution to river and groundwater receptors. The project will promote the uptake of successful technologies for use in river basin management measures. One of the major outcomes of the project will be a generic river basin management tool that assesses the ecological and economical impact of rehabilitation technologies on the water system at both local and regional scales.",

Research will focus on two urban areas in Europe (Dublin, Istanbul), which are part of the MOLAND project. Both high-resolution (HR) satellite data, as well as medium-resolution (MR) imagery will be used, separately and in combination, to improve the monitoring and modeling of urban change processes and their environmental impact, based on innovative land-use/land-cover mapping approaches, spatial metrics and spatial dynamic modeling.\n\nMajor objectives of the project are:\n\n- to improve the extraction of urban land-use/land-cover (LULC) information and elevation data from high- and medium-resolution satellite imagery;\n- to investigate how spatial metrics may contribute to a more detailed, more objective, and more generic representation of urban form and function;\n- to examine how spatial metrics derived from remotely sensed imagery may complement existing, detailed land-use maps in the calibration and validation of the MOLAND urban growth model;\n- to study the impact of urban dynamics on population distribution, landscape characteristics and hydrological run-off in the urban/rural interface.",
