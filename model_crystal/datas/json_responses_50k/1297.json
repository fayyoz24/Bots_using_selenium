As an independent consultant, I provided translation (Indonesian into English) and document editing services. \nMy main client was the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works. An example of a project I worked on was a planning guideline. This document was supposed to be accessible also for non-Indonesian speakers.  Because of my native English skills, I was hired to ensure that the language of the document used the correct English terminology and to reduce ambiguity. This shows that the ministry trusted me to ensure the confidentiality of the documents that I worked on.\nThe translation and editing skills that I honed during this job have helped me during my career as a researcher. In later jobs, I have used these skills to produce many English reports that were based on Indonesian data and vice versa.",
