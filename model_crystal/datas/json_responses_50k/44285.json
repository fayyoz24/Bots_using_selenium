    "summary": "I am a student came far away from Indonesia who decided to chase my dreams in the Netherlands. It was not because my family pushed me to study abroad, it's because I am willing and want to learn other's culture and thoughts. Making friends and being around of divers people are such a blessing for me. Nevertheless, study is a very important thing for me even though I love socializing.  These are the reasons why I take communication studies at Arnhem Business School.\n\nThese eagerness of learning other's culture makes me want to work at multicultural company where I can meet a lot of people from different countries and work with them and learning how to cope with different approaches to other's culture. Moreover, even though working at multicultural company requires me to adapt easily to culture, I believe that I am able to do that since I have been an International student for the past few years and counting.",

There are so many jokes that will light up the day and small talks that may lead us to a new idea for our work. Nonetheless, Lightyear has taught me to work in a structural way.
