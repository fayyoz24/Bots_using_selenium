    "summary": "I am an MSc. Aerospace Engineering graduate from the Delft University of Technology, specialising in the Aerodynamics field with particular focus on the computational aspect. Besides this, I also have a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering which has given me a wider perspective.\n\nI have experience in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction, doing both my Master thesis and internship projects in this field. My electives include fluid-structure interactions, numerical analysis and scientific programming, giving me a strong background in the field. While my interest mainly lies in the numerical aspect, I also have experience with the experimental part, having performed wind tunnel tests using PIV, hot wire anemometry and also tests for aerodynamic coefficient calculations on a scaled airplane model. \n\nI am an enthusiastic learner and am able to work both independently and in teams. I have worked on group projects with multicultural teams, both as part of my Masters and as a fellow of the Melton Foundation, which aims to promote diversity. I also have writing experience, having worked for 2.5 years as an editor of the Leonardo Times department magazine which has a circulation of 5500 copies both within the department and in the industry. \n\nI like to play an active role in my surrounding and have been on the board of the AWEP (Aerodynamics, Wind Energy and Propulsion) Society and helped organise various events here, as well as during my bachelors when I took an active role in organizing the annual college fests,  and conferences and other events with the Melton Foundation. I also enjoy working with people and have volunteered as an English teacher and tutor in the non-profit group, U&I. \n\nI hope to use both my academic and non-academic skills to have a positive impact on my work, colleagues and clients. \n ",

The method was based on radial basis function interpolation with additional degrees of freedom given to the generally static boundary nodes such that they can slide along the boundary and reduce skewing of the internal mesh. \n\n- There were two alternative methods developed to allow sliding of the boundaries which were compared to the original RBF method in terms of mesh quality and computational time. I optimised the method with a Greedy control point selection algorithm to improve the computational efficiency, which resulted in the sliding method produced much improved mesh qualities within acceptable computation times.\n\n- The results and details are expected to be highly beneficial to FSI and imposed motion computations. I am currently working getting the work published in a scientific journal. \n\n- This independent project required a good understanding of the mathematics of the radial basis function and the boundary conditions needed to allow for sliding, as well as extensive programming skills. I also performed an extensive literature review prior to commencing the project to determine what path the work should take. \n\nAn electronic version of the thesis report can be found at : http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:75f3e25a-b991-4e85-ab8a-736a32383bb5",

It was specifically aimed at regions with a high amount of sunlight. Unlike conventional solar devices that work by converting solar energy to electrical energy (photo-voltaic cells), this refrigerator was based on the principle of variable adsorption of the refrigerant, methanol, by activated charcoal depending on the temperature.\n\nThe activated charcoal was placed in a solar collector. During the night at cooler temperatures, it would adsorb the methanol. During the day, when heated up due to the solar radiation, this methanol would be released by the activated charcoal and would flow into pipes by means of valves. The methanol was then expanded through an orifice to cool it and used in turn to cool the supplies placed in the refrigerator. The now evaporated methanol would return to the collector to be readsorbed by the charcoal. The entire cycle takes 24 hours.\n\nI worked on the project in a team with two other students. We based the design of previous similar designs but modified it based on materials available easily. The design was fabricated and then we tested its performance under various (weather and temperature conditions). Cooling was successfully achieved particularly on warmer days.",

I volunteered to be the coordinator for the two day event at my college. The aim of the campaign was to reach out to college students to make them aware of the ill effects of smoking.\n\nI was the sole point of contact between IITB and my college and had to organize the event with no outside help, which meant getting permissions, organizing the venue and getting volunteers to help out with the event. \n\nThe event also featured a doodle making contest, which made it to the Limca Book of World Records for the most doodles in one campaign."
