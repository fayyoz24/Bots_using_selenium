The goal of my workshops is to inspire, guide, and educate people about the world of scents. We, humans, put a lot of conscious focus on our sight, taste, touch, sound, but not on our sense of smell. While using certain techniques, exercises, and smelling essential oils, aroma chemicals, perfumes, I help to enhance and be more aware of the sense of smell, and at the same time bond, connect with scented memories. I also share a lot of tips& tricks and other interesting facts about perfumes/essential oils, etc. \n\nNext to the workshops, I also run my own Instagram account/blog. It focuses on my passion: perfumes. I create visual content, write reviews, share knowledge and my passion about the perfume world while trying to engage, educate and grow my audience by using various different strategies & tools (Canva, Planoly, etc.). In a year, I managed to reach >1000 followers.\n\nSee more: https://www.instagram.com/how_to_scent_it/",
