    "summary": "I am a Computer Science BSc graduate and software developer based in Barcelona.\n\nMy love for video games sparked my interest in computer science and programming. Before pursuing my bachelor's degree, I learned how to work with the Unity game engine and got my first coding experience.\n\nRecently, I've been focusing on backend and cloud development as a full-stack developer. I enjoy building robust and scalable systems that enhance user experiences and power applications.\n\nBesides my professional interests, I enjoy outdoor activities such as snowboarding, skateboarding, surfing, hiking, and attending live music and sports events.\n\nCurrently, I'm looking for new software development opportunities in Barcelona and remotely.",

I couldn't spend too much time on actual features and the fun factor because I had only around a week to work on it, but nevertheless working on games is always a blast!",
