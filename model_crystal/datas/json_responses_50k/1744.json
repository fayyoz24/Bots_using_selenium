    "summary": "Before I had a very well described summary here about me as a finance professional and manager with extensive experience in general ledger accounting, Procure-To-Pay,  asset accounting, VAT regulations, finance & compliance reporting, lean practices and financial accounting. All focusing on my knowledge and not so much on me as a person.\n\nNow I identify myself as a true people manager who can value the personal needs of my staff while managing the companies KPI's and results. And I\u2019m proud to be achieving my results as a manager and have had no unplanned attrition in my teams, just people moving into their next career step that I helped to guide them into.\n\nThe wellbeing of my staff is of great value to me, as when my staff is happy they are energized and eager to work and put their best effort in to the day to day job.  And the outcome, the results are there seamlessly. I succeed as manager if my team succeeds in their jobs, and otherwise it is my responsibility as a manager to provide the necessary tools to achieve the desired results. \nI describe myself as being different, caring about mental health at the workplace while applying a strong lean mindset into how I manage the daily workload, projects or tasks assigned to me or my team. \n\nBeing flexible and eager to learn new things makes me almost like a chameleon and I guide my team through these changes while encouraging them also to look better to what they like and dislike and ensure they choose their right career path. Making your own choices and not just go with the flow has so many benefits although it requires a lot of strength to often step into the unknown.",
