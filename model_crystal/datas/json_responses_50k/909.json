Stores layouts are kept simple and marketing activities are kept to a minimum. Because of the buying power ALDI is able to buy from renowned suppliers at the best conditions and prices. These advantages are passed on to the customer. With this concept ALDI is able to reach that one and only goal: offer best private label products at low prices. \n\nMy role at ALDI was to maximize the results of the six supermarkets in the area I was responsible for. I was accountable for the operating of the branch leaders and for improvement of the operational functioning of the individual branches. More turnover with less staffing costs was my main challenge; therefore, I had to motivate branch leaders to achieve tight goals, which I formulated in a detailed sales planning.",
