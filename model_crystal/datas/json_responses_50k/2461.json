Everyone talks to a avatar, rather than against a real life face with real emotions. \n\nIn reality, the clothes you wear determines the identity which people will see from the outside. By creating the translation of the 'digital identity' of the internet into clothes, the identity that emerges on the internet appears in real life. 'The Social media sweaters' consists of a series of three sweaters. The first sweater shows my  'digital' database of friends, the second sweater shows all the pictures I'm tagged in and pictures I've placed by myself and the third sweater shows important information from me and texts I have said through social media.",

We used the index of his book The Value of Void volume one, in which 9 chapters were crossed and used these chapters to create a grid which represented the second volume of The Value of Void. These 9 chapters in the grid formed new chapters, which we filled with sources of inspiration, studies and with elements which he has listed as his own periodical system. New worlds are revealed for the visitors to fantasise about. What can it become, what will it be. The unwritten chapters are written and presented without the presence of Navid Nuur. And he definitely was impressed when he saw his ficitional legacy when it was finished.  ",

The exhibition existed from a few things like a table, a Froebel Gift box, a gown, a few gloves and two performers. These performers told stories about the objects in their wallets (which are specially made for the exhibition at our art residency Frans Masereel Centre in Kasterlee, Belgium). Communication and to be more precise: speech, is a very important factor in this exhibition. \n\nFor this exhibition I worked as a performer and as a graphic designer on the communication.  For the communication I designed an image with two cartoon clouds. One from an old and popular Belgian cartoon figure Kuifje and one modern one, the talk cloud we all know from Whatsapp. I also designed a typeface. \n\nhttp://www.danadijkgraaf.nl/miscellaneous/all-the-knives/   ",

They are focused on sharing knowledge about culture & design (graphic, interaction, product, fashion), and invite well known and young designers from the field to present their ideas or work. Next to designers, they also invite other peoples when it fits the subject (journalists, philosophers etc). \n\nAs a member of the program board, I help to form the program of speakers and themes for the year."

It's my belief, that when you create  a campaign for a rather sad subject, you better can seek attention with humor and beauty than showing the obvious and show something sad.  "
