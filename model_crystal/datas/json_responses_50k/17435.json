Buzz is not something that you can see or smell. But you will notice when buzz is around, because people will talk about it. That's why buzz can be a great tool to communicate a message. And that's exactly what The Buzz Club strives for. Buzz won't make you walk on the moon like Buzz Aldrin, but buzz will definitely give your brand a reason to exist and stand out from the crowd. \n\nWe are a creative agency based in Breda and we give identity to brands and products. In another ways, we create buzz. And we are a club because we believe the best way to do this is with support of creative soldiers out of the field. Are you a soldier that wants to join our club? Or are you scratching your head for buzz? We love to hear from you!\n\nwww.thebuzzclub.nl",
