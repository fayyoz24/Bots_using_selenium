    "summary": "I am a motivated, adaptable and responsible junior landscape designer.\n\nI've graduated cum laude bachelor in Politecnico di Milano july 2017, and concluded my master degree in landscape architecture at TUDelft in june 2020.\n\nI\u2019ve chosen to study in English with the goal of achieving a broad international outreach.\nThis choice increased the quality and relevance of my qualifications and skills, boosted my personal development and my work prospects, getting me in contact with the artistic environment of different countries, with similar codes but different backgrounds, surroundings and cultures.\n\nMy prior commitment is to make it possible for me to attain high level results at international \nlevel in those fields that I prefer, that is mainly concerned with art and music.\nMy reliability, communication skills, responsibility and friendly nature are assets I would bring\nwith me. \n\nI\u2019m inquiring, reliable and gained good experience in working as part of a team.\nAs i have been playing drums in different projects during the last nine years I\u2019ve developed both \nthe: ability to work independently, to solve problems working in a team and to focus deeply on \nthe work led.\n\nIn 2015 I took part to Resiliant routes Chicago Charette, a workshop on social recovery of a neighborhood through interventions on its flows and public areas. My group focused on the theme of leisure and wellness.\n\nIn 2016 I've had the chance to participate to Critical Concrete's architectural social recovery project in Porto, Portugal, in 2016. I've worked there with a group of twenty architecture students to redesign and physically rebuild the house of an unemployed, physically troubled elder man. We were given a 5000\u20ac budget from the municipality and had to deal with restraints and limitations. Upcycling and direct contact with the client had been two of the most interesting aspects of this.",
