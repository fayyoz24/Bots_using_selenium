    "summary": "Coaching and training: www.groeiflow.nl  info@groeiflow.nl \n\nI am curious, positive minded, and ambitious, aiming to continue my personal and professional development. It motivates and inspires me to work on the edge of knowledge expansion that has an impact on, and relevance for, both theory and practice. \n\nAs a psychologist and researcher, I am interested in topics around creativity, flow, coaching, and new ways of working. The overarching theme in my work is creating an optimal fit between the individual\u2019s needs and the work context, to optimize work outcomes. \n\nAs a coach, my drive and specialism lies in guiding professionals towards more flow in work, and in stimulating them to take on the positive challenge that fits their qualities. Because when you are in your flow, you grow and perform optimally.",
