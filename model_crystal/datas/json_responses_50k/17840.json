    "summary": "I am an independent scholar, researcher, moderator, workshop facilitator and teacher. My main expertise is in the creation and facilitation of learning environments designed in such a way that they open up to new perspectives and aim to facilitate beneficial change.    \n\nPublic debate\nI earned an anthropology PhD on a study of the historical and cultural roots of our digital society, while living in the San Francisco Bay Area. After having seen how a small group of techies and entrepreneurs makes far-reaching decisions regarding the principles that shape the technologies billions of people use, my goal was to work on settings where larger groups of people would feel invited to form an opinion and to get involved. This resulted in a traveling series of brainstorms with key stakeholder organizations, the founding of Gr1p -  a non-profit that aims to contribute to a society in which more people get a better grip on their digital environment - and the creation of a documentary on the Smart City. I received the Public Sociology award for the way I combined this academic work with public engagement.   \n\nWorkshops\nI create and collaborate in workshop settings inviting different groups of stakeholders to find common ground in complex issues. One example is the Rotterdam municipality needing to figure out on what terms and with which technologies to digitize the city, balancing interests of privacy, profit-making and equality. Another example regards the dilemma of farmers seeking to implement sustainable farming while being limited by existing regulations and contracts. \n \nTeaching \nI organize an honours program for the University of Amsterdam where students are invited to reflect on the question of 'freedom' and how to use, design and implement technologies with this value at its core. With the Gr1p foundation we develop and organize multiple similar courses for different settings. ",

This film, that I co-produced with filmmaker Sara Blom, was generously funded by Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie and Stichting Democratie en Media. \n\nThe film discusses the ambition by several networks to turn Amsterdam into a Smart City: a city in which smart technologies will make it sustainable, safe and comfortable and that will enable citizens to have more control over their surroundings. We explore the connection between this dream and the dilemma\u2019s posed by the urban society of Amsterdam against it. The film contrasts the digital lifeworlds of different networks of people: from public-private organizations wanting to mark Amsterdam internationally as a Smart City, to citizens wanting to measure the air quality around their homes, to citizens who are not at all comfortable with digital machines. By zooming in on these contrasts, but foremost by emphasizing the shared experiences between these networks, the film calls for a broad discussion regarding power and disempowerment in the digital society.",

My particular research focused on the ways in which Californian dreams of the information society have become part of European future visions - as expressed for instance in de Digital Agenda for Europe and Horizon 2020. I wanted to understand how the sometimes abstract technological future visions become part of the everyday lives of people. I also sought to compare different institutional settings in which innovation takes place. For this I studied the co-creative development of a small 'air quality' sensing technology - the Air Quality Egg. Academic articles related to this research are forthcoming.",

This course was highly interactive and hands-on and involved many guest speakers from relevant fields. Guest speakers included Hans de Zwart, director of Bits of Freedom, Paulus Lips, medical practitioner and philosopher of medicine and risk, and Donna Metzlar, co-founder of the Genderchangers.\n\nSome of the questions we asked:\n* What are the social, material and ideological foundations that support the notion that \u2018we\u2019 live in the information society?\n* How is the information society lived in different regions of the world?\n* How do people across the world construct their notions of \u2018truth\u2019 in the information society and what kind of truths carry the farthest? \n* What does it mean to be politically active in the information society?\n* And what does it mean to conduct anthropological research in and of \u2018the information society\u2019? \n\nWe looked at subjects varying from transhumanism to ICT4D projects; from privacy-activist groups to technophobes, from high-tech spirituality to e-waste.\n\nBoth students and the board of the Anthropology department officially recognized our teaching as excellent.",
