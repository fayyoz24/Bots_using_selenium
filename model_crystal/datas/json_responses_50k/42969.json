Seeking to share my love for my Ukrainian heritage with others, I started this venture during my maternity leave as a safe haven during the hectic times in my country.\n\nDespite being a small business, I have established a loyal customer base and consistently make sales. I initially utilized e-commerce tools on Etsy, including SEO practices to increase visibility, and I am currently in the process of transitioning my sales to my own website to expand my reach and sell more independently. At Barvinok, sustainability is a top priority, and we use vintage candle jars and upcycled containers to minimize our environmental impact while offering unique and beautiful products to our customers.",
