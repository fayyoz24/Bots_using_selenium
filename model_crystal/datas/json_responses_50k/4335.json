It's designed to build a positive framework for conversations that can challenge stereotypes and prejudices through dialogue. Real people become Books to be loaned out to Readers, allowing Readers the opportunity to listen to their stories first-hand. Our aim is to create a safe space where conversations that may be difficult to have elsewhere can be facilitated here. Ultimately, we hope to contribute towards a more accepting and open society.\n\nI am part of the core team which organises Human Library Singapore, a community group that started sometime last year. I am in-charge of interviewing and curating new Books, handling the media, general event management and seeking for collaborations and partnerships with other organisations such as TedX and UN Women."
