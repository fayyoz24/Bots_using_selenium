    "summary": "During the last 20 years I have developed myself from an IT technical expert to an experienced Project Manager to a Program Manager in a wide spectrum of the Information and Communication Technology, with a strong affinity with Software Quality and Software Delivery. Over the last few years the project focus area expanded towards business driven projects, such as Compliance, Service Delivery and Patient Management.\n\nMy motivation has always been to look for solutions for a myriad of challenges from the perspective of a manager and leader, both in program management as in the technical arena, while closely working together with specialists.\n\nDue to my strong analytical capabilities I am able to quickly adapt to various industries and technologies.",

One of the initial projects was the preparation of the organization towards GDPR with a very clear and fixed deadline. The challenge in this project for Office Depot was the lack of a clear and complete overview of all applications and systems impacted by the data protection and privacy regulation changes. The coordination and planning of the investigation and inventory to get to such an artifact was therefore part of the scope of my project. \nBeside the GDPR project which touched basically every department and individual in the organization I managed a couple of other large scale projects in the Compliance domain, such as PCI Compliance and VAT regulation. I also managed projects in the Finance area, such as 445-to-MonthEnd reporting implementation and in the Supply Chain Management domain, such as the Import/Export process improvement project.",
