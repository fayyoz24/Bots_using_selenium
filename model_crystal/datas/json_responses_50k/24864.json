In order to develop a measuring procedure one must first identify all possible errors followed by the development of a mathematical model of the machine. In this report a HTM model is detailed. From the HTM, one can see the relationship between each carriage and their errors therefore allowing for the correction of the machine performance. Detailed procedures and set-ups for the measuring are also included along with work environment tests (egs. drift test) to ensure effectiveness of error measurement.",

It\u2019s Research and Development facilities are the only one in the country to be recognized by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India as a Research & Development Unit for mechanical seals\nThis cooler was designed as an accessory to mechanical seals in accordance with API Plan 21 and API Plan 23. The cooler was designed to work in natural convection mode as well as forced convection mode. It is intended to work in areas with strict environmental regulations regarding oil leaks and places where water shortage does not permit water based cooling. There was a severe lack of theoretical data available on such a configuration hence I've used ANSYS Fluent and  ANSYS ICEM CFD as design tools to estimate the required length of tube. I performed the simulation on a desktop computer I was only able to simulate the conditions over very small segment of the pipe as opposed to the entire helix. The forced convection simulation results predicted a temperature drop of 32\u00b0C",

In the team my specific role was to work on 3D modeling of the ATV and integration of the power pack with other systems of the vehicle. For the same reason I learnt different softwares like Catia (V5), AutoCAD (2006) and to some extent Ansys (Workbench 11) too! I was also responsible for tuning of the engine for maximum possible performance by altering the air-fuel ratio. At the 2007 competition my team was appreciated for innovative suspension design that incorporated features that helped us reduce travel required for the shock absorbers. Subsequently, at the 2009 competition my team won the 2nd prize for the most innovative vehicle. For this competition we had implemented hydraulic regenerative braking system that converted kinetic and heat energies lost during braking into potential energy using a hydraulic pump and accumulator. This energy could subsequently be given back to the power pack at the driver\u2019s discretion using a hydraulic motor and a remote trigger. To complement this design we had side-mounted the engine which was the first such attempt at Baja competitions. I was also the driver of our team. Even after completion of my four years of engineering studies I participated in the Baja SAEIndia 2010 competition. In this competition to improve the performance of the engine we had designed a special exhaust system which worked on the similar principle of an exhaust brake. This system improved our final engine output torque by 2N-m; a much needed gain for the hill climb event!",

A dock leveler is a loading ramp intended to bridge a gap between trucks of various heights and a Loading bay of a warehouse.\n\n I have used Microsoft office excel to perform calculations so as to achieve loading at various hinges as the forklift passes over this platform instead of assuming a steady maximum load. Based on these loads I managed to optimally select various components required. I also conducted research to determine various loading heights of the various models of trucks available in market in order to determine the optimum travel required for the platform. I have also conducted a kinematic simulation of to check for interferences. The key feature of this design is that it incorporates a double crank mechanism through which the lip of the leveler and the platform maintain a constant angle. This enables a smooth ride to and from the truck and reduces damage to goods being handled.",

These parameters help in early detection problems and reduce rework after final testing; I was assigned the task to reduce range of the values of these parameters so that the machine can be set show OK or NOT OK.  Once this is set the associate can determine to let the engine pass to the next station or to send it for rework.\n\tThe EFT machine is machine designed to measure Torque, Break away Torque, Oil Pressure  and many other parameters it is a cold test the main intention of this machine is to reduce or eliminate the hot tests  required as hot test requires 40 min to measure all parameters   & requires more resources compared to a cold test.

I this competition one can use individual stock parts but entire assemblies cannot be used, the mechanisms and the chassis have to be built by the students. The vehicle which completes the lap in the shortest time span wins. \nThe vehicle I constructed had a rear wheel drive front independent and rear dependent trailing arm suspension. The chassis was made of aluminum. To keep the Center of Gravity Balanced most of the aggregates were placed in the center. The throttle of the engine and steering was controlled by two radio operated Futaba Servos. To provide additional traction to the rear wheels I decided to place the battery pack slightly behind the rear wheels.\n\tI milled the entire chassis bearing blocks for the wheels on a HMT M1TR milling machine. I\u2019ve used Delrin (Polyoxymethylene, Polyformaldehyde) for the front lower arms to reduce overall weight \n\n",
