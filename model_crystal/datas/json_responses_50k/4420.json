    "summary": "I'm a fourth year bachelor student Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics at the Technical University of Eindhoven. I expect to be continuing to a master in theoretical physics in the upcoming year, where additionally I will focus on obtaining teaching degrees. Additionally, I'm part of the Honors Academy, an additional project in which real life problems are addressed and solved. Here, I focus mostly on programming and cybersecurity. Next to my studies, I have taken up a board year at the Honors Study Association Confluente, where I was chair of the association.\n\nIn the past, I've successfully been student assistant and student mentor, reflecting my interests in learning and assisting others. As my board year and Honors Academy enrollment convey, I enjoy working together with others on project which can make a difference, and I am prepared to put as much time and energy as required in to finish the project with a desirable result. In this, I set my standards high for what defines a desirable result, such that the projects I deliver are always well accepted.\n\nOver the course of my study and extracurricular activities, I have gained skills in mathematical modeling and experimental physics, as well as programming in several different languages. Soft skill wise, I have great time and energy management, as well as being able to help others with this. I always strive to be the best person I can be and try to improve on myself continuously by attending workshops.\n\nSome of my past achievements include reaching the final on the Mathematics Olympiad several times, ranking amongst the best 30 out of 10000 participants. Additionally, I have reached the final of the Physics Olympiad, reaching 13th, and the Chemistry Olympiad, reaching 2nd. I then participated in the international Chemistry Olympiad, where I ranked 194th of the world. I've competed in the Singapore Internation Mathematics Olympiad (SIMC), where my team ranked in the top half of the world.",
