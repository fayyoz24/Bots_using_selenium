    "summary": "There are certain languages that have been identified as important for one to command in order to be successful in today\u2019s world, yet there is one that is often not classified among them but is probably the most crucial of them all; and that is the language of today\u2019s Media. Throughout the history of humanity, the media has shaped the way societies interact with one another. Be it for bad or for good, this contemporary way of communication has the power to change lives. From the development of new online communities to the fascinating advances in the realm of branding and advertisement, I have always realised the pivotal role technology has to play in any modern human society. In addition to my growing interest in the field of Media and Digital Marketing, I believe in constantly pursuing positive outcomes in my work with persistency and a creative brainstorming. Being an optimist and perfectionist by nature I always aim for constructive feedback when working in groups, which has shown me I can easily adapt to any work environment.",
