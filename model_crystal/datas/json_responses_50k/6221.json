    "summary": "I specialize in international arbitration and litigation, representing large corporate clients in international arbitrations and proceedings before the Dutch national courts on a variety of subjects. My particular expertise is in the field of energy, where I have litigated extensively and have been involved in several gas price reviews. I have represented both buyers and sellers under long-term gas sales agreements, advising them during the pre-litigation phase and representing them in arbitration. Furthermore, my experience includes advising clients on contract interpretation and corporate law matters, and I have experience in national and international mergers and acquisitions in a variety of industries, as well as post M&A disputes. \n\nI particularly enjoy drafting legal pleadings and strategy papers as well as participating in expert meetings. In addition, I like  coordinating and supervising input from the client, specialist teams and external counsel as well as the work of junior associates. I successfully manage the most complex cases, being able to maintain focus on the strategy and the bigger picture of a case whilst at the same time perfecting the details of not only the legal but also the economic and commercial arguments raised.",
