It won me the first prize in the category \u2018Composers Under 30\u201d.\n\nI've always showed interest with almost any part of sound, which has lead to a rather diverse number of activities. I'm a freelance radio-producer and editor with the Dutch National Radio, teach editing,-and recording techniques in various settings and I do both commercial,- and non-profit productions, ranging from remixes, leaders and advertising to experimental music and sound design. From time to time I'm involved in recording on location as well: for film/TV, or DVD-productions. I assemble, edit and mix for broadcast, film and games on a regular basis and specialize in surround sound and audio art. \nTogether with partner and artist Iris Honderdos, I completed several installations worldwide.\n\nDue to my widespread experience in the area of sound and music, festivals and organizations sometimes acquire my help as consultant for audiovisual solutions or as an aid in setting up the program.",

More recent projects took them to Armenia, Friesland, Liberia, Bulgaria, Norway and Peru.\n\nIn their method of working they cannot know upfront what they will create, since they need to home in on the emotions of the community they want to work with.After a process of research and meditation on a subject, sketching and modeling, the actual work on the art itself can begin.It results mostly in an installation, accompanied by sound or video and is presented to the audience during a performance or concert; it is a gift to the community.\nTheir approach proofed to be very suitable for addressing complex or sensitive issues within local communities. Therefore they have been contracted by several NGOs.
