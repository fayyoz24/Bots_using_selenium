    "summary": "Currently I am working as the Lead project manager on installation of EWTs Wind Turbines for international projects. As a Lead I am managing the overall interest, processes, continuity and common challenges of the project unit and steer the project team where/if necessary (i.e. in managing contracts). As a Project Manager, I specialize and have experience in setting-up, transport, installation and commissioning of unique one-off projects (i.e. Arctic, Ascension Island, Vietnam) and new markets firsts (India, Canada, Germany, France).\n\nIn addition I am supporting the Sales and Legal team with advice, risk assessment and contracts in new markets. I manage projects fully from start to finish, from single turbine installations to the occasional EPC contract and Wind Farms.\n\nGraduated as a construction engineer, specialized in the multidisciplinary field of urban wind energy, has enabled me to be a versatile project manager with a broad understanding of engineering disciplines and construction. Alongside my experience with structures, detailed engineering and building physics, mainly in aerodynamics and climatic design, I am able to communicate on a broad level with both clients and engineers.\n\nI aim to contribute to the current and future energy crisis by realizing energy-generation projects and to further develop myself on a management-level to contribute to sustainable innovation.",

The clients I have dealt with so far range from farmers to developers. \n\nDue to the relatively small scale of EWT I am often involved in the Sales-stage, contract and project development and I have strongly enhanced my skills in solving civil and electrical issues.
