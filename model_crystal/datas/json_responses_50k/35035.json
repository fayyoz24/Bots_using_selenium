    "summary": "After anthropological research and coordination of a large action research project, \"Culture and Conservation\" in the interior of Indonesian Borneo, I joined WWF Indonesia and the WWF network twenty  years ago. My work has focused on strengthening the recognition of IPs rights especially in protected areas and improving governance and equity in natural resources. My work has also aimed at integrating and strengthening social and development dimensions in conservation initiatives (human rights principles, policies, best practices and indicators) at local, national, regional, and global levels, and building relevant capacity of staff and partners from local to global. Key issues include: social equity and inclusion, good governance of natural assets and shared governance of protected areas, recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights, supporting ICCAs and territories of life, building networks and empowering civil society, Green Economies, sustainable livelihoods and rural well being; advocacy related to CBD and SDGs.",

This is increasingly leading to social conflict and loss of local support for conservation. In order to address these challenges and build a more equitable conservation WWF needs to: \n\u2022\tImprove advocacy for policies that can promote equity and sustainability in natural resource management\n\u2022\tPromote the rights of Indigenous and local communities in land- and seascapes, and ensure conditions of good and fair governance in natural resource management and conservation\n\u2022\tPromote  equity and social inclusion in the design and implementation of access and benefit sharing schemes to ensure that those most affected by conservation interventions bear the highest costs\n\u2022\tImprove our ability to demonstrate more systematically linkages between equity, good livelihood and good governance of natural resources.  \n",
