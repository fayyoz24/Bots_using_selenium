    "summary": "Not only am I a Chartered Accountant with over six years of international experience in the public and private sectors, but I am also an avid foodie, museum visitor and traveller.\n\nI am currently working and residing in the Netherlands as an Audit Manager at PKF Wallast.\n\nThroughout my career I have had the privilege to work with amazing colleagues and interesting clients and even had the honour to be named Audit Manager of the year. \n\nMy international experience include entities from South Africa, the Seychelles, British Virgin Islands, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The industries I have external audit experience in, include the Public Sector (including and healthcare), Property investment, Financial Services, and the Retail industries. Having worked with a broad range of clients, meant that I gained experience with both listed (JSE, MERJ Exchange and Nasdaq) and non-listed entities as well as separate and consolidated financial statements.\n\nI'm always up for new challenges and I am continually focused on sharpening skills and knowledge to remain at the top of our industry.",
