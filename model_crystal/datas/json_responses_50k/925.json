I am a people-person who believes that comparing intentions with data of observed behaviour is crucial to understanding the world around us. Specifically, I get excited about topics related to decision making processes and why we make mistakes. \nI like to work in teams where l can be my solution-oriented self and use my skills of listening, questioning, data analysis, and data visualisation to implement creative and effective solutions.\nIf you think there is an opportunity for us to work together to create a lasting impact, then please reach out to me so that we can discuss the possibilities over a coffee. \ud83d\ude80",

The dashboard would not have been such a great success without practicing skills such as stakeholder management, project management, creative thinking, and evaluation & feedback.\n\nThe final product is a dashboard that gives insights into each stage of the recruitment process, by visualising recruitment- and media channel efficiency KPIs. This dashboard will assist data-driven decision making for the following recruitment rounds.\n\nCreating this dashboard required teamwork and clear communication, which allowed us to learn more about our working styles how to create these automated dashboards in future.",
