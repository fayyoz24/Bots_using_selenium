    "summary": "I was born in a small city in Bulgaria, where I lived till eight years old. After that I moved to The Netherlands. I have been moving approximately every 3 years in my life. First in Bulgaria and after that in The Netherlands. This life experience of constantly changing environment has formed me into the person I am today. A person that likes adventure and can get along well with different people. This life experience is useful because it makes me work well in a team, makes me adaptable, and makes me take the lead, if necessary.\n\nGoing through high school and my gap year, I have been trying out different things. Different jobs, different sports, travelling to different countries, etc. This experience is useful for me today as it helps me make decisions in my study, career, and personal life.\n\nWhile entering university, I started finding more purpose. I learned a lot from my lecturers and my fellow students about business and success. At this moment, I am deepening my knowledge of blockchain technology and web3.0. If these topics make you excited, feel free to connect and send me a message!",
