In doing so, the LF is partnered with local organisations (POs) who work to improve health, education, social and livelihood aspects of these children\u2019s lives. Although the Liliane Foundation does not engage directly with parents and children, it monitors performance and progress of the programmes through chosen strategic partners (SPOs), who oversee the coordination and management of the local partners.\n\nIn addition, while caregivers are inseparable parts of these children\u2019s lives, the foundation has never directly addressed issues that parents face in dealing with their children with disabilities. As such, the LF created a parenting project to increase parental training in accepting and coping with a child\u2019s disability, to stimulate the formation of parent support groups, and to give more voice to parents in the grassroots lobby and advocacy activities. It also aims to facilitate knowledge exchange among SPOs and POs.\n\nMy work as an intern involved various steps, beginning with a needs assessment to evaluate the current knowledge and SPOs' planned activities, followed by a questionnaire sent out to POs in order to examine their current capacity and remaining needs. In addition, I also worked on the building blocks for a position paper, used for internal purposes such as making sure that the LF understands why parents are important stakeholders and that parents be more involved by SPOs and POs. In parallel, my supervisor and I also reflected upon potential tools or models that could be used in the field to better work with and for parents.",
