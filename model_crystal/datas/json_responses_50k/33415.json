    "summary": "The combination of fieldwork, writing, and visual ethnography are my personal blend of doing anthropology. My research interests revolve around the anthropology of emotion, human rights, morality, and violence, with a special interest in Latin America.\n\nI am currently working on the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis and refugees in the neighboring countries for which I was awarded the Independent Social Research Foundation Political Economy Research Fellowship. \n\nMy monograph, Phenomenal Justice. Violence and Morality in Argentina received the international award Outstanding Academic Title 2020 and was shortlisted for the Juan E. Mendez Book Award for Human Rights in Latin America.\n\nI am co-founder of the cultural platform DoKumento and editor of the Dutch anthropological journal Etnofoor, https://etnofoor.nl/. \n\nThrough Visual Anthropology, I explore new ways of theorizing and working together with other independent filmmakers. Examples of my work as an independent filmmaker are Servicio2 and Het Papierparadijs. La Caida is my latest project.",

Since a few months they are following the Belgium route: they have decided to live 50 meters across the Belgian border to circumvent strict Dutch migration law. The 30\u201d documentary wants to stimulate reflection about the bizarre consequences of bureaucracy and the illusion of freedom in modern life.

Since 2006, thousands of cases are being tried at the federal courts in Argentina for the illegal detentions, tortures, murders, disappearances, death flights, and the illegal adoptions of children. Drawing on observations at court and prison and conversations with judges, lawyers, psychologists, victims, human rights activists, indicted officers and their families in Buenos Aires, Eva van Roekel analyzes what justice means and does for the victims and the indicted military officers. The result is an affective exploration of this enormous legal process trying to do justice for the crimes that were committed more than 35 years ago. By looking at emotions from \u2018within\u2019, this anthropological study on the case of Argentina challenges the idea that transitional justice and its practices would induce a movement away from violence and suffering. Instead Phenomenal Justice offers alternative perspectives on the meaning of violence, truth and justice in societies that struggle with accountability and remembrance.",
