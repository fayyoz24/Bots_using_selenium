    "summary": "The research activity of Angelo Accardo started in 2009 and involved several areas of investigation related to the nanotechnology and biomedical field. He has a strong background in microfabrication processes (e.g. optical lithography, stencil lithography, soft lithography, plasma reactive ion etch, 3D stereolithography, digital light projection, 2-photon absorption direct laser writing), computer aided design tools (e.g. AutoDesk Inventor), characterization tools (e.g. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, Light sheet fluorescence microscopy, Small and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy) and biology (neurodegenerative peptides, neuronal cells, cancer biomarkers, cancer cells, protein structures). \n\nCurrently, He is Assistant Professor at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). His main area of research is the development of multi-scale (nano-micro-meso) 3D fabrication paradigms to address a wide range of open questions in cell biology. He is interested in particular in the design and fabrication of 3D microenvironments, by employing light-assisted additive manufacturing techniques (such as two-photon lithography and stereolithography), for studying the mechanobiology, migration and differentiation mechanisms of mammalian cells as well as of spheroids/organoids.\n\nDr. Accardo is author of 41 publications in peer-reviewed journals (of which 23 as first/corresponding author, h-index=20), 4 book chapters (of which 2 as first author) and principal inventor of 1 industrial patent on electrowetting superhydrophobic surfaces.
