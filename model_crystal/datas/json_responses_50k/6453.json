Results from 41 participants playing a video game while walking on a treadmill showed that the approach was successful as they reported increased game engagement, decreased leg symptoms and experience of time loss. The outcome of the experiment proves that our approach can help individuals engage in longer walking periods while perceiving less leg symptoms, thus increasing physical activity levels.",
