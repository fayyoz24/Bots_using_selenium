    "summary": "Retail expert with over 15 years of accelerated experience. Profound knowledge of buying, planning and allocation achieved through working in a \nbroad variety of roles in high fashion and sports retail with global portfolios across multiple brands. Proven track record of turning underperforming \nbusinesses around to sustainable and profitable growth. Strength areas include:\nGeneral Management, Stategic thinking, Building and Coaching high performing teams and relationships with key stakeholders.\n\nIn my work I always try to be involved in the companies I work for as much as possible besides my normal work activities. Wether it be on an organisational level or improving the physical work space as long as it positively benefits the employees.\n\nIn previous roles I have been a member of the Works Council for both Mexx and Nike where I was the Vice chair of the committee. It enabled me to be the voice of the Retail side of the business if any changes to our organization were required.",
