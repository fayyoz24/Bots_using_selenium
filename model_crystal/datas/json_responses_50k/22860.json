    "summary": "Your adventures and good stories have tremendous value; they make you happy. Excellent experiences make you happier than buying products. I make real-life games in which you create those stories and live those adventures. \n\nHarnessing 8 years of game design and entrepreneurial experience from two award-winning videogames, two of the most successful real-life games of the Benelux and countless adventures I organized for my friends, I\u2019m one of the first Game Designers to bring immersive games to real life. More on my entrepreneurial journey and these projects down below at \u201cExperience\u201d and \u201cProjects\u201d. \n\nEver since I started trekking around the world, I formed a deep desire to create experiences that make you feel alive. My curiosity takes me to unexpected places providing me with inspiration and new perspectives. With the memory of an elephant, a vivid & endless imagination and a brain that\u2019s lightning fast at finding connections between experiences, I have great ideas and even better solutions.\n\nI once spend a whole day walking around with a gas mask to simulate how it feels to be an astronaut for a space project. Comprehensive research on the theme & subject within the time window helps making intelligent decisions. Creating a believable world matters if you want your players to hide under a bed for 20 minutes out of free will and still say they had the best time of their lives!\n\nI\u2019m on a mission to create tense & thrilling games that will become the next highlight of your life to be printed in your memory to relish and provide you with long-lasting happiness!
