    "summary": "As a research professional with 10+ years of experience in clinical research, immunology, global health, and epidemiology, I've always been driven by the desire to improve public health outcomes and make a positive impact on the world. \n\nMy current focus is on completing my PhD in infectious disease epidemiology, with a specific emphasis on leprosy transmission in East Africa. This work has given me a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by communities affected by infectious diseases, and has reinforced my commitment to improving health equity and promoting evidence-based interventions. \n\nI'm also passionate about education, and find immense joy in empowering junior scientists to reach their career goals. For me, there is no greater satisfaction than watching others succeed and contribute to meaningful scientific advancements.",
