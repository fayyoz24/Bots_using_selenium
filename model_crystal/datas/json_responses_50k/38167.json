    "summary": "With an educational background of Accountancy and Theology (both focussing on accountability!) I worked for 22 years as programme officer with ICCO (www.icco.nl) and since October 2004 for myself as freelance consultant.\nIn my consultancy life and advices I aim to translate the lessons learned during my many contacts with people in overseas NGO's and CBO's. What I am offering is analysis and advice on Sustainable Organisational Development, both from an objective point of view (based on actual MDF theory) and a subjective point of view (based on my large experience, knowledge, life skills and intuition). \nVia my work and advices I want to contribute to a better functioning of organisations as carriers of programmes aiming to benefit the living cirumstances of people in need. \nAre you interested? Please see my CV. I send it on request (aadenteunivandermeer@gmail.com) or call 0031(0)651043060. Let's cooperate!\n\nSpecialties: Sustainable Organisational Development, assessing the quality of the work of organisations, bringing out very practical hands on reports, a professional frank and open approach with understanding and acceptance of cultural differences. \nGeographical focus --> Southern Africa, East Africa, Indian subcontinent",
