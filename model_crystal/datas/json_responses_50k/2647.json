Traveling through Africa is notoriously expensive and we were young and broke. Yet we managed to have a fantastic and adventurous honeymoon, despite our limited budget. \n\nUpon returning home, I used this experience to set up a network with local African tour operators, safari operators and guides and built my own online travel agency on top of that network. I learned how to set up a company, how to do (social media) marketing, B2C sales, SEO/SEA, contract management, lead generation and so much more. I've learned a great deal from all of that, including from the many mistakes I made. \n\nWhilst being in a full time job, I grew my own company to over 6 figures in annual revenue and hundreds of happy travelers. \n\nAfter having had my company in lockdown mode for 12 months during the pandemic, I decided to pursue other activities. Although stressful, making it through the downside of being an entrepreneur has proven to have been a valuable experience.",
