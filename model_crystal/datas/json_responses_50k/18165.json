    "summary": "I believe that every digital product design challenge starts with gaining empathy for the end-user. Creating a product or service that is loved by the user increases the chance that it gets adopted successfully. \nI apply Design Thinking during the entire end-to-end cycle of the product design process. User interviews and observation studies help me to empathize with the user. I use ideation workshops to shape, design and reshape the ideas and assumptions. Mockups, wireframes and (clickable) prototypes help to visualize and simulate the ideas. They enable to test assumptions with the user and iterate from there. Step by step we go from complex challenge to a crisp and clean minimal lovable product.\n\nI am passionate about digital design projects where long term vision and sustainability are important drivers. I believe that we make a better world together and I am keen on adding my contribution somewhere along the road. \n\nI am a persistent designer, ready to make a difference.",

When change hits your business, there are a lot of decisions to make. Soon, you'll end up in a legal jungle to make the right arrangements and setup for your business. Fair chance that this is all unfamiliar to you and it easily becomes a time consuming process. So let's help out here! \n\nTogether with my team I am designing a brand new application from scratch to give the entrepreneur a smooth and intuitive experience arranging their legal registration.\n\nBeing responsible for the entire end-to-end design process gives me loads of energy. Both the long and term design vision are on my account, giving me a good mix of design challenges. The fuzzy front end triggers my strategic brain cells and the muddy back-end is my pixel playground. However, every challenge start with talking to and observing the users. Researching hypotheses and gaining empathy helps me to understand the 'why', pains, job-to-be-done, current behaviour and desired behaviour. \nRounding all these insights up into sketches, wireframes, screen designs and journey mappings brings the design alive. Via user testing the idea will be validated, finalized and sliced into development user stories. Then it is time for development, monitoring the new flow and writing new user stories to start the design loop all over again.",

My role was to lead the end-to-end product development process. Starting with the concept exploring together with BAM, gather all requirements, prioritize them and translate them into a first design for the application. Via an iterative design process we went from concept to an design for the app that got developed by the team: kick-off of the project, gathering the needs from users, prioritizing them, setting up the design, receiving user feedback, prioritize again, finetuning the design, starting development, receiving user feedback, etc. etc.\nThe end-result is an application where two user groups could loggin to: tender owners to publish an asphalt tender with specific sustainability requirements and tender subscribers who want to commit to the sustainability requirements and prove their commitment.",

Traders can compare and buy directly online and NGM makes sure the flower order is delivered at the desired location straight away.\nNGM has its first users onboarded and is ready to scale up. This is where I entered the process. My role was to bring the application to the next nevel. Understanding the needs and pain points of both user groups (flower grower and buyer) and translate them into new functionalities and optimizations for the app. Via observation studies in the greenhouses and interviews with flower buyers I formed hypotheses and emphasized with the users.
