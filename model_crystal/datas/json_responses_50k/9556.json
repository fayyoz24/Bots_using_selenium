    "summary": "As a researcher, my primary interest is the modern history of Jewish communities in the Islamic world and their responses to modernity. From a methodological standpoint I consider myself a historian, and as such the majority of my research is based on archival material and historic press in English, French, Arabic, and Hebrew, dating from the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century. My current research rethinks the connection between transnational solidarity organizations and empire. The focus is on the centrality and agency of non-European elites, thereby challenging assumptions about the center and the periphery within colonial networks\n\nI have a passion for modern history and digital humanities, as represented by my former roles as the digital curator for the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam and as the project lead for the openjournals.nl platform at the KNAW. Combined with eight years of experience in academic publishing, honing my skills in project development and management, I have a unique skill set and professional perspective for working with institutions looking to make culture accessible to all.\n\n\u2022\tDigital Curation\n\u2022      Project management \n\u2022\tDeveloping, organizing and publishing academic print and online content\n\u2022\tDeveloping online platforms for academic reference works and bibliographic databases\n\u2022\tInternational network of academics, librarians, and publishers\n\u2022\tOrganizing academic conferences & meetings\n\u2022\tFinancial development & management \n\u2022\tTeam management",

Its main objective is to understand how disparate Jewish communities interacted through philanthropic networks in the post-WWI period until the creation of the state of Israel. Between 1918-1948 transnational Jewish solidarity organizations, based in Europe and North America expanded their presence in MENA by local Jewish groups in the development of communal infrastructure. As a result, interaction between Jewish sub-groups (i.e. Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Baghdadi, Maghrebi) increased exponentially often via national Jewish organisations (for example the AJA, AIU, and JDC). It is my hypothesis that these organisations transformed notions of Jewish identity, religiosity, and solidarity from the local to the global. In order to understand the nature of these transformations I will focus on Jewish religious reform, political participation, and acculturation through the lens of transnational solidarity movements.",

This period of societal modernization and competing nationalisms saw the emergence of new political structures that would define the Middle East for most of the twentieth century. While Arabic nationalism, predicated as it was on the Arabic language more than on Islam, was seen as a positive development by many Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians, others showed increasing uneasiness with its ramifications. This was more specifically the case among those non-Muslims that in addition to Arabic highly valued other languages, such as Syriac, Hebrew and Armenian, but also English and French. Would participation in Arab nationalism also imply giving up the allegiances symbolized by these languages?",
