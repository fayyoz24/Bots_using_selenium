Notably, this attention has been drawn to the potential of ion-induced bending processes, a phenomenon documented in various systems such as nanotubes, nanowires, and thin films. Grasping the intricacies of this phenomenon holds paramount importance, as it paves the way for achieving reproducibility and predictability. Ultimately, this opens up the possibility of employing ion-induced bending as a dependable method for finely manipulating the shape and geometry of functional nanostructures within nanodevices. In this context, our project introduced an innovative theoretical framework elucidating the mechanisms governing bending through the evolution of ion-induced crystallographic defects. This novel approach was rigorously validated through experiments focused on both solid and nanoporous metallic materials.",
