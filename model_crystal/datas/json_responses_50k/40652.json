    "summary": "I have been a full-stack software engineer for nearly 5 years where I have worked with clients, software engineers, and managers to ensure the best solutions are implemented for the problems that are faced. I have a passion for making a difference using coding as my tool. With strong analytical skills, problem-solving, and a good eye for detail, I have flourished in my current position. As a Software Engineer, I have participated in the full software and operational life cycle, from analysis, design, and implementation, to DevOps and maintenance, allowing me to grow and make better decisions for the team. When working on projects and tasks, I ensure that the solution not only takes the system into account but also the different users and their experiences.\n\nIn terms of the tech stack, I'm open to learning and working with different languages, some that come to mind are Java, Python, Ruby, SQL Server and React. I am excited to learn more alongside a strong team, where I can enjoy learning from and mentoring others in our shared journey of software, team and personal growth. \n\nI would like to be part of a team that enjoys their work as much as they enjoy each other. A team that works together to make a difference using coding as their tool.\n\nI highly value a work-life balance where I give my 100% while at work but also get a chance to have a personal life. I would also like to find a company that aligns with my values regarding loyalty, trust, honourability, and the general value of each other.\n\nI would prefer working in a hybrid environment with flexible working hours.",

I have a concern for students learning, and, was driven to ensure that they understand the work and do well in the module.",
