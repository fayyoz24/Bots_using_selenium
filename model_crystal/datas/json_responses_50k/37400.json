The amateur dancers from the Dance and More Foundation Cura\u00e7ao, Simia Dance Company. The inexperienced dancers are boys and girls aged 8 to 14 years from less prosperous neighborhoods of Banda Abou Curacao. For this last group, the project is of great importance because these children rarely come into contact with theater, or don\u2019t have resources to develop their talents and to show. \nThe project includes a social element (cooperation between young people from different groups of society), an educational element (rehearsals are built from target-related themes) and a presentation element (the show). Through Contemporary dance, Urban dance, rap, singing and drumming the children of Banda Abou Simia Dance Company have demonstrated their talents and made their feelings speak.\n"
