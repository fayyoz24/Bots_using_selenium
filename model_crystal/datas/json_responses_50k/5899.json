    "summary": "\"Eager to touch and inspire people by using (social) media in a creative and innovative way.\"\n\nWriting and creating has been a hobby of mine since I was a little child. For hours, I could sit down and journal about my thoughts, write poems and song lyrics and put my ideas onto paper. Accordingly, it is no big surprise that I ended up with a career that supports this passion. \n\nAs a writer & (social) media expert, I get to express my creativity and knowledge in the most fun and inspiring ways. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn and of course Google offer wonderful opportunities to spread your word.\n\nThat is also one of the reasons, why I started my own online brand HiSensitives together with my partner - to be able to have an outlet for all my passions. Besides my work for HiSensitives, I enjoy working as a freelance copywriter, translator and Pinterest marketeer for my clients. It is wonderful to be able to utilize my gifts in a broad variety of projects.\n\nIf you'd like to work with me, feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn! I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
