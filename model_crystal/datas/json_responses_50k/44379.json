A great advantage of working with a system like this is the self-pacing of students, which prevented the classroom inherent issue of different learning speeds.\n\nThe gamification component of the system centered mostly around experience points and badge systems. The response to these was rather positive and resulted in higher engagement rates.",

Over time it grew to be a large enough project to demand a full time focus.\n\nWorking on Hoasted taught me a lot about web infrastructure and the development of software platforms.\n\nI became involved when the project was still small and helped it grow towards a profitable business. For a number of months I worked on it full time, but decided to focus on other projects.",

It was a USB stick that contained a 1-click computer maintenance solution. I went into this project knowing nothing about starting, running or growing a company.\n\nOver a number of years I gained experience in project management, working with Chinese manufacturers and doing business with big retail chains. The most successful moment of the project in my view was selling CleanPC at the Media Markt (one of the biggest technology retailers in the Netherlands at the time) in Maastricht.\n\nThe project did not end up as a commercial success, but was a great learning experience. My experiences in this project have helped a lot in my professional life.",
