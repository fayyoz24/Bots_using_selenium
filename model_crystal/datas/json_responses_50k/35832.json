    "summary": "Bart is known for his naturalistic lighting, enjoys working on narrative projects and commercials,\nbelieves in teamwork, and isn\u2019t afraid of getting his hands dirty.\n\nBart was born in Amsterdam, but has also lived in Cura\u00e7ao, Romania, and in many different cities in the Netherlands. He got in touch with photography while studying Music Production and Songwriting at the Conservatory in Groningen.\nDuring that time, he was also very much into travelling and playing extreme sports.\nThis led him to develop a dynamic and intuitive way of capturing fast moving objects. \n\nBart is now more interested in the narrative world, and has redirected his focus to more character- and story-based films, but this intuitive, natural style is still part of his signature.\n\nLet\u2019s have a chat, feel free to contact me:\n\nTEL: +31615333797\nEMAIL: info@bartmartensdop.com",
