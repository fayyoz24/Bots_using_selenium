    "summary": "* At the moment working on the new N2 plant as OTE-B (controls & instrumentation) engineer to get construction complete. This installation will enable Gasunie to mix up high caloric natural gas to the standard gas which is in use in the Netherlands. Also excited to be part of future projects in the field of hydrogen storage/production and many other sustainable energy projects to get the energy transition on track. So to prepare myself I'm starting a hydrogen post-HBO study in October 2023.\n\n* Currently I'm working for Teijin Aramid as project leader/engineer electrical/instrumentation/automation disciplines. Started on the challenging expansion \"Kagayaki\" project (mostly brownfield related). As the finish line is coming closer I will make a transfer to another great company within a couple of weeks. The last project was challenging but fun so time to be challenged once again.\n\n* During my last position I gained lots of experience in the oil & gas industry. At first started in the maintenance side of things at asset Groningen. This has given me plenty of insights in the daily operation of gas production locations and the challenges to keep it safe and maintain reliable production. During my last assignment I worked as a project engineer in the ONEgas asset. Last job was decomplexing one of the North Sea platforms. This involved simplifying the process and replacement of older DCS/ESD systems.\n\n * Finished the Endumax project at the Teijin Aramid Emmen site. This project was very interesting to do and we succeeded in closing it without serious safety issues, on time and within the budget constraints. Within this project I functioned as Project Engineer Electrical, Instrumentation & Automation.\n\n* Within Teijin I worked on the major expansion of the production capacity of the plant which was known as the Nikko project Delfzijl. From checking the design and construction to the final close out with sub contractors.\n\n* After 2 years I was promoted to Engineer B at Akzo Nobel / Stork this ment that I got greater responsibilities and got to work on more complex designs. During this period I was the counterpart of Siemens Engineering Germany on the construction of the Akzo Nobel MCA (Mono Chlorid Acid) plant located at Delfzijl.",

Biggest challenge was to do this safely in a running plant with minimal downtime to get tie ins in and afterwards delivering complete installation turn key. After this I got involved with the Endumax project at location Emmen. This plant had to built in a production hall and consisted of many separate machinery that had to be automated as a complete production line. The project team managed to do this complete project safely within the time/budget constraints.",
