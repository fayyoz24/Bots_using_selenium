    "summary": "I joined the KPMG Advisory group in November 2018. I am part of the KPMG Business Analytics/Process Mining team. Data Analysis and Process Mining have become exciting scientific disciplines. As a Data Science professional, I aspire to apply approaches, tools and technologies that will use event data to discover new insights about business and turn the operational data into competitive advantages for the businesses.\n\nI completed my Master\u2019s in Computer Science (with specialization in \u201cData Science in Engineering\") from Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands (TU/e). I did my internship at Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL) where I worked with the health informatics team that was driving innovations to improve cancer care through process mining and data-driven solutions. I completed my Master's research/thesis at ProcessGold (Eindhoven) where I applied techniques and principles of process mining, machine learning and statistics. My research focused on predicting the ultimate level of KPIs achieved during the execution of business processes.\n\nAbout KPMG Process Mining Offerings:\n\nProcess mining offers a set of novel tools and techniques for the factual analysis of business processes. Process mining is process and system agnostics, meaning it can be used to analyse a wide range of processes from back-office and mid-office to customer-facing processes. With that in mind, KPMG offers a number of solutions that are designed to help organisation get the maximum value out of their data. Our strong team of data scientists use market-leading software and state-of-the-art techniques to increase the added-value of the different service offerings provided to our clients.\n\nLearn more about process mining at KPMG: https://to.kpmg.nl/2G8OnTP\n\nLearn more about KPMG: https://home.kpmg.com/nl/en/home/about/overview.html",

The internship used a process mining technique, Data Aware Petri Net (DPN), to model the primary care path of colon cancer.\n\nThe findings from the research have been selected as a poster presentation session for the upcoming annual symposium of the \u201cAmerican Medical Informatics Association\u201d in San Francisco (AMIA 2018).",
