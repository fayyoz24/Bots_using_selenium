    "summary": "I am a lecturer in European Studies at the University of Amsterdam. In this position I am jointly convening several courses revolving around EU Enlargement and External Relations, European Geopolitics, European Integration and Skills Seminar Brussels. In addition, I have taught seminars for the course Middle East: History, Politics and Economy and am a MA thesis supervisor. I have several years of experience as a module convenor of a variety of courses in both the United Kingdom (Durham University) and the Netherlands (University of Groningen). In these courses I have covered several subjects such as politics, political economy, state-society relations and international relations in the Middle East as well as supervising Bachelor and Master Students in Middle Eastern Studies (University of Groningen) and Politics (Durham University). Throughout these years I have distinguished myself as a lecturer by implementing active learning methods in my courses, which has resulted in excellent student reviews about the quality of my teaching. \n\nAs a scholar my research revolves around state-society relations, political economy and international relations in the Gulf region. I obtained my doctoral degree in Middle Eastern Politics at the University in Exeter in March 2020 (after passing the Viva without corrections) with a thesis on the the impact of Internet technology on the Gulf monarchies focusing on Kuwait and Oman. I have presented my work at various conferences and had a number of publications in the International Spectator, edited volumes, Gulf Insight, the HH Sheikh Nasser Mohammad al-Sabah Publication Series and ZemZem. Alongside this,  I have frequently contributed to Gulf State News providing political analysis on Kuwait and have initiated several extra-cirricular activies including being co-organiser of the Gulf Conference 2016 (University of Exeter) and co-founding the Social Movement Theory Reading Group at the University of Exeter.",

In this Dissertation, I argue that the UAE did withdrawn because of the decision to locate the central bank in Riyadh. With the UAE carving out an independent role for itself and seeing itself as an example for the other GCC states, it could not accept Saudi insistence locating the central bank in Riyadh. The economic benefits of the Monetary Union were not sufficient for the UAE to stay in the GCC Monetary Union.",
