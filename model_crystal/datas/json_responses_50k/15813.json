Despite the higher removal efficiency obtained, this unit was suboptimal in its economic viability. In my design project, I developed a working model which is a rate-based scrubber with all experimentally measured key components\u2019 properties included. The model was validated with the experimental results and further parametrically optimized. This inspired the researchers to set up new experiments that lead to the successful improvement of the BTX unit. Also, these advanced models were integrated into different process scenarios and compared in terms of their profitability. During this period, I proactively interacted with subject and skill experts and also contributed to knowledge-sharing via one-to-one conversations, speaking at lunch- lectures, and with EU conferences.

I was in charge of synthesizing various reaction routes, and their corresponding processes. Mass & energy balances, sizing, and CAPEX evaluations were done for each. The major bottleneck in minimizing the investment for these processes was identified through individual contribution analysis. Thanks to my teammates, the team from Shell, and the Mentors who made it successful.",
