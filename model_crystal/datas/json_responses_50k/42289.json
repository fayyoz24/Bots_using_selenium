    "summary": "Hello, I'm Azza. I'm a graduate student at the University of Twente, studying Spatial Engineering and also a consultant at BlackEarth. I'm focused on using technology like GIS, Remote Sensing, and machine learning to create solutions for retail, FMCG, finance and banking industries. My research explores using geospatial tech for things like improving disaster response and vehicle routing.\n\nBefore my current study, I worked in product management, using methods like Agile and Lean Startup. This gave me a strong understanding of solving user problems with technology. With over 6 years of diverse experience, including teaching and editorial roles, I bring a unique perspective. I'm excited to connect with others who are interested in technology's role in building a safer world.\n\nMore on: https://linktr.ee/asawungrana",

Because of that Indonesia has to prepare to face every possibility. Jakarta is Indonesia\u2019s capital with main activities that makes it as one of nuclear attack target because if we attack Jakarta, Indonesia will be paralyzed. Integration of Geographical Information System, Nukemap application, and literature review used to make the result. Nukemap is an application to predict damage of nuclear bomb. This study is important for countermeasures after disaster with decide the effective evacuation location near Jakarta. The result of this study is nuclear bomb disaster countermeasures modeling that are in the form of evacuation location mapping and safest destination location for ease evacuation process.",

Indonesia is an archipelago country that has great wave energy potential to produce electricity. Sea wave, an eco-energy source can produce about 20-70 kWh/m. South Java shores are a kind of shore that have great potential  sea wave energy  especially at Gunungkidul district that its region characteristics formed by karst/limestone. This research has a purpose to determine the area suitability for onshore sea wave energy power station through GIS, spatial land analysis, and weighting method. Area suitability level is grouped to suitable (S1), suitable conditional (S2), and not suitable (N). Weighting method uses this following parameter: shore morphology, sea depth, shore tilt, wave type, wind velocity, and wind direction as early appraisal for area suitability identification to place onshore sea wave power station in Gunungkidul Regency.",

This organization is the embodiment of empathy and duty of Universitas Gadjah Mada's students as agent of changes. The core of Gadjah Mada Mengajar itself is similar to what Indonesia Mengajar possesses. We taught children of left-behind villages around Yogyakarta to strive with education. My personal duty is to create fun and fine curricula for students with only 3 meetings per week. But as other student volunteering programs, we all struggled in human resources that lacked of motivation and also budget for development. But nevertheless, we strive to provide our best for the children."
