    "summary": "I am a research master student in Cultural Leadership from the University of Groningen and a bachelor in Economics and Management of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Activities from Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice.\n\nMy intention to study management of cultural heritage was driven mostly by my will to acquire a thorough understanding of the managerial practices and a wide array of instruments to critically evaluate them as well as knowledge of the artistic development through centuries. Over the past years, I had the opportunity to lay solid foundations in terms of both quantitative skills and economic theory revolving around cultural enterprises, deepening my knowledge of curatorial practices and legal institutes in addition to strengthening the study of the cultural heritage in its many manifestations. This has directed my enthusiasm to the role of institutions, international organizations, and NGOs in managing this relationship and in creating meaningful interchange between the territory, the cultural expression, and visitors.\n\nAt the moment my research interest covers three areas: the relationship between the education provided to young art professionals and the work market, opportunities for artists to find new forms to exhibit and share their artworks, and sustainable management of cultural heritage. \n\nGiven my fond, long-term interest in the management of cultural heritage, sustainability, and accessibility of the arts which go beyond my more recent yet strong drive towards institutional responsibilities in these fields, I am committed and interested in all experiences that enhance my capabilities and push my boundaries both as a student and as a cultural leader through a balance between quantitative, qualitative research, and practice.",

I have been exploring the cultural heritage and the impact of climate change on it and on waterways.\nOur project is called Navigandum per hereditatem. We have chosen this Latin expression because of the double meaning \"per hereditatem\" has: it can signify \"trough the heritage\", or \"for heredity\". We believe it summarises well both the cultural heritage focus and the attention they will give to sustainability seen as the prerequisite to have future generations inherit intact cities from us.\nFor us, the protection and enhancement of heritage is a personal priority, and we recognize the importance of communicating it with and to society. We believe that tomorrow\u2019s World Heritage will increasingly value sites that foster positive relations between man and nature and will progressively include more intangible heritage, such as local culture and practices.\n\nTo increase the impact of their Travelling Scholarship, we have been receiving the support of the European Climate Pact and its Ambassadors with the aim of initiating dialogues revolving around the environmental and social sustainability of cities and heritage sites we will visit. We plan on meeting citizens involved in the safeguarding and enhancement of cultural heritage, other Ambassadors, local institutions, NGOs, and international stakeholders. The project aims at culminating with a report presented during the Dutch National Week of Climate in November 2022.",

The outcomes of the research will therefore represent a practical tool to better the economic and logistic sustainability of the cultural organisation focusing on safeguarding the grassroots aspect of their work with performance artists and the community. This will include an analysis of past and present formal and informal managerial practices of PACE and its network, an investigation on a possible future institutional embedding in the University of the Free State, and finally the definition of steps to eventually take in that direction. The methodology proposed is a form of organisational ethnography applied to a digital environment.",

The participants, coming from different countries of the European continent, will communicate with experts and their peers through a series of workshops, knowledge-sharing sessions, cultural exchange sessions, as well as realising cross-border collaborative projects. The project aims to provide:\n\n- an analysis of the current institutional, legal, and political frameworks governing the fields of visual and performing arts,\n- a series of realistic collaborative projects based on individual artistic practices carried out by groups of 3-6 young individuals from different European countries,\n- public dissemination of the results using various platforms, in order to share the experience gained, as well as descriptions of the challenges encountered in realising the projects in order to provide peer-to-peer support for future generations of young professionals working with similar topics.\n\nRegrettably, an education - formal or informal - in the arts does not always prepare young people to successfully navigate the structures governing their field of interest and to make their work visible to the public. This often discourages the new generation of artists from pursuing a meaningful career in the arts after a few unsuccessful attempts to realise their projects. This forum will provide peer-to-peer and expert support for young professionals when starting their careers. It will ensure sustainability through public dissemination of the results and will also allow for closer and more meaningful collaboration on a European level.",
