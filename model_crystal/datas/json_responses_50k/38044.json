Therefore, all issues related to maternal and child health have been labeled as priority areas in policy and strategy development by the Lao government. However, while Laos has been subject to many health system reforms, innovations and policy changes, the desired effects have not yet been achieved. Earlier health system research in the Lao health system have suggested that persistent implementation gaps might be one of the main barriers hindering the governmental attempts of strengthening the health care system. This research project explores the gap between sexual and reproductive health (SRH) policy formulation and implementation (1) by measuring the extent to which policy objectives are translated into practice and (2) by analyzing the perspectives of involved actors on policy formulation and implementation processes in order to identify barriers in the health system hindering successful implementation. On the one hand, this policy implementation analysis aims to reveal insights with regard to the extent to which SRH policies are translated into practice by health managers and which barriers are encountered by implementers. On the other hand, this study feeds into reflections on policy implementation processes in general and make suggestions for future pathways to change these processes in order to increase effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of SRH policy implementation.",

On the one hand, this policy implementation analysis aims to reveal insights with regard to the extent to which SRH policies are translated into practice by health managers and which barriers are encountered by implementers. On the other hand, this study feeds into reflections on policy implementation processes in general and make suggestions for future pathways to change these processes in order to increase effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of SRH policy implementation.",
