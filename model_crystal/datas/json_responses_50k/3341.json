    "summary": "Currently studying MSc Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society at the University of Twente.\nI am an open-minded, well-organized person, empathetic and focused in tech ethics and design. Having been involved in numerous design projects, I became aware of social problems and issues of emerging technologies, and learnt valuable social science research methods to deal with them. Studying philosophy of technology was a natural next step to expand my knowledge of technology ethics and to gather new insights on social design. My experiences enable me to design and evaluate our preferable technological futures.\n\nMy dream is to one day become a significant voice in tech ethics.",
