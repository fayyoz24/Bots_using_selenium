The product, InterAct, is Signify's multiuse IoT solution that has use cases in Sport lighting, Architectural Lighting, Office and Retail store lighting. \n\nManaged social media of Press Office channels ensuring precise and engaging communication of the company's most notable activities around the world. From content creation to community management and data reporting I was involved in all steps of the communication process. To ensure the process was insight driven I conducted weekly media analyses to improve both content and strategy.\n\nI was also lucky enough to get hands on PR work at IFA 2018. IFA is a large tech convention typically hosted in Berlin, amongst our InterAct offering, I also worked on PR for Philips Hue ensuring all speakers made media events on time and that content from the convention was curated and scheduled for release on our global channels.",
