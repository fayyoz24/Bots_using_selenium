    "summary": "I work for the European Space Agency in a combined Technical and Management Role which enables me to maintain links with Industry and keep abreast of technical development whilst at the same time lead a great team of Engineers working on the Sentinel-1 Payload.\n\nI got into the Space Industry quite by chance when I accompanied one of my friends to a recruitment Seminar held by Matra Marconi Space in Plymouth University where I was studying. I had no intention of applying for a job in Space until I started talking to an Engineer who told me about the project he was working on.  This involved exploration into deep space in order to see what was beyond our universe. Thinking about the Universe and what was out there captured my imagination and started my love affair with the Space Industry. As a result I immediately signed up and was lucky enough to be called for an Interview. I started my career in Space with Matra Marconi Space, now known as Astrium Ltd, in June 1997. Since then I have been involved in many Space projects mainly centered around Earth Observation and Synthetic Aperture Radar which allows us to monitor our Planet continuously for many applications. I have met a lot of wonderful people in the Space Industry, most of which tend to stay and it is like being part of a large family.",

This was a joint venture with Astrium GmbH and breadboards were designed and manufactured to prove the concept. My responsibilities apart from managing the team were to co-ordinate, as the deputy Project Manager with my counterpart in Astrium GmbH, weekly meetings to asses progress and develop and good across team working relationship. I also organized joint reviews with my German colleagues and presented with my team our results which were well received.

As I was on a two year graduate Programme I had the chance to work in various parts of the company to gain experience and find out more about the different aspects of Engineering in the Space Industry. During my graduate years I worked on a /diverse array of Projects including ASAR TR Modules, ASAR TCIU, Artemis FGU, Metop and Waveguide Filter Tuning. My role on these Project was as a test Engineer which gave me a hands on experience with the Hardware after it had been designed. During the last part of my graduate Programme I spent six months in the Directorate of Science and Radar working on ASAR, RadarSAT and Metop predominantly helping in the System Design aspects that required RF Modeling for support to reviews etc. This lead me to aspire towards a career in Design and specifically the area of RF Design. I started as an Assistant Engineer in the Directorate of Science and Radar in June 1999 and after training in HP UNIX, Fortran and HP Advanced Design System I produced RF Models for use across a range of Projects to allow the generation of RF Budgets and RF Requirements into System and Subsystem level requirements specifications. This lead to roles on Metop and LSAR as the RF System Engineer where my responsibilities included Producing realistic RF Models of Equipments that could be used to fault find and during investigations. The Model produced for Metop was used for RF Compatibility modeling as the Metop Satellite had many Transmitters and Receivers from different instruments that could interact with each other. This needed modeling using ADS as well as a full life size Model where the Engineering Models of each Antenna were tested with each other over a dedicated test campaign. The S-Parameter results were then analyzed and fed into the ADS model for future reference and use.",
