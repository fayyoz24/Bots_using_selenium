For these industrial construction sites, to be reserved or removed, and how to be protected or developed have become a hot issue in transformation and renewal of old city sites of modern city design. This passage takes the update and transformation of old industrial construction sites in Shougang for example. On the base of the preliminary research and analysis, including the base location, the size of the project, municipal transportation, environment analysis, functional status, the status of green, the ground situation analysis and so on, it puts forward a design scheme based on the ecological restoration and reconstruction of culture. In technology, it mainly adopts physical means to combine the ecological restoration (including soil and water purification etc.) with landscape. In visual form, it introduces agricultural landscape to contrast with industrial sites, resulting in more powerful and attractive landscape level. At the same time, according to the site location and the characteristics of surrounding industrial culture, and to guide people\u2019s actions by space design naturally, it aims at establishing a new landscape, function of order and unique aesthetic standard for the industrial site and reconstructing the local cultural development, in order to achieve the  purpose of sustainable development of the ecology and culture , then puts forward practical methods for transformation of the city industrial construction sites.",

Usually the sphere structure includes an aspect of interesting and tries to give memory and feelings for seniors. If we could transform the \"nest\" of empty-nesters into a basic shape, it may be the sphere structure as well. So I try to use the accumulation of the sphere structure to create a basic structure of chair. At the same time, there are two movable components on the chair back. On the one hand, these generate certain interaction and dialogue between visitors and the chair. On the other hand, \"empty nest\" is real, warm, careful \"nest\" rather than \"empty nest\".",
