    "summary": "My name is Marloes Fransen. In 2012 I received my Bachelor Degree in International Business and Languages with English, Spanish and German as my languages. I graduated from the Avans University of Applied Sciences in Den Bosch.\n\nI have an international mind set and a love for travel. First of all, I have lived a year in Argentina as an exchange student after finishing pre-university education. Furthermore, as part of my Bachelor Degree, I have studied a semester in Costa Rica and I have completed internships of 5 months in London and Barcelona. During my professional education I have studied and worked on the following aspects of Applied Sciences: entrepreneurship, marketing, finance, promotion, culture and communication. As for my linguistic skills: my native language is Dutch and I speak fluent English, Spanish and elementary German.\n\nCurrently I am the business manager of the department of public playground equipment at my family\u2019s wood business. It is a small but diverse and international company, enabling me to develop a great variety of professional skills and experience, for example in the field of purchase, sales, marketing, social media, customer relationship and administration.\n\nMy weekend job as a waitress at a high quality restaurant has been based purely on my personal affinity with the culinary food and wine industry. Following my passion I obtained my SWEN 3 wine certificate and I am still trying to increase my knowledge on the subject.\n\nI would describe myself as ambitious, creative, clever, inquisitive and spontaneous. My previous experiences of living and studying abroad have given me great independence and flexibility in my professional development. On a personal level I love dedicating my time to traveling, gastronomy and wine, playing football, reading books (especially classic literature) and my social life. My friends and family would describe me as an energetic, confident, knowledgeable and trustworthy young woman with a good sense of humour.",
