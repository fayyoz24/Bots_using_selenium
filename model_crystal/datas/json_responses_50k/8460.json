The airfoil used was NACA 0016 airfoil at 75000 Renolds Number. A simplified 2D geometry was created and compared to the Hugh Piggott's hand made design. Hugh Piggott's design has been tried and tested and this project was a small attempt to optimize the performance of the machine by proposing, evaluating and combining techniques to improve the turbine blade's efficiency.  This project demanded a strong understanding of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics which are broadly the same, as both air and fluid are Newtonian fluids.",

First a variable displacement V6 Gasoline Direct Injection engine was designed and a 1D CFD simulations was done in LMS Amesim and the pressure and temperature at the exhaust were measured. After that, according to these pressure and temperature readings, 3 different Thermoacoustic Primemovers were designed in Design Environment for Low-amplitude ThermoAcoustic Energy Conversion (DeltaEC). The first model is a simple standing wave Thermoacoustic engine with 41% efficiency. But the size was not very desirable so a second twin regenerator Thermoacoustic engine was designed with an efficiency of 43%. But because of the demand and competitiveness in terms of efficiency and size, a travelling wave Thermoacoustic engine was designed with an efficiency of 46% and the possibility of liquid piston was largely investigated to make the engine compact and suitable for car use. Each of these engines are simulated at 25 different temperature points varying between 300k to 750k with different volumetric flow rates varying for all the 3 primemovers with six different working medium in the engine namely - Helium, Nitrogen, Air, Carbon dioxide, Helium-Xenon mixture and Helium-Argon mixture.",
