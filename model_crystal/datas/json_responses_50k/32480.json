    "summary": "I facilitate product-service systems and strategies using human(ity)-centred design and research. \n\nI enjoy collaborating with people from different backgrounds and using micro skills like reflection to facilitate complex problem exploration and co-creation. Using a creative, inclusive and systems-rooted lens is key to everything I do.\n\nMy passions include thought leadership of design, innovation management, and planning/facilitating creative workshops. \n\nI also enjoy speculating about the future of our world and employing cross-functional innovation, design and technology as a best practice to build towards it - keeping in mind social impact, sustainability and design justice.\n\nSkilled at project management, communication, creative and technical writing - I strive to be a T-shaped professional and these skills manifest as a boon in all of my tasks. \n\nLet's grab a (virtual or physical) cuppa/water/beer and connect :)",

We envision an Atmanirbhar (English: self-sufficient), future-proof India with innovation - through the UNBOX India movement.\n\nMy role in this project involved leading the design research, strategy and facilitating a bunch of workshops. I created additional value for the team through content writing and program management. Details below:\n\n1. Qualitative research about innovation in India and how students have/might approach it, creative design research on design toolkits existing worldwide, actionable insight generation (analysis and synthesis) and creating strategic design choices.\n\n--> A strong propagation of inclusivity and accessibility principles as a strategic guideline for the design of the toolkit. This was communicated across the design team for e.g, to the visual designer, and implemented as well.\n\n3. Designing the structure, content, process of use and strategy of UNBOX and its individual artefacts, detailing existing design methods and creating new ones, low-fidelity testing and, creating UNBOX\u2019s value proposition canvas.\n\n4. Planning and co-facilitating workshops (related to lean startup and pre-totyping) wherein we built on methods from UNBOX. These workshops were done with budding entrepreneurs from the CVR College of Engineering, Hyderabad.\n\n5.
