    "summary": "Over thirty years of involvement as Engineering Consultant to North Sea Operating Companies, fulfilling various design engineering and construction support functions has included pipeline systems, subsea wellhead and template facilities, as well as involvement in the development of integrated towhead technology to enhance pipeline bundle performance. This has led to considerable experience in the transfer of products by pipeline in both offshore and onshore environments.\n\nThe experience of installing and maintaining subsea wells and their associated control and power umbilicals from fixed and floating structures has seen me as a client representative on Lay and Jet barges, DSVs and Construction barges, ROV and Survey vessels.\n\nHaving been involved in the development of the systems now applied to deep-water field developments. From the early days, I have been closely associated with the development of this technology. This gives me a comprehensive overview of all aspects of a subsea projects with the ability to smooth the interfaces between the different specialities, with an emphasis on improving performance and reducing costs.\n\n",
