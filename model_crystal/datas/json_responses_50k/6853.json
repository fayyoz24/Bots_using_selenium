This had an impact of 6 Mil Euro on Unilever India business.  Worked closely with Hair and Home Care R &D to get Ethoxylated Alcohol approved in India. Worked closely with suppliers in India to re classify Alcohol Ethoxylate 1 mole to correct HS Code such that it attracted nil import duty as against original HS Code which attracted 6 % import duty. This helped mitigate almost entire 6 Mil Euro impact.\nWas awarded supply chain excellence award for above project.\n\n2)Negotiated a conversion cost of $250 / MT with a new vendor for SLS/ PAS Needles for India which was at par with the theoretical conversion cost for SLS/ PAS Needles. This was against $400 that the incumbent supplier was charging.\n\n3)Negotiated a conversion cost of $65 per ton with a local supplier (Rawabi) in Saudi Arabia for SLES 1EO. This was one of the lowest conversion costs for SLES in the Unilever world.\n\n4)Negotiated and executed 1.2 Mil Euro savings on Tea Envelopes with annual spend of 3.5 M Euro",

The job also involves enhancing the cash position of the company by negotiating a higher payment term with vendors. A key element of the job is to identify and drive value creation projects through alternate vendors , alternate materials etc. This involves very close co-ordination with Research and Innovation and other supply chain functions.\nBringing the outside into the organization say for eg competition practices etc  is another key element of the job. Another key responsibility is material price forecasting and providing insights on market inflation so that business can take judicious calls on pricing.",
