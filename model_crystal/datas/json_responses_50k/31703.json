    "summary": "As a graduate of Arizona State University Master of Science program in Biomimicry as well as a graduate of Delft University of Technology as an architect (MSc), I've become a professional Biomimicry Design Educator. I learn biomimicry, I teach biomimicry and do research on best practices of biomimicry while analyzing how the beautiful analogies from Nature have a positive effect on our students. I've received my PhD on Analogical Reasoning in Biomimicry Design Education on October 8th, 2021. Still enjoying the vibes from that celebration.\n\nThose I am so lucky to teach, can become practitioners in the design world, helping to design for circularity within the systems we live. \n\nWe practice the complete Biomimicry [Design] Thinking methodology in our minor \"Design with Nature\" at The Hague University of Applied Sciences within the IDE program. Here students tackle relevant global challenges with real clients such as torrential rains, storm flooding, heat and humidity, waste-to-resource issues and building shelters for in these operating conditions. In past semesters, students have addressed the noise polution along the railways with ProRail, the Energy Transition with Spinwaves / Mensen Maken de Transitie, and Plastic in our waterways with the Betafactory in The Hague. Climate challenges such as Urban Heat, flooding and drought have become main issues to design solutions for. Each team of students amazes me each year with what they  learn from nature to solve their challenge... I hope to continue doing this kind of research after my PhD and am open for options to be able to do so, preferably at a University as Professor of Biomimicry. Momentarily, I am able to learn from my fellow 'tribe members' in the Biomimicry Living Lab at THUAS that I have started with biomimicry specialsts and alumni from the Biomimicry Design Thinking semester. New members keep joining, making this an adaptive, regenerative community tribe.",

The first workshop was for their New Years opening celebration. Such an inspiring and innovative place to be! Their solutions for eating out during the Corona crisis in 2020 reached my friends in Colorado who posted it on their own Facebook page. Awesome! \nSee the workshop here: https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/285513/workshop-biomimicry"
