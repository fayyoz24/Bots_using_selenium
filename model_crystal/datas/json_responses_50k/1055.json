    "summary": "For me, it's very simple! Investing in your people- your employees is CRUCIAL to meeting your organizational or business goals!!!\n\n\nHello, I am Amarachi Adannaya Igboegwu, and I am passionate and driven about helping people managers building inclusive teams which make for inclusive workplaces.\ud83c\udf0e\n\n\nI recognized my natural ability in building capacity and inspiring connection and harmony while teaching in Japan as an English teacher\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\n\nBeing one of the very few black foreigners in my town of Yonago, Tottori, I was invited to talk to elementary school students and women\u2019s groups about my cultural experiences as an English teacher in Japan \u26e9\ufe0f\n\n\nDuring these incredible moments of storytelling about my life in the US as a Nigerian-American, I found my calling. \u2764\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t occur to me that I was doing diversity work back then, but it helped me recognize that I was good at connecting with audiences. \n\n\nI moved to San Francisco, after 18 months in Japan and focused on developing my public speaking and leadership skills through Toastmasters International (Go Golden Gate Toastmasters!). \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udca5\n\n\nMy experience at Golden Gate Toastmasters and my extensive work and academic experience have equipped me with the skills to develop and facilitate workshops that lead people managers to build inclusive teams.\ud83d\udca5\n\n\nI have exceptional skills in facilitating workshops that inspire and build connections critical for collaborative work in the workplace. \ud83d\udca5\n\nMy current job role has further reinforced my onsite and virtual facilitation skills as the Global Induction Trainer at the Norwegian Refugee Council, where I have trained over 300 facilitators. \ud83d\udca5\n\nBuilding an inclusive team will inspire employees to give their best because of the alignment of their goals with the organization\u2019s overall mission. \ud83d\udca5\n\nMotivation becomes natural when people understand their role and personal contribution in achieving overarching goals. \ud83d\udca5\n\nProviding the right environment that supports team members, therefore, becomes imperative.\ud83d\udca5\n\nI am on a mission to promote knowledge critical for building inclusive and cohesive teams. \ud83d\udca5",

I love my job because I work closely with facilitators worldwide, where I  support, mentor, coach them in delivering top-notch induction workshops.\nMy role also entails leadership development where I equally incorporate DEI principles. I count myself as lucky because I get to do what comes naturally to me.
