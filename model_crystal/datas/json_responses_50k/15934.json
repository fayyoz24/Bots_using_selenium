Approx. 250 volunteers make the day possible for the kids. Objective is to secure that the families escape a day from their normal routine. Because also the volunteers escape a day from their daily routine the event creates a symbioses of hearth warming positivism where everybody goes above and beyond; utopia for a day. www.opkikker.nl"
