I have proven track record building brands, leading multifunctional teams and delivering on key business KPIs (revenue, share, profit, brand penetration and equity). \n\nAfter a decade at the biggest CPG company in the world, I was chosen among a selected group of talents to join startup generator Antler, where I combined my experience and my purpose to empower women, to build Baushe (previously Baubo.care) - a platform that aims to enable women to live at their best through menopause.\n\nIn 2021 I joined LunamLabs, as cofounder, to bring to life \"The Gamechangers NFT\" - a unique NFT collection made by women artists, featuring gamechanging women, with the purpose to fund women entrepreneurs. \n\nI also co-founded \"Lean In Netherlands\", the officially affiliated network to Lean In.org, which grew to a team of 35+ volunteers and a strong community. On this capacity, I'm often invited to talk at events, companies, podcasts or panels. \n\nClifton strengths: WOO, Activator, Includer, Communicator, Significance \nMBTI: E.N.T.J\n\nMotto: \"It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.\" [Invictus, W.E. Henley]\n\nPS: I'm selective with my network, so I won't accept LinkedIn invitations without an introduction on the invite, without a good reason for us to connect; or from robots",
