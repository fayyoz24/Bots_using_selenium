In accordance with the EU PACT FOR SKILLS the project is focusing on the development of digital skills by better tuning between the institutional actors and the individuals and their needs. Career Guidance and Counselling (CGC) practitioners play an important role bringing individuals, companies, and training providers closer together. This is especially important for disadvantaged learners who experience a digital divide.\n\nDigital transformation is also a challenge for HE and study programs in this context. CGC practitioners as well as other professionals in the field (e. g. in-company trainers, HR experts, adult education experts) need a deeper understanding of the digital transformation and the needs in the labor market as well as the training offers and programs available.\n\nThis requires a transformation of guidance offerings and concepts systematically, I.e.: The level of digital skills; The level of needs-based training offerings in the local and regional context; The level of cooperation in networks and the methodical design for cooperation; The level of the psychological-individual situation, which should be reflected in resource orientation, encouragement and strengthening of identity.\n\nThese aspects will be reflected in the academic education and training of counselors as well as in the approach to the development of CGC services. HEI and practice need to be linked for this purpose. Networking all partners, cooperation at eye level, recognition of people as important actors, local and targeted offer development are some central approaches that will be brought together in the project.",

Alongside their working life people more usually need to adjust and develop their career. Lifelong Career Guidance and related services are a relevant mean in this context (EU resolution 2004; 2008). In face of demographic change, forthcoming digitalization and individualization, economic crisis, global competition and skills shortage many organizations around Europe are coming under increasing pressure to find and keep talented employees at all levels of skills who bring the right qualification, competence and motivation. At the same time employees get mobile, search for attractive, stable and future-oriented job opportunities and need support to access labour offers all around Europe.\n\nStudents and professionals as (future) HR experts and practitioners, scholars in University and trainers in VET sector, counsellors and coaches in public or private services play a key role for the implementation of the envisaged change. CONNECT! will address them as direct target groups by courses and trainings. Career topics will be integrated in study programs in different disciplines and interdisciplinary study programs. Indirect targets are the more than 220 million employees (individual beneficiaries). Being aware of the fact that of course the project cannot reach all these people, it aims to make a difference in the future practice of career development in enterprises. The target group includes employees of all age, all level of education and qualification as of hierarchy. This includes explicitly those employees who face special difficulties and risks. VET students and trainees from higher education sector are of special interest.",
