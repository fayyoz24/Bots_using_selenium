    "summary": "I have a Masters degree in Bio-Engineering (Life Science and Technology) and a Masters degree in High-Tech Business Administration (Management of Technology), where I am top of my class. I also hold a Bachelors degree in Life Science and Technology, where I received a national price for best performing student in related studies. During my education I gained both theoretical and practical experience in bio-engineering and -research, and in financial- and managerial matters. I developed both engineering, and financial- and managerial experiences further during my time as Team Leader of the DreamTeam iGEM TUDelft 2021, for which we were awarded second place in the global competition. I gained further personal- and social development and administrative- and managerial experience during my time as Chairman of the student board of the Royal Society Of Engineers (KIVI). I gained additional financial- and entrepreneurial experience during the venture creation and mentorship programs of iGEM EPIC 2022. During my Bachelors degree Life Science and Technology I was able to follow a minor abroad at Imperial College London, where I followed physical-, organic-, and pharmaceutical courses on Masters level. I also assisted teachers of various courses as Teaching Assistant, where I guided and developed workshop modules, mentored students, and helped assessing exams. I also worked as Community Officer for first year Bachelors and first year Masters students, where I was the first contact point for administrative and educational related issues. In parallel to my professional development, I have also developed myself a tremendous amount on a personal level over the ages due to various life-changing events.",

The iGEM competition is a global competition inviting student teams from all around the world to engineer a solution for a societally relevant problem through synthetic biology. As Team Leader I led the 2021 team from the Delft University of Technology. Our team developed a quantitative, modular and rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies used at the point-of-care called AptaVita. This aptazyme-based device, containing dedicated readout hardware, could help accelerate the data obtention on vitamin deficiencies to combat hidden hunger more effectively. As Team Leader I was responsible for the overall vision of the project, the realization of the overall project goals, project management, and project module alignment and integration. A good understanding of all different components (engineering design, modeling, human practices, entrepreneurship, amongst others) was required from my part. Contributions besides leading the team include modeling of the biomolecular network and subsequent laboratory interpretations, acquisitions, human practices, and entrepreneurship.\nOur team came in second in the overall global competition and won 2 project prices.",
