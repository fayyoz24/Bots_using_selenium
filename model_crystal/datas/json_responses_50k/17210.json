The design uses an integrated co-simulation approach incorporating load pull for optimal impedance extraction, network synthesis, and electromagnetic analysis. The design flow demonstrated uses a nonlinear GaN HEMT model, ATC capacitor models, and MWO software for EM analysis and layout. Also demonstrated is a method for source and load impedance network measurement and optimal tuning. ",
