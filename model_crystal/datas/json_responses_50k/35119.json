The main topics I work on are resilient long term water supply planning, organizational development, enabling environment, investments, network extension projects in low income areas and Monitoring & Evaluation.\n\nTowards Climate Resilient Water Supply in the Southwestern Mekong Delta\nThe project aims to support the water companies in the Mekong Delta in delivering sustainable and resilient water supply services in the context of climate change. Phase 1 of the project runs from 2018-2021 and focuses on developing climate resilient investment planning, organisational improvement of the utilities, and network extensions. To overcome challenges such as saline intrusion and soil subsidence, a regional approach for upgrading, expansion and modification of supply schemes is believed to be necessary. The project is a collaboration between SOCTRANGWACO (Soc Trang), CANTHOWASSCO (Can Tho), CANTHO2WASUCO (Can Tho), HAWASUCO (Hau Giang), CTU-Dragon Institute, VEI and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Within the project, the MoFA aims to strengthen the enabling environment of laws & regulations, financing and policies in which water companies are encouraged to function properly and enhance their performance.",

Strengthening the financial, technical and social sustainability of the local partner water companies in order to make sustainable drinking water available to millions of people in developing and transition countries.\n2. Strengthening the enabling environment of laws & regulations, financing and policies in which water companies are encouraged to function properly and enhance their performance.\n3. Increasing access to water infrastructure investment finance, by developing investment proposals and engaging with domestic and international fi nancing organisations and banks.\n\nAt VEI, the leading partner of the WaterWorX programme, I worked on setting up and coordinating the programme. Highlights included successfully finalising the inception phase, the annual plans for 2018 and 2019, setting up a Monitoring and Evaluation framework and the Amsterdam International Water Week, where all involved WaterWorX partners came together celebrating the kick-off of 25 Water Operator Partnerships.",
