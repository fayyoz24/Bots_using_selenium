    "summary": "I create experiences for life...\n\nDue the current world situation, I had the opportunity to continue with my studies after 10 years in the Tourism Industry. I got my certification as Health Coach in October 2020 and I started to run a small business in this area. It was challenging because it was something new for me, however I like to prove myself and I like to learn more things, I really like to help people in all ways are possible: with my service. As Health Coach or as Front desk supervisor or even in a restaurant. I am sure, I born to service with my talents to others and making a difference in every place I am.\n\nI am very proud of my own small business: \"Bienestar Integral\". I am working on line/part time in this project. With all my experience about customer service, sales and management I had the tools to run it by myself. Of course it wasn't easy but I love to learn and improve in a new area.\n\nMeanwhile we (all workers in tourism) go back to the action, I did something new and useful during the lockdown. I am pretty sure, we will go back stronger, with new experiences and lessons for life.\n\nI  considering myself as a smart worker, organized, creative, leader, disciplined and I have good management skills. I see the challenges in every company and team and I improve them as much as possible. I change my weaknesses for opportunities in my professional and personal life as well.\n\nI lived in the Netherlands almost 7 years. I have developed a great capacity to adapt of any situation and being open to new ideas. I loved to work with people from all over the world and from different cultures. \n\nI am thinking of solutions, not focus in the problems. Specially in situations which can be stressful, I stay focused in the best way to solve any issues for my customers and colleagues too.\n\nI am able to handle difficult situations with a positive attitude and a smile, and never lose control of the situation. My decisions are matching with my actions.\n\nI totally believe: \u201cif you want, you can get it!\u201d   \n",
