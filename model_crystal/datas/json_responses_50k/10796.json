This means that the energy demand of Enspijk is equal to the energy production within Enspijk, measured over one year. A concrete design was made which takes into account the technical possibilities within Enspijk, the boundaries set by different stakeholders and the capacities of the current electricity grid.\n\nThe current energy use in Enspijk together with an estimation of the future energy demand in 2030 is analyzed first. The potential of different renewable energy sources is investigated, including wind energy, solar energy, biomass and geothermal energy. In order to make an optimal plan, three scenarios with different emphasis are proposed. After carrying out a multi criteria analysis, a combined scenario is constructed with the most promising features of these three scenarios.",
