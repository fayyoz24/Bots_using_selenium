Over three years we have managed to foster a large and dedicated following of over 70.000 people on Facebook alone. Moreover, we pride ourselves in direct communication with our followers as well as receiving feedback and ideas from them that help us grow our brand and exposure. Through the quality of our content we sustain high engagement and reach, all organic and without any help from external ads.",
