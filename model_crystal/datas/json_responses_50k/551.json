    "summary": "From a young age, I have had a passion for history. During my study, I discovered a particular interest in doing research, going to archives, and working with sources that easily date back 500 years. Therefore, I chose to focus on an academic career by following the research master Classical, Medieval, and Early Modern Studies (CMEMS). Moreover, I participated in several academic conferences like IMC Leeds and the CMEMS conference to broaden my academic experience. \n\nDuring my student years, I developed my leadership and management skills through my committee and board work for the study association GHD Ubbo Emmius. The board year enabled me to develop my organisational, communication, and crisis-management skills. In addition to  my involvement in GHD Ubbo Emmius, I also participated in several university committees like the Programme Committee of CMEMS and the First Years' Council of the study History. \n\nMy interests are not limited to an academic environment. During holidays and weekends, I  work for beach club the Marlijn on Schiermonikoog (Island in The Netherlands). From the start of my employment at the Marlijn, I have developed a passion for food, drinks, and everything related to restaurant work. Due to my broad interests, I had many different tasks, from dishwasher to waiter and from cook to bartender.  \n\nCurrently, I am a PhD-candidate at the Central European University in Vienna. My project \"Life-changing journeys to Rome (2022-2026)\" concerns the late medieval pilgrimage to Rome and the prescribed, presented and expressed emotions during these life-changing events.",
