    "summary": "I am a performer of classical and contemporary music, both as soloist and chamber musician. I'm part of the Oskari Piano Quartet. With Ensemble Modelo62 and my duo Nine Volt I explore more experimental classical music. I\u2019m often involved in music theatre and modern dance productions. \n\nI am part of the production team of Ensemble Modelo62, writing texts for subsidy applications and publicity. Besides that I work as a freelance fundraiser for other artists and cultural organizations.\n\nLast edition of the Cello Bi\u00ebnnale Amsterdam I did the artistic direction, production and presentation of the Tango Club Night, where I performed with top musicians from the Dutch tango scene. We premiered the production Beethoven Lost in Silence by Esther Apituley right before the pandemic and toured it during the seasons 2020, 2021 and 2022. During the summer of 2019 I performed 46 shows of the theatre production Mammoet by Tom de Ket www.mammoetindrenthe.nl. For 6 years I was the cellist of the tango bands of Dutch Bandoneon player Carel Kraayenhof. We performed a.o. at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam together with the Carel Kraayenhof Ensemble and the Dutch Chamber Orchestra (Nederlands Kamerorkest). Besides tours in Indonesia, the Dutch Caribbean and Gran Canaria with this group I traveled to Japan and Indonesia with pianist and voice trainer Roeland Drost. With Ensemble Modelo62 we performed in Argentina, Mexico, Norway, UK Germany and Belgium. I created and performed my own music for the musictheatreplay Pessoa, a mist-opera that was premiered at the Cellobi\u00ebnnale Amsterdam. Together with dancer/choreographer Samir Calixto I created Beating Hollow, a duet for dancer and cellist (in collaboration with Korzo Productions). With this performance we made it to the final of the Jur Naessens Muziekprijs 2009 at the BIMhuis, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2006 I graduated from the Fontys Conservatory in Tilburg, where I studied with Paul Uyterlinde. Before I was a student of Ran Varon and Jeroen den Herder at the conservatories of Zwolle and Utrecht. During my studies I had lessons with Maria Hol, Jaap Kruithof, Lenian Benjamins and Eduard van Regteren-Altena. \n\nI followed masterclasses with Marcio Carneiro, Vladimir Perlin and Gabor Tak\u00e1cs-Nagy (Tak\u00e1cs Quartet). In 2010 I attended the Internationale Ferienkurse f\u00fcr Neue Musik 2010 in Darmstadt, Germany, where I had coachings with Bill Forman and Lucas Fels, cellist of the Arditti Quartet.\n\nSpecialties: classical, contemporary music, dance performances,  tango, rock, jazz, text, finance.",
