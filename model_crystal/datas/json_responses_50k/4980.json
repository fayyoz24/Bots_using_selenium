The Business Accounting team performs margin and subsidy activities in TomTom. My tasks involved:\n- Compiling royalty reports based upon external royalty contracts and communicating these with TomTom vendors and customers;\n- Preparing and maintaining royalty dashboards and overviews to ensure accurate accounting information.\n- Manage preparation of quarterly audit schedules as required, working in cooperation with internal and external auditors;\n- Participating in ad hoc projects to support management in increasing efficiency in the accounting processes.\n- Analyze and review balance sheet and P&L positions and send out analytical reports and reconciliations out to the Business and Corporate Finance.\n\nWithin these teams I have intensively learned about all the technology created from the TomTom products and gained a bottom-up view of the company. This allowed me to see different aspects from beginning to end and brought new insights to my next rotation: TomTom Automotive.",
