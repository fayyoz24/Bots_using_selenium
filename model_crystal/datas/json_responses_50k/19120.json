The goal of the project was to create a design to control the amplitude and frequency of the cradle with the main goal of calming down the baby. The following are the learning outcomes from this project:\n\nDeveloped my programming skills in C programming.\n\nImproved my design skills in creating sensors (Heartbeat, crying sound), and optimizing the circuit by using filters and amplifiers.\n\nGot familiar with the M5 stack framework, and used M5 signals in order to drive power through a transistor circuit in order to control actuator movements of the cradle.\n\nWe managed to successfully finish the project within 8 weeks, achieving the 2nd fastest time from around 30 groups.\n\nThe following is the link to the code: https://github.com/malikweren/DBL-Rock-your-Baby",
