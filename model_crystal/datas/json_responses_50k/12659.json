    "summary": "Available for Interim assignments starting from 01-10-2023\n\nDriven Supply Chain and Logistics professional, graduated from Aviation Logistics with experience as buyer, planner and coordinator in the Ecommerce and retail business. Known as an innovative thinker with strong focus on business strategy, a key player in relationship management and coordinating experience for new and on-going projects. As a highly motivated and results-driven leader, solving strategic complex logistic business segments strongly improves my own personal motivation and development. \n\nHaving a high motivation is the key in getting things done. I acquired the required skills for analyzing and identifying opportunities for efficiency improvements such as improving FCA KPI's lowering operational cost, portfolio rationalisation, creating Forecast exception/Inventory dashboards. This is demonstrated in with the success of the Key-User & Slimstock program Slim4 and super user for F&R RELEX, the creation of KPI templates and self-initiated projects at Greetz.",
