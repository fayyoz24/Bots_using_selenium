    "summary": "I'm an award-winning multi-disciplinary creative. \"What the f**k is that?!\" I hear you ask... good question. It means I've spent nearly 10 years working at the best independent advertising agencies in London & Amsterdam such as Mother, Wieden + Kennedy, Anomaly and We Are Pi learning how to come up with ideas, write them, design them, sell them, script them, art direct them, cast them, shoot them, edit them then fight tooth-and-nail to not lose them in the process.\n\nMy experience spans big-budget campaigns for global brands (IKEA, Nike) zero-budget campaigns for NGOs (Greenpeace, SkatePal), brand re-designs for fashionistas (Desigual), bonkers installations for bookies (Paddy Power) and docu development for broadcasters (Channel4, BBC).\n\nMy commercial work has made the leap from agency reels into real life; featuring in national press ('Treat Her Like A Queen' for The Body Shop) and on international news ('Deep House Party' for Desperados), which has led me to speak at events such as the D&AD Awards and Adweek Europe.\n\nMy independent design work has been sold around the world. Books (SAHTEN \u0635\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u2013 The SkatePal Cookbook) and zines (Roll With The Punches) have been featured by the likes of i-D, Good Sport Magazine, Huck and Its Nice That, distributed by Antenne Books, and stocked by independent outlets from Berlin to Biarritz to Beirut.\n\nMy photographic work (see www.tom-bird.com) has been exhibited at shows in the United Kingdom (Pushing Boarders, London), The Netherlands (New Radicalism, Rotterdam) and the Czech Republic (Brno Biennial of Graphic Design).\n\nI often work as a solo creative, although since el pandemico I've increasingly been partnered with various creatives dotted all over the world \u2013 either to lead projects or work within a wider creative unit. That said, should a project require a more hands-on approach, I do also have a bunch of trusted creative collaborators in my timezone.\n\nFinally, if you made it this far you'll be surprised to know that I try to stay humble. All this chest-beating gives me the ick, but if you aint gonna do it on LinkedIn, then where else you gonna do it.\n\nSay hello@tombirdistheword.com",

Featuring recipes from local skaters, their families, shop owners, local heroes, past volunteers, and even by Palestine\u2019s own international master chef: Sami Tamimi (co-founder of OTTOLENGI).\n\nI've been volunteering with SkatePal since 2015 \u2013 predominately as an instructor and and occasional skatepark builder \u2013 and this 184-page book is the result of a need to broaden awareness of the organisation beyond the skateboard community (skaters don't have the $$$). After developing the curation with the SkatePal team, I gathered the majority of material during a 2019 trip to Palestine, then spent 2020 writing, editing, and designing the book.\n\nHit the link below and pick up a copy. 100% of profits help to continue SkatePal's programmes...",
