            "description": "In this thesis, I individually assessed 130 national reports by countries, which stated their activities in response to the Minamata Convention, in order to better manage mercury within their case. As a result of an extensive data analysis procedure, the 130 national reports entailed over 1100 measures which countries have taken in the form of 28 mercury types and 20 measure types. After scanning literature, I identified eight types of measures, which induce problem shifting (the unintentional generation of other problems). The eight types of measures include 270 of the 1100 measures, highlighting a significant problem towards the effectiveness of the Convention, and have identified how waste streams are under-adressed by the Convention. Further disparities between Global North and South capacities were adressed, alongside a short-termism which inhibits national policy implementation processes. \n\nThis research will be presented in October at the ESG Conference at Radboud Universiteit in Nijmegen, and is currently undergoing metamorphasis to become a research article.",
