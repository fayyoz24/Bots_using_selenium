The Level 1 and 2 management team wanted to have a gist of how many consoles are being sold and how many of them are actually being activated by the users.\n\nA data dump from the ERP system was created with the data representing Region, Sales and Activations. This file was transported to an SFTP server and was used to parse an XML file which then created images of each state and region with the number on top of it.\n\nThese images were put together in a Map and was placed in an Apache server making it available over an internal web link. This link was shared to the Management team and also was used to display the progress on televisions placed across the companies offices.\n\nThe minimum viable product was designed and developed and delivered in 1 week. Changes were made to it later.",
