            "description": "DRAMPower is an open source tool for fast and accurate DRAM power and energy estimation for DDR2/DDR3/DDR4, LPDDR/LPDDR2/LPDDR3 and Wide IO DRAM memories based on JEDEC standards. The tool is based on the DRAM power model developed jointly by the Computer Engineering Research Group at TU Delft and the Electronic Systems Group at TU Eindhoven and verified by the Microelectronic System Design Research Group at TU Kaiserslautern with equivalent circuit-level simulations.\n\nThe tool can be employed at two levels of abstraction to enable easy integration into existing system design flows: (1) Command-level and (2) Transaction-level. Users employing DRAM memory controllers can log the DRAM command traces and employ DRAMPower at the command-level. Users without access to memory controllers can make use of DRAMPower at the transaction-level. To facilitate the same, DRAMPower now includes an optional DRAM command scheduler, which dynamically schedules and logs DRAM commands, corresponding to the incoming memory transactions, as if it were a regular memory controller. It assumes closed-page policy, employs FCFS scheduling across transactions and uses ASAP scheduling for DRAM commands. The generated DRAM command schedule is analyzable for real-time applications.\n\nThe DRAMPower tool performs DRAM command trace analysis based on memory state transitions, thus speeding up simulations. The power model and equations have been updated for better accuracy in consultation with TU Kaiserslautern [3]. As a result, DRAMPower is faster and more accurate than similar tools performing cycle-accurate analysis. Finally, the tool has also been updated to support variation-aware power estimation, for a selection of DDR3 memories manufactured at 50nm process technology. Towards this, 15 sample datasheets reflecting the variation-impact on DRAM currents are provided. The current version of the tool is v3.0 and was released on 10th September 2013. The tool can be downloaded at: www.drampower.info",
