OSS provides the means whereby HE institutions, students, businesses and foundations can all collaborate to resolve authentic business problems. Not only does OSS provide the necessary shared infrastructure and collaborative practice, the foundations which manage the software are also hubs which channel the operational challenges of their users through to the people who can solve them. This has great potential for enabling students and supervisors to collaborate in resolving the problems of businesses, but is constrained by the lack of support for managing and promoting collaboration across the two sectors. VALS will:\n\n- Provide the methods, practice, documentation and infrastructure to unlock this potential through virtual placements in businesses and other public and private bodies\n- Pilot and promote these as the \u201cSemester of Code\u201d\n\nThe consortium of eight is composed of equal numbers of HE institutions and SMEs who have a focus on OSS, and is completed by a number of OSS foundations as associate partners who have committed to collaborating in the Semester of Code by providing access to problems and problem owners.\n\nPartners: \n- University of Salamanca (Spain)\n- OpenDirective Ltd (United Kingdom)\n- RayCom B.V. (Netherlands)\n- University of Bolton (United Kingdom)\n- University of Udine (Italy)\n- University of Cyprus (Cyprus)\n- Mindshock S.L.
