    "summary": "I am a pragmatic, results-oriented, Mechanical Engineer with a special interest in the automotive and renewable energy industry. I have a passion for innovation and enjoy working in fast-paced environments, as one of my strengths is managing different priorities. I appreciate testing designs in real life to challenge my theories and simulations (wind tunnel experiments or mock-up testing, for instance). Thanks to a broad interest, I enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams; I will often perform at the interfaces of my discipline and start the dialogue with other (non-technical and technical) disciplines to find the best possible solution.",

With state-of-the-art CFD simulations and a new evaluation method that I developed, I analysed two conventional secondary intake designs. The goal of my research was to asses which aerodynamic design optimizations actually increase overall aircraft efficiency, and how larger intakes for MEA can be designed for efficiency.\n\nClearly, subsystem efficiency and aerodynamic efficiency have to be taken into account to optimize fuel consumption at aircraft level. Surprisingly, the conventional focus on Total Pressure Recovery actually reduces overall aircraft efficiency for MEA. Finally, I found that secondary air intake performance can be assessed by using the momentum thickness and inlet height only. In other words, the performance of larger secondary air intakes can be assessed easily, without the need for extensive CFD simulations.\n\nMy thesis was awarded with a 9/10.",

I worked on an unsteady, two-phase CFD model of a small centrifugal pump. The goal of my research was to find the sources of fluid-induced noise and vibration, and to determine which design parameters affect the pump performance, and noise and vibration levels.\n\nThrough a parametric study, I found empirical relations between five different design parameters and the pump performance, and noise and vibration levels. I proposed a new design that reduced torque and pressure fluctuations significantly (-20 dB), while only slightly diminishing efficiency. Besides that, the empirical relations proved to be a useful tool for quick redesigns of the pump.",
