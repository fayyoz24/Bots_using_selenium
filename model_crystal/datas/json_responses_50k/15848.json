    "summary": "\"EVERY CHILD IS AN ARTIST, THE PROBLEM IS STAYING AN ARTIST WHEN YOU GROW UP\" Pablo Picasso (1881 - 1973 )\n\nI believe that designers have the power to change the way people live by adding value to their lives. Designers see the harmony and transform it into life. Designing is the first step of a process in changing your environment and the surrounding world for a better and more comfortable life. \n\n\"It all must start with an inspired, spontaneous idea.\" Raymond loewy (1893 - 1986)\n\nWe are all full of ideas which are ignored most of the time. Ideas that stream in our mind but we usually forget them. Designing gives us the bravery to illustrate these ideas and make them real. Via designing you can change simple ideas to efficient and effective implements which can greatly influence our lives. \n\n'People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It\u2019s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn\u2019t know it was missing.\u201d Paola Antonelli",
