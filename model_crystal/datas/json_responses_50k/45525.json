    "summary": "Welcome to my English LinkedIn profile.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmbitious and eager to learn:\nI am a young, energetic and ambitious person, graduated as an aeronautical engineer with a passion for this industry that cannot be put into words. I like to learn things that are new to me, making it possible for me to grow, not only on a professional level but also as a person.\n\nFlexible:\nI am a flexible person. In daily life, but especially on a professional level. For my first job I moved to another part of the Netherlands, both challenging and rewarding. Internationally? Not a problem. I am flexible for my employer, working where the company needs me and where I fit best.\n\nTeam-player:\nI am truly a team-player. I like to work with people, working towards a goal as a team. For me it is not about the individual but about the end-result that was achieved by the team. Through my studies and previous employments I have experience with various projects, working together through the conceptual and detailed design phase of a project, where tasks like being the chairman, minutes secretary or just literature research were common.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you would like to know more, you may contact me at any time:\n\nalex.speet@outlook.com\nnl.linkedin.com/in/alexspeetaviation",
