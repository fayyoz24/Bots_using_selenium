    "summary": "Katy Grieve Creative\n\nI am a freelance, multi-disciplinary creative, working in the Fashion and Design industry as a freelancer in the roles of Fashion Knitwear Designer, Trend Forecaster and Creative Designer.\n\nAs a multilingual postgraduate from Nottingham Trent University specialised in knitwear design, I am skilled in a wide range of knitwear machinery and CAD. I have had experience working for Knitwear Lab in Amsterdam and continue to show interest in exploring innovative knitwear design in womenswear and textile finishings, exploring fully-fashioned design, combining knitwear techniques to enhance products. I have experience in sketching, designing and developing knitted clothing. Technical skills include experience on CAD Powerknitting machinery systems such as Stoll and Shima, knitting on Dubied machines, domestic knitting machines, linking machines, hand knitting and crochet techniques. I have taught knitting for many universities such as ArtEZ (Arnhem) and AMFI (Amsterdam).\n\nMy abilities continue on to communicate a keen interest in trend forecasting and creative design areas; from how I report on consumer zeitgeist and environment, to analysing societal behaviours and producing informed themes in trend developments. I have gained valuable trend forecasting experience through stijlinstituut Amsterdam who's clients operate in industries ranging from fashion/textiles to design; active in research, manufacturing, publishing and exhibiting looking ahead in time to drive innovation. These companies include Textile View, INVISTA, Heimtextil, Swarovski, Vlisco, Mare di Moda, Material District. I have gained experienced in the use of Adobe Softwares such as Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator and relevant experience in the use of Keynote through these projects.\n\nFurthermore, I have some Sales experience working for companies such as Knitwear Lab and Kniterate, handling customer relations and sales of knitted products as well as sales of Kniterate knitting machines.\n\nI travel frequently between the UK and Europe, based in the Netherlands. \n\nFeel free to email me with potential opportunities or collaborations: Katy_Grieve@hotmail.com",

Manipulating our preconceived restrictions of what a body should look like to be beautiful, this project allows us to dress up and camouflage from the harsh criticism of the outer world with new comfort. As knitwear is the most mouldable garment form, it allows many forms of manipulation on the body, sculpting and contouring, playing with forms to give the body new meaning in relation to the stripe in womenswear. It strongly refers to principles of Dazzle Camouflage and its power to hide or expose as graphic camouflage of a body in its environment. The collection redefines the stripe in knitwear\u2019s current industry.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Katy Grieve",
