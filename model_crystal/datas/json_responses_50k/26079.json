    "summary": "I didn't speak until I was 3 years old, which was a source of big concern for my grandparents. And only my mom said, \"Just wait - she will be unstoppable.\" Guess what? My mom was right! I started to talk after 3 and asked too many (like really too many!) questions. In transformation times, when you had a paper encyclopedia instead of Google at home, communication was my key to knowledge and information.\n\nThus, I turned my passion into a marketing communications manager profession. I enjoy talking to internal and external stakeholders to get valuable insights for the company, which help to build a marketing strategy. I worked with wonderful agile and mid-sized teams in Ukraine and Germany, enhancing my flexibility and readiness to work in fast-paced environments. I am especially passionate about developing and conducting marketing campaigns connected with the creation of compelling content.\n\nAdditionally, I am always thirsty for knowledge, constantly learning new things from graphic design and marketing to psychology, philosophy, and sometimes even physics. One of my favorite books now is \u201cAuthentic: How to be yourself and why it matters\u201d by Professor Stephen Joseph. I truly believe that both the company and the person should strive for authenticity. My goal, as a marketer, is to help your company to build authentic relationships with your audience.\n\nI am currently open to new job opportunities and eager to take on new challenges. Please do not hesitate to contact me!",
