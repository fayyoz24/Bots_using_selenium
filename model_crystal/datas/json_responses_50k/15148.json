    "summary": "Currently I live in Utrecht and work as IT Security Architect at PostNL. Have previously worked as IT Compliance Officer and in several IT related project manager positions during my IT Management Traineeship at PostNL. I have obtained a MSc in Industrial Engineering & Management (Financial Engineering & Management) at the University of Twente and performed my graduation internship at PwC. I have a BSc in Applied Physics from Twente University. Naarden-Bussum is the place where I grew up.\n\nI have been National Treasurer of the Political Youth Organization Young Democrats (Jonge Democraten, affiliated with D66) from February 2010 till December 2011. In this function I was responsible for the financial policy and all the associated organizational aspects of the association. Using knowledge from previous functions, critical thinking and knowledge from the JD itself, I combined the best in order to optimize the organization for the more than 5000 members.\n\nBefore becoming active at the JD, I have had several other positions in boards and committees. Among other things, I was a University Council Member for the University of Twente, treasurer of the UReka fraction within the Council, treasurer of the Campus Broadcast Association and chairman of the Central Educational Price UT.",
