    "summary": "I am a a transportation and logistics engineer specialised in bulk material handling systems and logistic processes in bulk terminals and plants. \n\nI gained experience in numerous bulk terminal projects world-wide. The projects varied from (pre-) feasibility studies to master-planning, conceptual design, preparation of tender documentation and actual project implementation and construction supervision but also due-diligences. Nearly all projects are multi-disciplinary involving expertise like marine civil design, financial feasibility and EIA.\n\nIn St.Petersburg I am ultimately responsible for the quality of the bulk material handling projects which we do from our local office. I am also the linking pin between our local team and our bulk handling centre of excellence in Rotterdam.",

The projects varied from (pre-) feasibility studies to master-planning, conceptual design, preparation of tender documentation and actual project implementation and construction supervision but also due-diligences. Nearly all projects are multi-disciplinary.\n\nThe last year before I went to St.Petersburg with my family I acted as team-leader in the field of bulk material handling.\n\nA nice project example is the new phosphate export terminal in the Aqaba South Port. I was involved in master planning, conceptual design, tender design and tender documentation as well as the tendering process itself. After that I contributed to the construction supervision and back-office support. The terminal is now up and running and visible in google-earth!\n\nOther projects included pit-to-port studies, floating transhipment studies, coal fired power plant fuel and waste handling optimisation studies, tender documentation for a fly-ash terminal, conceptual design and due-diligences of several grain export terminals.",
