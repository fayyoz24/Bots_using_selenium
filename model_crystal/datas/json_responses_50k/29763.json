    "summary": "Biomedical engineer with expertise in computational biology and a strong background in epidemiological research. I am experienced in utilizing data mining and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns in complex biological datasets, facilitating the identification of cardiovascular biomarkers. \nCurrently working toward a PhD degree in the groups of Molecular Epidemiolgy in the LUMC. Supervised by Prof. Dr. Eline Slagboom (LUMC), Prof Dr. Marcel Reinders (TU Delft), and Ir. Dr. Erik van den Akker (LUMC) I used with large population studies (e.g. BBMRI-nl) to identify cardiovascular and aging biomarkers. Combining advanced algorithms with different -omics levels (e.g. metabolomics and DNA methylation) I trained and analyzed several risk models for cardiovascular risk factors. \nI also created and maintained  for 2 years a Rshiny package named MiMIR (available on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MiMIR/index.html) to apply our metabolomics models to other studies.\nI was also a member of the board of the LUMC PhD Association for 2 years, in which I organized several events. I am open-minded, autonomous and respectful. Always keen on learning new skills and collaborating with people from all over the world.",

The data was downloaded from the TCGA database during December 2014, and it contained the data from the normal cells, the cancerous cells for all the 71 patients. Moreover, also the microRNA expression from was available.\nTherefore, we analyzed the gene expression data using a t-test and a Fold Change analysis to reveal the genes that changed more their expression between the normal condition and the cancerous condition. The same analysis was done for both theRNAs and the microRNAs, obtaining two lists. In order to do this, I created a MATLAB GUI.\nSubsequently, we analyzed if the differentially expressed genes were functionally enriched in Biological Process, Molecular Functions or Cellular Components terms, using the web tool Fidea. This revealed some interesting properties of the cancer. Finally, I analyzed the most interesting RNAs and microRNAs differentially expressed, looking also if they were previously related to the disease in previous studies.\n\n",

In a really interactive class we were abe to discuss and create new methods to select better these genes. \nIn particular my project used the cross correlation to find similarities between the expression of the cyclins and the one of the other genes. Indeed, cycins is a family of proteins that control the progression of cells through the cell cycle, so they could be useful to individuate other possible regulatory genes.",
