The project aims to reach a better understanding of science teachers' competencies and training needs necessary to teach sustainable development goals (SDG) through socio-scientific issues (SSI) in Dutch secondary science education efficiently. Implementing SSI into science lessons and developing citizenship skills such as argumentation, reasoning, and evidence-based decision-making are suggested by several researchers as an effective way to achieve the SDG. Although there is a relatively large literature on SSI and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) separately, there is limited research on ESD through implementing SSI in science lessons. Moreover, previous studies have mainly focused on teacher knowledge, although, for effective use of SSI for ESD, not only teacher knowledge but also skills, and attitudes are crucial. \n\nPhysics, chemistry, and biology teachers will form a professional learning community to design SSI lessons for ESD in this project. The qualitative data will be collected from teachers and teacher educators to capture teachers\u2019 pedagogical content knowledge of teaching SSI for SDG in science lessons, to characterise teachers\u2019 skills and attitudes for teaching SSI for SDG science lessons, to describe teachers\u2019 views on the use of SSI for teaching SDG, the challenges and tensions in teaching SDG through SSI, to explore the development of science teacher candidates\u2019 competencies to teach SDG through implementing SSI in science lessons. \n\nThe outputs of this research will contribute to the knowledge development about teacher competencies for teaching SDG in secondary school science lessons.",

In this project the two departments, AP and ME, collaborate to create a joint challenge-based course. Although the department of EE was also involved in the proposal, they stepped out of the project. Hence, the project plan has been revised; however, the content and the purpose of the project plan (as of January 2019) have not changed. \nThe present project proposal is an accompanying research linked to CBL - Systems and Control project. This accompanying study focuses on multidisciplinary aspect of the course. This is a key point in the set-up of the project that requires in depth development, and it is of fundamental value for the development of CBL at TU/e. The aim of the project is to investigate whether the multidisciplinary aspect of the course can, indeed, improve what students learn.",

            "description": "In the last three decades, the emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) continued to increase as a potential solution to overturn declining numbers of students choosing careers in STEM disciplines. \nDeparting from this need, teacher education programs will share thinking about how to leverage design to improve the coherence and relevance of instruction In this project. The biggest difference of this project is to change the emphasis on completing the design products to creating a learning environment around design products. Previous studies focused primarily on completing design products. This project aims to change the emphasis on the teaching environment created around the design products. By looking at its nature, the project is the first of its kind about design-based pedagogy. The project will offer guidelines for teacher education programs and teachers by presenting activities supporting interdisciplinary thinking and offering assessment items to measure design-based pedagogy. The project will start with creating the Booklet of Design-Based Pedagogy. Then the Project will shift to Practical Applications of Design Based Pedagogy and Online Learning through eTwinning projects. When creating the Booklet on Design-Based Pedagogy, the main goal will be to offer a common framework and set of activities to implement design-based pedagogy. The partners collaboratively create the booklet that will include three steps: (1) Reviewing Design Challenges and Design Products across European teacher education programs, (2) Supporting\nScientific and Engineering Practices with Critical Thinking, (3) Assessing Design Based Pedagogy. Reviewing design challenges and design products across European teacher education programs will help to picture the existing practices across European teacher education programs. In the next step, activities that support critical thinking when engaging with scientific and engineering practices will be created.",

In SSI lessons, students acquire certain skills (e.g., reasoning, argumentation, decision-making) to become responsible citizens. However, from the practical experiences of teachers, it appears that in SSI lessons, the 'evaluation' of what has been learned is usually ignored, or only focused on knowledge. Science teachers experience reluctance in making the development of SSI skills visible. In this project, teachers in a PLC develop formative assessment tools and strategies for their SSI lessons. We investigate whether this will enable teachers to develop more competence for formative assessment and thus gain a better insight into the development of SSI skills.",

In SSI lessons, students acquire certain skills (e.g., reasoning, argumentation, and decision-making) to become responsible citizens. However, from the practical experiences of teachers, it appears that in SSI lessons, the 'evaluation' of what has been learned is usually ignored, or only focused on knowledge. Science teachers experience reluctance in making the development of SSI skills visible. In this project, teachers in a PLC develop formative assessment tools and strategies for their SSI lessons. We investigate whether this will enable teachers to develop more competence for formative assessment and thus gain a better insight into the development of SSI skills.",
