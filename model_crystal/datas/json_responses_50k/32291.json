We hypothesized that increasing the history awareness of an object, by making the history of an object salient, would add essence to a mass-produced and disposable object. The increased essence will lead to less wasteful behavior, or when people are given the choice, will lead them to choose less wasteful alternatives. For example, choose a more sustainable ceramic bowl over a disposable paper bowl. In the present research, we conducted three studies with the goal to empirically investigate the concept of essence. Study 1 provided initial support that usage of a timeline is a successful method to increase the salience of an objects history, and consequently increase its historic essence. Study 3 replicated this finding and further demonstrated that people presented with the timeline assigned the same amount of essence to the paper bowl as to the ceramic bowl. In addition, the timeline manipulation made people more aware of the wastefulness of the paper bowl, especially for people who were not concerned about the environment. Interestingly, the timeline increased the awareness of the paper bowl but had no such effect on the ceramic bowl. This implies that the timeline per se does not matter, it only matters for the paper bowl. It can be assumed that mass-produced and disposable objects lack this awareness, and that the timeline was effective in making people more aware that the paper bowl has a history. Our study revealed preliminary results, demonstrating that essence can be manipulated by history awareness. Our findings show that it is possible, with small means, to change the way we perceive objects. This opens up new applications where the concept of essence can be used.\n",

Information campaigns attempt to raise knowledge and awareness of the problem, but are unsuccessful in reaching behavioral change. Furthermore, it is known that environmental cues can influence behavior, and that implicit information in the environment activates behavior. Recent research showed that shiny activates the concept of clean. More specifically, there exists a cognitive link between visual aspects of clean, namely shininess and cleanliness. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a shiny environment on cleaning behavior. Specifically, we wanted to test the behavioral effect of the cognitive link between visual shininess and behavior. We expected that a shiny environment would activate more cleaning behavior than a dull environment. In addition a process measure was designed to check for concept activation. The results demonstrated that there exists a behavioral effect between visual shininess and behavior. The shiny tabletop manipulation had a significant effect on cleaning behavior. Participants showed more overall cleaning behaviors in the shiny environment than in the dull environment. Additionally, completing the process task on a shiny tabletop activated more clean-related words than in the control condition. \n \n\n\n \n\n",

In this project we attempted to answer the question whether a naturalness bias exist in the context of lighting, and whether people\u2019s sense of personal connection to nature and their beliefs towards different types of lighting affect its occurrence. Four studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness of two paradigms of measuring a naturalness bias in the context of lighting. Results indicate that the two presented paradigms did not reliably measure a naturalness bias in the context of lighting. People\u2019s connectedness to nature and beliefs towards different light kinds were reliably and validly measured, providing future research with a good frame of reference for evaluating the effectiveness of other paradigms of measuring a naturalness bias in the context of lighting.\n\n",

Several user research methods where used as a basis of our research including interviews, brainstorm sessions, storyboards, focus groups, and concept validation. In the end we defined requirements to which extensions to the existing DirectLife web service should adhere. Our results show that adding several extensions to the DirectLife web service that increase social interaction can enhance both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.",
