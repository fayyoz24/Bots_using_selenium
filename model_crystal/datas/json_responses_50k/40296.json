    "summary": "I am currently in my first year of the Research Master's program in Media, Art, and Performance Studies at Utrecht University, where my focus lies on the evolving dynamics within the realms of media, art, and performance, the concepts of play, performativity and participation, intermediate and transmedial practices, spectatorship and usership, data-driven research, and the interplay between technology, embodiment, and perception.\n\nWith a recent Honours Bachelor's degree in Media and Culture, I've honed my expertise in Participatory Cultures, participated in the Humanities Honours Programme, and completed an internship at the renowned Dutch music festival Le Guess Who?. My knowledge spans various fields, including civic imagination and social engagement, participatory citizenship, artistic, political, and digital activism, fan cultures, spectatorship in theatre and performance, visual and sensory cultures, social media marketing, content creation, digital ethnography, and audience research.\n\nBeyond my academic pursuits, I am an avid guitarist and singer, a poetry enthusiast, a writer and dancer by heart, and a vice editor-in-chief of the academic student-made journal for audiovisual culture BLIK.",
