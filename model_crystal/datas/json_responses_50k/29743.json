    "summary": "Having completed my BSc in physical geography at the University of Edinburgh, I have chosen to continue my studies with the MSc Forest and Nature Conservation at Wageningen University & Research. My key interest being rewilding, this master's programme felt like a logical progression, as I hope to continue exploring different management strategies for nature areas that extensively consider both social and environmental benefits. \n\nDespite being from the Netherlands, I lived abroad for most of my life. I have lived in Singapore, Dubai, Malaysia, Scotland, and am currently in the Netherlands for my master's in Forest and Nature Conservation. Growing up in so many different places has granted me a unique international perspective and means I easily adapt to new situations.",

My job involved using SAP to fill out orders for their UK-based clients at Norfolk Leisure, meaning I often liaised with the Norfolk Leisure team to ensure the correct outdoor furniture was being ordered. Part of this involved calculating the number of furniture sets that could fit into 40'HC, 40'FT and 20'FT containers, it being essential that the space in these containers was maximised due to the sky-rocketing costs of shipping. Alongside this I helped the team with various other tasks, such as organising spreadsheets to include the correct specifications of the furniture sets for future catalogues and order sheets, organising their shipping dates calendar to ensure containers were shipped on time from various factories, and so on.\n \nThis job meant I had to quickly learn how to use a new application, SAP, and allowed me to develop my communication and team-work skills, it being very important that the order forms were filled out correctly for the clients. This was a rewarding job that familiarised me with the demands of a 9-5 job, as well as providing insight to how an efficient and organised team works.",
