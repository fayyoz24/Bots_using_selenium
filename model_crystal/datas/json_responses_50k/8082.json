    "summary": "Ever since high school, I have been fascinated by businesses and organizations and the underlying motives and operations. This interest soon developed into one with an international focus, eventually leading to studying and working abroad as an intern during my Bachelor of Business Administration at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.\n\nIn my third year, I applied for an internship at Evert Tennis Academy in Florida, USA. In those 6 months I was mainly responsible for a wide variety of tasks in Marketing & Business Development, as well as Customer Management. I was undeniably pleased to be active in such a dynamic and culture-rich environment, where I learned to adjust to a completely different work setting. I completed the internship with an 8.8/10.\n\nFollowing that, I enrolled in a Minor studies at Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de Marketing (IPAM) in Porto, Portugal. In the course of this semester, I gained endless insights in the future (business) generation, specifically in the way they think, plan and act.\n\nI recently graduated for my BBA, in which I specialized in International Business Consultancy. In the final semester I succesfully defended my thesis with an 8.6/10.",
