The information which is received and recorded as\nunder Section 154 of the Code is usually known and referred to as the First Information Report.\n\nAs will be analyzed in the paper, the evidentiary value of the First Information Report is far\ngreater than any other statement as recorded by the police officer \u2013 in \u2013 charge of the concerned\nPolice Station during the course of the investigation procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled\nthat, since the expression \u201cinformation\u201d is not qualified as credible or reasonable, in such a\nsituation the police officer \u2013 in \u2013 charge of the Police Station is duty bound to register the\ninformation as provided under Section 154 of the Code .",
