They will do so in multi-disciplinary teams of 5 students. During the course students will practice both personal as well as professional skills. They combine making an impact in society with reflections on their personal development and goals for the future.\n\nI am very excited about this combination of skill training and reflection because I believe it will give the students valuable practical experience as well as confidence about their own capacities and goals.",

The trajectory consists of a wide range of activities that are available to students throughout their studies. Academic and research skills are trained within the curriculum. Other relevant skills can be trained through participation in co curricular and extra curricular events. Students not only train skills, they are also encouraged to reflect on their choices and made aware of their added value as cultural anthropologists on the job market. \n\nI drew attention to internship opportunities and monitored internship projects. I maintained and built a network of organizations and alumni. Within the trajectory I collaborated with the Career Services in the faculty and the University. \n\nThe main goal is for students to know what they want and to give them the confidence and competence to successfully take the step to the job market. \n\nThe trajectory was marked as a best practice within the University.",
