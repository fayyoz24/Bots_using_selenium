    "summary": "I am a Mechanical Engineer with Master Degree in Automotive Technology and a specialization in Automotive power trains. I have a strong theoretical knowledge on the design and development of advanced future power train components and its control.\n\nWords that describe me best are: self-motivated, efficient, and very organized. In my experience it is nice to work in teams and I fare well in team situations. Depending on the team and assignment, I contribute as an effective team player as well as a team leader and drawing as many positives as I can from the experience.\n\nWithin projects I want to put my knowledge to use in the field of control system design and development with focus on modeling and simulation. Within these areas I have experience in the automotive sector and advanced power train components specifically but am not limited to these subjects.",

            "description": "In this project, it is aimed to model the vehicle dynamics of a F1 car which has a kinetic energy recovery system starting from standstill position and driven on a straight road without any lateral dynamics. After the implementation of the vehicle dynamics to a model, it is desired to investigate different parameters which are predicted to have an effect on the launch of the vehicle with sensitivity analysis to reach the best overall setting of the F1 car for the best launch.\nThe basic principles of launch control and different types of kinetic energy recovery systems are investigated. The most suitable KERS type is selected for F1 applications. The interactions amongst engine, drivetrain and wheels are clearly defined with some equations which will be given in the model description and all these equations are implemented to a Matlab/Simulink model.\nWithin the sensitivity analysis part, certain simulations are performed to tune vehicle parameters to reach the best start up from a start position. The results are evaluated in terms of launch control with discussion of the best strategy to apply KERS and the best overall parameters are determined to get the best acceleration performance.\nThe objectives and my contributions towards this project are the following\n\n\u2022\tUnderstood the basic principles of launch control and KERS\n\u2022\tAnd Interaction amongst engine, drivetrain and wheels\n\u2022\tDecision was made on the appropriate KERS type\n\u2022\tDeveloped a Matlab/Simulink model for system design and analysis\n\u2022\tPerformed a sensitivity analysis for the impact on acceleration performance.\n",

One of the important factors that affect the efficiency is the losses in the CVT.\nThe losses mainly occur in the hydraulic actuation and variator. In order to achieve a significant amount of fuel consumption a good control strategy is required to optimize the losses and control the variator with great precision. In order to avoid slip in the variator and to improve fuel efficiency a Slip Control Algorithm was proposed in Bosch Transmission Technology. The Control Algorithm will operate the variator at an efficient point. The Control Algorithm was tested in a test rig and measurements were obtained. Further, the algorithm was installed in a passenger car vehicle and measured. However, the slip control algorithm was not robust in both platforms.\nThe main goal of this internship is to investigate the reason why the slip controller is not robust and an analysis had to be done on the measurements and the control algorithm.\nThe main objectives and my contributions are the following\n\n\u2022\tTo conduct a literature study of the slip control.\n\u2022\tTo understand the slip control algorithm developed by Bosch Transmission Technology\n\u2022\tUnderstood the method of implementation method (i.e Test rig , Vehicle)\n\u2022\tProposed an approach for analysis of the measurements in different platform\n\u2022\tAnalyzed the test rig measurements in MATLAB/SIMULINK\n\u2022\tAuthored and presented a detailed technical report",
