Prior to the UvA, I was the holder of the UNIDROIT - Bank of Italy Chair at the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). I was also a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in Banking and Financial Law at the Faculty of Law, Economics and Finance of the University of Luxembourg. I held postdoctoral and visiting researcher positions at Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich, Columbia University in the City of New York, and EUROPAINSTITUT in Basel, where I worked on banking structural reforms, money view of banking, and regulation of hedge funds, respectively. I hold a Ph.D. from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, an LL.M. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, an LL.M. in Public Law, and an LL.B. both from Shahid Beheshti University School of Law.\n\nMy professional and academic interests include Law & Finance, Regulation of Financial Markets and Institutions, European and International Financial Regulation, Law & Technology, Company and Contract Law. My research focuses on monetary and banking law, shadow banking, financial market infrastructures, banking structural reforms, financial contracting, alternative investment funds, and legal issues of fintech, payments, blockchain, and crypto-assets. I am the author of several (award-winning) articles published in internationally renowned peer-reviewed law journals. I teach European Banking Law, Financial Contracting (derivatives, repo/securities lending, securitization), International Business Transactions, Law & Economics, Fintech Law, and Cryptoassets: Law and Policy.",
