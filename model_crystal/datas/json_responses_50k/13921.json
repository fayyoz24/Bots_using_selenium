Since January 2011 management promoted me and made me responsible for all commercial, marketing and acquisition tasks within the organisation. Key tasks have been optimising communication structures and process management aswell as optimising the results on both trading and operations. Klaas de Boer runs a total position of approx 40 to 60 KT per month, combining gasoil, fuels, international trading and hedging instruments.\n\nOliehandel Klaas de Boer is a physical supplier mainly active in the Amsterdam and Rotterdam markets.

My knowledge and skills about oil, shipping, local markets, local suppliers, international trading and economics have been further developed over the years and have resulted in a full time job as trader per 2006. \nFrom 2006 till 2009 I have been working all national and international enquiries as a (back to back) trader. Also acquisition, claims handling etc have been part of my daily routine.\nWithin Bebeka I have gained experience in building an ICT / CRM platform to register, monitor and analyse customer and suppliers behaviour, transactions and back office progress. This project was an internship for Communication, Management and PR. This platform was build and implemented together with management and third parties. The CRM platform is the backbone of Bebeka UA sales and administration processes and a database concerning customer and suppliers relevant data. \nBebeka UA is a cooperative working for and on behalf of ship owners. These owners are a member of the cooperative and thus have a great influence in the organisation and the course of the organisation.
