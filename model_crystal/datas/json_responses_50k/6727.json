For almost two months the website was 'in style' and reported the latest fashion news. \n\nTogether with a few interns I wrote the fashion articles: news flashes, fashion show reports, celebrity news, interviews, style inspiration, street style photography, tips&tricks. \n\nDuring the fashion week I also hosted four short films where I did interviews with Dutch celebrities, models and designers, went backstage to cover 'A day in the shoes of a designer' and spotted styles and trends on and next to the catwalk.",
