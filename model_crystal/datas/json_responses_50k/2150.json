    "summary": "My grandmother told stories, my father is a story teller, I love telling stories. The greatest among the greatest, heroes like Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King, were story tellers. \nMy stories are tales about a rapidly changing world, a world that makes many anxious and angry. But in which, surprisingly, a lot remains the same. Stories about the tremendous progress we experience and the problems we resolve. \nI write my stories as a journalist, I publish them in books and I convey them in person during lectures and presentations.I describe myself as a Curious Cosmopolitan. 'Curious', as I am very inquisitive to broad global developments. 'Cosmopolitan', because I believe that people around the world bear responsibility for one another. \n'Be the change that you wish to see in the world', Ghandi told us. Martin Luther King added: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'.",

Moreover, I had spoken columns and commentaries on the public radio. \nAlthough I have been a journalist for nearly thirty years, I currently feel that I am shifting away from mainstream journalism. When I started, I was mainly concerned with the publication itself. Did I correctly quote the people that I had interviewed? Did I apply the adversarial principle? Was my language accurate? \nRight now I am more and more concerned about the impact of my work on society. How do we, journalists, influence people and what is our responsibility?",
