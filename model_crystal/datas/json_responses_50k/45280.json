The XY-stage utilizes four sets\nof unidirectional combs as electrostatic actuators. The design is inspired by the raster scan image\nreconstruction algorithm used in display technologies. The fabricated MEMS device incorporates a suspended micro-mirror, actuation beams, combs, and foldedflexure spring structures to enable precise positioning in two perpendicular directions. The report details the materials and methods employed, including the initial design, analytical modeling, micro-fabrication steps, and mounting and wire-bonding processes. Optical microscopy and white light interferometry techniques were employed to evaluate the fabricated samples. The results highlight the observed structures, contamination issues, and stiction challenges. Further investigations are necessary to address stiction issues and optimize device performance.",

The pulser circuit is divided into two main sections, namely digital and analogue circuits, to achieve precise control and high-performance output. The half-bridge pulser is designed to generate pulsed waves with a voltage range of up to 60V and a frequency span from 1 kHz to 10 MHz, catering to various applications. The system consists of two separate PCBs - the pulser circuit and a motherboard. The mother board facilitates the centralized control of five different channels, providing versatility for multi-channel PMUT array operation.",
