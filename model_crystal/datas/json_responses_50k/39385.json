    "summary": "You can write about your years of experience, industry, or skills. People also talk about their achievements or previous job experiences.\nWho am I? Born in a small town in the North of Italy, it was soon clear that my ambitions were bigger than anything my small town, or even my country could offer me. Therefore I decided to study languages and cultures, ready to expand my horizons and very much wanting to learn more, to make an impact. My ambitions led me to move to the Netherlands as soon as I was 18. Here I started with a bachelor's and, consequently a master's in Amsterdam. Studying gives me energy; I love learning while critically engaging with the material. After spending a semester in Chile in 2019, during the social uprising, I was surer than ever that I wanted to dedicate myself to helping others. I worked a year at the Netherlands Red Cross, working with people who needed food aid, and later with refugees from Ukraine. In those circumstances I realized I missed the analytical perspective, I missed the research process and being able to make an informed decision. I wanted to be able to defend these people on an international level, I wanted to defend Human RIghts in general. This is why I applied to EMA, the European Master in Human Rights and Democratization. I have never been one of these people that feel the need to move to a different country every year, I am proud of my roots and my background. But I am willing to do what it takes to make an impact, to have a meaningful job that gives me purpose. This is me, someone, who came from nothing and suddenly decided that wanted to be more. I had to work hard both academically and financially to arrive where I am... But the best is yet to come! Curious what it will be? Me too!",
