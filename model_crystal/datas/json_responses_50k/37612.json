We drove through eastern Europe, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Iran and Turkmenistan and reached Almaty, Kazakhstan by the end of October. Our winter of 2017/2018 was well spend in Central Asia and by February we went back to our car in the winter wonderland of Almaty. From here we drove further through Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and followed the famous and feared Pamir Highway to reach Kyrgyzstan. In Kyrgyzstan we exchanged our trustable Suzuki for an old Russian Sovjet van, an UAZ Bukhanka and with that vehicle we managed to drive all the way back to The Netherlands. It's impossible to describe feelings, adventures and specially lessons learned in a few words, but it was definitely an unforgettable and once in a lifetime experience.",
