    "summary": "My name is Thebe Van Rensbergen and I recently obtained my master in Global Challenges for Sustainability. This master is offered by CHARM-EU a European University alliance, co-funded by the Erasmus + Programme, between the University of Barcelona, Trinity College Dublin, Utrecht University, the University of Montpellier and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University Budapest.\n\nIn september 2021, I started my first semester in Utrecht, I completed my second semester in Budapest and finished my Capstone phase in Montpellier, executing a project for the Safe Seaweed Coalition.\n\nDuring this challenge-driven master program I obtained, improved and practised several skills:\n\n- I have experience in sustainable communication thanks to the Capstone project, communication the seaweed revolution, taking a deep dive into communication assessment and writing a communication strategy. \n\n- I have research experience thanks to the research based projects this master consisted of.\n\n- In the second semester I specialised in Life and Health. This is where I practised writing intervention plans and policy briefs surrounding the topics of mental health amongst students, transgender healthcare and healthy ageing. \n\n- I am knowledgeable about seaweed\u2019s potential to contribute to the SDG\u2019s thanks to my Capstone project. I have quite a lot of background knowledge on Seaweed and I can link its potential to several SDG's.\n\n- I am able to apply design thinking when approaching a problem and going through each step from empathising to prototyping to offer a solution to a problem \n\n- I am able to apply systems thinking to understand the extend and effect of certain issues. The extent to which people or the planet are affected by one single problem is hard to perceive. Design thinking helps us to map these issues and avoid negative spill-over effects. \n\nOverall, I have gained many skills, approaches, experiences and knowledge about a wide set of topics. This only shows how sustainability has endless applications which I will continue to learn about and practice with in future endeavors.\n\nPrior to this master I completed a bachelor in business administration in which: \n\n- I completed an internship in Hamburg to gain insight and experience in a start-up company, a year later I finished an exchange in Bordeaux to improve my adaptability and flexibility within Europe and advance my French language skills. \n\n- Before graduating, I worked at Social Enterprise NL as a communication intern where I wrote my thesis regarding content strategies.",
