    "summary": "Tiago is a Bachelor in Biotechnology (University of Bras\u00edlia, Brazil) and a Master of Science in Molecular Medicine and Innovative Treatment (University of Groningen, the Netherlands). Currently doing his PhD at the Molecular Neurobiology section of the Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems (University Medical Center Groningen, UMCG, the Netherlands). He is part of the PhD Student Councils from the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience research school (BCN) and the Graduate School of Medical Sciences (GSMS). He has experience and interest in cellular and molecular neurobiology, with emphasis on epigenetics and neuroimmunology (microglia and macrophages). He is also interested in science communication, a passion he materializes as one of the writing editors of the SciFact Blog.\n\nCurrently, he investigates microglia biology with focus on epigenetics and immune memory during neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and demyelination (in the context of multiple sclerosis). During his master\u2019s, he developed a first research project on microglia biology (VISTA receptor) at the Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology at the UMCG in the Netherlands. His second master\u2019s research project focused on microglia and monocytes in multiple sclerosis treatment (cladribine) at the Multiple Sclerosis Division, Neuroimmunology and Remyelination Laboratory at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health (University of Melbourne) in Australia. During his bachelor\u2019s, he participated in several projects on inflammation related to infections, obesity, and cancer at the Laboratory of Immunology and Inflammation, Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, at the University of Bras\u00edlia in Brazil.\n\nHe was an Orange Tulip Scholarship student during his master\u2019s and received grants from the GSMS/UMCG, Holland Scholarship, Groningen Univesity Fund, Marco Polo, and De Cock-Hadders Stitching. He was a fellow undergraduate researcher at the University of Brasilia by the Institutional program for scientific initiation scholarships (PIBIC) from the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) and also received a scholarship from the Young Talents for Science (Jovens Talentos para Ci\u00eancia) undergraduate research program from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES).",
