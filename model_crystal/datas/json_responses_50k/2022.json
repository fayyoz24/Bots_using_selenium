    "summary": "I am an environmental engineer with experties in waste management and water treatment engineering. \n\nAfter my bachelor study, I had some experiences on environmental management and sustainable development project for multiple state-owned companies in Indonesia. When pursuing my master\u2019s, I also had the chance to work with one of the leading solid waste management companies in the Netherlands as an Intern. \n\nDuring my master\u2019s thesis, I dedicated my research to test a newly developed method to detect nanoplastic in water. This topic has broadened my research interest not only in waste management but also in water treatment technology. Now I\u2019m doing a PhD focusing on removal of nanoplastic in drinking water via sand filtration",
