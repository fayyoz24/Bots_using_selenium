To raise awareness on this particular issue, School of Liberal Arts, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi organised a speech contest under the topic \"ASEAN As You Wish\". The objective is to encourage and offer new-generation ASEANers an opportunity to express their thoughts on what they wish for their one-world community.\n\nThis is the second English speech contest that Peerawat joined during his college study. He would like to express his gratitude to Asst. Prof. Thanis Bunsom, Lect. Kunthida Rungruengkiat, Asst. Prof. Dr. Pattamawan Jimarkon Zilli and Lect. Penpitcha Prakaiborisuth for supervision.",
