I have also used my software engineering skills to improve the structure and usability of the code. \n\nSome highlights of my work on this project are:\n - Perform optimizations and parallelise the algorithm. This led to a 550% decrease in computation times for large datasets on a personal computer while maintaining the same amount of memory usage and the same levels of accuracy.\n - Refactor the entire project and improve usability by creating bindings that allow the algorithm to be installed as a Python module and used with Numpy arrays, which allows for easy integration with existing data-processing pipelines.",
