Using the money we fundraised, we were able to buy material and equipment to build shelter for the teachers at the local school. We also donated goats and built goat sheds for the families who needed it the most. This was a lot of manual labor and we learnt how to mix concrete and stack bricks together perfectly to make an oven for the families to use."
