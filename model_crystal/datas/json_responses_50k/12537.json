    "summary": "Prior entering the realm of creativity, I spent a year trying out various jobs (law officer, teacher, tour guide, photographer) to find the right path in life. Eventually I set out a direction to creativity which I thought a strong power to free and fulfill the meaning and purpose of lives.. I received my master degree in Cognitive Psychology from Southwest University (Chongqing, China), where I investigated the neural correlates of analogical transfer in creative problem solving with neuroimaging technique. Thereafter, I applied successfully a Chinese government scholarship, and in 2016, I moved to the Netherlands to continue my PhD research at Radboud University. Given her neuroscience knowledge and the practical importance of creativity, during PhD, I turned her research interest to foster creativity through education and training. In my research, I developed several short and long-term training programs to foster creativity among children, students, and adults in various settings including the classroom, lab, and online. These training programs have been scientifically proved effective and published in reputed journals in my field. Through my research, I've developed my research skills in conducting both behavioral and neuroimaging data, and collecting qualitative and quantitative data, which are primarily analyzed using SPSS and R. Besides research, I have supervised both Bachelor and master students in conducting interventional and virtual reality studies as well as writing theses. Outside the lab, I enjoy film, reading, sewing, walking, caring plants, and attempting to develop both my mental (writing poems, programming with Python) and physical skills (swimming, volleyball, pole dancing).",
