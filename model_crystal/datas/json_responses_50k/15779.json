In the final part  conclusions were drawn from the framework and made recommendations on feasible actions shipbuilder could take to improve its position.\n",

A firm\u2019s ability to jointly pursue both exploitative and explorative \ninnovation has been conceived as having positive performance effects, and the mediation \neffect of innovation ambidexterity between structural, contextual, and leadership \ncharacteristics on a firm\u2019s performance (Chang & Hughes, 2012). Ambidexterity relates to \nattainting balance between incremental innovations (i.e., represents relatively minor \nadaptations of existing products and business concepts) and radical innovations (i.e., \nfundamental changes leading to a switch from existing products or concepts to completely \nnew ones).\n\n In (Raisch & Birkinshaw, 2008), three dimensions in an organization__ organizational \nstructure, behavioral contexts, and leadership processes__ are described as promoters of \nambidexterity. Structural antecedents focus on developing a structural mechanism to cope \nwith competing demands in a firm to balance exploitive and explorative innovation. The \npresence of organic or mechanistic enables a firm to alternate between these two \nrequirements.\n\n Also, contextual relates to shaping a set of systems and processes that define a context that \nallows exploration and exploitation to take place and hence individuals can be directed to \ninnovate ambidextrously. In addition, leadership antecedent emphasizes on role of top \nmanagers in engendering ambidextrous behavior, by using exploitation of existing practices \nand exploring within and pressing towards new frontiers. (Chang & Hughes, 2012)\n\nIn this paper, we investigate Innovation ambidexterity and Innovation Management within \nDSM.",

It has been three years since Square entered as a leader in the Mobile payment market, which now has grown big and has a lot of players. An analysis of the competitors and cost comparisons pointed out that the main competitor is GoPayment but Square has a favorable payment system.\n\nAdaption of Square according to the latest technology and demands of the market is the next step in the analysis. The Square already crossed the \u2018Chasm\u2019 and a strategy and selection of the market segments proved that the three main sections to target are the \u201cthe average sales volume and higher sales volumes businesses\u201d, \u201cbusinesses with fluctuations in their volume of sale amount\u201d and \u201cmerchants which rely on good customer services\u201d.\n\nTo gain access to these market segments, possible market research methods are proposed to be employed by Square Inc. for promoting different versions of Square. For risk assessment and propositions on which field to improve the company a SWOT analysis and a multi-attribute model have been included.\n\nOverall Grade : 7.5/10",
