    "summary": "I\u2019m a human being that is authentic and coherent with who I am, what I do, and how I do it. \n\nEmpathy is my superpower. \n\nI am a mother, an activist, and a doer with a humanitarian heart. \n\nI\u2019m a curious person who is always interested in understanding and learning new things. I see the big picture through the multitude of its details and love connecting the dots. \n\nI\u2019m a good discussion partner, being critical and constructive at the same time. I believe in inclusion and co-creation as the best tool for innovation. \n\nI love solving problems, looking at them from a different perspective, and \u201cplaying\u201d with my analytical and conceptual skills. At the same time, I\u2019m getting the things done and done properly, quality being a constant focus in whatever I do. \n\nI\u00b4m not afraid of making mistakes while experimenting and prototyping, always focusing on learning and moving forward. When I participate in a meaningful project, I give all my energy and passion to it. \n\n14 intense years in the humanitarian field had a clear influence on who I am and how I work. During the last years, I took a break to enjoy motherhood, studying, and using my know-how to advise others through consultancy. \n\nNow I feel the need to come back to direct actions, joining an organization with meaningful activities and a direct, positive impact on people\u2019s life.",
