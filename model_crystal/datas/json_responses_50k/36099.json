    "summary": "Hello, Hallo, Bonjour, Hola ! \nWelcome and pleased to meet you. I am Fernando, a passionate and experienced professional in the hotel and tourism industry. \n\nI am currently working as a Reception Supervisor at the Meininger Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, which is part of the Meininger Hotel Group, and has 186 rooms for 806 Beds. I am responsible for supervising front desk team members and ensuring standard operating procedures, as well as all front-desk duties such as check-in and out guests, managing reservation via SIHOT software system, computing billing, taking payments and dealing with all related queries from guests. \n\nI have over 10 years of experience in the hotel  and tourism industry  and a degree in Tourism Management. I have previously worked in hotels in Chile (Santiago de Chile) and in France (Paris). I also have considerable experience as a Travel Agent and Sales Representative, having worked for two years in national and international travel & tours agencies. Through these experiences I developed strong communication skills, leadership, the ability to think on my feet and first and foremost: a great passion for the tourism and hospitality industry. \n\nI hold an Advanced Bachelor (5 years degree) in Tourism Management from the Metropolitan University of Technology in Santiago de Chile, which gave me solid and practical skills in administration, strategy in hospitality markets, accounting, strategic management and budgeting. \n\nBeing originally from Chile in South America I am a native speaker of Spanish, and having also lived 3 years in Paris I am proficient in French. I also speak English and I have lived for a few months at a time in Vermont,  USA and Sheffield, England where I worked and volunteered. I enjoy speaking foreign languages: I am also teaching myself Portuguese and I would love to learn Dutch now that I live here in The Netherlands!\n\nI am a dedicated, hard-working person with an attention for details and solid customer-focused interpersonal skills. I enjoy providing excellent service, solve problems and work effectively with my team. Want to know more about me ? Let\u2019s connect and chat!",
