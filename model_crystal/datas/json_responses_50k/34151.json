Local sleep refers to sleep-like activity that occurs in the brain during wakefulness due to sleep deprivation or task-specific brain overload. We recruited 42 partially sleep-deprived healthy participants who performed two frontally demanding cognitive tasks to induce attentional lapses. Participants were randomly assigned to the control (SHAM) or experimental (CLAS) condition. After the tasks, participants took a one-hour nap, during which we boosted frontal slow oscillations using closed-loop auditory stimulation in the CLAS condition.\n\nWe measured local sleep intrusions using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed subjective attentional states (mind-wandering, mind-blanking, task-focused), performance errors, and reports of lapses of attention. We found that both groups showed a reduction in local sleep intrusions, performance errors, and reports of lapses of attention after the nap, and there was no significant difference between the groups. Therefore, we concluded that the CLAS intervention could not provide more effect on top of a regular nap in reducing local sleep intrusions and their subjective and objective consequences.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate what happens when teenagers are encouraged to take unknown risks to help their best friends. To achieve this, we used an adapted version of the well-known Balloon Analogue Risk Task. Our goal was to examine whether risk-taking could have an adaptive and positive side, namely, helping others. Through a within-subject design, we manipulated the conditions to link adolescents' prosocial behavior to a monetary risk to themselves. However, contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found that adolescents preferred to be less prosocial when there was a risk to themselves as a result of helping their friends.",
