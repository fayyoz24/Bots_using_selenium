It is our desire to bring people in the presence of the Lord as this is the best place to grow. \n\nAlso we have two apartments where people can stay for a period of retreat, and we have different ministries to help people grow in their relationship with God and in their skills. For example we have a Songwriter community, a Kingdom Kids ministry and we both give training, we write (songs and I wrote books) and we speak. \n\nYou can find more information on our website www.peterencarinvanessen.nl and www.mannavoorelkedag.nl.",
