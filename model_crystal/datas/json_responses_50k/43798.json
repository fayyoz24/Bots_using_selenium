    "summary": "As an experimental plasma physicist my passion is fundamental research in the field of gas discharges as well as development of their technological applications. I am specially driven towards laboratory work and data analysis. I like taking control of all the aspects from the setup design, construction, operation and maintenance. I find specially rewarding, and also critical for success, to achieve a complete understanding of every element that forms an experiment, from the system under study to the equipment used to monitor and control it. Although I am an experimentalist I have a solid theoretical background on plasma and general physics and I am able to formulate equations to explain and understand the experimental data. \n\nI am self-motivated, pro-active and able to perform my research in an independent way. This being said, I rather work in a team in cooperation with other researchers. My education as a physicist allows me to work with people of different technical and scientific backgrounds. According to my experience cooperation and cross-field work is the key to quality research.\n\nBeyond fundamental research I have interests in technical and non-technical areas such as development, testing, management, business planning and demonstration among others. My ambition now is to work in an environment where I can use my technical skills, but more importantly where I can expand them and learn new ones out of the technical field\n",
