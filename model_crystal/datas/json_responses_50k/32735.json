Specifically, it targets the mashing step, a critical process where enzymes break down key components in barley grains to facilitate fermentation. Central to this is starch gelatinization, which requires substantial heat.\nThe study explores innovative approaches to lower this energy demand, with a spotlight on Pulsating Electric Field (PEF) treatment. PEF treatment disrupts starch crystalline structures, lowering gelatinization temperature, and consequently, energy requirements. By incorporating this technique, the report introduces a novel pre-treatment process. This involves creating a barley-water paste, treated with PEF, before entering the mashing stage. The result is enhanced gelatinization, leading to improved energy efficiency.\nA python model assessed the process's impact, considering factors like water content, heating fraction, and gelatinization time.  Implementation of this process is projected to yield impressive energy savings of 24.3% and electrify 9.5% of the mashing process.",

Our first event was the Valentine's Borrel, where we organized a fun gathering and were able to collect 127 euros for the Turkey Disaster Fund. This event was a great way to kick off our event planning journey, and it helped increase our visibility and name across the TU Delft campus.\n\nFor our next event, we decided to collaborate with X-TU Delft to organize a Pizza Baking Competition. We were thrilled to see the event being a sold-out success. This collaboration allowed us to expand our network and reach out to more individuals. Through this event, we were able to bring together the TU Delft community and create an environment that was both competitive and fun.\n\nOur final event was perhaps the most entertaining of all. We set up a gaming table in front of the TU Delft Library during the exam week. It was great to see students having fun with their friends while taking a break from studying. The event was a huge success, and we were able to create a positive impact on the students' well-being during the exam week. This experience motivated me to care more for my society, and I was able to make new friends and learn more about the inner workings of Delft while contributing to social causes that I care about deeply.\n\nOverall, organizing these events was an incredibly enriching experience for us as a team. We learned how to collaborate effectively, developed our event planning skills and had a fun time while contributing to social causes that we are passionate about. We hope to continue organizing events that make a positive impact on the TU Delft community and beyond."

Together as a team, we successfully coordinated various events such as discussions, games, and even a collaborative project named \"Message Missile\" with Breeze SNU, our annual cultural fest. This initiative allowed us to connect with a broader audience and propagate the message of environmental preservation.\nIn addition, we partnered with the SPAS NGO to expand our outreach and create a positive impact in rural areas. Furthermore, we lent our support to the Shiv Nadar Foundation's annual afforestation project, actively participating in tree planting and environmental restoration efforts, leaving a lasting imprint on the world around us."

One notable event was the Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program. Through this initiative, we aimed to raise awareness about the significance of preventing suicide and offered resources and assistance to those facing mental health difficulties. I also had the opportunity to help arrange a guided meditation session designed to help people relax, unwind, and find inner peace and calmness. Overall, my experience with the Blue Circle Mental Team at SNU was highly fulfilling and allowed me to contribute to important efforts to enhance mental health on campus."
