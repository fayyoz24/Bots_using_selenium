Businesses can seamlessly sync their accounting software to Skippr and gain real time insights into their cash flow and funding needs. \n\nSkippr is the game changer in working capital solutions. Many business owners struggle to understand their cash flow requirements. Part of the problem is their accounting solutions provide backward looking and accrual based information. Skippr solves this problem by providing forward looking cash flow data as well as actionable solutions.\n\nAs the third employee, alongside founders, I led an early-stage customer experience improvement project, focused on product education and customer onboarding. This included the building and implementation of a streamlined step-by-step customer onboarding process to reduce early customer churn.",
