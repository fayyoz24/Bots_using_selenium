The data consisted of a seven-year period from 2004 to 2011. Both long run\nand short run association between the variables where analyzed. The Johansen technique\nof integration was applied along with the Vector error correction model and Granger\ncausality test to analyze the relationship among the variables. The findings showed that\nthere is neither a long or short run relationship between the variables. In granger\ncausality however, casual relationships did exist, evidence shows that exchange rates\ncause stock prices in the cases of Hungary and Czech. There is also causality between\nstock prices themselves, as in the case of Czech Republic and Germany",
