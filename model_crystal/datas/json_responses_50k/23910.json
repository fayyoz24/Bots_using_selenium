Through warm ups and conditioning, participants will be eased into shape. This program is based on an Indonesian martial art called Poekoelan Tjimindie Tulen, which came to the United States in 1956. The art is termed a broken mirror style, because no two participants will look alike, and all are encouraged to form their own interpretation of the art. The form focuses on fluidity and grace, as well as efficiency in action. A common phrase participants hear is \u201cnothing you can do is wrong\u201d, because doing anything is better than nothing towards one\u2019s own defense. Ultimately, participants will develop confidence, compassion, and love for both self and other.",
