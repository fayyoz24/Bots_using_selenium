    "summary": "I am a dedicated professional looking to transition towards becoming a full-time data analyst. I am skilled in creating meaningful data visualizations, improving business processes, and training colleagues with a drive for continuous improvement. I have created multiple dashboards to support easier decision-making and efficiency improvements, for which I received a company award at Merck. I have gained extensive experience with technical software, including Excel, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP HANA. \n\nBesides my work I have followed since 2019 online courses with the objective to become an all-round data analyst. These courses include general data analytics (like ETL & standardizing). I am certified for SQL and keep practicing programming extensively with the help of an SQL coach. I am also certified for PowerBi, and have studied data extraction, transformation, modelling, analysis, visualization & sharing. Going forward I am planning to focus my study on Tableau as an interactive data visualization software and Python as a programming language. \n\nI am pro-active, with an eye for challenging and improving processes. I focus on quality above quantity in delivery, am organized and have a clear and direct communication style. I am patient and determined, and able to balance the need for rigorous processes with a sensibility for customer requirements. With sufficient space and agency, I can take initiative and create lean solutions.\n\nI enjoy working in an international environment, and always approach my work with dedication and commitment.",
