    "summary": "My research focuses on social development in adolescence. One of my main interests is the development of prosocial behavior (i.e., behavior that benefits others, such as giving, helping and sharing). During my PhD project I specifically focused on how the development of giving and its neural correlates in adolescence could be explained by benefactor-, beneficiary- and situational characteristics. I currently focus on the question whether different types of prosocial behaviors show unique or similar developmental patterns and associations with contextual factors. Other research interests include brain development, the wellbeing of adolescents, specifically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as connecting science and society through the YoungXperts platform. \n\nTo answer my research questions I use multiple levels of explanation (i.e., behavioural, neural) and employ a variety of techniques (e.g., MRI, experiments, surveys, youth panels). During my PhD I was involved in all stages (i.e., designing, data collection, analyses, writing) of a large, comprehensive longitudinal project on prosocial behavior in adolescence, called the \u2018Brainlinks Project\u2019. 142 participants and their parents participated in this study that uses multiple techniques (i.e., MRI, hormonal data, experimental tasks, questionnaires, parent reports) to examine the development of prosocial behavior in adolescence.",

Wij onderzoeken wat jongeren uniek maakt en hoe zij een rol vinden in de samenleving. \n\nUit ons onderzoek hebben wij veel kennis over jongeren, hoe zij opgroeien, en hoe dat werkt in het brein. Deze kennis willen wij voor jongeren op een begrijpelijke manier beschikbaar maken. Maar we hebben een n\u00f3g belangrijkere missie: ervoor zorgen dat er iets met die kennis gebeurt: dat mensen in actie komen, zodat jongeren er voordeel van hebben. Om dit te bereiken organiseren wij brainstorms met jongeren, de YoungXperts sessies. De brainstorms helpen ons om:\n- jongeren een stem te geven: hoe denken zij over belangrijke thema\u2019s?\n- ons onderzoek beter op jongeren aan te laten sluiten\n- samen met jongeren de beste manier vinden om in actie te komen op basis van beschikbare kennis",

Additional goals include testing the moderating role of social context, individual differences, and social experiences.\n\nThe study consists of three waves, taking place in three consecutive years (2018, 2019 and 2020) in which adolescents (aged 9-18 years in 2018) will be followed over time. A unique aspect of the Brainlinks study is that 76 parents (mothers and fathers) participated during the first wave, completing a task battery very similar to the adolescents. This gives us a unique chance to examine how parents\u2019 (prosocial) behavior and its neural correlates are related to that of their child. We are now also testing effects of prosocial interventions.\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 681632)\n\nMore info (in Dutch): https://juniorhersenen.nl/onderzoeken/brainlinks/",
