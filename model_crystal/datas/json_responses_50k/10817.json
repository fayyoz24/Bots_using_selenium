    "summary": "It's my mission in life to help others in achieving their next best thing. Professionally, I do this by (a) helping companies in finding talent, (b) helping talent find their next career step and (c) coach and guide women in becoming an improved and more concious version of themselves.\n \nBeing an interim recruiter allows me to help companies find their new talents. With a proven track record in the IT and (High-)Tech industry, I bring knowledge, experience and a large network to the table. This enables me to transform your company's technical vacancies to the best next life opportunity for new talent. I have experience in both corporate and agency recruitment, and have helped companies such as ASML, ING Belgium and BearingPoint Caribbean in finding new human resources. I do all of this with great enthusiasm, a critical eye and always a personal approach.\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating feel free to contact me via recruitment@ohinya.nl. \n\nIn my personal life, people have always approached me for my attentiveness, sharp-wittedness and good listening skills. This combined with the enjoyment I get out of helping others professionally, have brought me to coaching. I coach women in becoming a better version of themselves. With tools gained from NLP- and EMDR training, I challenge women in getting a deeper understanding of their motives and guide them towards making more conscious decisions. \n\nIf you are interested in a coaching session, you can reach me via coach@ohinya.nl.
