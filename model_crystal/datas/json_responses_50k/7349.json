AMIDEAST has been proud to have worked directly with more than 36,000 underserved youth across the MENA region through the Access Program, helping them acquire skills and new perspectives that open doors to future opportunities.\nAMIDEAST is currently serving approximately 5,000 youth in five MENA countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, and the West Bank/Gaza. Please check with our offices in these countries for more information.\nIn addition, AMIDEAST has offered programs similar to the Access Program in Iraq, the UAE, and Yemen with funding from U.S. embassies.",
