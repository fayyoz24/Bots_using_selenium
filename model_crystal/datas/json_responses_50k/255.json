He explores in his works hybrids of living and non-living systems creating novel approaches to investigate endangered and inhospitable ecosystems. Throughout his works he develops ways to enhance the communication between humans, other living organisms and the environment. He considers nature as inspiration and a necessary force and knowledge to shift the human-centered development of the technological world. \nIvan is the coordinator and founder of interdisciplinary research groups as Hybrid Forms Lab (hybridformslab.org) and is the creator and coordinator of the mobile residency program EME (Est\u00fadio M\u00f3vel Experimental -emedata.blogspot.com). His works are exhibited internationally, participating in festivals, residencies and talks. \nHenriques has been a crucial developer crossing the bridges of art/design/technology/science/engineering. He gives consultancies in interdisciplinary thinking and development as for example TU Delft, Dutch Design Week amongst others. Currently Henriques teaches Aesthetics of Interconnectedness online and also the intersections of art/design/science for students of the Autonomous Practice at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam.

He explores in his works hybrids of nature and (technological) culture creating new forms of communication between humans and other living organisms. He considers nature as inspiration and a necessary factor in the development of the technological world.\n\nHe researches in various aspects of real time environment data visualization, where it becomes a motive and motor for the platform that he creates within his works. In a deep look at this information he gets from the environment and other living organisms, Ivan creates interactive and participatory art installations. His visionary combination of robotics and living organisms explores the fluidity of subject positions in the post-digital world. The audience involvement is the core of his creation, approaching all the living species to have a unique experience envisioning a new possible world where we all are hypersensitive to our surroundings. The development of smell, touch and audiovisual installations explores such concepts [1] as: the future (reinvention) of the environment; the acceleration of techno-scientific mutations; when nature becomes culture; the use of natural resources; where these hybrids of nature and technology will take place in the near future and reshape and redefine our tools to be more coherent with the world we live in.\n\n[1]: these concepts were discussed in the e-book Oritur.",

A deep investigation and understanding of interactions of biotic and abiotic systems to be applied in the designs.  The developments of the bio-machines is an initiative to foster studies and applications focused on the convergence of human augmentation with the increasing intelligence and awareness of artifacts, leading towards a symbiosis of humans, machines, other living organisms and the environment. I have been active in the art-science scene for almost 10 years. Within my practice I reflect on the actual environmental situation, bringing out-of-the-box speculative designs. For a deep understanding of the inter-relations between the biotic and abiotic systems a multiple perspective of the environment lead to combine myself with professionals from other disciplines. The impulse to be an educator is to create this interdisciplinary platform and bridges for students to imagine and create new perspectives which are not yet envisioned, to re-think about our environment and our ways of production.\n\n\n\u2028",
