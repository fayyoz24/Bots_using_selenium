    "summary": "I am assistant professor of political communication at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR). My research focuses on the intersections between right-wing populism and disinformation, the impact of disinformation and deepfakes on democracy, and the effectiveness of corrective information to combat disinformation and uncivil speech. \n \nApplying qualitative and quantitative methods, I am driven by key questions and puzzles in our current digital information ecology: What are the effects of the digital manipulation of information, and which segments of society are most vulnerable to disinformation and uncivil speech? How can we use communication in a positive way to counter the negative ramifications of harmful content?  \n \nI teach various courses in the BA and (R)MA programs of communication sciences - which focus on quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection, and topics such as mis- and disinformation, populism, framing and media effects. \n \nNext to research and teaching, I am interested in making an impact by communicating about my research to professionals in education and policy, and consulting different stakeholders about media literacy in the digital age. My mission is to more comprehensively understand the challenges we face in our current fragmented information ecology threatened by post-factual relativism and the strategic attack on the common truth by disinformation actors.",

As marketing manager, my challenge is to promote Hameleers Car Polish on cross-media platforms using a limited budget, for example by designing a website and creating advertisements on marketplace websites. Keeping in mind that word-of-mouth marketing is the most efficient type of promotion in this branche, advertising is less important than customer satisfaction. Therefore, Hameleers Car Polish invests in high quality services and stimulates clients to share their experience with their social network.",
