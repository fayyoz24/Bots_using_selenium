    "summary": "I'm an integrative health practitioner operating within the functional medicine model, which integrates science and traditional Western medical practices (such as using laboratory tests and diagnostic methods) with complementary medicine.\n\nFunctional medicine aims to find the root cause of disease and is deeply science based. In my health practice All Ways Healthy, I work on both prevention and improvement of illness focusing on diagnostic (lab) testing, nutrition, therapeutic diets, supplements, exercise, botanicals, mind-body techniques and stress-management to foster healing. Functional medicine has a valuable role to play in treating chronic diseases or vague symptoms, such as gastrointestinal problems, chronic fatigue, stress-related disorders, autoimmune diseases, musculoskeletal problems, chronic infections (viral or bacterial) and more. \n\nI studied orthomolecular health, integrative health and digestive health at different institutions in both the Netherlands and abroad. I completed all programs cum laude. I'm specialised in gastrointestinal problems, the gut microbiome, and its relation to the brain and symptoms of the mind (the gut-brain axis). By doing comprehensive gut microbiome lab testing with my clients, it is possible to see where imbalances lie and - using a highly personalised approach - to help the body get back to balance. Aside from this, I'm interested in the mind-body connection and in using techniques derived from neuroscience and neuropsychoimmunology that help to alter the body\u2019s stress response.\n\nTo bridge my academic background (one bachelor and two masters) in external communications, research and writing with my passion in integrative health, I also work as a freelance writer and researcher for both health magazines and health-related companies.

I was invited to speak at the pre-conference 'Crisis Management and Communication,' and presented on the role of new media in crisis communication management and its impact on corporate reputation. \n\nThe purpose of this conference was to reflect on the new dynamics of crisis communication management, both in the private and public sectors. Academics and practitioners were invited to submit theoretical papers relating to several themes concerning crisis communication and management, in order to promote reflection and debate on these issues. \n\nTopics that were explored: \nNew Technologies, crisis management and crisis communication management\nOrganizational culture\u2019s influence on crisis (communication) management\nBusiness continuity, business resilience and crisis management\nFactors and parameters of crisis communication\nOrganizational/corporate reputation in a crisis: importance and impact of crisis situations on business assets.",
