    "summary": "I have over 25 years of experience in international education. Since August 2019 I am working as a math teacher at an international school in Amsterdam. Before that I was International Deputy Principal for Academic Affairs at the Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Astana in Kazakhstan from 2014-2019. The school is part of a large scale educational reform project in the country, bringing international best practices to schools while maintaining and building on strengths already present in the country's educational system. In my role I guided the development of the IB Diploma and Middle Years Programme at the school as well as contributing to the improvement of school management and leadership. \n\nFrom 2005-2014 I worked for the IB, first in Geneva, supporting schools in the Africa, Europe and Middle East region in their implementation of the MYP and guiding them through authorization and evaluation. In this role I also trained and managed workshop leaders, consultants and site visitors. Later I worked in Washington DC for the IB in the design and monitoring of the global authorization and evaluation processes as well as in designing services for schools to support them during the authorization process. \n\nI started my career at a school in the Netherlands, where I worked for 7 years teaching mathematics at secondary level and leading the international section and Dutch bi-lingual section of the school through authorization and successful implementation of the IB Middle Years Programme.\n\n\n\nMy areas of expertise are curriculum design and development (with a particular emphasis on mathematics), international education, design of accreditation processes and design and provision of teacher training. I also very much enjoy teaching mathematics. I work well independently while also thriving in teams. I am an excellent communicator and strategic thinker as well as being results oriented and an effective planner and organizer. I have a good eye for detail and interdependencies while maintaining the big picture and moving new ideas forward.",
