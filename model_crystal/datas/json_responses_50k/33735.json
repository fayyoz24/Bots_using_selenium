    "summary": "* Every accomplishment begins with the decision to try. *\n\nWhen I was 17 years old, I moved to another continent all by myself. I still believe this was the best decision I made. It made me confident in my decision-making, like deciding to go and live abroad at such a young age. \n\nI have a Bachelor Degree as a Producer in Media and Entertainment Management and my work experience in this area mainly involved the production of international events in the Beauty and Fashion industry. Being a producer is an amazing and rewarding job, it introduced me into this wonderful industry. I decided to go deeper in this creative industry. For this reason, I became a certified Image Consultant, Personal Shopper, and Fashion Stylist, as well as a Makeup Artist. In Lima Fashion Week I worked backstage for Argentinian designer Jazm\u00edn Ch\u00e9bar, as well as an image consultant and personal shopper for a VIP event in their store. In theater, I have worked as a Wardrobe Stylist.\n\nMy professional skills are:\n\u2022\tProblem solving\n\u2022\tQuick learner\n\u2022\tMulti-tasking\n\u2022\tPlanning, coordinating and organizing\n\u2022\tEye for detail\n\u2022\tWorking under pressure\n\u2022\tCustomer focus\n\u2022\tEntertainment Management\n\u2022\tPersonal Shopping & Image Consulting\n\u2022\tFashion Styling\n\u2022\tMakeup Artistry\n\u2022\tHair Styling and Colouring\n\n\nMy specialties are:\n\u2022\tSpeaking in public\n\u2022\tBasic video editing\n\u2022\tDesigning invitations and logos\n\u2022\tE-Window shopping\n\u2022\tCreative writing",
