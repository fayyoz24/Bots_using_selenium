It had been 4 months since I came out to California and had started my first job. I was loving that, but I was used to always having a side-hustle. I missed the energy of working towards a vision, that constant sense of being on a mission and solving problems.\n\nWhen I wandered into Forager, it was SJ First Friday and there was a band playing in an old abandoned billiards hall. I saw their business plan flyer laying out and my curiosity got the best of me. As I read, I started to fall in love. Their idea was genius and touched all parts of my interests. \n\nBeer, food, community, change... \n\nI approached Heinz and asked if they needed any help with marketing or sales. One thing led to another and next thing I knew I was on the team. Brainstorming, problem-solving and working with passion to make the vision of Forager a reality. \n\nAll though my time with the team was short, the experience was extraordinary and taught me much. I even was able to write one of their first blog posts. \n\nI had to learn the team dynamic quickly and how to communicate with them effectively. The most challenging and rewarding part though was working to understand the underlying vision of Forager and how to formulate that into words, into pictures, into a blog post, into a brand.\n\n**You can read the post by clicking on the link below**",

Now concluding its 13th year, PALS has grown from our first year (2002) enrollment of 200 to 600 youngsters every summer. Our mission is to provide positive growth and development experiences for our children to stay in school, set life goals, make friends, and to dream big. In other words, our mission is to help our children make their lives count. This mission is intentionally consistent with the late Nelson Mandela\u2019s endearing and enduring belief that working on the problem of poverty is nothing less than an act of justice, pure and simple.
