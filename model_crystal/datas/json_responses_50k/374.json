These projects can be (multi-)cultural, social or scientific.   \nFounded in 2002 as a result of study on (multi-)cultural exchange between Switzerland and The Netherlands, mostly on jazzmusic.\n\nART LETTER\nDuring 2003 till 2006 I worked with the SWISS EMBASSY publishing the monthly ART Letter. All kind of concerts, events, expositions by Swiss artists in The Netherlands were published and promoted to the Swiss Clubs in the Netherlands, the Dutch press and a large distributionlist. \nThis resulted in direct contact with the Dutch Embassy and various venues in Switzerland whom applied to have announcements of the concerts and events of Dutch artists in Switzerland. A cooperation started with podia, artists and others.\nThe Artletter was written in english and had a distriubitionlist of artists, podia and locations (750 persons). The information was translated from Dutch, German, French and Italian.\nAnnouncements were also send to SICA (Stichting Internationale Culturele Activiteiten (now Dutch Culture) for the rubric Buitengaats.\n\nJAZZ CLUBS and JAZZ ARTISTS:\nIn the years 2002 till 2007 I often traveled to Switzerland to visit the jazzclubs and promoted the Dutch jazz artists, like for Michiel Borstlap, Jesse van Ruller, The Amsterdam Jazz trio, Ben van den Dungen, Jury Honing, Sandro Fazio, and many more. I also worked with Swiss (jazz)artists and promoted them in The Netherlands, like Lucas Niggli, Ania Losinger, Irene Schweitzer, Ericka Stuckli, and more.....\n\nJAZZ AGENDA \nPromotion weekly of jazzconcerts organized by Equinox Jazz Production (EJP) in The Hague in the beginning of 2000 for 2 years. The announcements were send out to a distributionlist of more than 1000 interested persons.",

Each class had a winner and all those paintings were exposed at MUZEE Scheveningen, de Pier and in the stand of the Municipality on the beach. \r\n\r\nThe project XXL Art is still running: they invited painters from every province of The Netherlands that has a coastline, to paint the coastline before the renovationworks start.
