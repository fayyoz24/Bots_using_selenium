    "summary": "Welcome at my LinkedIn page! I have 7+ \nyears of experience at three different high-quality pharmaceutical companies. There, I improved my skills (1) to work according to strict GMP and safety guidelines, (2) to work smoothly in a team, (3) to perform my activities in a LEAN way, (4) to lead problem-solving projects, like change controls (5) and to learn from my colleagues.\n\nBefore my pharmaceutical experience, I finished my masters Biomedical Sciences in Amsterdam. As a student, my highlight was the ninemonth research internship in Geneva about cardiovascular disease. During this internship, I independently planned and performed my experiments, I have read many scientific articles and I gave multiple presentations. Subsequently, as a scientific writer, I analyzed novel research and described dry scientific matter in an attractive manner. Furthermore, I improved my tutoring and teaching skills (biology, chemistry and physics) at multiple secondary schools.",
