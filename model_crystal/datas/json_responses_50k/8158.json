We cancelled our rent, put all our belongings into a storage box, prepared our backpacks and bought tickets to Jakarta, Indonesia. In the next months, we explored what it means to live a more conscious life: enjoy little moments, take time to slow down, meditate and follow our heart and intuition. With this knowledge, we returned back to the Netherlands to start a new chapter of our life.",
