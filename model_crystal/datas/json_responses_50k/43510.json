    "summary": "I\u2019m the lead structural engineer for NAM\u2019s 35 offshore gas platforms in the Dutch North Sea.\n\nManaging these structures I\u2019ve encountered a wide range of complex problems. Like our assets, these are spread across the operating lifecycle: installations, brownfield modifications, renewal campaigns, lifetime extensions and decommissioning. \n\nThroughout this, maintenance support with a focus on efficiency ensures continued safe production for the many ageing and late-life locations. \n\nI\u2019m particularly excited to be working on major projects such as platform electrification which enable these structures to find a new value and relevance. \n\nI joined Shell through their graduate programme after graduating with a First in Engineering Science (MEng) from Oxford University.",

Working with my colleagues I was able to establish several new sources of income such as the Martlet Society for old members.
