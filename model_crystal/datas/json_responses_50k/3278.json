    "summary": "From the middle of August 2014 I will start a cycling tour from Takaka, Golden Bay, New Zealand to Amsterdam, Holland. It is also a fundraising trip for the homeless and street kids in Cambodia. The main purpose of my cycle tour is to raise funds for scholarships for these kids to learn a profession in one of the technical schools from Don Bosco in Sihanoukville, Phnom Penh or Kep province in Cambodia. On my 60th birthday in January 2015, I hope to be cycling somewhere in South East Asia.\n\nThe first step is Christchurch and from there to Sydney, Cairns, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to Sihanoukville, Cambodia. In Holland we learn how to cycle from an early age, but never before have I embarked on such a big trip. I have met people who have cycled from Europe to New Zealand and I found that really interesting. A few times when flying to Holland and back, I have wondered who lives down there.\n\n6 months ago I made the decision to give it a go, why not, I am now fit enough and  in the flow of new things.  Join me on this epic journey of a lifetime, and follow me via my Blog, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn for regular updates, insights and funny stories from that Dutch guy on his bike. \n\nJan van Susteren helped young disadvantaged people like street kids, homeless youths, and youths in crime situations and their families in their own social environment. Every person needs a stable social environment with positive relationships that offer possibilities to grow and prosper. In the past twenty five years have helped develop thirteen different methods to approach these problems. Working on 80 projects in seven different countries, using an approach-to-measure for each individual person. I work with a youngster for a short, (10 to 12 weeks) intensive, intervention period, aimed at re-activating or creating a stable and positive social environment with an 80% success rate.\n\nOther skills: PPL pilot license, chef, building, counselling.",

One of the organisations he contacted, by mediation from the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports, was Jan van Susteren of Bureau INSTAP.\nMay 1998 Bureau INSTAP and the Foundation Copiii Romaniei, founded by the President of Romania, started a joint project for the period of three and a half years. With full support of the Dutch govermentThe objective of the \u2018Integration Project Street Children of Romania\u2019 was to develop and introduce a new method of service and social assistance for street children in Bucharest. Conveying the method took place according to the \u2018train-the-trainer\u2019 principle. This meant that at the same time as training was given to the teams, staff members were being taught how to give such training sessions themselves in the future. The project was financed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by the Foundation Copiii Romaine. At the end of the project period and on the basis of this method, the conditions had been realised to also continue the care for street children in other Romanian cities. In short the method used worked from the basic assumption that for children it is important that they can fall back on a safe and stable social situation, a basis upon which they can develop and enlarge their social world. As a rule this basic situation is the family. Homeless young people are lacking this safe background. In many cases the cause for wandering behaviour originates from family problems.",

These constitute the predictable consequences and risks of being homeless. Thus, any solution will have to take all these aspects into account. Various research studies have shown also that these young people mostly come from families which have a multitude of problems: unemployment, ac-accommodation problems (poor maintenance, lots of vermin), alcohol abuse, arguments, physical abuse, incest, integration problems (in particular amongst \n\nYoung people from immigrant families), divorce and psychiatric problems. The youngsters have usually dropped out of school and have had negative experiences with social services. Problems may accumulate and reinforce each other. This may result in stress and mental health problems, which in turn may lead to alcoholism. In short: a negative spiral results. Young people grow up in a social environment in which they are regularly confronted with these problems. Not only do young people get caught up in the problems faced by their parents, their family and their social environment, from approximately thirteen years of age onwards, they also have to pass through the sometimes difficult stages of puberty and adolescence",
