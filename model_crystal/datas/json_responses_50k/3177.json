I am a fresh Master graduate, having recently submitted my thesis on the role and interpretation of global environmental consultancy firms of the resilience paradigm as applied in water-related projects. In my MSc Environment & Resource Management, I focused on the global sustainability challenges of the food system and on environmental governance issues at large. Last semester I have been pursuing my exchange semester at ETH Zurich, focusing on the energy transition, power markets and carbon mitigation technologies. Having studied at four universities across Europe equipped me with the necessary interpersonal skills to influence action through trust and communication.",
