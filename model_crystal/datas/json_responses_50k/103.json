This concerns the aspectual difference between (a) \u2018John ate an apple\u2019 and (b) \u2018John was eating an apple\u2019 (for simple temporal relations), and between (c) \u2018Mary said that John ate an apple\u2019 and (d) \u2018Mary said that John was eating an apple\u2019 (for complex ones). While previous L2 research has extensively focused on the acquisition of grammatical aspect and simple temporal relations, there is little research to date on complex orderings. In this project, it is examined to what extent L2 knowledge of grammatical aspect for simple temporal relations predicts knowledge for complex ones within the same group of language learners, and to what extent this is modulated by language proficiency. The outcome of the present project will inform modern theories of L2 acquisition and grammatical aspect.",

What do we miss? In the present project, we investigated how misspelt words influence where people\u2019s attention is drawn to during reading. Specifically, it was asked to what extent orthographic and phonological factors, such as the position within a word and the distance from the stressed syllable, affect the detection of spelling errors. We predicted an interplay between orthography and phonology such that the misspelling\u2019s noticeability increases or decreases within different \u2018ortho-phonological\u2019 contexts. This hypothesis was tested in two experiments involving a misspelling recognition task in German, for which we collected native speakers\u2019 data relevant to performance accuracy, reaction times, and eye movements. The results appear to support our predictions and contribute to existing research concerning reading and attention.",

These mini-games and their respective language versions were tested in four countries: The Netherlands (Dutch), Belgium (French), United Kingdom and South Africa (English). Four types of mini-games were developed, and in two of them users could use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to support spoken interaction. The evaluation phase of the GOBL project represented a crucial stage for the future improvement of its four mini-games with computer-assisted language learning (CALL) purposes. The goal was to identify trends in the user\u2019 perceptions and attitudes towards (aspects of) the mini-games\u2019 final version, including any differences in the users\u2019 experience linked to (a) the two versions of the mini-games (with and without ASR), (b) the languages used across the aforementioned countries, and (c) the users\u2019 linguistic and gaming proficiency levels.",
