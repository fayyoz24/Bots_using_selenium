    "summary": "20+ years (I had my first product out before I started university) of experience as entrepreneur, architect, developer, product manager, and IT director in the EV and endurance sport industries. I love to work where product and tech meet to help build great products. Focus on creating scalable solution on the Microsoft .NET & Azure tech stack.\n\nGoal-getter mentality helping ambitious organizations scale up their business by guiding and coaching development teams (up to 25 FTE). Achieved 50% year over year growth (both in revenue and paying customers) by working closely with global sales and marketing teams.\n\nFounder of two startups in the endurance sport industry. The first one (Looptijden.nl) was acquired by MYLAPS sports timing. My second startup (sodisp.com) is a global fitness challenge platform. It was founded a little over a year ago and is growing fast. Most customers are from the Americas (Mexico, USA, and Canada).",

The team was a mix of about 25 in-house (Amsterdam office) and outsourced members. Together we wrote, improved, tested, and released our flagship SaaS product. I worked closely with the Operations and Product teams to make and deliver according to our product roadmap.\n\nDuring the 3 years at GreenFlux I transitioned the development team from a purely outsourced team to a healthy mix of in-house engineers and outsourcing to strategic partners. My final accomplishment was to improve and describe our way of working and processes within our team and organization to such a level we received the ISO 27001 certification.\n\nDuring the 3 years at GreenFlux I acquired a lot of knowledge about the EV market: its protocols (OCPP, OCPI, OICP/Hubject, ....) and everything that has to do with roaming, smart charging, and billing.",
