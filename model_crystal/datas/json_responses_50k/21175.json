The lifetime of the treatments can be significantly increased by introducing precipitation mechanism for inhibitor retention. \n\nI studied the factors that affect precipitation and re-dissolution of the scale inhibitors during squeeze treatments and developed the qualitative dissolution model for phosphonate scale inhibitors. Once this model is simulated and implemented into in-house SQUEEZE code, the more accurate prediction of residual phosphonate scale inhibitor concentration in produced brine can be obtained. \n\nThe project was stirred by Joint Industry Project sponsors (over 20 energy companies). The project was awarded the 1st and 2nd prizes in European Division of SPE Student Paper Contest (2018 and 2017).\n\nMain deliverable: \n\u2022\tConducted comprehensive analytical study on unconventional chemistry for application in lower temperature conditions for barite scale inhibition\n\u2022\tDeveloped procedures and conducted static and dynamic flooding laboratory tests to examine  precipitated scale inhibitors \n\u2022\tLearnt analytical and general laboratory techniques: ICP-OES, UV-Vis Spectrometry, static inhibition efficiency and compatibility tests; sand pack flooding, ESEM/EDX, NMR, FTIR\n\u2022\tPresented all key findings to the joint industry project sponsors (over 20 oil and gas upstream company representatives) every 6 months supplemented with progress reports interpreting obtained data \n\u2022\tInvited to present at international conferences (4 presentations)\n\u2022\tPublished 4 papers in peer-reviewed and conference journals",
