    "summary": "I fell in love with spacial design when realised how it can inspire visitors. On my first 5 years of career, I worked as an architect, but later the appeal of quickly and efficiently generating experiences that strongly connect with people hearts brought me to exhibit design and a Master in Ephemeral Architecture and Temporary Spaces.. A dedicated passion with documentary photography, another master in History and a brief career working in the field of producing video content for brands - gave me an extra insight with visual narratives.\n\nSuccessful projects result from diverse teams working together in healthy open and collaborative ways. I believe in collaborative thinking and I am fortunate to have worked and learned with incredible talents in the design and production of several travelling exhibitions for Canada, Spain, Greece, Holland, Honduras, Guatemala and Indonesia. Some of my work has been at Barcelona Light Festival, Stedelijk Contemporary Art museum and National Photography Museum, both in The Netherlands. \n\nI am open for collaborations, and now exploring AR, interactivity and AI and love to find ways together to share ideas. Let's discuss it!\n\nSuccessful projects result from diverse teams working together in healthy open and collaborative ways.
