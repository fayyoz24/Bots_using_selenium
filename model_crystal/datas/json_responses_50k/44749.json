The ESM provides the Orion vehicle with propulsion, attitude control, electrical power generation and distribution, crew module heat rejection/control and crew consumables storage. \n\nHaving overseen the design, development and qualification of the module over a period of eleven years, the team enjoyed a great reward for their efforts at the end of 2022 when the Orion vehicle performed a flawless Artemis I mission to the Moon. This was the first integrated flight test of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System rocket and the KSC ground systems and the mission\u2019s success provided confidence that the vehicle is safe to fly with a crew.\n\nWithin ESA, the ESM team collaborated with specialists from diverse disciplines including D/HRE (exploration) and D/TEC (subsystem design experts). External collaborators included the European industry, NASA, Lockheed Martin Co. and other US industries. This collaboration marks the first time that ESA and industry team members integrated in the development team of a NASA-crewed transportation system.",
