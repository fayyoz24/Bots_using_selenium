Further, blending reduces the effective density and viscosity of the \nfuel. The spray cone angle and spray tip penetration length are the parameters studied experimentally. Using spray visualization system, a high speed digital camera and image processing techniques, experimental values of these parameters are obtained. But the values of these macroscopic quantities alone cannot determine which the best alternative for diesel is. Hence, evaluation of a microscopic quantity called Sauter Mean Diameter is done. This quantity gives \nthe average diameter of a spherical droplet.  The fuels used are Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME), diesel and blends of KOME and diesel in various proportions. The aim of this endeavour is to find a similarity in trends between test fuels, because reusability and eco-friendliness of biodiesel make it a very eligible contender.",

                    "description": "Tata Steel IJmuiden R&D have developed a numerical model to simulate and predict the temperature history of the steel strip under the controlled cooling in the Run-Out table of the Hot Strip Mill. Any numerical model contains deviations from the expected or the measured values. A model is adjudged to be good if the magnitude of these deviations is on the lower side. The model simulating the Run-Out Table cooling process (ROT) has a set of Heat Transfer Coeffi\u000ecient (HTC) Vs Surface Temperature curves as a model input along with measured process parameters such as strip speed and finishing temperature. This is important to predict the temperature history and phase transformation phenomena in the steel strip. The existing problem in the model is the occurrence of high magnitude of errors between the model calculated temperatures and the measured temperatures. This seems to occur more at lower strip surface temperatures, where the heat transfer regimes di\u000bffer from the ones at higher surface temperatures. In this study, the error performance trends have been studied for the default curve setting and various changed settings of the HTC curves. It was observed and validated that for a reduction of 10% from the default set of HTC values, the error attains a minimum for majority of the samples. The mean coiling temperature error was reduced from 20 \u000e\u00b0C to 2.5 \u00b0\u000eC along with a reduction in standard deviation from 28 \u00b0\u000eC to 25 \u00b0\u000eC. Further recommendations have been given to provide a better understanding of the physics of the problem, by linking them with the latest literature results. The success of this model improvement can save an estimated \u20ac500,000 for the company.",

I was assigned the task of finding the reasons leading to the energy deficit. Teaming up with two experienced energy consultants, I conducted  an energy audit on boilers, pipelines and chimneys of this plant. I successfully identified & suggested changes that would improve the efficiency of the heating equipment. In addition, I conducted a cost analysis of each alternative solution and selected the option with the best rate of return on investments with reasonable investment costs. This cost analysis produced recurring savings amounting to around \u20ac 150,000 per year for an one-time investment of \u20ac85,000.",
