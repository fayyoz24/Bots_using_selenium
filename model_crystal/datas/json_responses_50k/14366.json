    "summary": "Following a successful and fulfilling career in the oil and gas industry working on some extremely technically challenging subsea projects, I decided to study space science, whilst raising my family and living abroad. Space has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.\n\nHolding senior technical positions on some major oil and gas projects in the harsh environment of the North Sea, I gained significant experience on every phase of a project, from initial development and concept studies, to design, interface engineering, integration testing, offshore installation, pre-commissioning, operator management and decommissioning.\n\nI am now excited to move onto the next chapter of my career working on renewables projects at Heerema Engineering Solutions.",
