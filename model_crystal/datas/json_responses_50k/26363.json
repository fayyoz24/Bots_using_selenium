Oracle GL would consume the accounting transactions through FAH from the source system BaNCS.\n\n\u2022\tDeveloped the conversion program to load the account balances data from the legacy system to \n        the GL system.\n\u2022\tAnalyzed financial year records and identified important discrepancies during migration. The effort \n        led to recover the mis-matched balances during a three-year period and significantly reduced the \n        risk of non-compliance for the organization.\n\u2022\tDeveloped the inbound interface to receive the transactions file from the source system and \n        process through FAH and then post to GL.\n\u2022\tDeveloped PL/SQL programs for implementing validation rules.\n\u2022\tDeveloped the outbound interface (Transactions and Balance) that will generate 2 CSV files\n        through UTL_FILE package for consumption to the report tool OBIEE.\n\u2022\tDeveloped the custom Trial Balance Report using the XML Publisher reporting solution.\n\u2022\tDeveloped and automated Unix shell script for recursive loading, helped in loading huge amounts \n        of data all around the clock for Non-functional load testing reducing completion time by 80%.\n\u2022\tImplemented GL reports through FSG (Financial Statement Generator) reporting tool of Oracle GL.\n\u2022\tImplemented Oracle Alert to send out failure notifications.\n\u2022\tWorked on migrating the balances to the GL system through the Web ADI tool.\n\u2022\tContributed in Unit testing of the entire implementation, creation of test scripts, logging and \n        tracking defects to closure.\n\u2022\tContributed keenly in resolving the production issues both from business and technical \n        perspective.",
