The versatile harvester can be placed in front of a window or even the entire fa\u00e7ade of a building. Depending on the size of the harvester and storage containers, this system is capable of storing enough warmth and cold  to maintain a stable indoor temperature (summer & winter) without the need for external power.\n\nMy biggest achievement in this project was a simulation program I wrote to prove and predict how the system would work. The program require the dimensions of the harvesting system and would then simulate the harvesting process using historical weather data collected hourly by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI).",

The goal of these courses was the creation of mathematical models to simulate behaviors of different objects.\n\nThe second half of the minor consisted of a project with a company partnering with the HvA. Using their simulation engine we created a 3D model of our school building and simulated the evacuation procedures in the event of a fire. The simulation engine provided algorithms to simulate how people move through a space. However, due to the limited interface and usability of the engine, I built my own framework around the engine in C#. This allowed us to create and run scenarios quickly. We were also able to use the actual time-table of the school to simulate the actual evacuation process at any given time during the day. As a final benefit, we were able to manipulate the 3D building model quickly and with ease.",

Agile/Scrum is often chosen as a tool to provide a project/program with execution power by its short iterations and focus on working software. But how can we see if a software development project in Scrum is going well? Thesis was rewarded with an 8.0, graduated with honors/cum laude.\n\nDuring my research I found that feedback generated in Scrum predominantly provides information about execution and solution. But not about added value, constraints and in limited sense about capability.\n\nMy thesis is grounded in a 75 million Euro project at a client of KPMG. I analyzed in total eight sprints, four teams, conducted various interviews and observed day-to-day work over a period of three months.\n\nThe contribution of this thesis was twofold. It made make clear how di\u000ecult it is in a large, complex change program to see if the program is on schedule. Additionally, it showed that, while Scrum is a solution-oriented approach, and as such brings the problems in realization clearly into view, it does not perform well with management on value and the programs constraints. The second contribution of this thesis was a clear analysis how to extend Scrum to make these risks assessable, by adding a light weight governance layer.\n\nGrade: 8.0.",

This internship proved to be a broad introduction to the IT field in a multinational corporation as well as additional experience in software engineering. During this internship, I explored the structural quality (source-code) of several software applications within ABN-AMRO's processes. While the initial assignment was to create reports for senior management by using a static-code analyzer, I quickly discovered this approach was not the best way to report on overall software quality.\n\nIn order to provide senior management with a complete overview of software quality, I devised a method for implementing application life-cycle management. This process consists of tracking an application from beginning to end which provides vital intelligence about the connections between the total-cost of ownership as well as the quality of an application to both internal and external entities. The method works by implementing various quality checks between each phase an application goes through during its life cycle. Aside from measuring quality, these checks are also able to actively manage quality to the desired level.",
