As such, I am responsible for team organization as well as coordination with other teams.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, I continue to work on developing our physically-correct simulation engine which we use to develop our simulations of automotive camera, lidar, and radar sensors. I am the primary developer of our Physics Based Lidar (PBL) plugin for Simcenter Prescan. The PBL plugin is available in two variants: the Point Cloud Lidar (PCL) for real-time applications, and the Full-Waveform Lidar (FWL) for extremely high-accuracy lidar simulation. Both variants are physically-correct, and part of the work involved in their development is validation of their correctness. For validation, I work directly with lidar manufacturers in order to show the correctness and usability of our plugins.\n\nThe PBL simulation was developed using our in-house simulation engine. It is developed using Nvidia Optix, CUDA, and C++. For development, I make use of Jenkins, Atlassian Jira, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Mercurial.",
