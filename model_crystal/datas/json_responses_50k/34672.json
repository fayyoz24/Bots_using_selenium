The most intense was the period between 2012 and 2015.\n\nApart from the jobs, I liked the most \u2013 working on websites and smaller online stores; I also did graphic work (branding, visual communication for events like conferences, and even making cartoons and short animations). I even taught analogue photography, and darkroom work with children at summer camps \ud83c\udf9e Whoever did not take all the gigs because it was necessary to stay in college should throw the first stone. \ud83d\udc40\n\nClients: Bridgestone, Religia TV, Grupa Tarczynski, Polish Insurance Association (PIU), Festival for Education, University of Life Sciences, University of Lodz, Polin Museum and a whole lot of small businesses, who taught me patience and signing contracts with clients",
