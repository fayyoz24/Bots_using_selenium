    "summary": "I am a beta student with an interest in innovation and business. During my research internships I have obtained several interesting results, which are relevant to fundamental research. I enjoyed working at a research department. In addition, I am fascinated about the fast-changing and competitive world. I think that innovation is a key to success. Therefore, I have chosen the master specialization Science, management and Innovation, to build business-oriented knowledge. My exact background is a privilege because I am able to understand complex processes and technologies. Furthermore, during the courses \u2018\u2019Entrepreneurship\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019From Lab to Clinic\u2019\u2019 I have obtained knowledge about writing a business plan and consultancy report for a company.
