    "summary": "After years in corporate environment, I am excited to announce that I am starting my business.\n\nAfter 20 years of successful business management in the IT industry, after 12 years as a Chief Mother Officier of 2 fantastic children and after 2 years of pandemic with a couple of lockdowns giving me the opportunity to explore the undersides of school curses and education , I found the perfect way to bring those 3 expertises together. \n\nThe opportunity to be part of facilitators amongst the parents of the amazing @International School of Amsterdam allowed me to interact with teachers, staff,  many international communities, students and parents and learn from them. I enjoy helping and bringing people together, helping organizing events and share our culture with students and parents. \nI also enjoy seeing smile on the face of children when they explore new areas of learnings, how fabulous it is to see the excitement of them having fun, because playing is also at the center of their world. \n\nThose last couple of months of break made me realize what I always really wanted ! Start my business and contribute in a positive way to our children and our world. \n\nMy personal project consiste in organizing for our children's (and adults)  a brand-new and innovative way of moving & learning thanks to technology working on 4 pillars : focus, active engagement, feedbacks and consolidation. \nLearn\nEducational\nAutonomous\nReflective \nNeuro-science\nOrientation\nLEARN-O  is the new concept.\n\nWe need to listen more to our kids and embrace the future with values of the past : the new era of LEARNING.\nRepetition makes perfection, so here is your opportunity to combine educational and activities simultaneously.",
