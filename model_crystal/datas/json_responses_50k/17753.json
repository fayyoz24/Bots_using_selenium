    "summary": "I finished the international Bachelor's program in Psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands in the summer of 22. For my Master, I chose to specialize in Occupational\\Organizational and Economic Psychology. \n\nI am very ambitious, conscientious, and curious. Furthermore, I am a 100% dedicated to a task that I am assigned to. Moreover, I worked as a waitress/hostess for a long time and from an early age, which taught me to be responsible, polite, resilient, flexible, and considerate when working in teams. Finally, my experience with tutoring and internships in educational facilities strengthened my organizational, empathic, and leading skills, as well as made me confident in my ability to find creative and innovative solutions in case of stagnating progress or conflict. \n\n\nNext to my Master, I am also pursuing training to become a certified professional in horse-assisted therapy. Even with these two things already on my agenda, I am still looking for job (e.g., part-time, working student) and internship opportunities, especially in the field of scientific research, Occupational/Organizational and Economic Psychology (e.g., Human Resources, personnel development, Coaching, etc.), or horse-assisted therapy.\n\nIf I managed to inspire you and you believe that I could valuably contribute to your project/team, feel free to contact me! I am time-flexible and mobile (e.g. by car). Additionally, I am also skilled with computer programs/working in an online setting if home-office is an option.",

My goal was to support seminar participants in strengthening their resilience and time- and stress management. In doing so, I was able to use my creative skills as well as my academic know-how. I strengthened these skills by putting them into practice to develop content that met the individual needs of the participants. Furthermore, I learned to apply and convey complex interrelationships in an understandable way and to use innovative methods to actively involve the participants in the learning process.\n\nIn addition, I had the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the implementation of employee training through observations in various seminars. I was able to actively accompany the entire process from preparation to implementation and gain valuable experience by supporting and supervising small group work. These insights have deepened my understanding of how to implement training measures and further developed my teamwork skills.\n\nI assisted and participated in the following seminars/training during the internship: \n- \"Personal resilience - developing inner strength and mastering change\"\n- \"Professional time, self and team management with Outlook and OneNote\"\n- \"Professional stress management\"\n- \"Professional time and self-management - your key to calmness, serenity and success\"",
