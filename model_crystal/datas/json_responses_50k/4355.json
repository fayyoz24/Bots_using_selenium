    "summary": "The Batavia brand and company perform excellent! We create multiple new and different -''refreshing innovative'' products which are GREAT to USE and to SELL. Tools to Build is our claim and direction, which in fact has a triple meaning: WE build tools for users, USERS can build with our tools, and RESELLERS can build their companies by selling our tools. Our open mind and partnership attitude to available technics, partnerships and consumer behaviour is why we have the energy to continue with what we are doing. We share our knowledge at various levels; from development to functional design, high class sourcing, marketing to even IP agreements (yes! we license technology and brands) and develop business at B2B and B2C level maintaining and respecting each others function and role. The world and consumers change; definitely suppliers and retailers need to adapt and I see that Batavia has an answer to several of these new requirements. We make a difference and besides that; we offer potential!\n\nwww.bataviapower.com",
