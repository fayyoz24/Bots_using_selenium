An online training program was\ndesigned in which psychological constructs (e.g. self-efficacy, etc.) were expected to influence vmbo students\u2019 goal to engage in correct waste disposal behaviour. Furthermore, various exercises were\nexpected to enhance the development of competencies to reduce cognitive load. The combination was\nexpected to \u2018boost\u2019, and hence, increase vmbo-students\u2019 selective attention. Nevertheless, the results\nindicated that vmbo-students whose selective attention was \u2018boosted\u2019 (N = 63) did not score higher on\nthe psychological constructs than students in the control condition (N = 75). Moreover, the students\nwhose selective attention was \u2018boosted\u2019 did neither continue longer with waste disposal nor correctly\ndispose of waste items more often than students in the control condition. Nevertheless, explorative\nanalyses did indicate that providing students with information on the consequences of littering\nincreases their knowledge, makes students believe more that others consider correct waste disposal\nimportant and makes them consider it as more important themselves as well. While these findings do\nnot yet translate to an increase in correct waste disposal behaviour, this study does offer concrete\nstarting points to further investigate the potential of \u2018boosting\u2019 students\u2019 selective attention to create\nsustainable behaviour change which transfers to various contexts and situations.",

It is still commonly believed that this process is accompanied by a rational decision-making process, but research suggests otherwise. This experiment, therefore, aimed at proving the effect of bias caused by anchoring on high school teachers\u2019 (affective, normative and continuance) commitment to change. Differences in gender and work experience were investigated as well. A total of 195 high school teachers in the Netherlands participated in the experiment. The teachers were assigned to three different conditions (no anchor, an encouraging anchor or a discouraging anchor) to possibly manipulate the outcomes. The results indicated that high school teachers that were presented with an encouraging anchor scored higher on normative commitment to change than teachers that were presented with a discouraging anchor. Furthermore, high school teachers with more than three years of work experience in the control condition scored higher on continuance commitment to change than teachers with less than or three years of work experience in the control condition. Even though fewer effects of anchoring were found than expected, the anchors in combination with the scenario might have elicited an unconscious normative influence. Thus, the results do provide evidence to suggest that high school teachers might not be as rational in their decision-making processes towards change as is still commonly assumed. Suggested is to take the role of familiarity, knowledge or expertise with the proposed changes into account when conducting future research. \nKeywords: change management, affective, normative, continuance, commitment to change, bias, anchoring, high school teacher, gender, work experience\n",

            "description": "A lot of research is done about the \u2018bystander effect\u2019. Less is known about the effect of the number of\npassive bystanders. This research aims at investigating the effect of the number of passive bystanders on the mental well-being of a victim of sexual harassment. Students ranging from the age of 18 to 25 were asked to participate in this study. With using Virtual Reality videos, it was tried to come as close to a real life situation as possible. Before and after the video, the students answered multiple questions about mental well-being, which was measured in terms of multiple concepts. The effect of the number of bystanders on the need for safety, one of the constructs of mental well-being, of a victim of sexual harassment was found to be significant (p = .048). The score on need for safety tends to be higher when there are less bystanders present, which implies a lower mental well-being when less bystanders are present. Additionally, the effect of \u2018just world beliefs\u2019 on the mental well-being was investigated as well.  he study showed that self-blame thoughts (p = .010), one of the other concepts of which mental well- being consists, tend to be higher when someone scores low on \u2018just world beliefs\u2019 and more bystanders re present. No other significant effects were found for both the main research questions and the additional research questions about \u2018just world beliefs\u2019. The quality and severity of the Virtual Reality video might be a reason for the low amount of significant effects found. For future research suggestions have been made to improve the quality of the video, since it remains an important subject to investigate to be able to help future victims of sexual harassment in an appropriate and scientific proven way.\nKeywords: bystander effect, sexual harassment, number of bystanders, Virtual Reality, just world beliefs",
