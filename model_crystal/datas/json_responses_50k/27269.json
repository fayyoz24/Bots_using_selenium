    "summary": "I am an innovative, results-oriented postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University, Materials Theory Group | \u00c5ngstr\u00f6mlaboratoriet with a demonstrated history of working in computational materials science and energy-related applications. I am committed to continuous improvement both personally and professionally. I have a strong background in mathematics, physics & programming, having completed a Ph.D. in Physics (Materials science and engineering), an M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Physics, & an undergraduate degree in physics,\n\nMy career has equipped me with a number of hard skills: a strong background in Physics, mathematics, data analysis & modeling, research & development (R&D) & familiarising myself with new concepts (on an almost weekly basis), plus plenty of programming experience. Furthermore, I have acquired soft skills, through my studies: the ability to communicate complex ideas in simple terms, presentation building & public speaking, driving a small team towards a common goal but also being able to easily transition to independent work, as well as being fluid enough to accommodate change & unexpected events.\n\nI am very well-rounded & have a keen interest in many other facets of life, such as the High energy physics, computer science & consulting spaces. As long as a field presents tough, interesting questions, I'm all for it.\n\nMotivated by the ability to have an impact, change the world, and leave it a better place than I found it.",
