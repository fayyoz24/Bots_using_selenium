My team members covered Account managers, Project managers, Designers, Engineers, Work preparators and Administration. The teams developed retail solutions for brands like Nespresso, Heineken, Cybex, Philips and Nintendo. Project driven I was responsible that my teams delivered profitable projects and satisfied clients. Process driven I developed tools to monitor project costs in relation with expected revenues. Efficiency driven I developed a tool that consolidated calculations, investments and logistics. Based on the outcome we were able to created strategic quotations. \nNote: In the summer of 2020 Alrec had to close their Dutch production facility, with the side effect that half of my colleagues were redundant. To effectively allocate the remaining people to the projects Arec shifted more and more from a team - towards a department structure.",
