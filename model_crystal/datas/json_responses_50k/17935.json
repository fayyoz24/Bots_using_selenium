    "summary": "An interculturalist long before I understood the term, I was raised and educated across continents. As an adult I have honed my cultural understanding through academic studies in Sociology, Cultural Studies and International Relations, as well as a career spanning both NGOs and multinational corporations.     \n\nI currently live in Amsterdam, where I have spent the past few years working in the financial sector, where I developed my skills as an intercultural specialist. The Netherlands is the first place I have ever lived where both my names are easily pronounceable and spell-able. From my name, most people immediately assume I am Dutch. But I\u2019m more than one label, which is why I understand how limiting labels and assumptions can be. \n \nI develop all my training and speaking sessions with the aim of showing people the benefits of looking beyond labels and cultural assumptions and sharing the skills of intercultural communication I\u2019ve learnt throughout my life.",
