    "summary": "I'm a communications specialist with a background in science journalism, digital content creation, community engagement, facilitation, and academic research. With experience in science journalism, I communicate complex ideas in the easy-to-read manner without sacrificing accuracy. In our highly visual communications environment, I am always thinking about visual impact of digital posts and publications. I'm driven by complex questions about how people relate to one another and relate to the soil. After working in agriculture extension and as a journalist, I decided to take a role that allowed me to combine my interests in storytelling and outreach.",

I lived in Ireland and, through the perspective of a soil geographer, studied the science, energy politics, and cultural identity associated with peat bogs in Ireland. I interviewed more than 100 people and produced digital media such as written stories, audio slideshows, social media, photographs and a blog.\n\nWhy Irish bogs matter:\nThough covering only 3% of land globally, peatlands hold more than 25% of the world\u2019s soil carbon. That is the equivalent of half the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, or three times the amount of carbon stored in rainforests. Peat bogs cover 20% of Ireland and hold an iconic place in Ireland's collective identity. \n\nThis project explored the changing Irish relationship to peatland. These changes are driven by a shifting energy economy and increasing concern about carbon emissions resulting from drained bogs. While wet, peat soil is a stable carbon reservoir. However, like many carbon-rich natural resources, people harvest and burn peat as fuel, releasing its carbon back into our increasingly saturated atmosphere. Through this fellowship, I explored the complex relationship between Irish culture and carbon-rich peat soil.\n\nAbout the fellowship:\n\"The Fulbright-National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellowship is a partnership between the U.S. Department of State and the National Geographic Society, which provides a unique platform for U.S. Fulbrighters to undertake an in-depth exploration of globally relevant issues and use a variety of digital storytelling tools and media, including blogs, photography, video and social media, to share their stories by providing content to National Geographic digital platforms with the support and mentorship of National Geographic staff. These storytelling tools are a powerful resource in building lasting ties across cultures.\" ~Nat Geo Society",
