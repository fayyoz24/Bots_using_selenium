    "summary": "I am a result-oriented business leader with a strong people focus and a passion for technology. I drive growth and expansion for tech start-ups and scale-ups in Asia and Europe. I enjoy building high performance teams, organisations and grow people. \n\nOne of my proudest achievements has been to manage a start-up into a highly profitable business, in a very competitive market. Leaseweb is a managed hybrid cloud provider and operates in the Fintech, Martech, Media, Gaming and e-Commerce space. My track record in both Sales and Operations is excellent and I work best in an environment where I can combine strategic thinking and in-depth product knowledge with a hands-on execution mentality. This is how I earn the respect of my team and get things done. \n\nBefore Leaseweb, my ING Bank career started as an IT Business Analyst and Project Manager. Then Head of IT Applications, Program and Change Management roles and through to COO Business Lending.\n\nI have lived and worked in many different countries in Asia, Middle East, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe. \n\nAt a glance\n\u2022\tInternationally experienced business leader\n\u2022\tDrives growth and change for start-ups, scale-ups and large enterprises\n\u2022\tDigital Innovation and Transformation\n\u2022\tMSc. in Economics\n\nCore Competencies and Experiences\nSales \u2022 Building teams \u2022 Digital Transformation and Innovation \u2022  Outsourcing and Offshoring \u2022 Program Management \u2022 Cloud, SaaS and Hosting \u2022 DevOps, Agile and Lean Six Sigma \u2022 Fintech domains: Financial Markets, Lending, Payments, Insurance, Finance and Compliance",
