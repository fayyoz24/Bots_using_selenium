The main feature of the project is real-life problem based learning.\n\nMy responsibilities as a Project Marketing Manager included:\n\n- Analysis of the current business situation. \n- Development of a new rescue marketing plan to make the organisation profitable again.\n- Constant communication with every member of the team, especially communication manager.\n\nWorking in an international team, with every team member being responsible for his own department of the company was an extremely valuable experience. I learned how an international enterprise should work and how to cope with the difficulties it may bring. \n\nThe position of Project Marketing Manager required excellent communication and cooperation with every department of the company (Logistics, HRQM, Finance, Marketing). As a result, more detailed, in-depth knowledge was accumulated from different fields and their influence regarding marketing planning.",
