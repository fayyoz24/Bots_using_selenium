    "summary": "I am an Economist from the University of Piura (Peru) with a master\u2019s degree in Environmental Sciences and a major in Environmental Economics from Wageningen University. Given my interdisciplinary academic and working background, I focus on the integration of technical elements from an interdisciplinary perspective in the decision-making processes, by combining economics and societal topics with climate change and environmental impacts. My experience started in Peru in projects related to climate change scenarios and economic impacts.\n\nWithin Deltares I am involved in international projects on mainly River basin management projects related to Integrated water management and water security; Climate risk assessments (water scarcity risk, supply chain climate risks, physical and transitional risks, etc) and also collaborating on financial/funding mechanisms for water security and climate finance. I am very familiar with the way of working in Developing countries, experience that has been acquired while working in the Latin American region and India (Master Thesis). Apart of my role on research projects, I also carry out the role of Country Coordinator for Peru, handling the commercial relationship with different local stakeholders and identifying collaboration opportunities for the Latin American Region.\n",
