    "summary": "As a student at Nanyang Technology University under the Material Science and Engineering with Second Major Medical Biology program, I wish to leverage this degree to garner valuable new skill sets and gain exposure to the industry.\n\nGraduating from Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Biomedical Science program, I was trained and equipped with skills in biomedical research such as Cell culturing, PCR and Gel electrophoresis. During my internship stint at A*Star, I was exposed to the cross-discipline potential of material science and biomedical science in the project on nanotechnology in drug delivery. \n\nDuring my summer internship at NTU MSE lab, I had the opportunity to conduct material research on reversible polymers. This experience has equipped me with training on thermal analysis of materials using Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. It also provided me with the chance to showcase my skills in data analytics using Microsoft Excel and SPSS study and correlate the experimental data and the variables.\n\nThrough these internships experiences, I had gained new insight into material research and I'm currently looking to further explore other roles that I can contribute to Singapore's material industry.",
