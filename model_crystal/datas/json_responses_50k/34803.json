    "summary": "After moving to the United States of America and passing the IGCSE exams in Washington DC, I graduated Cum Laude from my Global Supply Chain Management and Change masters at Maastricht University 7 years later. The next step for me was joining the High Potential Traineeship Program for young professionals at Yacht. I would not have achieved this without my high level of motivation, discipline and perseverance. I, Femke van de Moosdijk, have developed among other skills, stakeholder management, project management, communication, adaptability,  and continuous improvement skills in international, technical environments. To learn the basics of supply chain in practice, I worked as shopfloor controller at Neways Advanced Applications and as Supplier Performance manager at Philips Medical. With these insights of how these parts of the supply chain function, I was ready to take the next step and help the continuous improvement of such a supply chain. I, therefore started as Supply chain business analyst at Philips, where I contribute to several projects to improve several aspects of the supply chain and the insights thereof. I successfully managed to implement supply chain transparency in the outbound flow of finished goods (The following important aspects were addressed: software, process & hardware), introduce a new consolidating capability, standardise management reporting models and applied the agile way of working for new supply chain software and PowerBI report introductions. I hope to learn lots more during the course of the projects I am a part of so I can use this knowledge throughout the rest of my career.\n\nCurious about my profile, please reach out to me via LinkedIn message or via mail (femkevandemoosdijk@gmail.com)",
