    "summary": "I am an Algerian third-year student in International business in The Hague, and I am currently following the operations and supply chain specialization. My passion of identifying problems and finding creative solutions brought me to this specific program.\n\nWhen I was a child, I have always been that little hero who was called to fix problems between two classmates. That is because I have never jumped into conclusions and offer answers. Instead, I always observed the event while engaging in some unconscious critical thinking, and after speaking with each of them, I was able to identify the true issue. That was my way of creating two best friends in two days instead of two months of fighting! Do you want to know the moral of my story?  Well, half of the solution is in understanding the problem, and this is what Operations are all about.\n\nDuring my Bachelor program I am becoming aware of my problem-solving skills namely: team and project leadership, communication, critical thinking, observations, and most importantly the Lean and Agile mindset. For the sake of thriving in my career, I am currently focused on learning how to master the necessary skills through working on practical cases based on theoretical books with assistance from instructors who are experts in the field of Operations and Supply chain.",
