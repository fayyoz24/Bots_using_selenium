    "summary": "I am a professional who is always open to new and exciting challenges. I started working while I studied towards my BA in Translation and Interpreting. After obtaining my degree, I took a four-year study break in which I focused on gaining more work experience. I didn't restrict myself to my career: I was also a professor (including at the same place where I obtained my BA degree), and I gained some experience in customer service and administrative/office work. During these four years, I saved up to fulfill a big life-goal: to obtain a MA degree abroad, something that I achieved recently in the Netherlands. My next big goal is to go for a PhD, but first, I want to experience working in Europe, at an international company. The Netherlands is a great place to start!\n\nLanguages are my passion, and as such I have strong language- and communication-related abilities. I'm not only into translating; I can also do proofreading, editing and writing of all sorts of content. I particularly like dealing with blogs, magazines and social media, working with content destined to the popularization of science, and cultural topics.\n\nI am responsible and organized, proactive and independent, result-oriented and a fast learner, able to deal with problems and make decisions. I am equally comfortable with teamwork and individual work. I love cultural diversity and deeply respect people\u2019s differing opinions and attitudes derived from cultural differences. I act in the best interest of people I interact with. I am someone you can trust, both with sensitive information and with money. I am aware of my strengths and weaknesses, always willing to work on the latter.\n\nI am keen to put my skills to good use and learn a lot from my colleagues, when someone gives me the chance to be a part of their team! Looking forward to it :)",

I intend to prepare and publish an article derived from my findings, together with my supervisor.\n\nIdioms are especially complex because their structure and meaning are not as straightforward as in other expressions. They can appear in all registers and in any literary genre, including dictionaries. Various sets of strategies for the translation of idioms have been proposed by different authors. In my thesis I examined the translation strategies according to Baker (1992) used in two online bilingual dictionaries for the two types of idioms identified by Nunberg et al (1994), called 'idiomatically combining expressions' and 'idiomatic phrases'. I also looked into the microstructural treatment of said idioms in the analyzed dictionaries, and explored the forms in which they appear in natural contexts - that is, outside the dictionaries.",

My primary goal was to get to work with endangered languages, because I have been strongly interested in them since I was a child. I also wanted to gain experience and knowledge of documentary linguistics and field methods, to know the procedure a researcher has to follow to prepare data and materials for their submission into an online language archive for endangered languages. \n\nI worked on the transcription and analysis of some of the data collected in the field by my primary supervisor over the last ten years. I prepared audio, video and text materials for archiving, transcribed and edited audio and video field data using the specialized software programmes ELAN and Praat.",
