    "summary": "Through my academic interests and alternative upbringing, I have developed a skillset well-suited to interdisciplinary and holistic learning pursuits. I relocated frequently as a young person before moving to The Netherlands to complete a degree in Global Public Health at Leiden University College. My program introduced me to ethnographic research methods and the importance of research design in pursuing complex global challenges. My thesis consisted of a systematic literature review on the role of therapeutic healing in Indigenous-focused maternal health practices operating in settler-colonial landscapes. My objective was to determine how the therapeutic landscape works in application through said practices, and how it can potentially address current issues surrounding cultural safety in the western childbearing environments. I have a passion for academic research. My aspiration is to become a cultural anthropologist and work at an institution such as Leiden University. At this time, my primary interests revolve around Indigenous knowledge systems and maternal health. I currently work part-time along side school as a retail employee and in my spare time, I enjoy reading and artistic outlets such as painting and dance.",
