A good visual language should work perfectly together with other parts of the system \u2028and real life always brings in new challenges. \u2028I am working on complex visual systems from \u2028the beginning of my career till automotive systems \u2028and AAA-games UI\u2019s.\n\nMy goal as a designer is to provide a solution that \u2028is not only functional and visually attractive, but also the most natural for the end users. And I believe that product should be perfect on every level. \n\nI design solutions that last. And I feel proud when \u2028I see people using the products I worked on in their everyday life.",

I worked on creating the websites - from design to implementation, creating illustrations and making magazine layouts, designing promotional print material and brand styles. At this point I understood that visual component of this work is what interests me the most. Working by myself learned me to be involved in a project on all levels and take responsibility for every step of it. This quality is important for me and I try to get involved as much as possible in the development of the projects I work on. \n\nCurrently I am more focused on creating my own iOS-apps (with the help of an iOS-developer), but I am also opened for some freelance work. Having own apps gave me some valuable experience in promoting my own product, listening to the users and working with the feedback.",

It was very important to fit our product seamlessly into the existing built-in OS of the brand. It was even more challenging because of the device specifics, it was very important that all the designs are pixel perfect. After creating a detailed and thorough specifications document, next stage of my work was to work together with the international team of developers and help them in implementing all the changes. Together we were always searching out what is the best for the user and how we can improve the product in accordance with the strict requirements.

One of the biggest challenges was to negotiate and push through all the details of the new visual appearance and functionality to the company of the client that often had a very bureaucratic structure. Websites I worked on were mostly containing plenty of information needed to be properly displayed and easy to find. The most interesting for me was how to organise all the information blocks on the screen so that the website doesn\u2019t become too heavy and everything stays very clear and neat, yet all the data is accessible and easy to find.",
