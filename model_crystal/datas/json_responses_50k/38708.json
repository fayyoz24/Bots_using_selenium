The goal is to provide guidance & guidelines for each stakeholder involved in the process as well defining the owner of each process stage in agreement with them. \n\nAchievement: \n- Led strategic meetings with stakeholders to identify actions to be performed at which stage of the process and mapped actions into an understandable format for all business stakeholders \n\u2013 High-level & zoomed-in views. -Developed from scratch crucial generic tools & templates for each process stage enabling stakeholders to get clarity on responsibilities and ensure ownership of projects. \n\nAchievement:\n- In 6 months time I worked closely with all department involved with Fintech integration management : Product, Procurement, Legal, Compliance, Support, Project, Finance & Tech and delivered a full on process for new partners screening, onboarding & management (including all templates). \n- These process have now been used across the business for the past 8 months and widely mitigated, increased our professionalism, efficiency and faster delivery while mitigating risks as process are accessible across the organisation instead of being own by a couple of individuals.\n- Building of our way of working for a new cross functional company department focussed on 3rd party integration & management : team member onboarding, team ceremonies & enforcement of process following.",
