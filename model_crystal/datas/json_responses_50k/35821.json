    "summary": "Key drivers for me are continuous learning and professional development. I am structured, accurate and result-driven in my work. In social interactions I am representative, extravert and professional. As a team member I often take the role of a visionary and a coordinator. One of my strengths is the ability to think abstractly and then visualize my ideas and make a plan how to achieve them. I take decisions based on logic and build my arguments based on facts, causes and consequences. Creating business value for the customer and the organization and searching the win-win outcome of any situation is what best describes me. ",
