    "summary": "Communication is one of the gifts I have received and developed. Inspiring people and research are a passion which I consider a privilege. For my entire life, my scientific background has intertwined with my holistic mindset naturally. \nIndeed, along my versatile career I have been strongly engaged in change, innovation, and learning. I have always believed in each individual\u2019s powerful potential to contribute to common well-being, and so in the need to facilitate self-awareness, empowerment, and joy. For this reason, one of my very first achievements has been being able to inject my positive energy into others and inspire them. \n\nMore and more, I have acknowledged and accessed my power, I have lived in the flow, with the aim of working with people and for people, to find out more and share more about being.\nOver time, I have taken on positions of great responsibility and trust that have allowed me and others to grow.\n\nI\u2019m a lifelong learner and an amazed traveler, and I love their feeling of expansion. My journey has been a learning adventure, full of marvelous teachers, experiences, and emotions.\nWorking with my talents has become a major part of my life. Besides being a choice of my personal path, my talents have expanded my vision as a researcher. While I have a strong research interest in lifelong learning, eLearning, open learning-research-education, personalised learning, and change management, my current research focus is on the unlimited potential of human beings and the mind-brain relationship, as a result of my mediumistic abilities and my latest co-initiative Stichting Lovefrequencies.\n\nI find research extremely rewarding, particularly in dynamic, flexible and international working environments that allow me to contribute effectively to the construction of a better future by applying my skills and by expressing my potential.",

The project investigated on how an aware adoption of ICT can contribute to improve the quality of teaching, in particular for students with special needs. Learning4All was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research, and included 7 research units (Politecnico di Milano \u2013 coordinator -, IMATI CNR di Genova and the Universit\u00e0 di Bari, di Bologna, di Perugia, del Salento and Politecnica delle Marche). \nA format to be implemented in a ubiquitous learning environment, the QRcode can meet different learning styles because it allows the student to enrich all paper-based contents with in-depth multimedia and multichannel learning materials. The QRcode format consists in the integration of paper-based and digital learning material through Quick Response (QR) code, aimed at facilitating personalised and flexible (anytime, anywhere) learning. Multimedia contents are coded by the teacher in QR code and are then easily accessible by a decoding software which is downloadable for free.\nThe QRcode format is potentially adaptable to all disciplines, favoring in this way the enhancement of interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, and was implemented in several learning experiences of English as a foreign language for different clusters, with good results: in February-June 2010 in three different scenarios (adult lifelong learners, in-service teachers and secondary school students) (Leone & Leo, 2011), in February-March 2011 with 4 classes of a secondary school and in March-April 2012 with 2 classes of a secondary school for surveyors (in an interdisciplinary module EFL \u2013 Building Construction). Further, the format was selected as element of techno-pedagogical innovation in the project Eureka (2012-2014), a network of 11 schools in Apulia, Italy, for the enhancement of curriculum continuity from middle into high school.",
