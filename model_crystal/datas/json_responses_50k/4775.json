    "summary": "My work focuses on understanding and informing how entrepreneurship & innovation can create the necessary systemic change not only for a sustainable economy but also one that is fair and inclusive. In this endaevour, I specifically look at understanding, including and amplifying the voices of people that are (or may otherwise be) neglected or overlooked. \n\nThis requires zooming in on everyday practices of people and zooming out by looking the larger systems in which these practices take place. Moreover, it requires engaged scholarship and participating in change as opposed to watching it at the sidelines.",

OSMARE focuses on the business models that have CSA integrated through the Vuna program. These business models are located in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. \n\nI am interested in studying the everyday entrepreneuring of smallholders in rural communities. Doing in-depth qualitative research is crucial, during which I am adopting practice theory as a lens in his research to create  space for inductive inquiry. At the same time I engage with smallholders, farmer organizations, private companies and other stakeholders by organizing capacity building activities with the aim to foster the resilience of the value chain and its actors.",

We first aim to understand what responsible innovation could mean in a business context, which is based on conceptual analyses and a systematic review of the literature. This is accompanied with exploratory empirical studies that aim to find out how social entrepreneurs manage the development of their innovations, and how public values are 'embedded' in their innovation outcomes.",

This workshop serves to make young professionals from all over the world familiar with different participatory systems-thinking tools. This helps these young professionals to take systems thinking into account when (re)designing their own impact plan for sustainability, which they will implement within their own organizations."
