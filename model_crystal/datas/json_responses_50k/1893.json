    "summary": "Cultural Experience Consultant \n\nI advise individuals, organizations, and companies on how to create and promote cultural experiences surrounding a specific content and for a specific audience. I help clients design immersive themed experiences, creating a story-line that is dramaturgically sound, and that is also culturally and historically minded. \n\nFor that I work closely both to scientists, historians and specialists, and to the creative teams, to produce authentic and engaging experiences that educate and inspire. With an architect background, I work for the last twenty years in the fields of theatre, cultural production and the visual arts, both in Amsterdam and abroad. In my advisory work, I research, consult with experts, compare and find solutions for creative teams to navigate the fine line between fantasy and scientific accuracy. I advise my clients and their teams on architecture, props, copywriting, tone of voice, and I can work directly with actors, grime and costume experts, film makers, graphic designers and prop builders. \n\nI have a passion for knowledge, craftmanship and hospitality, and my motto is \u201cnever underestimate the audience\u201d. My goal is to help clients creating meaningful and impactful experiences, delivering value to the audience and generating positive outcomes for the client.\n\nMy most challenging and rewarding project to date was Quake Lisbon, an Immersive Historical experience about the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. Opened in April 2022, it just won three important prizes: an Outstanding Achievement Thea Award - Historical Experience (AOA), 1st prize for Themed Environment at the Blooloop Innovation Awards and at the same event, the 3rd place in the category Innovative Storytelling.",

My position as a producer always involves some sort of participation in the artistic process, otherwise I find it not challenging enough. My work starts by participating in the conceptual definition of the project, goes through fund raising and subsidies application, and finishes into full-on production. I'm often part of the project itself, as a performer, a co-writer or a model. Reporting and finance are also of my responsibility.\n\nSome examples:\nBehind the Wall - international collaboration between visual artists Mijntje Strenghold (NL) and Roney George (BR). Exhibitions in Amsterdam (April 2015) and in Salvador, at the Museum of Modern Art of Bahia (January/February 2016). Project supported by the AFK, amongst others.\nLink for a review (in Portuguese): https://www.revistamuseu.com.br/site/br/noticias/nacionais/65-mam-atelier-estreia-com-projeto-behind-the-wall.html\n\nThe Author's Room - script development and installation in historical building in Amsterdam. Film maker Roberta Marques developed a treatment for 6 weeks between December 2018 and January 2019, having regular shows to small audiences of the work in progress, opening her author's room, her actual physical working place to accommodate the visitors. A final reading of the text, with the working title of \"Trade\",  was shown in January 2019. \n\nAfterimage - video and sound installation by light designer, Minna Tiikkainen, video maker Helle Lysh\u00f8j and visual / video / sound artist Susanna Brenner. Project developed in artists in residencies in Germany and in Belgium, with its grand public show happening in the summer of 2018, at the Stadschouwburg in Amsterdam, during the international dance festival Juli Dans.\nLink for a review (in Dutch): https://www.theaterkrant.nl/recensie/afterimage-i-ii-iii/susanna-brenner-helle-lyshoj-minna-tiikkainen/",
