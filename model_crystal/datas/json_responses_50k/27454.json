Firstly,  this paper will discuss the theory behind smoothing splines and how they can be adapted to construct self-evolving splines with the ability to update as new information is discovered by an autonomous agent. Secondly, this paper will discuss in detail how these self-evolving splines can be utilised for new methods of path planning, in particular, how these methods can be used to develop the software in self-driving vehicles. Further to this, this paper will show how Monte Carlo methods can be used effectively for evaluating the success of the path planning system. These evaluation methods will then be used to determine the ideal smoothing parameter of the self-evolving cubic smoothing splines.",

Following this, new research results will be presented. First, an array of numerical evidence will be introduced to support the Levy Flight Foraging Hypothesis. Further to this, upper and lower bounds for the connective constant of the Union Jack lattice will be implemented numerically. Additionally, a new method of analysis will be developed to study the Narrow Escape Problem. Lastly, an extension to the reinforced random walks will be constructed to link reinforced random walks to self-avoiding walks.",
