A second projected has been to review the global distribution set up for TP Vision (Philips TV) as stand alone organization. As a result of a study done a project has been started to reduce the European stock points from 11 (shared Philips stock points) to 5 European TP Vision (Philips TV) dedicated stock points. This project will end in Q1 2014.\nBoth projects have been executed in time and within the budget without significant operational disturbances. \nThe function is responsible for a budget of 65 million Euro, 31 direct reports and 12 functional reports.",
