    "summary": "I am an assistant professor in Statistics in the Department of methodology and statistics of the Faculty of Health Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML) at Maastricht University (NL).\n\nMy main interests are in Bayesian statistical modelling for cost-effectiveness analysis and decision-making problems in the health systems. During my PhD I have specifically focused on the study and adoption of Bayesian methods to handle missing data in health economic evaluations and to assess the impact of their uncertainty on the output of the decision-making process. My research area involves different topics: from systematic literature reviews, case study applications, survival analysis, meta-analytic methods, multilevel models and trial-based clinical and economic analyses.\n\nI have been involved in the design and analysis of randomised clinical trials data in different areas such as behavioural interventions (e.g. sexual and mental health), schizophrenia and psychosis, ophthalmology, dementia and Parkinson. I detain advanced software and programming skills in R and Bayesian software (e.g. JAGS/STAN) and good skills in other statistical software such as STATA and MatLab.",
