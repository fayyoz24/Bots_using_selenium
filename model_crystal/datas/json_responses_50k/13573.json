This involved actively participating in the process of writing RIVM-wide feedback reports, as well as organizing and attending 5-8 different focus groups. These activities were carried out with the overarching goal of contributing to developing a new policy agenda for pandemic preparedness.\n\n2. In line with my interest in global health, I performed tasks for our WHO Collaborative Centre for Infectious Disease. I conducted evaluations of tools for public health and social measures, compiled annual reports and contributed to the scoping of the health emergency governance framework.\n\n3. My passion for education drove me to lead, alongside a colleague, the designing and organizing of six seminars. These seminars were specifically tailored to facilitate knowledge expansion and skill-building for our team of newly arrived colleagues.",

On a daily basis, I provided supervision to a team of 2-8 nurses, who acted as the primary points of contact for institutions during outbreaks. However, in the case of large-scale or complex outbreaks, I coordinated the various teams involved and had a leadership role in outbreak management.\n\nFurthermore, I held the position of supervisor for a contact tracing team consisting of 20-40 employees, serving as their second point of contact. Beyond my clinical duties, I pursued my passion for innovation and education by designing and facilitating a series of workshops aimed at team-building and skill development. Additionally, I actively contributed to the internal policy team and played a key role in establishing a triage system.",
