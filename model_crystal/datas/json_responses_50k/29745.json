    "summary": "Second-year International Business student. My love for business and languages brought me to the Netherlands, more specifically to NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences. Here, I am currently working on my BBA in International Business. \n\nSo far this year, I had the opportunity to work on various projects in the areas of Supply Chain and Operations Management, Finance and Accounting, Organisation and People and Marketing and Sales. The most valuable lesson I have learned so far in my journey at NHL Stenden is to be a great communicator, as well as understand and take into consideration cultural differences. As I had not previously studied business outside of my free time, I enjoyed learning the basics of different fields. Furthermore, this helped me understand what business area I want to explore in my future career.  Additionally, I learned more about crucial current societal and psychological topics during \u201cBusiness transformers\u201d classes. \n\nMoreover, I completed projects on the aforementioned topics in groups for the whole year, through which I improved my leadership and teamwork skills. All the projects were executed in cooperation with actual companies, conveying real business knowledge to me.  \n\nThis year I also continued studying various languages; more specifically, I decided to broaden my knowledge of Spanish. I am also set on broadening my German skills. The following year, I will complete two semester-long projects, followed by a six-month study abroad period and another semester-long internship before embarking on my final year of study.",
