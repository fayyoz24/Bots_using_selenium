    "summary": "I discovered my love of Mechanics first in the third year of high-school. I just felt that all those kinematics and dynamics of a projectile sit smoothly in my mind. Since then, I have constantly been being educated in Mechanical Engineering, however, more following the fluid side.\nI know myself as an experimentalist researcher in fluid mechanics with expertise in heat transfer and microfluidics. During the course of my research studies both in my Master's degree and PhD, I have constantly been involved in instrumentation and fabrication through building versatile setups for my experiments. Notwithstanding, it is not limited to just hands-on jobs, and yet a lot of intellectual discussion on the results have tamed me as an academic expert in the field. Here it follows a snapshot of my experience in the field-recognised terminologies:\n1- Microfluidics\n2- Cryo-EM (Cryo-Electron Microscopy)\n3- Atomisation (Surface Acoustic Wave or SAW which is an Ultrasonic one)\n4- TEM sample preparation\n5- Protein deposition\n6- Cell spray\n7- Nano-biotechnology | Micro-biotechnology | Nanotechnology\n8- Microfabrication | Nanofabrication\n9- Nanofluid heat transfer\n\n",
