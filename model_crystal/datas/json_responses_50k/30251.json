    "summary": "I am a charismatic and self driven leader who is interested in an undergraduate degree in International Business. I have a passion to work and collaborate with people. I want to make a personal impact on the society and volunteered to teach kids in Nepal recently. \n\nI have good grades, and have been judged MVP in NCIS tournament where I excelled in various sports, encouraged and inspired my friends and teammates to achieve their best. I want to leverage my international living experiences (in 3 countries) and my multi-lingual abilities (fluent in 3 languages) to help International companies extend their reach globally and in a sustainable manner. \n\nI am very good with technology and designed and built my own computer (which I still use) at the age of 13. I am told that I am good at Excel and PowerPoint also.\n\nI am looking to join a school that will help me grow further, become a citizen of the world and provide me a platform to make an impact in the community as well as on the society as a whole. I graduate in 2023.",
