The use of Next was a big speed boost, it really streamlined the serverside rendering portion of development. \nThe real challenge here was state management, this is why I used reselect. The library reselect allowed me to keep strict uniform data structures that were then aggregated by \"selectors\". This made data easy to consume from a react component perspective.\nThe data was used to generate a word report from all of the data a user inputs. There were several exceptions and formats with unique table calculations making this very challenging. \n\nTech\n- React\n- Redux\n- Reselect\n- Next.js\n- Node\n- Firebase\n- Yarn\n- Jest",
