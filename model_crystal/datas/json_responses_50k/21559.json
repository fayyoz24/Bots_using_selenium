Saying that, she well deserves her score of 4 as she has worked tirelessly on delivering her scorecard. We now have excellent visibility of per client profitablity and each cluster is held tightly to account by the balanced scorecard program that Lynn has rolled out. She has also taken on additional duties this year, inc\nluding the administration of the Top 100 events. This particular event was a great success and she was acknowledged publically as being one of the drivers of its success. She has also taken the lead in arranging the quarterly reviews for our business and it would be fair to say that our effectiveness and cohesion as a leadership team has been greatly enhanced by her enthus\niasm and passion for the team. She has worked very hard to develop her network within NASCL and I have often leveraged this resource to get a feel for the morale of the team and for insight into any pressing/topical issues that I otherwise might not have visibility of. We have recently found a better fit for her senority and talent in a new role as Head of CL Client Management and we are greatly looking forward to seeing even more from Lynn in 2011.\tCharles Crawford\n\nDirect Manager: Charles Crawford, Director, Contract Logistics, Greater China Area at Agility",
