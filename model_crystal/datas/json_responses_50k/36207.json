    "summary": "I am a psychologist providing guidance to grassroots-driven processes for social change. To develop in a healthy way communities and societies must be inclusive, and no living being should be harmed or driven by fear. The focus of my work is on ownership and active citizenship for marginalized groups. Much of this experience was built up in Central- and South America.\n\nI also further these ideas in practicing judo and ju jitsu, and have trained athletes, teachers and referees throughout Latin America. I was a teacher of police and security personnel and, together with a colleague, I designed and facilitated a core training to field workers for providing Unarmed Civilian Protection with Nonviolent Peaceforce.\n\nI have a passion for doing on-the-ground research to inform policy making. To be useful research not only needs to be reliable. It must also be relevant and validated at the local level.\nI aim to contribute to the quality of life through societal systems that bring along social justice.\n\nAs an associate of the platform for action research Acci\u00f3n Andina (since 1993) I worked with multiple stakeholders to develop and promote policy guidelines. Among local partners were urban youth, neighborhood and farmer organizations, drug prisoners and municipalities. Together with the Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Organization for Migration we focused on return migration; with CRIES Argentina and the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict on learning from social conflict; and with research centers from San Sim\u00f3n University, Bolivia, and the Latin American CLACSO network on tackling violence and local unsafety.\n\nIn 2018-2019 I participated in the design of a research program on local violence and citizenship with the Centro de Estudios Sociales Universitarios in Cochabamba, Bolivia. I'm currently on sabbatical leave, accompanying my children who have chosen to live and study in the Netherlands.\n\n",
