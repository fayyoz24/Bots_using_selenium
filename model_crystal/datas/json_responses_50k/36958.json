    "summary": "Since June 2022 I have been working as a political advisor and advocacy officer at PAX for Peace, the biggest peace organisation in the Netherlands. My files include Israel-Palestine and the link between business and conflict. \n\nUntil June 2021 I was a policy officer at the European Institute of Peace (EIP), a conflict resolution and mediation organisation in Brussels. Here I worked with EU policy makers on integrating an understanding of the political economy of conflicts (such as the role of illicit financial flows, commodity traders etc.). into policy thinking on Sudan and South Sudan.",
