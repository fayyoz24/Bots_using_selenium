In order to reduce efficiencies, lack of coordination and the weak linkage between the seed and ware potato value chain farmers will be provided with improved agricultural practices, climate change adaptation and business development skills. In addition, investments will be made through the seed and potato value chain, such as storage, logistics, energy and access to finance. As a result, 20,000 potato farmers will increase their productivity by using clean seeds. Furthermore, the project will provide training, access to finance and create market opportunities by further developing the processing capacity.\n\nProject design and development.

The Agribusiness Capital Fund, or ABC Fund \u2014 with contributions from the European Commission, Luxembourg, Africa, Caribbean, and the Pacific group of states, and AGRA \u2014 seeks to mobilize about $240 million in private capital. The organisation recognized a lack of financing to build the types of businesses that will help rural communities process their crops and link them to markets and has created the ABC fund to address this issue.\n\nThe ABC Fund, which is managed independently by Bamboo Capital Partners in collaboration with Injaro Investments, provides loans of between $25,000 and $1 million to small businesses in order to address the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of finance between microfinance and commercial loans. \n\nTo ensure that the financing for these SMEs and cooperatives (direct financing) and financial institutions (indirect financing) has the desired impact on rural communities, IFAD has selected Agriterra to manage its Technical Assistance Facility. In a consortium with Rabo Partnerships, Agricord and Advance Consulting, Agriterra coordinates this TA facility.\n\nAs program manager I was responsible for the set-up of the TA facility, development of management procedures and first trials of combined due diligence and TA-assessment missions at SMEs and cooperatives in Ghana and Ivory Coast.",

Cooperatives are robust business entities that serve the interest of their members while adding value to agricultural produce and responding to market developments. In both domestic and international value chains cooperatives have the potential to reach economies of scale and through proper due diligence Agriterra's Great Lakes team has managed to partner with the 100 agricultural cooperatives with the highest growth potential in the Great Lakes Region.\n\nAgriterra's approach is geared towards making cooperatives bankable, by reinforcing three fundamental aspects of cooperative businesses: business development, governance and financial management. Currently we provide our advisory services to agricultural cooperatives in the value chains of horticulture, maize, coffee, dairy, rice, cassava and potatoes. Additionally we have partnered with cooperative banks to strengthen the ability of farmer organisations to access finance.\n\nSince 2016 we created a team of 25 professional business advisors and set up 5 offices in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo. We support congolese rice cooperatives supplying the Heineken brewery in Bukavu, we support coffee cooperatives in moving away from the commodity market and towards the specialty coffee markets in Europe and the USA, we are in multi-national consortia with players as DSM, SNV, IDH and Wageningen University and most importantly: we are making an impact on the lives of more than 100,000 farmers.",
