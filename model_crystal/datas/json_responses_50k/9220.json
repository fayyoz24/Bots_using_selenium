    "summary": "Jan Peter Bergen is an Assistant Professor in Philosophy at the University of Twente's philosophy department. His focus is on education, while also looking into the role of technology in the development of moral subjectivity and virtues. \n\nUntil recently, he combined this position with his responsibilities as a Lecturer in Ethics and Technology at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. Before that, he was a post-doctoral researcher in philosophy of technology at the University of Twente. Working on Prof. Peter-Paul Verbeek\u2019s VICI project on Theorizing Technological Mediation, he focused on the role of technology in conscious self-development and how to design such technologies in a more responsible manner.\nJan completed his PhD in ethics of technology at Delft University of Technology between March 2012 and December 2017. Generally speaking, his work is influenced by  20th century phenomenology and social theory, STS, philosophical pragmatism, and technology dynamics. For more recent activities, however, he has also drawn inspiration from liberal philosophy of law, value-sensitive design theory, and the philosophy and sociology of death.\n\nJan has a interdisciplinary educational background. He holds a Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree in Product Development from the University College of Antwerp. He also holds an MSc in Industrial Ecology from Leiden University. This study teaches an approach to sustainability problems from a systemic perspective, including the social, policy, environental and engineering sciences.",
