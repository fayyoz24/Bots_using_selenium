    "summary": "At University of Sussex, I studied sustainability impacts brought by economic activities including policy implementation and larger investments by both the private and the public sectors. \n\nAfter that master course I got the post as a London-based economic journalist. My coverage was economic policies, statistics and corporate analysis. Then I moved to Norway and became a part of Japanese Embassy in Norway as Special Advisor to Ambassador. It had a wide range of tasks from programme implementation to field studies but the primary duty was research on economic & ESG affairs notably policies & regulations set by the governments & central banks and the Norwegian pension fund. The Norwegian Pension fund is one of the largest investors in the world and well known for its sustainable investment with strict guidelines therefore I had some policy dialogue over its strategy regarding the markets and managed communication between Oslo and Tokyo as well as thematic and comprehensive research. \n\nAfter that, I played similar roles at American embassy and carried out several programmes as Sr. Analyst, ESG Sustainability Investment at London Stock Exchange Group. My responsibility extended from primary research including climate action modelling and scoring corporate ESG activities to engagement with giant corporates and public bodies. Specifically, the engagement includes comprehensive assessment on all E&S&G issues and advisory for implementation. \n\nNow I am Analyst at Transition Asia, an independent think tank, and am responsible for research and analysis on climate & energy, e.g. public & corporate policy, CDP, IEA & IPCC scenarios, industry-specific technical & operational solutions and etc as well as engagement with a variety of external stakeholders.",
