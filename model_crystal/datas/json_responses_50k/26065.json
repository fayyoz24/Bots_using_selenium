    "summary": "Choosing to study Global Project and Change Management with a Business Administration BA, gives me the chance to develop in areas as globalization in all its forms, digitalization, culturalization, and economical aspects, that affect a good number of nations across the world.\nThe idea of pursuing the fields I chose is combined to my long-standing aspiration of someday being able to get back to the world. As the it evolves, international aspirations evolve as well, with new trends and dynamics and trough my study fields I want to keep up learning and protecting people\u2019s rights, developing and working, propping up a positive change in the world. Therefore, joining development programmes and organizations of the like in the future is what I aim in the long run, so I can put to test the abilities I have been developing over the years and use the technical and academic skills obtained during the degree and experience to come.\nWhen it comes to my personal experience, I am happy to have participated and actively contributed up until now in volunteering organizations and events, like GoCamp Ukraine and Happy Faces Ighiu Romania, the Green Reghin Initiative, Let\u2019s Do It Romania and also being an Event coordinator in Amnesty Zwolle studentgroup board, where I learned that knowledge is a priceless process, so every chance we have to learn a bit more of what surrounds us and beyond should be taken with praise and commitment. It gratefully satisfies me knowing that someone's life may improve a bit more because of what I might have done to fight contemporary problems.\nHereupon, added to the existing experience I have acquired, I have also been recurrently working with groups of children and older students, as a Math tutor for over 3 years, which has given me the chance to connect with people and understand their perspectives and concerns in society as a whole. And, at last but not least, I have also worked in the finance industry, providing support as a data entry and validation operator which allowed me to bolden a different set of skills. Currently, I am doing a Data Analytics course, gaining more knowledge on fields that are connected with my degree and having access to better opportunities.",
