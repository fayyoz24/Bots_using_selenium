    "summary": "Construction leader with a broad range of personal and professional interests.\n15+ years of experience in construction and development, leading a diverse range of projects including from-scratch, large scale retail developments, universities, mining camps and refurbishments. I am skilled at managing and executing on multiple large scale projects, from $2M to $15M+, from initial conception through to completion of construction.  In addition to operational excellence, I bring strong commercial and financial acumen, connecting construction projects to broader business outcomes. \n\nI'm an Australian citizen living in the Netherlands since 2017, having originally moved to support my partner's career aspirations.  Over the course of the last 6 years, I've taken time away from the construction industry to support family and pursue personal and business interests in the fitness space.  I'm an avid Cross fit athlete with multiple coaching certifications, and and currently run and own a gym business in Amsterdam.  I've continued to cultivate my personal interest in the construction and development space, have kept up my builders license for small projects in Australia, and am open to opportunities in the construction industry.",
