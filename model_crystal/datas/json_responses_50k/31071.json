Focusing on New Zealand and assuming that the news sentiment between the two countries can improve predictive accuracy, a new dataset involving migration flow and the news sentiment was constructed. The Statistics Department of New Zealand was used to extract the number of arrivals and the GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) database was used to extract the news sentiment. Additionally, the sliding time window approach suitable for time-series data was used to construct the temporal features. Based on this, six supervised machine learning algorithms were developed to predict monthly relative changes in arrivals to New Zealand two months ahead. ",
