    "summary": "Passion for impact trough data driven insights. \nHave experience and I am open to work as a web analyst, data analyst, business intelligence specialist, data translator and database marketeer. \nMy main tools are: Python, R, Pyspark, DataBricks, SQL, Adobe Analytics, GA, BigQuery, powerBI, Selligent, SAS and my creativity.\n\nAs an econometrics graduate I started out my career as data scientist; developing prediction models in order to prevent churn and/or to smarter acquire new customers. In the process of developing models, gathering the data, visualizing it, doing a quick stare and glare in order to understand it and the creating the model, I noticed that most impact could already be made when the data was nicely gather visualized, understood and discussed with the stakeholders. That made shift a little bit from Data Science - a field that I still love - towards data or web analyst. \n\nImpact is usually made by a changing that either impacts the client or an internal process, or both. So I worked closely together with Conversion optimization specialists, Customer journey specialists and lean six sigma consultants. As a data translator I can make the bridge between the business problem, a possible solution and how data can help prioritize and/or find optimizations in either a customer journey a marketing channel or an internal process. For example; embedding personalization in the marketing channel, automating a process or \n \nAs a business intelligence specialist I like not only create the data in the backhand or visualize the data in the front end, but also discuss the insights with the stakeholders. How do they read the dashboard and what changes do they make based upon what they see. So I can tailor the dashboard really to the stakeholders needs and as a data specialist I know what other data sources might be interesting to onboard and combine with the current insights.",

The main focus was on maximizing the number of students enrolled in the school program and ensuring their graduation and thus also minimizing the drop rate. \nThis was done by:\n\u2022\tOrganizing fun events for school going children only\n\u2022\tSetting up a place to study\n\u2022\tExpanding the cyber caf\u00e9\n\u2022\tTeaching children to work with computers \n\u2022\tSetting up a day care so older siblings don\u2019t have to skip school to babysit. \nBut also women empowerment programs to make the mothers more aware of the importance of education so they will support the children more.\n\nDuring this internship I also helped MUYOG expand by raising funds online, assisting with the construction of ten small shops they can rent out to little entrepreneurs and I even helped MUYOG out a couple times with collecting the garbage in the area, which is a small side program they have to generate income to finance their projects.",

The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) asses every new treatment on clinical and economic evidence in order to recommend the new treatment for reimbursement or not. I quantified every information on every submitted treatment between 2006 and 2013 in a dataset and used this dataset to analyze the decision process. The key aspects were identifying the most promising variables and finding what the effect of the important variables were on the probability of getting recommended for reimbursement.\n\nDuring my time with Pharmerit I also worked two months on a internal project where I joined a project team with whom I did a elaborate cost-effective analysis for a new treatment for multiple myeloma.",
