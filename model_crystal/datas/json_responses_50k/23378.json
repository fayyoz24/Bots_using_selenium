    "summary": "- Serial entrepreneur, founder of two AdTech companies. Developed organisations from 1 to 75 employees.\n- Won awards for innovation (Econsultancy.com), growth (Red Herring) and entrepreneurship (E&Y Finalist).\n- Recently obtained a BSc in Psychology, cum laude. Starting 2nd career to help improve mental healthcare.\n\nAfter twenty years as an AdTech entrepreneur, I've pivoted my career towards improving the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. The greatest threat to our wellbeing is chronic life stress, and work is the most common source of chronic life stress. This makes work the perfect environment to target wellbeing improvement. \n\nProviding private mental healthcare is a win/win for companies and employees. Not only are chronically stressed employees more likely to suffer mental illness, but they are also more likely to become physically ill. In contrast, happy employees are more productive,  make fewer mistakes and are less likely to switch companies. \n\nLike many entrepreneurs, I have lived-experience with how being neuroatypical can be good for business but bad for wellbeing. I also have extensive real-world experience attracting, retaining, and motivating the best talent for my start-ups. Creating an attractive company culture is crucial for achieving 3x annual growth. This requires a light-hearted approach that puts people before profits and offers ways to reduce and relieve stress. I've added to this expertise with my recently completed BSc in Psychology. Now I am looking to apply this at a scale-up or in a corporate environment. \n\nI am especially interested in working with organizations with similar values, such as b-corps or those looking to cultivate neurodiversity. I like to understand things from first principles, so I'm seeking hands-on opportunities to build experience with organizational psychology from the ground up. I offer excellent interdisciplinary skills, including sales, marketing, product development, recruitment, finance and software engineering if you have an opportunity. \n\nMy other interests include men\u2019s mental health, stigma, addiction, burnout, and digital wellbeing. If you are interested in any of these topics, it would be great to hear from you.",
