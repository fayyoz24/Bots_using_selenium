    "summary": "Ever since I was little, I loved to tell stories. I still remember waking up in the morning and the first thing I wanted to do was to talk and tell stories. \nIt was also no surprise there for that I got my first job at the age of 15 as a TV presenter/host and producer in a regional TV station. A job I would have for 5 years and which would be my introduction to television production. \nMy duties included but were not limited to introduce and keep the programme flowing, interview guests and generally \u201cdrive the show\u201d. I was also responsible for writing and rehearsing scripts. \nThis experience shaped me into the person I am now as it taught me how to effectively communicate both in front of the camera and behind the camera. I can always find a way to tell a story.\nI got the chance to work off-camera and was delighted that I got to tell stories but in a more in-depth manner working with international non-governmental organizations such as UNICEF and SNV- Netherlands Development Organisation. \nI saw that there was a gap in the content that was being generated in Tanzania and after taking a Acting for Film and Television course at the New York Film Academy, I executive produced, wrote and acted in Tanzania's first web-series, Kitendawili. \nKitendawili, which was published on YouTube and heavily promoted on social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) gathered over 40,000 view to date. This was my first self-funded production and I must say it gave me a practical lesson on the value of a production day!\nSince then I\u2019ve been working on various productions, both on-screen and off-screen throughout East Africa.\nI have applied the same love for telling stories in television into my work in the NGOs by using the stories (case studies) gathered from the NGO work and turning them into audio-visual content. \n\nProfessional skills:\n1. Confident communicator and presenter \n2. Writing skills (press releases, key note speeches, scripts)\n3. Creative- concept creation and pitching\n4. Strong leadership presence and interpersonal skills with the ability to influence and motivate people at all levels across a broad variety of job functions\n5. Excellent organizational skills to juggle many tasks without losing sight of the highest priority items and a desire to create and build new processes to enable organizational efficiencies\n6. Ability to understand complex concepts and work across multiple functions and teams\n7. Self-motivation and drive. Ability to work well independently and within a group setting to push projects to completion.\n8. Social media marketing skills",
