    "summary": "Remember that game 'I spy'? I used to play it with my sister in the back of the car. The game didn't last long though. After I guessed \"cow\" correctly, my sister would give up after a few attempts of guessing what I had spied. \"You're making it too difficult!\" she said.  She was right. My little eye didn't spy for trees, windmills and animals. I spied for text, colours, imagery and logos on company busses that would flash by. They were imprinted in my brain like pictures. Maybe that\u2019s where my passion for communication & design started.    \n\nI love marketing, I love design, and my inner-nerd loves data and development. Most of all I love bridging the gaps between these disciplines. I'm not your woman if you're looking for someone who can get 'over the moon enthusiastic' when hearing the word SEA. However, if you are looking for someone who truly knows how to reach and engage your audience via data analysis, brand building, creative online campaigns and concepts - I'm the digital-savvy one for you. Take a peek at my profile below and don't hesitate to invite me over for a cup of coffee or tea.",

Because Vlisco feels women should remain in the spotlight for longer than just one day, it celebrates Women\u2019s Month: a tribute to women in West- and Central Africa. During the month of March, women in Nigeria, Ghana, DRCongo, Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo are nominated for their efforts to make a positive impact on their community and environment. Also, during this month female fashion entrepreneurs get the chance to pitch their business plan in order to win funding for realising their fashion dream. To support this campaign a website was needed where the nominees and their stories could be presented, where people could vote for their favourite nominee and where the fashion entrepreneurs could pitch their business plan and upload their portfolio. During the project, I was the Product Owner and Scrum Master and collaborated closely with the content manager and marketing & e-commerce director at Vlisco and freelance developers. My tasks during this project included: concept development, translation of the concept into briefings, UX design, content creation and curation, testing, planning and budgeting.",

Firstly, I carried out tasks such as target audience analyses, competition and product research and writing a business case. Secondly, this was concept development, in which I developed concepts for websites, apps, presentations, brand identities, posters, flyers, banners, etc. Thirdly, this was the implementation of these concepts or the technical realization of it. A final aspect was the evaluation of these concepts, such as usability research and feedback to the customer.",
