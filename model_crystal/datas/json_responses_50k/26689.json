    "summary": "My great interest is the combination of communication skills and technical knowledge. In addition, having worked and studied in three completely different continents, I value intercultural teams and diverse mindset, which enables me to adapt to new environments and learn from different methods. \n\nThe alignment between my technical background studies together with all commercial functions I was exposed to (sales, contract management, procurement and cost estimating) gives me a holistic understand of project requirements and provides me with the right experience to overcome business challenges.",
