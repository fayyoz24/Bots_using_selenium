Most important business goal was a completely autonomous operation for local teams and their agencies to upload the latest assets into the DAM, whilst having a coherent upload approach across divisions and their markets.\n- Creating a user-friendly search portal in which marketing-, digital-, and brand teams automatically have access through SSO, which also matches their profile data with the usage rights of the assets to determine if downloading and reusing the asset is allowed. The current user base is more than 12,000 users per month.\n- Established the direct connection of DAM with 3rd party PIM, E-commerce, Email and Website platforms to ensure DAM becomes the single source of truth for Danone's visual assets.\n- Centralising the development of new components for Adobe Experience Manager Sites across 13 different markets to have a lower development cost per market. Organising monthly calls to facilitate generation of new ideas and deciding on priorities as a group. Secured global budget for the development as well.\n- Defined new ways of working with our local markets and Global IT on how we can efficiently work together with local agencies on one single platform and codebase without interference.\n- Launched and accelerated the use of Adobe Target for testing and personalisation of the content in Danone's websites. Also connected Target directly with our customer identity and access management tool to ensure we reuse the profile data for segmenting audiences effectively. \n- Supporting in defining the requirements and approach for the migration towards Adobe AEM Cloud.",
