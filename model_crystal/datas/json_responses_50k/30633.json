But it was much more than just another school-based project.\n\nKUMA presents a revolutionary and innovative product for snowboarders. As a team and based upon input from potential customers and our personal experiences, we have \u2018in-house\u2019 designed and developed the CUB\u2122. \nThe CUB\u2122 is a high quality, innovative and safe method to transporting one\u2019s snowboard comfortably on and around the slopes. \n\nI am extremely proud that KUMA was selected out of approximately one thousand higher educational institutions to win the coveted title of \u201cStudent Company 2017\u201d in The Netherlands. By winning this title we had the opportunity to participate in the JA Europe Enterprise Challenge, held on 28-29th June, Helsinki, Finland. \n\nAt this international event KUMA competed against nineteen other teams from sixteen European countries. We had the opportunity to pitch our ideas and our innovative product the CUB\u2122. Although we did not win the JA Europe Enterprise Challenge, I feel privileged to have had another amazing team experience. Participating in this exciting event provided me and my teammates with great new learnings.",
