    "summary": "\u27a1 Who's Mike\n\n\u2705 Passionate leader - with years of experience in business development, marketing, and operations. \n\u2705 Proven track record - of developing and motivating high-performance teams to reach organizational objectives while ensuring customer satisfaction. \n\u2705 Adept in driving growth - and developing innovative strategies for success. \n\u2705 Building strong relationships - with stakeholders and customers. \n\u2705 Challenger of the status quo - energized and prioritizer. \n\nI chase my dreams, seek challenges and enjoy every moment. I strive to achieve my goals by working hard and continuously developing myself on both a personal and professional level. In my team management I aim to inspire people by converting dreams into a concrete vision.\n\nI have traveled the world myself and now do this with my family. I keep fit with indoor football and squash. You can find me in the snow in the winter and at our beach house in the summer.\n\nWhatever I do, enjoyment is essential!\n\n\n\u27a1 Career \n\n\u2705 Gained international experience due to my successful studies in Africa, America and Asia. Furthermore, I have worked abroad in Austria and traveled South America. \n\u2705 Published my first business book globally after successfully writing a marketing strategy for the World Cup Football in South Africa, 2010. \n\u2705 Currently owning my own E-Academy platform. I help entrepreneurs to grow their business by increasing the conversation rate from lead to customer. The business owners I train do have leads from their socials and website yet, those leads do not actually convert into a customer. With my course, they quickly improve their skills to get more customers and truly start converting to scale their business. \n\u2705 About to publish my newest book in 2023, in cooperation with publisher Bookboon Learning. \n\u2705Although my career has my primary focus, I strive to devote time for other activities; for I believe that broad interests are the key to creating a successful environment. Hence, I have committed myself as a volunteer to several charity organizations.  \n\n\n\u27a1 Specialties;\n\n\u2705 Management (Team & Product)\n\u2705 Sales (B2B & B2C)\n\u2705 Strategy (Business Development)\n\u2705 Operations (Service & Support)\n\u2705 Marketing (Online & Offline)\n\u2705 Budget\n\u2705 Recruitment\n\u2705 Cultural differences\n\n\n\u27a1 Do you have opportunities to which I could add value?

Marketing Strategy: World Cup products recommendations \t\nAuthor:\tMike Heijstek\nRelease date:\tJanuary 2010\nISBN-NR.:\t978-3-8383-4120-0\nPublisher:\tLAP-Lambert, Academic Publishing\nDistribution:\tWorldwide \n\n\nDuring my internship in Cape Town, South Africa; I was asked to design a marketing strategy. The company wished to benefit from the World Cup Football which was hosted in South Africa and Cape Town. It was my job to advice the company about how to benefit optimally from the event. I had four main tasks:\n\n1. Customer/ market research: Who is coming to the world cup? What people, where do they stay, how much money do they spend, where are they interested in? Etc.\n  \n2. Find out what products were popular during previous World Cups. In short: how money was made.\n\n3. What was the city Cape Town as well as the country South Africa doing in order to host the event perfectly? This included aspects such as infrastructure, accommodation and transportation. However; I was also in contact with the local government, the FIFA, the stadium director, television channels and the popular V&A Waterfront manager. Basically, all facets of importance.\n\n4. The most important task: How can the previous three points be combined, together with the unique circumstances of Cape Town and South Africa to deliver a \u2018custom made\u2019 plan. It had to contain a marketing strategy about how the company could benefit from the event as well as product recommendations had to be included.\n\nI had to think about new products that could benefit the company. The current products were not of importance, however, the central location of the company was.\n\nAfterwards, in cooperation with LAP Publishing, I have published the report as a book internationally.",
