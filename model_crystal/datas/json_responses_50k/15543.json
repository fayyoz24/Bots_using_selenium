    "summary": "As an AI innovator with international experience, I have driven cutting-edge advancements in business and education. My company AI Horizon offers R&D services and expert consultations to help SMEs build scalable AI products and teams. At NHL Stenden, I set up projects that bring together highly skilled AI researchers, students, and SMEs to tackle exciting challenges in computer vision and data science.\n\nIn my past roles as Head of AI teams for companies in London, UK and Abu Dhabi, UAE, I combined core AI work with business administration, pitching to clients and investors, and contract writing. Under my guidance, AI projects have explored topics such as recommendation systems, training LLMs synthetic data generation, MLOps pipelines, autonomous drone control, and various CV and NLP applications.\n\nMy research interests span beyond AI to intersect with robotics, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, biology, and physics. My PhD work at the University of Groningen - and postdoc at the Oxford University - is on guidance and control in aerial hunting by raptors. I built simulations of bird flight to examine why raptors in general, and peregrine falcons in particular, should choose to use the spectacular, risky, and extraordinarily challenging attack behavior of stooping to catch their prey. In the simulations, I combine detailed kinematic and aerodynamic modelling with modelling of the vision, guidance, dynamics, and control of both raptor and prey (using deep learning and nonlinear optimization). The aim is to reverse engineer the attacking falcon in order to engineer autonomous drones that use bio-inspired controls, or even robot falcons that can be used to chase away birds from airports. \n\nSynthetic data is a key technology in todays AI world. I have experience in this field since 2013: back then, my master's thesis was on the role of large computer graphics databases (synthetic data) as training data for biologically-inspired deep neural networks used for image and video classification, under the supervision of Thomas Serre at Brown University.\n\nAs a recommendation systems expert, I go beyond conventional approaches. Rather than relying solely on embeddings and graphs, I leverage open-source pretrained models and public APIs to build a model farm as food for a generative home-grown network. Through a unique training scheme, this network distills knowledge across verticals, consented clients, and users. With this network, I aim to optimize complete webshops, creating highly personalized and effective recommendations for each user.",
