We sampled a few university faculties, medical labs, and pharmaceutical companies, observed workflows, and interviewed people, concluding that many concepts had been considerably misused in the implementation. For example, p-hacking was not uncommon in research labs without a professional biostatistian. We also noticed that classical statistics was far from sufficient for practice, and Baysian statistics and nonparametric statistics are greatly in need.\n",
