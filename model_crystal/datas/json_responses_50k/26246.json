    "summary": "I am a Scottish-Irish biomedical scientist with a flair and passion for foreign languages seeking to empower and sustain avant-garde biomedical innovation for a healthier, more equitable world. \n\nI am skilled at guiding and supporting talented academics in the preparation of competitive personal excellence grants. Specifically, I have written, coordinated, and reviewed multiple ERC as well as NWO proposals spanning life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences. My strengths comprise project conceptualisation, strategic CV assessment, proposal construction, and the delivery of tailored grant interview training sessions. My experience therefore spans the full gamut from pre-award idea generation through to proposal development and beyond. \n\nAdditionally, I am experienced in managing large scientific and clinical research consortia and coordinating the development of EU and national research proposals involving multiple partners from diverse countries and backgrounds.",

                    "description": "Thesis defended 13th December 2018. My research focused on identifying novel drug targets and synergistic combinations for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a virulent subtype of breast cancer with a dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. In particular, the work centred on reversing resistance of TNBC cells to EGFR inhibitors. High-throughput kinase inhibitor library-based screens were utilised to evaluate the potential of novel targeted agents in a panel of TNBC cell lines and subsequently identify TNBC-specific genetic dependencies using siRNA-based screening. The signal transduction pathways perturbed by drug treatment were delineated and subsequently scrutinised using transcriptomic profiling and western blotting. The impact of drug treatment or gene silencing on cell death, proliferation, cell cycle progression and migration was assessed simultaneously. This work demonstrated that TNBC cell lines resistant to both MEK and Akt inhibitors are sensitive to disruption of CDK function. Additionally, it revealed that novel CDK inhibitors with strong activity against P-TEFb/CDK9 are highly effective against TNBC cells as single agents and in combination with multiple targeted therapies. These agents provoked profound down-regulation of multiple oncogenic pro-proliferative pathways, the silencing of which was detrimental to TNBC cell proliferation, thus defining several genes as potential future drug targets. These results were regularly discussed and presented at both internal and external conferences, including the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2017 in Washington D.C. and the KWF Cancer Biology Meeting 2017. Throughout my doctoral studies, I accrued increasing levels of responsibility and autonomy, being responsible for driving my own research forward but also for ensuring the successful and meticulous long-term education of multiple BSc and MSc students.",
