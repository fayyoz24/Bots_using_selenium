Besides, I am a big fan of historical architecture, especially about the projects that give new life to old buildings. Traveling is my hobby and Japan and Europe are my two favorite destinations. It made me humble and cherish of what I have via traveling across Europe and access to abundant history/culture, amazing people and stunning architecture.\n\n\u5f9e\u5c0f\u71b1\u611b\u68d2\u7403\uff0c\u5152\u5b50\u4e94\u6b72\u6642\u4fbf\u52a0\u5165\u68d2\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u65e2\u662f\u8208\u8da3\u4e5f\u662f\u78e8\u7df4\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u68d2\u7403\u5df2\u6210\u70ba\u7236\u5b50\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8a9e\u8a00\u3002\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u559c\u611b\u5bcc\u6709\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u53f0\u7063\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u5916\uff0c\u65c5\u5c45\u6b50\u6d32\u9019\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u5efa\u7bc9\u4e4b\u65c5\uff0c\u8c50\u5bcc\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u548c\u8996\u91ce\uff0c\u6b77\u53f2\u9762\u524d\u6211\u5011\u986f\u5f97\u5982\u6b64\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u66f4\u61c2\u5f97\u73cd\u60dc\u8207\u8b19\u865b\u3002\n\nHome is where the heart is.
