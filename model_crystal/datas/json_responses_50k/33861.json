    "summary": "I am committed to a vision in which children, adolescents and adults with immune-mediated behavior and neuropsychiatric conditions obtain a timely diagnosis from informed, compassionate providers and receive individualized, transdisciplinary treatment and support regardless of where they live. In my advocacy, I seek creative and collaborative ways to achieve this vision. The skills and experiences I bring to my leadership roles were developed as a legislative assistant, as the executive director of a non-profit organization benefitting at-risk youth, and as an urban planner. What I enjoyed most in those roles, and what serves me well in my advocacy, is bringing together a broad range of stakeholders and experts to work creatively and collaboratively to solve complex issues. I enjoy the opportunity to meet interesting and talented people, to learn from them, and to create opportunities for positive change. The experience of living in the United States, Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands has been an asset in my work within an international organization. I feel fortunate to have experienced different cultures and the opportunities  to connect and form friendships and professional relationships with people of many nationalities.",

It simultaneously supports and energizes those who practice the approach by providing a sound framework, on which they can rely, to cultivate the best possible version of those with whom they come into contact.  It provides a skill set and increased confidence that allows those practicing it to address even severe, aggressive and violent behavior. -- Behavior that can be caused by a variety of factors including brain inflammation that causes neuroimmune disorders such as PANS/PANDAS. According to Kiki Chang, a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist specializing in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders, \u201cWe can\u2019t say how many kids with psychiatric symptoms have an underlying immune or inflammatory component to their disorder, but given the burgeoning research indicating that inflammation drives mood disorders and other psychiatric problems, it\u2019s likely to be a large subset of children and even adults diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses.\u201d (Source: Brain Attack, Stanford Medicine, Fall 2014).  The Nurtured Heart Approach\u00ae has much to offer anyone and everyone, but, I believe, particularly parents navigating their child's complicated healing journey from PANS/PANDAS.",
