    "summary": "As a person and professional, I am deeply interested in Wildlife Conservation, reason why I pursued a career in Biology and a Master's in Wildlife Health and Conservation. I particularly possess extensive experience in bird monitoring techniques, both in my home country (M\u00e9xico) and abroad (USA, Norway, Republic of Georgia), as birds are one of my evidently favorite species groups. Furthermore, I am very interested in the impact of human activities and beliefs on Wildlife.\n\nI have experience in Environmental impact assessment, mostly related to the impact of renewable energy facilities (wind and solar farms) on wildlife, which includes but is not limited to: project management, fieldwork coordination, logistics, fieldwork in remote locations, wildlife surveys (birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals), data analysis, elaboration of reports/studies (MIA, ETJ, prefactibilidad) (English and Spanish), photography, direct contact with a variety of stakeholders, among others.  In addition, I have also supported Social studies and coordinated several Due diligences to assess the feasibility of renewable energy projects in M\u00e9xico.\n\nAlso as part of my job experience, I have performed environmental education activities, created social media posts (conservation-related), organized educational/environmental events, created and given presentations, participated in virtual scientific conferences, worked with indigenous communities, worked successfully in a multicultural environment (people from many backgrounds and nationalities), mentored BSc students in conservation projects, conducted scientific research and proofread documents (English and Spanish).",
