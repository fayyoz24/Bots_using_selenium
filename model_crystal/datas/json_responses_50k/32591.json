    "summary": "Although I am currently working as an educator, and to my sincere satisfaction so, I am never just one thing. I am a storyteller at heart yet I am also a journalist, an interviewer, a writer, a historian, a team player, a researcher and, indeed, a teacher. I thoroughly enjoy teaching and I believe in education as a meaningful proces of interaction in which many good things can happen on top of the transfer of knowledge and experience and the discovery and development of talents and personal skills.  \n\nAs an educator I appear in variety of guises. First of all, as a lecturer who explains aspects of communication processes and the skills and ethics that come with the exercise of professionalism in communication related jobs. Second, as a coach who monitors the discovery and development of professional skills on the part of students who work on individual or group assignments, regardless whether these concern first year efforts or graduation assignments. Thirdly, as a developer of novel lessons, courses and subjects to help keep programs up to speed with developments in a broad and dynamic labor market. Finally, I am a part of a team of educators who, together as well as alone, work tirelessly to offer programs to students that are interesting, useful, stimulating and fun to follow. \n\nI believe that careers are rarely linear tracks. At least, not consciously so. We live our lives in full interaction with slow and fast changing circumstances and try to make the most of opportunities and necessities while we enjoy them or complain about them, hardly or partly aware of the full impact of our own attitudes on what is to come next. Having grown up in a family of educators, I find myself now doing exactly that which I did not want to do for a long time yet have been quite familiar with all my life. Perhaps life is ironic in such things. Or perhaps not just so much. Either way, I pave my own way forward.   ",

The University Council meets in monthly cycles with the Executive Board of the University to discuss a wide range of policy issues. The Council has a number of rights in co-decision-making, such as advisory rights and the right of consent. The university's annual budget, for instance, requires the explicit consent by the Council. \nIn 2013 I was re-elected for a second term. In 2015 I decided not to run again as my PhD contract would expire and I had not decided on any new position at the University. On the Council I have addressed a variety of topics, besides affairs of both bursary and employee PhD's, such internationalization, language policies, student housing, animal testing, the reports of the University Confidential Advisor and, currently, the plans to start a branch campus in Yantai, China.",
