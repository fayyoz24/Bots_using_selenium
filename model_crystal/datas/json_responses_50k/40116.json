    "summary": "24 years of experience in a Global Organization (McCain Foods) servicing the operational business units with IT support in the broadest context for the first 15 years. And after that, worked on Master Data Governance and Management processes. And now joining a global Data & Analytics team in our journey to become a more 'data driven' company.\n\nI managed to build long term relationships in a challenging environment were business colleagues expecting IT solutions in a company structure were IT solution development/sourcing is managed by a Global IT team located in Canada (Florenceville) needing to deliver in to business units 'around the world'. Managing expectations from business colleagues and making sure there needs are well heard and responded to by the overall IT group requires a wide range of skills (hard and soft). In this role I've been exposed to many different business processes and learned a lot about how McCain is operating. \n\nAnd after our global SAP implementation in 2013, I shifted focus from IT systems towards Master Data Goverance/Management as it became clear that without quality master data, automation of business processes and ability to easily gain insights about those processes is a challenge. Not even speaking about using the data for more advanced type of Analytics.\n\nI had the opportunity to travel the world as part of the McCain family and I am grateful for that. It been tough sometimes but I wouldn't have missed it.\n\nIn september 2022 I've joined the ZorgSaam Group. A new environment with a hospital and centers for elderly care and home care teams. The challenge of closing the gap, or at least not let it further grow, between the need for care in a quickly aging population and the capacity to keep up with that need using new (data) technology is huge. There's a lot to gain and the organization has made digitalization to support the care processes one of the priorities. I am pleased to be part of the team driving the change.\n\nCompetences: People Manager and Team Builder. Honest, open, straight forward and finding ways to get things done. Strong soft skills resulting in fast (working)relationship building and sustaining those. And with 'a passion for data'. Service oriented.",
