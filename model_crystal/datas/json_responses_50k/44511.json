This means that I coordinate all sorts of activities (e.g. communication, training, data migration and testing) in order to make sure the implementation of the new database will occur without any problems, as well as searching for support of other businesses on requirements we want to see fulfilled in future releases. \n\nThe last few months I became a Project Lead for a data alignment project. The newly implemented database has interfaces with other systems and the data between them was not aligned. To do so involved a lot of stakeholder management, patience and solid Shell specific IT knowledge.\n\nBoth roles mainly focus on process and change management, but also required solid knowledge on Shell specific IT.",
