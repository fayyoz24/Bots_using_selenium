    "summary": "Nothing you have ever done is wasted. You just haven\u2019t found how it all connects yet. \nAs a poet, a writer, a speaker and a trainer, I am always on the lookout for the links and connections that open new vistas of possibility. The world is changing faster than ever before and many of us have lost that ability to look around instead of only down or ahead. \n \nMy mission in life is to make the world a better place by helping people and teams discover their inherent creativity and by doing so, become better at navigating change, coming up with ideas and seizing control of their futures. \n \nHow do I do this?\n\u2606 Help people understand what creativity is, and how it works. \n\u2606 Equip people with a range of tools and techniques that help them tap into their own inherent creativity. \n\u2606 Teach people how to ideate, imagine, plan, and problem-solve. \n\u2606 Ask people to reject the assumptions and opinions of others and rebel against the socialization they have undergone. This allows them to paint new pictures and tell new stories. \n\u2606Invite people to stop accepting things as they are and start creating spaces where change becomes possible.\n \nI write books and poems, run a podcast and deliver workshops and keynotes. Our creativity capacity is what makes us human.\nRight now, we need more humanness in the world.\n \nIntrigued? Interested? Or plain nosy? Hit the connect button, drop me a line at david@davidchislett.com, or book a free call, to discover how I can help you uncover your creativity, and learn how to use it in structured, repeatable, and useful ways.",
