Schalkwijk\n\nDuring my PhD project my main goal was to elucidate the role of the glycation precursor methylglyoxal in the development of diabetic microvascular complications. By making use of a transgenic rat glyoxalase-1 overexpression model I was able to decrease diabetes-induced glycation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and nephropathy. Furthermore, I extended the use of glyoxalase-1 to prevent glycation in the field of atherosclerosis, arteriogenesis and myocardial infarction. I also participated as a tutor and examiner in several courses of the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences.",
