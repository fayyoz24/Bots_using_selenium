    "summary": "Thank you for taking an interest into my profile! My name is Gino, living in Rotterdam with a huge interest in international sales and logistics. \n\nAs a young kid I developed a certain sense and interest in languages - hence my interest in working within the international field. I further developed this by means of studying International Business and Languages (Bachelor) & International Supply Chain Management (Master of Science). Among other things I discovered a certain passion for interacting with people and making connections. This is something I applied throughout my working career as a sales executive, where former colleagues highly valued me for my passion, determination and perseverance. Some might say that I am very talented in creating a favourable position for myself due to my \"like-ability\". These values are furthermore reflected in my school career, where I managed to successfully obtain a Master of Science even though starting studying on a lower educational level.  \n\nSubsequently, my school career allowed me to do an internship for 6 months in Paris (France) and study in Birmingham (UK). This unique experience broadened my horizon globally and allowed me to develop my personal skillset. Currently, working in an international field adds value to these experiences. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to further develop myself on the many aspects stated above. My interest in sales and logistics is something I eventually would like to further develop along side my languages.",
