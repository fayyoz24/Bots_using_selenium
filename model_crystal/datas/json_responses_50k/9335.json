    "summary": "I recently started a new position as a Consultant at EY-Parthenon in the Strategy & Transaction team in Amsterdam. \nLast summer I finished my Master of Science degree in Leadership and Change Management at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. This Master study focuses on organizational change, managing change project, and to get buy-in from all involved. During my multilingual studies in the Bachelor's and Master's, I have acquired a broad business knowledge, especially in the field of languages, and was able to expand my language skills to a level of C1 in English and a level of B2 in Spanish.\nThrough my 6-month stay in the United States as an au pair a semester abroad (Alicante, Spain) and an internship abroad (Rotterdam, Netherlands) I was able to gain a lot of new experiences and, above all, further develop my intercultural skills. Furthermore, I have learned to take responsibility and to face new and difficult situations. \nI have a communicative, open-minded and creative way of thinking, which helps me especially when working with others in a team.",
