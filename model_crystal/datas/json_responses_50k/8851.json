We plan to introduce high quality coffee in the area. We are currently are working with the village Ban Namvang, of the Hmong ethnic people, where a selected group of farmers will be trained in producing high quality coffee.\nWe are partnering up with the regional Lao authorities in order to set up a center of expertise at the Viengphouka district Agricultural Research Centre in Nam Fa. Besides we are working with several coffee experts in Laos, Thailand and The Netherlands in order to grow and produce top-quality coffee. \nWe want to offer an alternative to the dominant trend of mono-culturing which in essence threatens the region's main asset which is diversity. We believe we can make a change by producing small-scale top products and directly selling them to the western specialty markets. \n",
