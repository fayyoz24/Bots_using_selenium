    "summary": "I am a Master\u2019s degree student at the University of Siegen. I\u2019m studying economics and I really enjoy it because I\u2019ve been interested in this topic since high school. \nI graduated from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation at the Faculty of Finance with a GPA of 1.7 (german assessment system). My favorite subjects at university were financial control and microeconomics.\nAlso, I already have pretty good working experience. Firstly, I completed a six-month internship at the \u201cSeverstal\u201d company in the Department of Finance. I find it highly productive and very interesting because I gained a good experience for my future job. My responsibilities were checking invoices and conducting reconciliations, creating presentations in MS PowerPoint, creating tables in MS Excel, and communicating with clients in English. Secondly, during my bachelor studies, I had working experience for two years as a sales manager in two companies, where I learned how to communicate with customers and be an integral part of a team.  \nI like improving my skills constantly, so in addition to my education, I also completed training courses \u201cBusiness Analytics with Excel: Elementary to Advanced\u201d and \u201cBusiness and Financial Modeling\u201d. Of course, I want to implement it into my working experience as fast as possible.",
