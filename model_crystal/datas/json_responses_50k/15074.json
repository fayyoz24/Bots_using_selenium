    "summary": "I have several years of education in Globalisation, Global Development, and Cultural Studies. I hope that my global perspective from living in South Africa, Australia, Sweden, Belgium and The Netherlands can contribute positively to a lot of companies on the international level, through bringing a multicultural perspective on several issues.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy dissecting and discussing global development issues, and also making music. I hope that my creative tendencies can bring out-of-the-box thinking to particular situations, contexts, and issues, to bridge the gap between logic and creativity within discussing solutions to development in the Global South and otherwise. Since it is close and personal to me, I have a particular passion for engaging with how issues affecting global networks can be addressed beginning on a localised scale.",
