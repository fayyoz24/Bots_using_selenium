With the permission from Gemeente Utrecht we are making a new space and proactively filling it with a great program of classes and workshops for the neighbourhood. At the same time giving new possibilities to organizers who until now found the social centers too expensive to consider as a possible location for their activities. We have the first pilot project running for a year with expansion possibilities after the first months. This is a new way of working for the Gemeente within the Social centers and we are intrigued to see how everything comes together.\n\nTypes of tasks include renter management, events organisation, coommunity building, space management and promotion on social media.",

Often on whatever level we can waste time, energy and resources because we are not clear about what we need or what our goals are. With a certain amount of clarity created through practical steps, we can not only make a business plan of intrinsic value but also see how we can greater collaboration with other organisations. By establishing our needs and wishes we realize clearly what we need in stakeholders, what they can mean for us and what we can mean for them.\n\nOnce the basics of the model are learned, it can be applied to any situation or circumstance. No matter if you are looking at goal setting for your business, making a business plan, dealing with a difficult team situation or looking for personal growth. Its all at your fingertips with this tool. The I:DNA model was designed to be universal leaving the questioners with practical information, tools and a guide to the next steps in goal fulfillment.",
