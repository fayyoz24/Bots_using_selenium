In this project, we work on research and innovation from two different points of view. In the first\nplace, an experimental development is addressed that allows an immediate response to the needs of the sector using antennas with a Teflon lens for their implementation in HAPS, LEO satellites and current communication stations in 5G technology and future 6G technology. On the other hand, thanks to industrial research, the improvement of these systems will be approached from two points of view. The first one focusing on the lens with the use of metamaterials and the second, from the point of view of the feed, using Gap Waveguide (GW) technology.",

For this purpose, a periodic spectral Method of Moments was derived to analyse skewed dipole arrays. This method provided design guidelines for tilted element arrays to achieve desired radiation characteristics with a non-symmetric radiation pattern.\n\u2022 Developing frequency filtering solutions to reduce the interferences between nearby radiating systems. A Miniaturized Element Frequency Selective Surface (MEFSS) was designed to reject higher order harmonics. A prototype was measured with a phased array antenna to validate the MEFSS behaviour while maintaining the array behaviour.\n\u2022 Exploring Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies to reduce the complexity in the fabrication process of three-dimensional antennas. A dipole antenna was designed and manufactured with AM technology to study its losses, the printer accuracy, and relevant issues related to this technology such as accuracy of the antenna replicas or the materials\u2019 behaviour under heat.",

Classes were fully packed, with around 80 children per class eager to learn but with not even a pen or a notebook to write down the exercises sometimes. \nThe Green Lion organisation helps not only with bringing people like me to help teaching but also with the necessary material for the children to keep learning. \nOverall, it was a wonderful experience not only inside the school but also outside. Their culture is fascinating and the people are kind and always sharing the little they have."
