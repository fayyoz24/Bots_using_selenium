Tevens worden er workshops en trainingen gegeven aan professionals gericht op cultuur sensitief werken. \n\n\nWij liepen er tegenaan dat hier geen passend lesmateriaal voor bestond. We zijn onze managers dan ook dankbaar dat wij de mogelijkheid hebben gekregen om dit zelf te ontwikkelen. \nIn de workshop Dit Zijn WIJ staan wij in samenwerking met de kinderen, hun docenten en ouders stil bij de identiteit van de klas en het terugdringen van pestgedrag. Daarnaast geven wij een workshop over cultuur sensitief werken aan professionals. ",

As the years go by we discover new things about ourselves in life; whether it has to do with \u2018predestined\u2019 discoveries, man-made desires and plans or something else. Yet the necessary question to think about is if those discoveries are part of the real you? The Kingdom citizen tour takes you on a hardcore reality check journey. We believe it to be the season of discovery, change and restoration. Don\u2019t allow yourself to wake up one day with regrets while voicing out: \u201cI have Never Become who I AM\u201d. Instead, make the choice to do what has to be done right now. \n\n{PURPOSE } The purpose of the tour is to help one creatively discover their purpose and to maximize their potential.\n\n{VISION & MISSION} The Tour entails personal life lessons; stories of how one discovered purpose through the obstacles in life and reveals how it was enabled by going beyond limitations and breaking the status quo.

Social issues that could not remain debate subjects. Appointed district leaders were assigned  to find organizations and young community leaders. Those who can be of influence to organize programs, projects and workshops to highlight the social issues in the community.\n\nOne of the young community leaders is Maame Durowah Okai the founder of the Brighter Day foundation. She accepted the proposal to help create awareness in the community and the I AM mentoring program was introduced to the City Council Amsterdam Together with the I AM Team & coaches Ingemar Francisca & Cynthia Ricardo\n\nIn order to personally develop in life it\u2019s important to first be aware of whom you are as an individual. Not just the individual that people say you are but rather what you know about yourself. Many times in life when the question is asked: \u201dWho Are You?\u201d we mostly define ourselves based on an occupation, status or how people see us.\n\nThe I AM mentoring program takes it a step further by discovering your personal purpose, potential and mission.  It gives clarity how you stand as that unique individual to make a bigger impact in the community,  generation, family or nation.\n\nWith this  program you get the chance to  work on competence that will help you discover \u201cYou\u201d and learn how to put \u201cYOU\u201d into practice\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQOOIyF8VH8\n\n",

Tevens worden er workshops en trainingen gegeven aan professionals en managers gericht op cultuur sensitief werken. \n\nStory Behind: \"Al langere tijd had ik met Shary Jones het verlangen om lessen voor kinderen over identiteit, diversiteit en familiewijsheid te ontwikkelen. Wij liepen er tegenaan dat hier geen passend lesmateriaal voor bestond. We zijn onze managers dan ook dankbaar dat wij de mogelijkheid hebben gekregen om dit zelf te ontwikkelen.  In de workshop Dit Zijn WIJ staan wij in samenwerking met de kinderen, hun docenten en ouders stil bij de identiteit van de klas en het terugdringen van pestgedrag\".",
