    "summary": "Currently looking for a PhD or research position in Ethics and Technology, with a connection to Public Administration!\n\nI recently graduated Cum Laude from the MSc Philosophy of Science, Technology, and Society at the University of Twente. My master's thesis focused on the epistemic condition of moral responsibility, and whether this condition would be undermined if one made use of automated decision-making systems. I have finished a masters degree in Global Markets, Local Creativities (specialisation Global Markets and Development) at the University of Glasgow, the University of Barcelona, and Georg-August University in G\u00f6ttingen. I am particularly interested in Public-Private Partnerships, governmental relations, and the digitalisation of public services.\n\nDuring my studies, I have acquired a profound understanding of the way public and private partners act together, and have used this knowledge in several consultancy projects. Apart from improving my specialist knowledge, this has also helped me to further develop my research skills, both qualitative and quantitative. My participation in international programmes, working with team members with both a different international and academic background, has allowed me to learn more about international management. These projects have had a huge impact on my critical thinking and analytical skills.\n\nWhile at university, I have been very active on campus. I have participated in a wide range of extracurricular activities, including a public speaking programme, honours programmes, student representative councils and several cultural activities. I have been the chairperson of a team of international students organising a charity run against child marriage, and have successfully organised this event while also excelling in my other academic commitments.\n\nSeveral projects have allowed me to gain extra knowledge on the role of digitalisation in the public sector, such as the e-Justice project with dr. Yashar Saghai, and my internship at the NSOB in the Hague. For the last, I have conducted research in how the NSOB works with digitalisation within their think tank publications.",
