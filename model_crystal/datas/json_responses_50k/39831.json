    "summary": "I thoroughly enjoy delivering a high standard of work. I am highly dedicated; never leave a job half\ndone, while knowing where to set boundaries. Someone who is authentic: what you see, is what you get. I have both a practical and an academic background which enables me to approach my work in a holistic way and to get the most out of every situation. I am a versatile and multi-skilled hard worker, who thrives when working in a challenging environment where commerce and operations go hand in hand with a strong vision and strategy. I take great pleasure in translating complex processes into logical and transparent ways of working. I love to laugh and create a positive atmosphere that puts people at ease. Being enthusiastic, cheerful and sociable, I perform best in a team, but with a high level of personal responsibility and independence. I aspire to learn, contribute to team synergy, generate and share knowledge, and motivate and inspire each other. And above all, to use all my competences and skills to their full potential.",
