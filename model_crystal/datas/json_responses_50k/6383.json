The platform was developed based on the information they provided.\nWe organised several \u2018area-specific\u2019 meetings in different neighbourhoods to test and iterate the platform with real users from the area.\nWhen the platform was almost ready, we met with the students from the Tourism University Altamira to receive their feedback and gather more information about Santander.",

With this new system, all bicycles introduced in the system by citizens, Handhaving or Smart Fiets Collectors will go to the Smart Fiets Manager back-end system, a database shared by all actors.\nThese are the features that a centralized system could provided:\n1. Public participation in the bike collection management: Smart Fiets provides a mechanism for citizens to report abandoned bikes with the Smart Fiets App in three steps (1- Place a sticker on the abandoned bicycle; 2- Scan its QR-code; 3- Add picture and details of the bike).\nThis bikes will be picked up by a dedicated team. By separating the collection of soft bikes (abandoned and neglected bikes with almost or no value) and hard bikes (long-term parked or wrongly parked bikes) the efficiency of the bicycle collection system will be increased.\n\n2- Transparency of the bicycle collection system: Smart Fiets will provide a way to register bikes and a service that will allow users to check whether their bicycle has been transferred to the Fietsdepot in case of loss. In that case, they will be able to claim them back online. In case it is not there, users will be able to report its loss to the police.\n\n3. Automatization of Fietsdepot: With Smart Fiets the process of Fietsdepot will be completely improved. That will result in an optimization of resources of bike deposit.",
