Specifically, the testing of self-driving buses is currently taking place in three test areas; Forus, Kongsberg and at Akershusstranda in Oslo.\n\n        \n\nIn studying how self-driving buses interact with other road users in real traffic we conduct video observations and analyze the interactions between the self-driving buses and other road users at strategically selected locations along the test routes. In addition to observing traffic behavior and interaction, we conduct interviews and surveys among road users about their expectations, experiences and attitudes towards the self-driving buses.\n\nInteractions will change over time\n\nBased on theories of interaction and behavioral adaptation as well as international experiences with self-driving buses, our hypothesis claims that interactions will change over time.\n\nWe distinguish between three phases:\n\nInitially we expect other road users to be reserved and careful in their interactions with the self-driving bus, and generally yield when interacting with the bus.\nAfter some time (1-3 months) we expect other road users to take advantage of the fact that the bus always stops when something comes in its way. Hence, we expect to find that other road users going first at intersections, even if the bus has the right of way.\nThe poor negotiating power of the self-driving bus makes it a \u201cweak\u201d road user. Moreover, the passengers (elderly, people with special needs) may be considered as \u201cweak\u201d. \n\n... \n\nSee more at the website",

With the combined efforts of psychologists, philosophers, and engineers, MHC-ADS will develop a theory of \u201cMeaningful Human Control\u201d (MHC) over Automated Driving Systems (ADS), and assess several aspects of this newly developed theory, with the use of three use cases: mixed traffic dual-mode transport, autonomous vehicles (or: pods), and truck platooning.\n\n\u201cMeaningful human control\u201d has been identified as key for the responsible design of autonomous systems operating in circumstances where human life is at stake. By preserving meaningful human control, human safety can be better protected, and accountability gaps can be avoided. However, we still lack a satisfactory theory of what meaningful human control precisely means in relation to ADS.\n\nBased on the methodology of \u201cvalue-sensitive design\u201d, MHC-ADS aims to develop a definition of meaningful human control over ADS, which encompasses its conceptual, technical and behavioural dimensions. MHC-ADS will also develop, implement, test and improve building blocks for guidelines for \u201cdesigning for meaningful human control\u201d on the three case studies, the results of which can be used by all its stakeholders in various different ways and with various different perspectives. In the first stage of our project, we are aiming to develop an empirically and technically usable conceptual toolbox (or framework) that can be shared across the different areas of expertise that characterize the project. We will isolate a minimal set of notions of control, based on literature from, among others, philosophy, behavioural science, and engineering. Simultaneously, we aim to identify an as clear as possible notion of \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d. \n\n...\n\nSee more at our website.",

Road transport is an essential part of society but the burden of traffic crashes, congestion, and pollution is enormous. Highly automated driving (HAD) has the potential to resolve these problems and major car makers foresee that HAD will be technically ready for commercialisation within one decade from now. However, before automated driving can be safely deployed on public roads we have to deal with imminent human factors questions, such as:\nHow should human-machine-interfaces (HMI) be designed to support transitions between automated and manual control?\nHow can the automation understand the driver\u2019s state and intentions?\nWhat are the effects of HAD on accident risk and transport efficiency?\nHFauto bridges the gap between engineers and psychologists through a multidisciplinary research and training programme. We combine engineering domains such as simulator hardware, traffic flow theory, control theory, and mathematical driver modelling with psychological domains such as human action and perception, cognitive modelling, vigilance, distraction, psychophysiology, and mode/situation awareness, to optimally address the interdisciplinary domain of human factors. Through secondments in automotive industry, road safety institutes, and academia, the researchers gain transferable knowledge of human factors, technology, and legal and marketing aspects of HAD.",

Attempts to correlate such measures with aggression and psychopathy have shown promising results in children. This research tried to correlate heart rate, heart rate variability and pre-ejection period with aggression and psychopathy in adults. In an attempt to characterize a group of 19 male adult convicts, values significantly different from literature were found, which raised several questions. The various confounders which are known to influence heart rate variability were assessed and closely monitored. No significant correlations were found in this research, nevertheless raising several points of discussion. Concluding that heart rate variability is difficult to compare with other researches, this research focused on closely monitoring all methods and measures used and all variables present, to give a clear picture of this research, in order to be able to compare this with future researches.",

            "description": "Abstract\n\nThe brain contains a \u201chigh road\u201d and a \u201clow road\u201d for processing of visual stimuli. The high road is assumed to process all visual stimuli whereas the low road is thought to be specialized in processing danger cues, allowing a reflex \u201cfight or flight\u201d-response. However, many studies coined an extra term, namely freeze to accompany the term \u201cfight or flight\u201d, which could influence reaction times involving emotional perception in the visual system. Given that the low road and high road differ in length and therefore processing speed, and the low road specializes in emotional processing, we were interested in the difference in processing speed between different stimuli. Therefore, we decided to test three different conditions, all having the focus on the difference in reaction speed between neutral and emotional stimuli. In our first experiment we showed each subject pictures of persons containing neutral or emotional expressions. In the second we first showed them a cue face, then a target face. The third experiment first showed both a cue face and a distraction, supposed to make the cue face invisible for the subject. The idea behind these three experiments was to try to test three different components in the visual system. The first experiment was thought to be the lifelike experiment, where the second pre-focused the low road and the third cancelled the high road altogether, giving different processing speeds per experiment. The three experiments showed no significant differences between emotion-rich and emotion-less faces, raising the question whether there is a difference in processing speed in emotion perception or something else.",

Specifically, my scope is oriented towards platoons of highly automated vehicles, and supervising the automated platoon whilst being driven automatically for extended periods of time. \nAfter a literature study investigating the key psychological constructs in driving automation, I developed a model that showed the complex interaction of constructs, such as mental workload, stress and situation awareness, in an automated driving environment. Henceforth, through empirical experimentation I attempted to assess and refine this model. \nIn both simulator and on-road experiments, I investigated the impact automated platooning has on the human psychology when subjected to prolonged periods of non-critical automated driving. \nA key instrument used for assessing human behaviour during my experiments is psychophysiological equipment, such as eye trackers and electrocardiographs.\n\nPapers on the experiments, as well as the literature study, have been (and still are being) published in respectable journals.",
