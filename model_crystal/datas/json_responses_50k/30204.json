    "summary": "Organized, diligent and ambitious third-year electrical engineering student with excellent attention to detail and passion for knowledge. I consider myself to be a very responsible problem solver with a hands-on attitude. \n\nWhen it comes to my study, I am particularly interested in signal processing, machine learning and computer engineering. I want to specialise in those areas and work at the intersection of hardware and software in the future. \n\nCurrently, I am working part-time as a teaching assistant and student mentor and I am looking for internship opportunities in the area of electrical engineering. I am always open to new opportunities and connections.",
