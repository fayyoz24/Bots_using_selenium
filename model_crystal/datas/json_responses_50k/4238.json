I am directly involved in FRAMES, an Interreg project among countries from the North Sea Region (Belgium, Germany, UK, Denmark and the Netherlands). The aim is to increase flood resilience and adaptation to climate change by applying the Multi layer safety approach (MLS). This holistic flood risk approach integrates measures for prevention, mitigation via spatial planning and emergency response.
