Summerson called on practicing architects to face \u2018the real-life adventures... looming ahead\u2019 instead of trying \u2018to fly level with the poet- innovator Le Corbusier.\u2019 To render architecture \u2018effective in English life\u2019 would be the role of qualified teams of \u2018salaried architects\u2019 working for local and central authorities or commercial undertakings. Their \u2018departmental architecture\u2019 would be responsible for lifting the average quality of everyday building practice, for the benefit of all \u2013 while providing a profession chronically seeking to secure its place in society with \u2018those three essential things for any born architect \u2013 bread, butter, and the opportunity to build.\u2019 Coincidentally, the following year saw the publication of Ayn Rand\u2019s novel The Fountainhead, whose protagonist-architect epitomised the \u2018prime mover\u2019, the individualistic creative hero who single-handedly conquered his place in history.\nSeemingly following Rand\u2019s drive, the canon of western contemporary architecture has overlooked Summerson\u2019s everyday, \u2018salaried\u2019 architecture, however overwhelming it may have turned out to be in our built environment, praising instead the solo designer and his groundbreaking work.\nWhat is, then, the specificity of this \u2018Bread & Butter\u2019 architecture? What is its place in architectural history studies, and how should we approach it? What does it tell us about the dissemination and hampering of architectural trends, or the architectural culture within institutions and agencies? Is it relevant in today\u2019s context of swift downplaying of institutional agency in the spatial accommodation of everyday needs? Are we prepared to bypass the still-prevalent notion of the architect-artist, the prime mover, and look at the circumstances of those who played their part in inconspicuous offices and unexciting departments?\"",

            "description": "Session co-chairing at the European Architectural History Network Second International Meeting, Brussels, 31 May - 3 June 2012\n\"Regionalism has had an intense if unbalanced existence in architectural history. Eclectic, romantic, nationalist, historicist, critical, resistant \u2013 numerous titles have been used to position design practices that engage with local and regional elements, originated in both formal and informal custom. Among these categories, critical regionalism (CR) had widespread impact and, thirty years on, still influences architectural debate. Although critiqued and questioned, it has become an umbrella-term and a benchmark against which complex and diverse local practices are hastily asserted. \nCR helped set the ground for a moralism of 'good' and 'bad', avant-garde and populist uses of regional features in design work \u2013 according to which 'critical' is progressive, worthy of study and praise, while 'uncritical' (eclectic, romantic, literal) is retrograde, and not equally relevant. This moral distinction and its insistence in binary oppositions bring about the ambivalent character of CR both as a 'revisionary form of imperialist nostalgia' (Jacobs 1996), 'often imposed from\noutside, from positions of authority' (Eggener 2002), and as a theory reverent to attitudes of peripheral challenge to central hegemonic power.\nNotions of negotiation, interchange, assimilation, hybridity, and contamination linking modernism and regionalism have recently been introduced to complement the established view of antagonism between the two. More and more investigations show evidence of conciliation and blur conventional readings of opposition. The aims and ambitions of regions and local communities, however, remain hidden in generally centralized accounts. How were those formulated, and transferred to building practice? How were the cultural frames of metropolitan designers projected onto peripheral contexts? To what extent were local actors permeable to central agents?\"",
