THE TIME AND THE NEED ARE THERE.\nThis investment will lead to greater involvement of your employees, lower turnover and absenteeism and a better working atmosphere. Happy employees.

Let's not wait until the staff numbers are disappointing (high turnover, high absenteeism, low involvement e.g.), the staff costs become too high and action is required. Because you will be too late.
