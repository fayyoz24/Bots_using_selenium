    "summary": "How can grass save the world?! Get ready to be Bamboozled...\n\nBamboo, technically speaking a grass, is the fastest growing plant in the world and whats more, it is a natural resource that, when sustainably managed, actually matures after harvesting. Why is this the future? \n\nIf we look at the GHG emissions worldwide, 40% come from the built environment. If we look at materials as if they were countries in terms of carbon emissions, concrete would be the 3rd biggest offender following China and the US. By integrating natural materials, like bamboo and wood, into the construction sector this is directly impacted and, on top of that, the large amounts of CO2 that are stored during the growth are stored in the product for the rest of its life. \n\nWhat's the catch? Though there is momentum within the bio based material world to push these sustainable products, such as CLT, bamboo is still relatively young and needs to be on the tips of more tongues to get the word out. Not only that but we need to push for a higher carbon tax to make these polluters less economically attractive and to prioritise bio based materials. Have I got you interested? Take a look at MOSO's website and find out even more about the beautiful material and the sheer potential: https://www.moso-bamboo.com/",
