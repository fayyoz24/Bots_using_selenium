JJ Footwear has the widest and largest collection of boots, ranging from Extra Narrow boots (circumfernce of 30 cm / 12,5 inch), up to Wide Calf Boots up to XXXL (circumference 60 cm / 25 inch). We confectionised making boots and shoes. With one goal in mind; to build the brand JJ Footwear behind an Internet driven concept, which is currently being sold in over 20 countries. Thus providing women all over the world for the best fitting solution and the broadest and widest ( :)) choice!  We also recently introduced the JJ Footwear App and the \"Personal Fit Concept\",which is a new business model for the Shoe Retail business.

The styles have been approved by NVOS Orthobanda, the highly qualified and internationally reknowned Dutch Association of Orhopedic Shoemakers. \n\nThe technical shoe-design objectives have been met:\n* Extra deep lasts with narrow heel fitting\n* Dynamic rocker sole\n* Available in multiple widths (E, H and K)\n* Rounded heel, optimal toespring\n* Stiff support with an adaptable counter\n* Optimised for Diabetis and Arthritus\n* Competetive Price Setting\n\nBut most of all, the design objective was to create a line of Semi-Othopedic Shoes, that's in line with the current fashion trends, so that the customer can wear these without be stared at by its surrounding. \n\nIn the first 6 months, we have already added over 50 customers to our client list, which proves that our gut feeling is being acknowledged by the market. More innovations are currently being developed, since  insurance companies are changing their \"rules\" and JJ PRO Footwear will make sure that the Orthopedic market can improve their margins with this \"newcomer\" on the Semi-Orthopedic market.",

Originated 15 years ago by orthopedic shoemakers and surgeants who did not find the proper footwear for problem feet they encoutered in their practices. So they decided to set up a brand that was specifically designed for problem feet and sensitive feet. If you are expereincing bunions, hammertoes, arthrosis or diabetes, New Feet is th\u00e9 brand to work with. \n\nNew Feet carries a lot of features that other shoe brands don't. Please read all about it in the attached brochures, where you can also read about the use of real stretcheable leather inside their shoes, for optimal comfort for the sensitive foot.\n\nNew Feet has several lines, for Shoe Shops which sell Comfort Shoes, for specialized Comfort shoe shops and for real Orthopedic shoe shops.\n\nNew Feet also carries a professional line, for hospital and real orthopedic use. They serve all hospitals in Denmark and a vastly growing number in Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe combination of JJ Footwear and New Feet makes it possible to work together in the designing stage and on Research and Development projects. The goal is to further extend the line into the direction that also consumers, that experience all kind of footproblems, want to choose NEW FEET as their preferred brand, not only because of the technology inside, and the fact that they can happily walk again, but mainly because the shoes look great!",

My responsibility is in general coordination, sponsorships, exhibition and matchmaking.\n\nSLEM is known for its future forward and meaningful contributions to the footwear industry. The subject of the SLEMinars are written below. This year we have a World Class line up of speakers on the following subject:\n\nPls also have a look at www.slem.nl/sleminars \n\nTHE FUTURE OF FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING\n\nWAALWIJK \u2013 Will footwear come back to Europe and the USA through high-tech factories only operated by robots? Will in-store manufacturing of tailor-made shoes be the solution for brick and mortar retail? Will we be able to have computers and scanners simply generate the shoes we need so we can 3D print them at home?\n\nThese questions and many more will be discussed at SLEM\u2019s upcoming Future of Footwear Manufacturing SLEMinars on April 20-21, 2017.  The first conference day will be about \u201csmart manufacturing\u201d, in other words: how can we take existing production methods to the next level, making them more local, functional and able to provide custom-made footwear. The second day will focus on \u201cdisruptive manufacturing\u201d, discussing entirely new methods of footwear manufacturing, from print farms to generative design systems and biotechnology solutions.\n\nTickets for the Future of Footwear Manufacturing SLEMinars are available at: http://www.slem.nl/sleminars.",
