    "summary": "I have spent the past years being a driven and dedicated international student, attaining my International Baccalaureate Diploma with a Language Award in 2019, my BSc in Media and Communication with Honours in 2022 and recently my MA in Media Studies: Digital Cultures with Honours as well.\n\nAs reflected in my academic journey, I have a passion for media and digital technologies. I particularly enjoy content creation, having independently developed skills in digital photography, graphic design and video-editing. Nonetheless, I am open to working more broadly with digital media and am looking forward to developing even more valuable skills which will allow me to work more closely with digital technology.\n\nMoreover, my professional and academic background has allowed me to develop strong leadership and project management skills. I enjoy being a cooperative and reliable team-player, who can also comfortably work independently.",
