    "summary": "As a pragmatic technology leader, I excel in complex environments and advocate for simple, long-term, stable, and maintainable solution strategies. With a growth mindset and a focus on a people-first culture, I employ a bottom-up approach to managing teams. I value the input of my team members and always make time for their professional criticism and insights.\n\nI possess a keen ability to identify the core of an issue and distinguish main concerns from peripheral ones. Proactive and driven by challenges, I take the initiative to ask questions and gather the right information. My choices and decisions are based on logical reasoning and are informed and thoughtful. I strive to create a support base by explaining the rationale behind my decisions.\n\nIn addition to these skills, I have a talent for seeing, creating, and seizing opportunities. I am an excellent leader who inspires others to achieve their full potential.",
