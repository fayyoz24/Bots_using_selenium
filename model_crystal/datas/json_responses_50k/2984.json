We are working closely with the Springfield Center, as a knowledge partner, to gain a better understanding by applying market scans and service delivery models under three main lenses.\n\nRecent crises have made us look at resilience as a way to systemically analyze the factors and their linkages with each other to gain a better understanding of the situation. However, it is a complex, broad and slippery concept. We are working towards making resilience more concrete and specific by developing a simple but rich conceptual framework. This framework will be validated in various themes and settings.\n\nThe COVID-19 Response and Resilience Initiative for Food Value Chains in Africa (CORE-Africa) project seeks to strengthen responses to the COVID-19 situation of nine projects across Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and Burundi) and to capture lessons for interventions and policies.\n\nCORE-Africa addresses five key themes: \n- Inputs and services for farmers\n- Consumer market channels\n- Digitalization for agriculture\n- Hygiene integration\n- Resilience (cross-cutting topic)",

Foresight can be an engaging and systemic tool that supports exploration, analysis, and understanding of the challenges facing our food system. In addition, it is a collaborative and horizontal approach that invites actors from various sectors, in order to enrich the processes under their diverse perspectives.\n\nThesis Topic: The role of foresight in the transition of the food system governance considering practitioners\u2019 perspective\n\nThe Foresight4Food initiative is organized by the Food Systems Group of the Institute for Environmental Change at the University of Oxford.

TAP\u2019s ultimate objective is to make agriculture more sustainable and improve livelihoods.\n\nDue to my active role in YPARD (Young Professionals for Agricultural Development), I was chosen to represent them in TAP. I have participated in different meetings such as the 7th TAP Partners Assembly, where we revised our goals as a team. As well, TAP has given me the opportunity to exchange ideas and share experiences with a diverse range of stakeholders who work to improve sustainability on the agricultural sector"
