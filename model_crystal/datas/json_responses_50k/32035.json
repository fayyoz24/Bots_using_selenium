    "summary": "In my early career, I worked as an industrial engineer for large multinational corporations in both technical and strategic roles, gaining a multi-faceted exposure to the complexity of organizations and a thorough grasp of the socio-systemic dynamics that executives face in culturally diverse teams and uncertain business contexts. \n\nThroughout the years, this development has fueled my passion to facilitate transformational leadership with unconditional regard and a thought-provoking style, naturally taking me to co-create with high-impact decision-makers who want to shift dysfunctional belief systems and narratives into expanded perspectives in service of growth.  \n\nItalian by origin, I now live in Amsterdam, after a number of relocations in UK and US first, and throughout Europe subsequently with my family. Trained with the Co-Active Training Institute (CTI), I\u2019m now prepping to become a Master Coach, working from my Professional Coach Certification with the International Coach Federation (ICF). \nI hold with distinction an Executive Master in clinical organizational psychology from INSEAD and a series of other useful practitioner tools accreditations, such as the Leadership Circle 360 Profile, the Hogan assessment and the Scrum Agile coaching, currently expanding my edges with meaningful spiritual work (Gita Belin, Aberkyn-McKinsey) and a certification as a Vinyasa Yoga teacher. \n\nIn my free time, I love giving back to my community, coaching a volleyball team of young talented girls and volunteering as a transition dialogues facilitator at the international school of my children. I also enjoy playing marimbas in a local music group and sporting in nature with my beloved family and dog.  \n",

At one point, the character you feel drawn to gets trapped in a small room with no way out and little time to save her life and the lives of many others. How do you feel about her? How would you wish she could find an escape and free up herself and the others? \nNow imagine you have figured a way out but the character in the movie is still struggling with little hope to find her way out. You may think to yourself excitedly: \u2018come on look up this way dude: that\u2019s were you are going to be free, for heavens\u2019 sake\u2019. How would you like that this movie character could hear you and see what you can see? \nMore often than we\u2019d like to admit to ourselves, we may have the feeling to be that character in the movie, while our \u2018hindsight-self\u2019 the person having it all figured out but with little or no use. To our disbelief, the same scene repeats itself with no variation, just like a movie is the same movie when it gets played again. \nIn our experiential workshop you will be offered a safe space where to explore your own small rooms where your mind gets typically caught. You will then learn how to break the circular triggering thoughts and affirm your freedom to make more conscious and resourceful choices you can make when outside of the movie you don\u2019t want to play anymore.  \n",

It's vision is to build a community of social change agents, entrepreneurs, and innovation managers \u2013 connected and engaged through Creative Leadership Programs, social change efforts, scale-up efforts and in-company programs.\n\nDubbed by Stanford University as \u201cthe future of higher education\u201d, THNK stands for creativity, business model innovation, and entrepreneurship for social impact. While a \u2018B-School\u2019 professionalizes management and a \u2018D-School\u2019 does the same for product design, THNK is a \u2018C-School\u2019 that applies creativity for positive change at scale. \n\nParticipants include experienced corporate innovators, entrepreneurs, and social change agents from all over the world with executive-level or entrepreneurial work experience. Each class consists of 40 people with around 20 different nationalities, men and women equally split.\n\nTHNK combines business design thinking with innovation strategy, and leadership development with the nurturing of entrepreneurial mindsets, with an emphasis on doing social good.\n\nTHNK\u2019s Creative Leadership Program is fully focused on learning-by-doing. Instead of lectures and academic study cases, THNK spurs its participants to work together on business and social concepts and open innovation projects to discover new avenues of perspective and potential",
