She has advocated for a world-class NPR One experience on the web, using technologies that are modern and proven. As a result, we are using the best technology for a pure-audio cross-platform webapp.  She has worked to open-source parts of NPR One, allowing for public innovation and partner participation while keeping organizational assets secure. As a result, our partners will be able to get a significant head-start should they decide to use HTML5 technology on their NPR One implementation.  She\u2019s continuously championed the need for a public developer blog, so that NPR developers may communicate to their peers around the world and show the world that public radio is moving rapidly into the 21st century.  Nara is a driven and dedicated colleague who is steadfast, outspoken and honest. She represents the best of NPR, and NPR Digital media.\"",
