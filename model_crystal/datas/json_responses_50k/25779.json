The others work on Bluetooth, WiFi or Internet. Some major drawbacks with such architecture are higher power consumption and considerable hardware cost\n\n\"IRis\" as we call it, has been mindcrafted to tackle these very problems. We conceptualized IRis with the goal of making digital education a reality even in most remote areas of nation. Having said that, cost effectiveness is obviously an important aspect of our product.\n\nIRis Slaves are driven by Attiny85 microcontrollers. At the heart of IRis lies an IR communication architecture instead of RF. Needless to say, IRis results in lower hardware cost and power consumption than its RF counterparts which are widely in use.\n\nYouTube Link : https://youtu.be/2T4GFIO2HKA/\nGitHub Link : https://www.github.com/matiyau/IRis/\nPresentation : https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/sprint/hackfest/team/357198/e8728ceiris.pptx",

            "description": "ClusterPi is an image processing cluster, built with Raspberry Pis, within a local network. Since most of the image processing algorithms exhibit a high amount of parallelism, a significant speedup can be achieved by performing parallel computation on several processing units. But since the processers are distributed over a network, there are delays introduced due to the comminucation of workload and the computed results. It is thus imperative that the reduction in computation time be much higher than the communication delay.\n\nWe have used MQTT protocol for message transfers. The cluster is formed with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ acting as a master, and a set of slaves, which include 3 Raspberry Pi 4Bs and 1 Raspberry Pi 400. The master distributes the workload among different slaves and then collects the results. The Canny-Edge detection algorithm has been tested on this setup, and has delivered promising results. We tried executing the algorithm with one, two and three slaves as well, and as expected the computation time deteriorated when the number of slaves was reduced. The CPU clock frequency was also changed and the best performance was obtained in a setup  with maximum slaves (4) and a maximum clock frequency (1400MHz).\n\nThis project was guided by Dr. Koen G. Langendoen",

My major work on the firmware includes interfacing of SPI and I2C buses with ESP32, for reading the electrical parameters and RTC times respectively. I have also developed an alpha version of the appliance detection program, based on the data collected from the test devices.",
