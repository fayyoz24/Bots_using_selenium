    "summary": "As a Creative Business graduate at Breda University of Applied Sciences, Boiana is eager to pursue real-life professional experience after spending a year at MediaMonks Amsterdam's Films and Content Department learning all about film-based advertisement from the biggest brands out there like Nike, BMW, Mondelez, Lenovo, Starbucks, Lg, Mini, Pinterest, Facebook, WhatsApp and more. The role she was given within the Film Craft and Talent team at MM was a chance to develop a variety of skills. From directing, talent sourcing, director treatments and pitches to all the ways a person can boost their creativity in the most effective ways in order to bring fresh new work to the table. \n\nWith her first personally developed short fashion film \"Ethereal Maiden\" in collaboration with MediaMonks and the fashion brand ByFar, she was able to practice further her skills including pitching, directing, producing, art directing amongst many other valuable filmmaking skills. The film was greatly appreciated and supported within the department with its core function - to inspire young talents within the company and give them the opportunity to develop their filmmaking portfolios.",
