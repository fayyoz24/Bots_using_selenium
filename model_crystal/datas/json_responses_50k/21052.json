Together with the Aktion Mensch architects he suggested an architecture with multiple, heterogeneous packaged solutions. With this architecture Aktion is able to quickly add new channels and execute campaigns with them.\nThe architecture is built on top of the back office legacy. The new mid office comprises of an \u201con premise\u201d CRM for customer care and customer self service and a set of unified eCommerce services. The front offices runs partly in the cloud and partly \u201con premise\u201d. Communication between the 3 layers is with asynchronous Publish/Subscribe and an ESB to synchronize redundant data in the near real-time.\nWith this architecture Aktion Mensch can avoid a Big Bang migration because \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d can co-exist.\nAktion Mensch will implement this architecture and was happy with the advice given.",

                    "description": "The Dutch Tax Department rolled out the website www.mijnbelastingdienst.nl for online income tax declaration. This solution consisted of 5 components among them a portal, a 360 degree customer view and set of web services for online tax declaration. \nDuring the 2013 campaign, they found that the need to support 80.000 concurrent user was not possible. They also questioned the future proof of the solution. \nStakeholders were B/CAO (Application Development), B/CIE (Infra Engineering) and the Business (Customer Support).\n\nAn experienced couple, among them mr. Rottier analysed the applications and advised a solution for the short term (Campaign 2014) and the mid term. They also  prepared their vision for the long term. All solutions were presented  to M1 and M2 management.\n\nWith these solutions they offered a raisonnable migration path for the 2014 Campaign onwards and a vision that will deliver future proof, low risk,  elastic scalability and flexibility. \n\nAll stakeholder were happy with the solutions and started implementation",
