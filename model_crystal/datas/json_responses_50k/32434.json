I was privileged to learn Agile way of working from a very knowledgeable Agile Coach and the experienced Scrum Masters at UK. \nWe were able to scale up 1 scrum team to 15 scrum teams in 2 years, which means , lot of training was provided to the new scrum teams and the scrum masters,so that they can learn and adopt scrum and the required process to deal with the distributed agile setup.  There were around 35 scrum teams distributed across India and UK and all working on the same code base. I have played a vital role in helping the team to adopt the Agile mind-set.",
