    "summary": "I have the right to work in the Netherlands as the partner of an EU National.\n\nI am a Mechanical Engineer specialised in operations within the FMCG industry. Most recently I have held Production Team Lead and Demand Planning Analyst roles with Diageo Australia.\n\nMy experience has given me a strong knowledge of both the complexities that encompass high-speed manufacturing as, as well as deep insights into consumer habits and market patterns. Furthermore, I believe that my ability to clearly communicate complex ideas and adapt various problem-solving techniques has enabled me to be successful within various teams and across multiple projects. \n\nI would describe myself as motivated, personable and eager to learn. My favourite projects are the ones that push me to grow and develop in a team environment. My international experience in Australia and the USA, as well as recent European Travels, have brought me to the European market. I am looking for a role in a team where I can both be challenged and contribute to exceed targets and expectations.\n",
