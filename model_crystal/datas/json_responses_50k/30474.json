    "summary": "Key contents of my education and work experience are medical research, IT and physics.\n\nAfter finishing my master\u2019s in biology (specialization medical physics), I started my career with 3 years of research and development in cardiology and dermatology. In 1997 I switched to IT, working for 3 years on several software development projects. The first decade of this millennium I have been working as a scientist in bioinformatics using my biological and statistical knowledge and applying my computer skills to manage and mine complicated data in genomics and molecular biology. 2011, I joined ReliTech BV working on the development of medical systems and techniques.\n\nAs a person I am a pragmatic problem solver, focused on efficiency and improvement. A communicator with respect for people and the ability to explain complex matter in a simple way.\n\nSpecialties: Life Sciences , Genomics , Bioinformatics , IT , Physics.",
