    "summary": "With dedication and determination, I spend my time learning about technology and programming. \n\nMy current bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam gives me new perspectives on current technologies and the way people interact with technology. The diversity of the people within the study also gives me the opportunity to learn about different cultures and their points of view on various topics, expanding my own frame of reference.\nBy choosing a minor in another field, I get to learn and explore the knowledge that lie outside my study. By extending my knowledge in any area I do not only gain more understanding of that topic, but I also get to know different world views, different opinions, different ways of thinking, and on top of that, it greatly improves my empathetic abilities due to an increased understanding of their perspective.\n\nWith the addition of the bachelor Computer Science, I wish to combine the technical components of computers with the knowledge I obtained during the Artificial Intelligence Bachelor. I am interested in creating efficient softwares that help people in their day-to-day life by optimizing human-computer or computer-computer interaction.\n\nBesides the knowledge gained by two simultaneous bachelors, I have also gained more experience in creating efficient schedules for myself in order to stay on top of the deadlines and exams. I learned to set priorities, keep an overview of all tasks ahead, stay organized, and most importantly I have learnt to test but also accept my limits resulting in more mental peace.",
