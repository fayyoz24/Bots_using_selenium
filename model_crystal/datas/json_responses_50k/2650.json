            "description": "The Bioeconomy Awareness and Discourse Project (BioCannDo) will raise awareness and acceptance of the broad public towards the bioeconomy and bio-based products through a strategic, stakeholder-driven information campaign and education. Convincing people that the bio-based economy offers something desirable, with new products, functionalities and applications for their daily life, that provide answers to societal concerns (e.g. climate change), requires neutral and science-based information. \n\nBioCannDo will present such information in a way that is easy to understand for the broader public. It will provide various means for feedback, interaction and encourages engagement in a discourse on common questions and concerns. Collaborating with bio-based stakeholder networks and communities at EU, regional and national level, BioCannDo will provide information, educational materials and key communication messages through such channels as a community of related projects and educational partners and an Infohub which combines different means of online communication (i.e. social media, blogs, videos, journalistic articles). \n\nBioCannDo will build on the legacy of previous projects (i.e. by using their networks, or social media accounts), existing material developed by them and be active in collecting, connecting, aggregating and reformulating content from different actors and resources. It will generate new content addressing the most urgent gaps in information and education. Such dual approach will help to maximise synergies and increase impact of both existing and new material. The developed content and key communication messages will be assessed and tested by stakeholders and target users through focus groups and a market survey. Findings will be used in feedback loops to adapt the content and messages.\n",

Member States need to implement and adapt national legislation till 2016 in line with this new legislation. The new directive provides new opportunities for public entities to purchase products and services which meet advanced ecological and social criteria. It allows making use of public procurement to support innovative products. It is against this background that the new EU funded project InnProBio \u2018Forum for Bio-Based Innovation in Public Procurement\u2019 strives to explore these new possibilities for bio-based products and services. \n\nInnProBio aims to engage public procurement practitioners interested in bio-based products and services in a community of practice. The project will develop an elaborated and legally solid toolbox to inform about opportunities of the procurement of innovative bio-based products and services as well as to assist in drafting public tenders accordingly. It will conduct pilot capacity building and dialogue events with public procurers, decision makers, standardization bodies and business product suppliers from EU countries. Furthermore recommendations to public decision makers and standardization bodies to support the procurement of innovative bio-based products and services will be provided. The final goal is to create cross-national buyers groups which collaboratively develop tenders aiming for bio-based products and services. \n",
