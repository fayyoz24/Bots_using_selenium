    "summary": "Business Consultancy and entrepreneurship specialist: with a strong international background, extensive experience in optimizing learning programs, and a results-oriented mindset, I am is well-suited to design and implement comprehensive learning and development strategies.\n\nI am able to work independently and to foster developmental relationships within teams. This approach promotes collaboration, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. My  expertise in developmental relationships is not only evident in my practical experience, but also in my academic pursuits. It was one of the key themes of my PhD thesis, where I explored the importance of supporting entrepreneurs through meaningful relationships. This research highlights my deep understanding of the dynamics of interpersonal connections and how they contribute to personal and professional growth. \n\nMoreover, as a career specialist at Insper, I counseled hundreds of students and alumni, coached student organizations, and developed mentoring programs. I actively sought out partnerships, managed stakeholder relationships, and increased employment opportunities for graduating students, achieving high employment rates and year-on-year growth in job postings. My proactive approach and dedication to continuous improvement make me a self-driven and motivated professional. This further demonstrates my ability to support individuals in achieving their goals.\n\nI am also adept at optimizing learning programs. As an Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of Groningen, I design and implement practical and learning experiences that enhanced students' competencies and skills. I create quality controls, assess participants' performance, and use blended learning techniques to create engaging and effective learning environments. My experience in training and coaching entrepreneurial teams demonstrates my ability to tailor learning experiences to meet specific organizational needs, since each faculty (read, \"business unit\") that I serve has distinct learning strategies, expectations, and assumptions about the nature of business.\n\nHaving resided in Europe and South America, I thrive in cross-cultural exchanges.",
