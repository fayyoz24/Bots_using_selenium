NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries are used in the project to simplify analysis.\n\n- Analyze A/B Test Results\nThe idea of this project is to understand the results of an A / B test run by an e-commerce website. The company developed a new web page to try to increase the number of users who \"convert\". The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand whether to implement the new page, keep the old one, or perhaps run the experiment for a longer period before making a decision.\n\n- Wrangle and Analyze Data\nWrangle the tweet archive of the Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs data to create an interesting and reliable analysis and visualisations.\n\n- Communicate Data Findings\nThe dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system in February, 2019.  In this analysis, the main interest is the data associated with the user, as well as the features associated with the movement of the users. I find it useful for business to have information about the most popular stations, user routes and the hours and days of the week when users are most active in rental.",
