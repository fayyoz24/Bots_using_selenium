    "summary": "Young researcher interested in resilience research of ecosystems, in particular forests, to inform conservation efforts and to help mitigate adverse impacts of climate change on natural processes and society. I am studying to what extent boreal forests can recover from disturbances, such as droughts, fires, and insect outbreaks. I aim to determine how resilient forests are likely to be in the face of more extreme future disturbances. \nI am particularly interested in the use of both fieldwork (e.g. tree ring data) and remote sensing products from satellites or drones.",

The aim of the project is to understand how different woodland characteristics in fragmented landscapes (described in the 'Making Space for Nature' report by Lawton et al. 2010) affect species across taxonomic groups. My study focuses on bat activity and diversity in response to local and landscape-scale characteristics of woodlands with special emphasis on potential differences between secondary and ancient woodlands in Scotland (continually wooded since at least 1750). My results may have considerable implications for woodland creation schemes beyond the UK. ",
