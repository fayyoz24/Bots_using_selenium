    "summary": "I am Sonal, an Eindhoven-based creative designer looking for full-time opportunities and freelance projects in the area of Accessoires Design, Graphic Design, Product Design and Textile Design. As a designer, I am focused on creating customer-centric designs. In everything I do, I create experiences for the people. \n\nIn the language of Graphic Design, I describe myself as '.tiff'. Unlike a '.jpeg' I am open to changes and growth. You may perceive me as an image, but with the right software you will see that I am made up of multiple malleable layers, awaiting enhancement! \n\nRecently, I collaborated with Tilted Lotus, a brand based in USA to design a textile design collection which will be presented at the NEW YORK FASHION WEEK on Runway 7, in September 2023. Before moving to the Netherlands in January 2023, I was working as a freelance designer in India. I worked with companies across fashion, tech and food industry to create impactful design solutions for their target markets. My expertise lies in my software skills. I believe they are a language to express my creative ideas and bring them to life.",
