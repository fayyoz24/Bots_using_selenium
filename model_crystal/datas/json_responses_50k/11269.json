I'll be fascinated by the word \"wedding\" when people share this with me, because to wed is hardly seen nowadays, but it has an important and crucial element in our lives!\n\nWhile planning weddings I'll always ask their love stories (even though I already know), but it's a great start of the process of planning and it may also add value in their weddings. Gaining information of their demands is the foundation but giving tips and tricks during the process of planning creates endless inspiration to their weddings. And who doesn't love an unique and remarkable wedding ;-)",
