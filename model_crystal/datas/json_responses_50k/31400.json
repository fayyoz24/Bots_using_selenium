    "summary": "As an Adobe Commerce Business Practitioner, I am involved in developing, optimizing, and maintaining websites and e-commerce platforms. I translate customer\u2019s wishes into functional solutions that are suitable for the relevant platform or product. Aside from managing a portfolio of projects, I perform different roles within operations and team management.\n\nVersatile and driven, I offer skills in strategic planning, resource management, and agile implementation. The work I enjoy the most is the one that allows me to bring people together and collaborate towards an ambitious goal as a team. I enjoy making team members feel welcome and appreciated in their workplace, and I strive towards creating a positive work atmosphere where colleagues trust and accept each other.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I had some free time next to my work, so I decided to get the certificates which I have been postponing for quite a while.  As a result, I became a Certified Adobe Commerce Business Practitioner, Professional Scrum Master I and I am currently preparing for taking the Project Management Professional exam. \n\nIn my free time, I like traveling, powerlifting, cooking, and adding a bit of magic to my everyday life wherever possible.",

Each of them was challenging in their own way and they've helped me a lot to develop various skills which I now find very useful in my day-to-day life. "
