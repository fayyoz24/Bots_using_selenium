    "summary": "\u2018Explore, Experiment and Learn!\u2019 Words that pretty much describe my personality and career :)\n\n13 + years of software industry experience in various roles, domains and technologies earned end to end product development knowledge. My Agile journey begins in the year of 2016, slowly embraced Agile as my carrier, since several of my natural characteristics support to continue this role with more passion. In this learning pursued in Scrum Master roles with various clients. I have also excelled as Scrum master in SoS teams.\n\nI\u2019ve had the chance to experiment and learn in different roles as Scrum Master, Agile Transformation Scrum Master, Test Manager and Project Manager. Getting to know my strengths and truly believing I can add value were an eye-opener for me. Nowadays I\u2019m an enthusiastic passionate (IT) Scrum Master with a focus on people and eye for improvements.\n\nMy personal goal is to make impact on an organisation through (happy) individuals/teams. I do this by building genuine relationships, help teams deliver value through Scrum, challenge the status quo and create a fun (and safe) environment where we can enable change together. As a Scrum Master I manage to get close to this goal, plus it offers me a 'professional playground' to experiment with!",
