    "summary": "Since I enrolled in Kindai University, I never wasted my time. I went to study abroad in the US and got to be fluent in English and experience diverse cultures. I studied many different areas related to globalization, including Translation, Global Issues, Diversity of Global Perspectives, and so on. I have been involved in the field of Globalization and Internationalization for more than two years now, and I am searching for further studies in the world of an intercultural society and an international labor market. I always put 100% effort into my study and work, so I have a strong academic record. In addition, I am able to activate groups with my problem-solving abilities and interpersonal skills, which I obtained when I led the basketball club to the championship of some cups as a captain and key player. I also have experience as a team leader at my part-time job, so I can be the one who manages the group and gives efficiency when we work on an international project. With these qualifications, I will be able to successfully participate in this program. In this way, I am motivated to enhance my expertise and make my career progress effectively.",
