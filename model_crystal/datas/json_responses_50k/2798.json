    "summary": "At Evers + Manders, we provide consultancy on grant proposals, focusing on five specific sectors: medical technology and innovation, energy, water, sustainable development, and innovative technologies. As a Grant Consultant, I advise on grant strategies, trajectories, development, writing, and submission for researchers in academia, hospitals, and R&D departments of companies.\n\nBefore starting at Evers + Manders, I obtained my PhD at Cardiff University. I worked with Prof. Penny Lewis on the subject of sleep and memory. In a broad sense, I'm interested in science and its connection to society. I also love travelling: prior to my PhD I spent eight months travelling through Latin America.\n\nIn July 2015 I obtained my MScRes in Cognitive Neuropsychology at the VU University in Amsterdam, with cum laude distinction. I acquired my bachelor's at Amsterdam University College, an interdisciplinary honours programme, where I majored in Social Sciences with a minor in the Sciences.",
