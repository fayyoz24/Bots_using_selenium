Although at first glance, turning from traditional to digital processes might look like an obvious and natural choice, several factors should be attentively considered, namely the size of the company, its corporate governance, production processes, the company\u2019s output, the number of employees, and finally the company reputation, to cite the most significant. So, are digital companies more sustainable inside and out? ",
