            "description": "The ecological stability of an ecosystem determines how it responds to disturbances. Understanding ecological stability is, therefore, crucial in preventing land degradation and designing strategies for restoration. In this study, the ecological stability of a dryland ecosystem in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, in the face of both a drought and a heavy flooding period, was determined. The Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) change detection methodology was used to determine breakpoints and trends in a time-series of Landsat NDVI data between 1984 and 2019. The breakpoints were classified using a newly developed typology based on the trend before and after the breakpoint. The improved typology that is introduced in this thesis, considers the statistical significance of trends and subdivides them in categories of abrupt changes that lead to an improvement of ecosystem functioning (positive breakpoints) and abrupt changes that lead to a deterioration of ecosystem functioning (negative breakpoints). Ecological stability was quantified using the resistance to abrupt changes that lead to a deterioration in ecosystem functioning and the response to climatic disturbances as indicators. The resulting data on resistance and response to climatic disturbances were compared to data of land cover classification, overall change in vegetation cover and initial vegetation cover. The results show that ecological stability is higher in the northern part of the Ounila watershed.\nEcological stability is lowest in lower-lying bare areas in the west and south of the watershed. Areas with\nhigher initial NDVI exhibited higher ecological stability. In the upper part of the watershed, there are some areas that have shown overall greening or browning. The areas that have experienced greening, had low resistance and showed an improvement in ecosystem functioning in response to the drought. These areas were identified as locations with high potential for land restoration.",

Based on the proposition that an increase in vegetation cover can lower temperature and induce precipitation, initiatives have emerged that aim to restore degraded  lands through regreening.  There  have  been  very  little  empirical  studies supporting this  claim,  especially  in  arid  regions.  Several  small scale,  short-term studies have concluded that regreeningeven lowers water availability.  However, the beneficial effects of vegetation on climate might not be visible at small temporal and spatial scales. In this thesis the impact of a large-scaleregreeningproject in the Kubuqi desert, China, on local climate during the past two decadesis assessed. Satellite observations of FAPAR and land surface temperature are analysed along with Reanalysis data of monthly means of  daily  total precipitation.  Firstly,  a  regreened  and  non-regreened  reference  area were assigned  within  the  case  study  area.  Then  the  time-series of FAPAR, LST  and  daily precipitation  in  the  reference  and regreened  area are  compared  between  1999-2019.  A trend  and  breakpoint analysis areconducted  using  the  Season-Trend-Model (STM) method. Finally, an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is applied on the yearly maximum and mean FAPAR, LST and daily precipitation data. It was found that the study area has indeed  significantly  gained  in  vegetation  cover.  In  those  areas  that  were  regreened  a strong cooling effect was observed, with temperatures up to 10\u00b0C lower than in the non-regreened areas. Daily precipitation in the regreened area was slightly higher than in the reference  area.  The extreme  cooling  can  partly  be  explained  by  enhanced  evaporative cooling over regreened areas. More research is needed to investigate whether the albedo effect of increased cloud cover could have played a role in cooling the land surface.",
