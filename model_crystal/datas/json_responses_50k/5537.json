To do so, Thierry used his engineering and scientist skills while developing new skills such as marketing, communication and costumer-development. Alongside the tool development, Thierry did some consultancy and training. For example, he trained engineers from a major tillage company to understand and know better the soil.\nSince 2018, Thierry launched its first product: zip drill mark 1 which is a retrofit kit to be mounted on existing Monosem NG+ 4, NG+ M and John Deere Max Emerge precision seeders. This equipment allows to transform a conventional planter into a no-till planter. It creates an advanced seed slot with clean-seed-to-soil contact, fertilizer at 5cm (2inch from the seed) and a perfect closure.\nIf you have any needs in terms of no-tillage equipment for your planter, feel free to contact Thierry and he will look at the best solutions for your seeds and seedlings.",
