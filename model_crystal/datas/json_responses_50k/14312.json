I have performed the following tasks for this project:\n\n- The test process has been made transparent and traceable for the project members and the management by organizing JIRA for the project with associated KPIs and reports.\nThis with the help of managing different test teams.\n- Introducing a chain test, in which entry and exit criteria were set up to start the User Acceptance Test. For the supplier, it became clear what entry criteria they had to meet to deliver the (sub) products before we could start the User Acceptance Test.\n- By allowing the Business to think about what to test in the previous test levels, findings were found much earlier. This resulted in less pressure on the User Acceptance Test and a shorter turnaround time of the test execution.\n- At the same time, KPN was in a transition from the waterfall way of working to the Agile way of working. This meant that I had to prepare the test process differently from the CARE layer at the chain test level. With the transition to the Agile way of working it was be possible to adjust the chain tests per sprint,\n- In collaboration with Agile Coaches and scrum teams, improvements were regularly made to the test process.",

Every day, a test report was generated from HP ALM with 1 push of a button, in which progress was automatically recorded. This information provided clarity towards the business and management.
