We do so by advising organisations on impact and sustainability.\nI specialised in impact measurement and management. I assist clients with designing and implementing impact strategies, carrying out impact assessments and evaluation studies, and developing tools. I aim to contribute to transparency and comparability in impact investing by facilitating harmonisation of impact measurement among investors. I have on-the-ground experience in both developed and emerging markets, as well as in fragile state environments. \nI have managed and carried out 30+ projects for international finance institutions, private equity and impact funds, NGOs and corporates. One of my main projects has been the development of the Joint Impact Model, a web-based tool enabling impact investors to measure employment, GDP contribution and carbon emissions supported by their portfolio in data-scarce environments. I have a good understanding of the dilemmas organisations may face in defining impact objectives, outlining their strategy, and collecting data to substantiate their progress. I supported numerous clients with pragmatic solutions, while ensuring alignment with international standards and harmonisation initiatives (e.g. PCAF, HIPSO). I also conducted numerous in-depth evaluation studies, assessing particular programs or topics (e.g. studies on how local value chains contribute to upgrading economies, and on linkages between employment programs and fragility) to derive learnings and recommendations. Methodologies I applied include input-output modelling, value chain mapping, surveys and stakeholder interviews.",
