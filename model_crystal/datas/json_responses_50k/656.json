    "summary": "I am passionate about sustainability and social interaction. This made me choose a master's in Political Science with a specialisation in Global Environmental Governance, Sustainability and Climate Change. The decision to choose a master's that did not logically follow my bachelor's in International Business Administration has enabled me to understand complex issues in the environment and sustainability realm in the private as well as the public sector. \n\nThe combination of these different studies has broadened my horizon about how corporate actors play a role in the larger, overarching system and has taught me that multisectoral collaboration is of vital importance for the improvement of the earth's state. \n\nMaking meaningful contributions with a positive impact on a large scale is what drives me. I like to approach other people to learn and to make progress. People would describe me as an enthusiastic, result-driven person who takes initiative and flourishes when working in a team.",

I was able to adapt to the family's environment very quickly, which was necessary because I would only work for them for one month. \n\nThis experience not only taught me about taking a lot of responsibilities and having to adapt to other cultural habits but also gave me a second family in Australia.",
