    "summary": "Officially a technician for computer aided design. Unfortunately my career was developing in an entirely different direction.\nThe first position I had was as a chemical technician in a copper producing company named Aqua (Bor, Serbia).\nAfter a couple of years I decided for a change.\nThe next 5 years, even though officially unemployed, i haven\u2019t stopped developing my skills further.\nIn 2010. my brother and me formed a hip-hop / jazz group called S.P.Q.R.\nA certain period of time had passed. The success of the group wasn\u2019t overwhelming- but encouraging. We were contacted by the Sophia university of films (Sophia, Bulgaria). Little did we know that the project in question wasn\u2019t as \u201csmall\u201d as we were meant to believe. The details provided to Us after the project had already started were quite surprising. \nIt was a project funded by the European committee which included cooperation between Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia.\nInstead of \u2018just\u2019 producing some of the music for the movie called \u2018Jalovina\u2019 by a Serbian director (and a dear personal friend) Mihajlo Kocev, we were instead offered to star in the movie.\nIncredible experience!!!\nThe following years have been a struggle. After a number of failed attempts to contact the employers I started a private business - house renovations and roof replacement. It was enough to provide for myself. I didn\u2019t love the job I was doing and that led me to the wondrous discovery of self enquiry. A process of discarding one owns ego. \nA painful and difficult task indeed, admitting your own faults and damaging patterns is not a ride for the feint of heart.\nAnother change (career wise), in a different environment was the solution.\nI came to the Netherlands in order to pursue my \u2018dreams\u2019 (important for the conclusion). \nAdjustment period, job hunting, adopting to the cultural differences, learning the language. These were just some of the issues I\u2019ve encountered. \nI was hired as house keeping at first, and eventually earned the position of an assistant manager. To elaborate, I did go through all stages of the corporate ladder. From a house keeper and a laundry operator, through reception and bar services, even the hotel maintenance.\nEventually I got to where I am now. Managing director of Dream and Drive classics. Who would\u2019ve thought...\nDon\u2019t give up on Your goals!!!\nWe can all Dream and Drive - it\u2019s legal.\n#drinkresponsible \n\nMarko Barbulovic",
