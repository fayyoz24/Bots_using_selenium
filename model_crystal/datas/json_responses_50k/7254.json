    "summary": "My studies until now have shown me how the everchanging economic environment suits my own drive for innovation and knowledge. Because of personal interests of mine, with in particular psychology and science, I get to learn and put into practice many concepts and ideas from various natures and combine them in my studies, internships, and projects.\n\nIf I were to put my achievements down, these would consist of the ones I acquired through constantly putting myself in uncomfortable environments and going through a process of turning discomfort into competency. There will never not be something to learn and improve upon, and this foresight will push me to strive to be better every day.\n\nWhat I look for in my pursuits is the ability to find the lengths I can go in helping others and myself achieve evermore accomplishments. The knowledge needed to discover the boundaries of these lengths is the core of what I will be looking for in my professional career.",
