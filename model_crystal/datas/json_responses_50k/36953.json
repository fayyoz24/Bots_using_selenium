After attending the panel I have produced a report of the panel discussion, which has refined my ability to understand and outline complex issues on multiple scales across various contexts. \n\nFurther, a major task I was entrusted with was to be a part of writing up the digest of Terrorism Threat Assessment of the Netherlands no. 54, a publication of the National Coordinator for Security and the Fight against Terrorism of the Netherlands.",
