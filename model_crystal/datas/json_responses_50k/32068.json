My main task was to develop a new cheesecake recipe, where I got to apply my knowledge on novel ingredients and their functionallity.  I was responsible for developing, but mainly improving samples for customers. This means that I would design cheesecake, apple pies or other bakery goods in such a way that it would satisfy customer needs, but also would be suitable for production in the factory. This demanded quite some creativity and knowledge to achieve the best, but still financially reasonable solution. I also got the freedom to be creative with designing recipes in my spare time, creating many new flavours.",
