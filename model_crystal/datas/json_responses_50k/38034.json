    "summary": "An avid translational scientist with a vested interest in HIV treatment and cure research. My current research is centered on investigating the landscape of HIV persistence and profiling immune responses in people with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. I have contributed to the design, development and validation of various technologies to study the latent and inducible viral reservoir. I have also applied many of these technologies to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological and immune-based interventions targeting the viral reservoir in several pre-clinical and clinical studies. I am strongly committed to linking and expanding my basic and translational research in Europe to African settings where infectious disease burden is high and extremely diverse. \nTo develop novel HIV therapeutics, which will be efficacious in highly diverse populations in Africa, crucial insights from the pre-clinical to clinical research pipeline need to reflect the intentional inclusion of African study participants and African Scientists to inform the design of novel and broadly applicable therapeutics. To this aim, I am involved in several infrastructure and capacity building and strengthening efforts in Southern and Eastern Africa to empower and accelerate locally relevant scientific research to tackle HIV and other (emerging)infectious diseases. \n\nOpen to engage and collaborate at various levels towards ensuring equitable, impactful and sustainable health research. \n",
