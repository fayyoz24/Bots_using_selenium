    "summary": "I am a senior scientist with over 40 years of experience in the chemical industry. Most of my time I was active in NMR, but over the years I was  developped new methods and equipment using IR, UV, GC and HPLC.\nFor many  projects, typically identification, I closely cooperated with IR and Mass Spectroscopy; In the polymer field, I joined forces with DSC, Molecular characterization and morphology groups.\nBesides doing  practical work I also trained many new people that joined the group over the years.\nThe last years I was responsible for keeping and expanding  the scientific knowledge level within the group.  \n\n",
