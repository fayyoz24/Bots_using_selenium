Different liquid chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry are routinely applied to study mAbs variants, but these techniques can resolve only the main antibody variants. The Fc receptor affinity chromatography is a highly selective technique to identify and separate antibody variants with tiny structural differences, which have a high impact on the interaction of mAbs with the Fc receptor. By hyphenation of the FcR affinity chromatography with high-resolution and very sensitive mass spectrometry, several low-abundant and highly similar structural variants can be detected. This method proves an efficient tool to assess antibody variants concerning the effect on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.",
