    "summary": "I'm an international development professional with a deep interest in leveraging information and communication technologies to address development challenges in a variety of contexts. My current work centers on improving patient-centered care through the use of digital adherence technologies and supporting national tuberculosis program systems to deliver quality healthcare to low-resource environments while collecting reliable, timely data for improved decision-making. In my spare time I am particularly interested in the use of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) for transportation of health supplies and lab samples in logistically-challenged areas.\n\nPast and ongoing interests range from building technologies to bridge the gap between paper-based and digital data, improving supply chain practices through global collaboration, the opportunity of ICTs to enable social and economic inclusion of Persons with Disabilities, and researching the impact of interactive technologies to improve maternal and child health during labor.",

Our final deliverable report briefly covers current revenue-creating practices and strategies of 14 different accelerators and more presents recommendations to the Unreasonable Institute of how to create an additional $50,000 annually in internally generated revenue. Our recommendations combine more common revenue builders such as alumni programs and corporate sponsorship with more creative strategies, such as entrepreneur speaker gigs and book deals.\n",

The History of Electricity project used Nitinol muscle wire, (shape metal alloy) LEDs, conductive paint, 3D printed objects and conventional craft materials to create a 3-scene interactive diorama. Both projects utilized the Arduino microprocessor system and custom code to exemplify how new computer technology can be paired with traditional materials to create new ideas of art, education, and interdisciplinary design.",
