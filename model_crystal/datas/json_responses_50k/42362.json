    "summary": "My background lies in Applied Physics. Both my bachelor and master theses focussed on the world of bionanoscience. My work experience at Krohne teached me about the oil industry and how to make a product from the drawing table until the actual production. In parallel I learned and worked with Agile Scrum, even becoming a Scrum Master. My hobbies involve crafting, animals, dancing and cooking. My passion lies with the environment, how to look after it and how it can keep me healthy (I love my vegatable garden and working with herbs) and with the holistic view on healing. The ultimate goal would be to connect my interest and skills in data engineering with these passions. \n\nI like working in an organized manner and completing things before moving on. Don't mind to work on a independent project for a while, but I feel that people working in a team can help grow each other and produce more increments. I am an open person and will give it to you straight. Please return the favor. I am here to learn. Forever. \n\nInterested in working together? At the moment I am good with BAM and also on maternity leave.\n\n\n\nNote to recruiters (1): I will not spend time on replying messages that are only describing a new job or asking for a CV without any personal interaction/conversation.\n\nNote to recruiters (2): I am not interested in working at a consultancy.\n\nNote to people who want to connect: If we did not meet in person or had no conversation what so ever, I will not accept your invitation.",

Part of the Portal is under my supervision and I am in the process of bringing the services from this environment to production, which includes rework to lower costs and improve speed. In the meanwhile the first new projects present themselves and give me the oppertunity to put my learnings from the past few months into practice. \n\nIn the time working at BAM, I already worked together with quite a lot of people and on quite a number of different projects. Data from different sources, discovering all different aspects within the Azure Portal (Databricks, Data Factory, Virtual Machines, SQL databases, App Services, Logic Apps) and still learning more about Power BI. In the mean time I also continued to develop my coding skills, mostly on SQL and C#.\n\nExtra courses:\n- C# beginner/intermediate/advanced training",

The main focus of my project was to create more insight into financial data with the use of visualizations and dashboards. Most of this is done in the form of Excel exports and PowerBI. \n\nBy now this project has become part of something larger. The company is looking for a way to gather all sorts of data, in such a way that it can be used more easily for findings KPI results. I am now part of the team responsible for gathering requirements, building database schema's and inventing dashboards to help visualizing these KPI's.  \n\nAnother project is a data conversion job, where a client needs to change an Excel sheet to a RDF (Turle) file in order to import it in their database. This required a lot of data cleaning and learning about RDF and graphical databases. \n\nIn parallel I am solving smaller questions and further developing my R, Python and Power BI skills.",

This required me to work together with the Meachanics team (3 FTE) for further development and investigations and with the Production department (3 FTE) to explain/help with the buildup of the magnet parts. During this period I learned a lot about working with people from different levels and converting highly detailed knowledge into plain English. Next to that I worked a lot with Origin and Ansys to do simulations and present the work.\n  - Later the focus shifted more toward model development together with the Physics team (5 FTE). This requires me to participate in brainstorm sessions, setup experiments, running the experiments, doing data analysis, writing reports and giving presentations all to improve the models used in our product. During this time I improved my overall NMR knowledge and fluid properties knowledge. Next to that I got pretty skilled in working with Scilab and Matlab.\n  - Parallel to previous described tasks, I was involved in the monthly Technical Lunch Meetings, reviewing/distributing patents related to our research, helping with the realisation of our new building, doing product calibrations at Xcaliber and overseeing experimens at external companies. These tasks helped me improve my softskills and my understanding of scientific reading/writing.\n\nExtra courses:\n- Ansys Design Modeler\n- Ansys Maxwell\n- Ansys Mechanical Introduction\n- Robotics training",
