My interest lies in product strategy and innovation, where I love to contribute to with my natural feel for trends and skills to create value propositions. As a tackler of big challenges, I take up undefined (design) problems in a structured way guided by Design Thinking methods. This can be seen in my graduation assignment, where I designed a practical tool to motivate employees for strategy realization.",
