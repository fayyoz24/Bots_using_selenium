One of the possible solution to avoid this turbo lag is by additionally mounting an electric supercharger. In this project, the design of the electric supercharger was carried out using IBM Rhapsody. Various SysML models were created to describe the structure and behaviour of the system.  Also,  a generic model was created in MATLAB which would compute the required boost pressure and mass airflow as a function of engine speed to resolve any given gap between the desired and actual torque. Finally, a simple integration was carried out and tested with the MATLAB and the IBM Rhapsody model. ",

In the progress towards first on-road application of RCCI technology, experimental studies have to be supported by proper modelling tools which can support both understanding the combustion phenomena and control system development.  TNO introduced a multi-zone modelling approach including chemical kinetics (referred to as the XCCI model) to reflect the combustion process using air and fuel path input parameters. \n\nTasks:\nThe aim of the graduation project was to develop a procedure to automate and calibrate/optimize the tuning parameters of the heavy duty (HD) dual fuel RCCI engine model developed in Matlab. \n\nAction:\nA 3 stage optimization procedure was designed which required large scale model simulations on a high performance cluster (HPC) on Linux platform. The concept of least squares/weighted least squares techniques was used.\n\nResults:\nAn automatic tuning procedure was developed which provided fit results in simulation times significantly lower (roughly 40-50%) than previously adopted approaches. In addition, a global fit procedure was also developed using parameter estimation methods.",

Based on software evaluation and development tools at DAF, suitable recommendations need to be made. \n\nAction: \nActively researched various software packages based on the requirements by preparing a list of pros and cons. Evaluated the BASELABS Create and vADASdeveloper software packages in detail. Also, provided a short demo during final presentation to indicate how these tools can aid the current development process at DAF with respect to sensor fusion\n\nResults:\nSuitable recommendations of software packages were made based on the development tool chain at DAF, cost factors, usability of software packages and their reliability. The outcome from the demo resulted in promising feedback for a further one year detailed investigation with the software.",
