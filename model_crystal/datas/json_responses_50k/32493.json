Also, being socially astute, I can fast find my footing in a structured/unstructured/high pressure work environment.  \n\nIn general about life, Work/Stay mostly kept me in India and Middle East until 2020, when I decided to relocate to the Netherlands with my Spouse, when she was offered a great career opportunity. Being an adaptive, inquisitive mind that I am, I too found the possibility of moving to a new country exciting and its been worth it.\n\nIn my free time, I like to cook, travel and browse the net, to help keep myself updated with what's happening around the world.",
