National borders are fading and cities sit at the heart of a country's economic and cultural well-being. Cities need to deal with many challenges: from flooding of rivers in downtown centers to the constant changing demands of society.\n\nAnd we are here to help! We provide comprehensive approaches to urban development planning and design, landscaping, smart transportation, urban regeneration and marketing. We create viable and durable urban plans which not only help create, build or maintain places of distinction - but also help to compete on a global platform.\n\nOur design-led propositions of Mobility Oriented Development (MODe), Regeneration, Resiliency and Investable Masterplanning respond to these challenges and contribute to improving the quality of life.\n\nWe\u2019re doing this for a diverse group of clients, including governments (cities, provinces and regions), commercial developers that are looking at brownfield regeneration as well as for transportation companies and affiliates to bring long-term value through design to the station and its surrounding built assets.\n\nCallisonRTKL combines the legacy of two great design practices into an even stronger, more distinct voice that is characterized by the strength of our ideas, the spirit of our culture and the passion of our people to make the world a better place.\n\nWe\u2019re a small team of extremely driven people in Berlin with a global pool of expertise and knowledge behind us. Our roots are Dutch, and so is our mother company: Arcadis. A built asset design and consultancy founded in 1888, we are 27,000 people active in over 70 countries that generate \u20ac3.4 billion in revenues. CallisonRTKL opened its Berlin office in 2016.\n\nIf this introduction got you interested to work with us, as a client or a team member, please get in contact.",
