    "summary": "My great joy is the creation of an inspiring learning and teaching experience and environment at educational institutions which are interested to stimulate creativity and wonderment in young adults for a better future. This could either be geared directly as artistic skills and craftsmanship in an academy or, indirectly and more broadly, as a free and creative mindset in educational environments beyond the traditional arts. \n\nThrough the multitude of projects that I have been involved in, I am well connected to a large international network of professionals within both the academic as well as practicing community in the fields of art, design, fashion, and architecture. \n\nI have been described as an efficient and practical, proactive, and result-oriented team player with a sense of leadership. One of my strengths is to inspire others through my enthusiasm for content and vision and convey a sense of passion that draws in and unites forces. My core experiences and abilities include everyday management in an educational and cultural institution, supervising a team of professionals (internal/ external) and support staff in an enabling, cooperative, and inclusive style: focused on connecting people, yet allowing for differences; asking questions and listening; acting as a coach but also capable of taking decisions and setting boundaries, implementing and continuous development of ambitions and a vision, carrying final responsibility for curriculum and its execution, budget responsibility, establishing and maintaining an external professional network, representing the ambitions and vision in the fields of art & design education.\n\nI have been contributing to and curating many exhibitions, have been teaching at various universities worldwide, and have written numerous articles and published books on a wide range of topics.",

Due to demographic, political and economic forces, and the many restricting building regulations Hong Kong seem to suffer from a monotonous and unfulfilling housing market. The government as well developers and architects seem to struggle to foster diversity and community values. Low-rise developments are disappearing rapidly and replaced by monotonous money-making extrusions of simple tower floor plans. Unfortunately, Hong Kong\u2019s housing market has become a tense investment market where diversity, community values and living conditions seem to have lost their meaning. How can Hong Kong\u2019s housing development escape its unrelenting uniformity and the denial of diversity? How can Hong Kong benefit from its scarcity of land and population density?\nCan we re-invent the Hong Kong housing tower by vertically mixing various programs and with it create more porous towers and a more 3 dimensional city? What housing towers appear when various other activities and program are integrated? What vertical organization is then needed? What vertical communities could emerge? What community values and living qualities can be discovered? And what kind of architecture can accommodate and facilitate the proposed mixed program?\nThis studio explored and investigated the potential of mixed-use housing towers and showcased various spatial concepts for vertical integration of mixed program. Students studied and explored new forms of vertical living strategies by mixing housing program with additional program such as farming, recreation, culture, sports, nature, education and shopping. Students investigated the motives and spatial and social qualities of vertical mixing. A series of first attempts of mixed-use housing towers have been produced.",

In contrast to other global cities, the repetitive design lacks variation in size of units, outdoor space, diversity in typologies, ecology as well as architectural excitement. \nHow to add more value by creative design? And which design parameters will then lead to housing towers beyond the current extrusion model? \nThis studio is a follow up on previous studio 'Hong Kong Tower Revolution' and aims at exploring various concepts for housing towers beyond extrusion. This will be done in two phases. \nPhase 1 will study the organization and layout of apartments by investigating everyday activities such as cooking, dining, bathing, sleeping, storing, relaxing, studying and propose improvements of these activities. These improvement ask for specific architectural elements and lead to new exciting apartment typologies.\nPhase 2 will explore and identify various motives for housing towers that go beyond the current standard of monotonous extrusion. From this research, a new approach on the design of these motives beyond extrusion such as vertical transportation, the maximum building envelope, mix of (collective) program, the (structural) core, will be tested. \nThe outcome of this phase will be combined with the improved apartments of the first phase, resulting in a set of attractive housing towers that reflect the desired variation and diversity.",

In contrast with the competition with other global cities, the repetitive design seem to lack size variation, outdoor spaces, diversity, greenness, ecology as well as a lack of architectural excitement. How can Hong Kong\u2019s housing escape its unrelenting uniformity and the denial of diversity? How to escape from the current stringent planning and building regulations? How to create more qualities? And what qualities should that be?\nThis studio studied the organization of apartments and looked into the different types of rooms and their functions. It explored various activities such as cooking, dining, bathing, sleeping, storing, relaxing and made proposals for improvement of these activities. Each improvement required a specific spatial quality and led to new apartment typologies. Some qualities included higher ceilings, more window openings, different room shapes, more outdoor spaces or more privacy. Other qualities asked for different connections, better natural cooling, more sustainable measures or better access and views to the outdoor. This studio opened the discussion for a more diverse housing development and proposed various motives for both horizontal and vertical mixing that led to housing towers with a higher amount of porosity (open space). It showcased 30 alternative residential tower typology designs that can be understood as a first step to add more diversity to the Hong Kong housing market. The towers were measured against value indicators such as view, direct sunlight, indirect light, access to outdoor space, and amount of useable space.\nThe studio results were exhibited at the 2013 Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/ Architecture (UABB) in Hong Kong.",

It is a unique part of Rotterdam; it combines the present and the past, old warehouses with modern architecture and life style. The warehouse 'Las Palmas' is now giving space to the Beeldfabriek which is an educational institution and the Photomuseum Rotterdam. The rest of the building will be occupied by offices. A purely cultural building with a very strong identity has been degraded to an ordinary office building without much cultural spirit and power to resurrect the area. How to re-invent a cultural place with a strong identity? How to make this dream called 'Little Manhattan at the Maas' come true? 'Las Palmas Experience' adds an urban quality to the pier. The roof of the Las Palmas building located in the center of the Wilhelminapier gets accessible by placing a wooden dock-like structure on top, which is connected by escalators on each side of the building. It becomes a round-the-clock up-lifted public plaza. The usability of this plaza is diverse. The flexible structure gives space to public and private functions, whereas the plain design makes it easy practicable to ensure the potentials of the dream. It absorbs a healthy mix of culture, commerce and leisure. It is surprising at any moment of the day and night. A real revelation to all the people with all kinds of expectations, from young to old, from local inhabitants to employers to tourists and investors. 'Las Palmas Experience' is a real urban meeting point - a cultural stage for the city of Rotterdam with an enormous force of attraction. All kinds of cultural institution can use this plaza as a satellite. Different programs varying from local to regional and to international events can take place on this unique urban plaza. The warehouse 'Las Palmas' becomes a cultural magnet again!",

The stipend consists of a prize of \u20ac 10,000 and was established to support young, talented artists in their development abroad. The jury has nominated three candidates from fourteen applications. The jury has noticed that all candidates have an international orientation and will research hidden subcultures and innovative forms of presentation. The artists give substance to questions such as: \"What nostalgic memories do we have and how do cultures influence the choice of materials, media and performances?\u201d \nIn addition to the name-giver George Verberg, this year's jury consists of Dorothea van der Meulen (Dean of Minerva Academy and chair of the jury), Tiham\u00e9r Salij (head of Fine Art and Workshops), Sarianne Breuker (lecturer in Fine Art) and Frederiek Bennema (lecturer in theory courses).\n\nAnna Fitas\nAnna surprised the jury with her excellent research question, beautiful presentation and artistic vision. Anna will relate the worlds of light and dark to man and the current theme of climate change. Through new stories, images and starting points, Anna will set to work with the aim of making a contribution to raising awareness about climate change. The jury expects the grant to make a special contribution to the further development of her artistic calling.",

S.I.A. studies possible living strategies and lifestyles and formulates the spatial, social, economic, and ecological qualities, analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. S.I.A. has been researching current spatial trends and predicting how they can manifest in the built environment if they continue to persist. S.I.A. provides global and local foresight to create innovative insights that lead to the type of urbanity the city will need to change. S.I.A. focuses in particular on the topics of concern potentially needed to bring future spatial change to the city and takes an explicit universal approach to strategic planning by linking macro trends to local issues. S.I.A. aims to set an international agenda for research, design, and innovation for what society is, in particular, what the city, its products, architectures, landscapes, infrastructures, and networks could be; a blueprint for the next to come.\n\nProjects (selection): Happy Bike City, Macuil Tochtli, Waalhaven, The Next City, Total Housing, NL28 Olympic Fire, EvoluCity - RDM Innovation&Science Center, Las Palmas Experience, Pleasure Edge, Talent Factory, M11, Satellite City",
