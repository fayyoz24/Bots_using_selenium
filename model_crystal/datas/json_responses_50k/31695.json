Thus, the lack of water is a type of dangerous event,\rbeing classified as a water vulnerability, also known as water poverty. Water poverty is a\rsocially constructed process, and reproduced through multiple socio-political processes of\rexclusion and discrimination, ranging from the macro level to the microcosm of households.\rVulnerability is measured with a risk indicator. In the case of water vulnerability, this measurement is made by the water poverty index (WPI). However, the present WPI presents\rproblems, such as difficulty in obtaining all indicators, the main one being the imprecision\rof the variables. Thus, the objective was to model these uncertainties using a more appropriate methodology: fuzzy logic. As a case study, the fuzzy water poverty index is applied\rin 5,655 Brazilian municipalities. Based on data, the 2010 Census and the National Sanitation Information System. Access to water sources and basic sanitation (water and sewage)\rwere analyzed. As a work tool, MATLAB and Excel software were used. Two different ways\rwere used to aggregate the final outputs: weighted average, and network of connected fuzzy\rinference systems. Final results of the Water Poverty Fuzzy Index (WPFI) indicate that\rBrazilian municipalities have managed to democratize access to water. On the other hand,\rsanitation did not accompany this process. This distinct combination leads to the idea that\rBrazil does not have a water vulnerability situation, however, the lack of sanitation is what\rbrings Brazilian municipalities, and consequently their population, to a situation of water\r\nvulnerability.",
