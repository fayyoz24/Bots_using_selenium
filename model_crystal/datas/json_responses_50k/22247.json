    "summary": "Rigorously logical, responsible and independent inspector. Familiar with HACCP and physical and chemical laboratory experiments. \n\nI am a third-year student of the international bachelor program: Process and Food Technology (PFT) of the Hague University of Applied Science. In 2015, I graduated from Changchun Foreign Language School. I am interested in physics and chemistry, because of reaction phenomena show the beauty of science. I enjoy doing physical and chemical experiments. By training for studies, I can critically analyse data with numeracy skills, and I am also good at Visio. \n\nMy first internship is a study of polysaccharide and soluble dietary fiber extraction and their bioactivities of Panax Ginseng in the Chinese Academy of agricultural science institute of specialty.
