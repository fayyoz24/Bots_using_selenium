Every year the Impact Centre develops the Management Scope Corporate Impact Index to map out developments in the field of employment, sustainability and finance. In addition to data collection, the aim of the internship is to develop an improved model for impact measurement. I have learned about sustainability in environment and people, I have discussed about inclusivity, diversity, concerned about sustainability, the difference in standards and evaluating. My task was collecting datas, scoring, checking. I had opportunity to give opinion on how to improve the evaluation, what the quantitative research may miss.",
