    "summary": "I am a passionate and internationally-oriented masters student of public policy and human development at the United Nations University-MERIT and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance. In this programme I am specialising in migration.\n\nMy bachelor's degree is in European Studies from the Maastricht University Faculty of Arts and Social sciences. During my studies I was a student ambassador for the faculty and I was a volunteer for ISAP and Match Maastricht. These experiences were very rewarding and helped me develop and improve a number of skills, such as (cross-cultural) communication, public speaking and tutoring. My job at AtlasV Singapore also enabled me to hone my non-academic writing skills. \n\nIn my third year of my bachelor's I had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester. I studied at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I am very grateful for this opportunity as I got to travel a lot and learn about the myriad of cultures in Singapore and the region. Upon returning I also got the chance to participate in the Maastricht Research Based Learning excellence programme, through which I got to research the state of transformative justice in Argentina. \n\nWhen I am not studying or working, I like to relax by playing some music or catching up with my friends. I also enjoy studying martial arts, in particular Pencak Silat. At the end of a busy day, cooking a healthy meal makes the day complete.",
