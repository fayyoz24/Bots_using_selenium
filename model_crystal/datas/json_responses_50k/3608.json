    "summary": "In the past years I\u2019ve focussed on extending my knowledge on hospitality in both practical and academic level. I managed to finish my post-secondary vocational education in Hotel Management at ROC Mondriaan The Hague, learning the basics of providing and managing a hospitality company. I continued with my bachelor at Hotelschool The Hague, were I fine tuned my leadership skills and obtained academic knowledge on managing and changing various industries. \n\nI have worked in 3 different countries across Europe during my internships and was member of the head board of Students\u2019 Associating Senti Questo, where I fulfilled the role of events manager. \n\n I  finished my Thesis on implementing a new hotel concept in The Hague tourism market. Besides writing my Thesis, I worked full-time in the role of operations supervisor (Front office & Food&Beverage) at Moxy, Schiphol Airport and fullfill the role as event manager at Beachclub Soomers during the summer period. After graduating I started my new journey in catering & events at Karsten & Kuiper.",
