    "summary": "As an International student and International student Ambassador, my passion for businesses and diverse cultures was ignited through living in various countries, including South Africa, Zambia, and Ethiopia. This led me to pursue my studies in The Netherlands, which provided me with a culturally diverse learning environment.\n\nThrough my experiences, I have learned the significance of diversity and understanding cultural nuances when collaborating in an international setting. While my high school education included Business courses through the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, first year in International Business at NHL Stenden provided me with practical knowledge and experience in areas such as Organisation & People, Marketing & Sales, Supply Chain & Operations Management, and Finance & Accounting. I am currently transitioning to Creative Business to explore another side of the business world, I am excited to see what this transition brings to my personal and professional development. \n\nFurthermore, I have gained hands-on experience working with classmates and real companies, providing me with an initial insight into the business world. I am excited to continue my studies and contribute to my community while gaining experience.",
