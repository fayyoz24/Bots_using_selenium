The scope of the current work is to assess the effects of space environmental conditions on the durability of thermal coatings (ceramics/white paint materials) and their expected usefulness to perform their assigned functions over the expected period of the spacecraft\u2019s or subsytem\u2019s mission operations. The test facility simulates space environment by performing thermal aging/cycling and VUV-UV radiation on materials exposed under high vacuum conditions. Experimental material analysis methods are performed at beginning of life (BOL), i.e. before accelerated space testing and at end of life (EOL), i.e. after accelerated space testing. These experimental methods include UV/VIS/NIR Spectroscopy for thermo-optical properties measurements, Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition evaluation, and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) for surface roughness measurements.",

The goal of this project is to study the mechanical, metallurgical properties and corrosion resistance of welded coating (stainless steels) so we can determine in what extend the post heat treatments can improve the coating properties. Several techniques are used such as X-Ray and neutron diffraction, incremental hole-drilling method and electrochemical tests. The samples in study are provided by ARSOPI S.A. company.",
