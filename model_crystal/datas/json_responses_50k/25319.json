    "summary": "I am an architectural designer who is driven by a passion for contributing to a more resilient coexistence between the diverse geography and multicultural populace of my home country, Ecuador. As such, my design process stems from my concern and purpose in shaping a more resilient infrastructural and social development of Ecuador in the backdrop of a global human advancement, while being shaped by my study and practice internationally - the United States, Spain, and the Netherlands. \n\nAlways adaptable, systematic in problem-solving and result-oriented in work, I am open to work on various fields of landscape, urban and building projects, which are shown by my history of working in a wide range of projects of different purposes, such as architecture, landscape, urban planning, graphic design, photography, and plastic arts.",
