The final result of the project was presented in a report and a presentation. \nThe project covered different subject areas such as Economics, Financial Accounting, Statistics, and others.  \nThe project helped me to get a better understanding of the connections between the different subjects and also helped to give the students a more \"real life\" approach to the covered content.

Our group had to come up with a product that we would want to sell. We then had to set up the whole business minding the areas marketing, managerial accounting, human resources and law. We had to work on each area of the project and were assessed through two reports (one progress report and the final report) as well as a presentation. In the presentation, we had to convince our teachers of the feasibility of the project and company. \nThe project was really helpful to get an impression different areas of a business and to see the connection between the different areas. Furthermore, the project helped us to require more knowledge in the four different main areas. Another benefit that we gained through the project was gaining experience with working in intercultural teams and team working skills in general.  ",
