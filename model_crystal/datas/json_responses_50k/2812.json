    "summary": "I am a freelance graphic designer. I have worked at many places, but now I am working independently. As a child, my favourite way to pass time was to draw and create crayon figures. Today I can do this as my profession! The crayon first turned into brush and later into electronic tools. Since I won an Erasmus scholarship during college I have obtained a lot of experience both in Hungary and in the Netherlands. My environment is very important to me. This gives me the inspiration and the drive. Hence why I love travelling and getting to know new cultures. I am currently living in the Netherlands, while my works are being published both within and outside Europe. During the years I spent in graphic design, I have worked in many fields. The one closest to my heart is, when I create a company's logo and it's branding, which is in harmony with the company itself, moreover communicates it's message both using online and offline forms. I have taken part in various other projects. For example I have created packaging for handmade marmalade, a publication of a jubilee book and several other animations.\n\nPlease, check my portfolio here: \n",
