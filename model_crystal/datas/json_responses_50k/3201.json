    "summary": "Since 2012 I have been working as Education in Emergencies Advisor at Plan International Ireland providing technical support to country teams. I have been deploying through Plan International Roster to support Country teams to respond to sudden onset disasters such as the Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and the Nepal Earthquake, complex emergencies and refugee crisis including the Syrian refugee response in Jordan and in Egypt, the Lake Chad crisis in Nigeria, the conflict in Central African Republic, the Malian Refugee Crisis (Northern Mali), the Rohingya Refugee response in Bangladesh. My last deployment has been to Moldova and Romania in February 2022 to support the Ukraine Refugee response. On behalf of Plan International, I co-chair the Global Education Cluster Cash task team and represent the organization in the INEE Accelerated Education working group. Before joining Plan Ireland\u2019s team, I worked for various Italian NGOs by supporting programmes in the Balkans, DRC, Sri Lanka during the Tsunami Response and in the Middle East for five years.",
