    "summary": "If there\u2019s one certainty in life, it is that we live in a constantly changing world. That means we need to constantly adapt, change and realign our work. From the design, approach, tools and methods we use, to the people involved in the process. \n\nThat's why I founded The Adaptation Company. I support organisations as a facilitator, project/programme manager and advisor throughout their adaptation process. Collaborative, inclusive and with a splash of humour are key words to describe my approach doing so.\n\nI enjoy advising on the puzzle that is presented. What is the exact challenge? What needs to be achieved? Who needs to be on board? What steps need to be taken to get there? Tackling the challenge step by step has proven a useful recipe.\n\nAs a facilitator I love bringing practitioners together for interactive and participatory in-person or online sessions so they can tackle the issues they face by making use of the collective knowledge of the group.\n\nOrganizing, planning and forecasting are my middle names, I often jokingly say, so count me in on anything related to managing and coordinating these processes (waterfall or Agile style).\n\n\ud83d\udcda Themes I have worked on are conflict transformation, peacebuilding, community building, leadership, gender-responsive governance, integrity promotion, local governance and youth participation in peace and justice. More recently, the topic of organisational culture and development has caught my attention. \n\n\ud83c\udf10 I have had the pleasure to gain academic experience in Turkey, work experience in The Netherlands, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon and extensive programmatic experience in Tunisia, Jordan, Morocco, The United Kingdom and Ukraine, and on Yemen. Next to that it has been an absolute joy to facilitate programmes for professionals from more than 65 countries from all over the world these past years.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Former colleagues describe me as a person who 'gets things done', referring to my love for settings things in motion, delivering quality results and discovering and learning new insights along the way. As a training participant shared \"I commended Kelly after the training program that she would make a good host for an event, anytime. She was patient with the participants and easy to understand\".",
