This solution requires no decision or respect of any rules by the users. Thus no control administration is required.

If space organizations cannot or do not share lessons they learn, then the all-important means of continuous improvement and avoidance of past mistakes is greatly diminished. The IPMC has recognized the importance of sharing Lessons Learned and has now organised a second workshop on this theme to be held at ESTEC on 22nd March 2013.\nDuring the first event, experts from key Space Agencies (NASA, CNES, JAXA, DLR and ESA) and Industry (Astrium), shared their best practices related to the role of Lessons Learned in different phases of programs or projects. The second workshop seeks to progress towards fostering the sharing of Lessons Learned across the member Space Agencies. Dr Kass is advising and helping the IPMC organize the content of this challenging event. ",
