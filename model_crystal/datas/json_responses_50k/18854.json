    "summary": "As a dynamic and driven management professional, I am thrilled to introduce myself, Sukrit Bhatia. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Specialisation: Management in the Digital Age`) from the esteemed University of Amsterdam, where I actively participated in a range of academic and extracurricular leadership roles.\n\nDuring my time as a Risk Response Intern at The Heineken Company, I honed my expertise in strategic planning, financial control, and risk management. Notably, I earned praise for my outstanding leadership in consolidating the year-end results cycle across more than 60 operational companies across multiple regions. As an Operational Support Specialist, I was instrumental in improving the identification of challenges and needs for Adyen's vast merchant population.\n\nMy versatility extends to my experience as a social media strategist, marketing consultant, and professional tutor. At Good Good Piggy, I optimized organic impressions and increased follow conversion rates significantly. I also provided exceptional education as a tutor and study coach in courses such as Innovation Management and International Business at Athena Studies.\n\nDriven by my passion for strategic management, I am determined to make a meaningful contribution to an organization's success. With my impeccable organizational, communication, and leadership skills, I am confident that I can add value to any team.",
