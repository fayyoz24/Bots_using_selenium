In July 2012, I was promoted to be an Associate Internal Auditor with higher grade code. This role involved leadership responsibilities as a team leader (In Charge Auditor). These responsibilities included defining the scope of the audit, assigning sub-teams to handle different sections, monitoring the progress and presenting results to management by writing the final audit reports. I was able, along with my team, to execute several process audits in different areas at the university, specifically: Core Labs & Research Centers, Medical Clinic & Services, Staff Health Insurance, Residential & Housing Services, Schools, Purchasing and Procurement, Utilities and Maintenance, Health & Safety, Capital Assets, and Payroll.",
