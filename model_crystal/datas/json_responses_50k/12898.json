Supported by 100 Resilient Cities, Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, Global Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation, UN/World Bank - High Level Panel on Water. \n\nIn this role, I have conducted extensive research, designed spatial plans and schemes, illustrated drawings and graphical content, conducted community engagement workshops, conducted stakeholder consultations, prepared tender documents for International Financing Institutions like the Green Climate Fund and World Bank and further collaborated with organisations like UN Habitat, Partners for Resilience and Red Cross Society.\n\nI am also currently involved in the development of a Local Energy Action Plan for Energy Transition in Bospolder Tussendijken in Rotterdam for the IABR-Atelier Rotterdam. \"With LEAP, which is being researched and advanced by Rotterdam-based OOZE Architects and Urbanists, the IABR \u2013 Atelier Rotterdam delves deeply into BoTu to (be able to) explore how the energy transition can serve as a lever for a broader qualitative leap toward the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals on the scale level of the neighborhood.\" The LEAP has been exhibited at the IABR-DOWN TO EARTH-2020 'WHOSE ENERGY IS IT ANYWAY?'. The exhibition has been an important tool in creating dialogue between stakeholder in BoTu and further conversations for local action in achieving energy transition. \n\nAdditional responsibilities include Public Relations, website management and social media communications for OOZE.",
