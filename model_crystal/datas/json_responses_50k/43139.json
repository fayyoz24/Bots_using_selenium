We decided to write the project in C++ (while at the time we all had very little to no experience with it) in order to practice for summer internships. We used ANTLR4 as the parser and lexer and then designed and coded the intermediate representations and code generation as well as implement optimisations such as register allocation by graph colouring, constant folding, side-affecting expressions and classes. This was one of the projects I've had the most fun doing so far, I learnt so much about C++ and its different features as well as finally creating a compiler after so many years of \"just finding them interesting\".",
