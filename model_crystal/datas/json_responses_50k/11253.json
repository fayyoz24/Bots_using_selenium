Additionally, after my experience in Events through managing Erasmus Extreme, I've decided to explore my organizational skills and if that could potentially become a field of work for me (as it is definitely one of my passions and I'd love to work in that industry). Hence, through continuous research Venturescapes came into my sight, and I've not regretted it ever since. \n\nVenturescapes is an (online) events company active in three niche markets: Event hospitality, Virtual Experiences, and Incentive events. During Covid, Venturescapes has progressed from being an on-site event manager towards working more behind the scenes and organizing the virtual aspect of online work conferences and meetings, including boxing of goody bags and further necessities. I'm very glad to gain this insight into the behind-the-scenes of international and professional events, and am incredibly excited for all the learning moments yet to come!",
