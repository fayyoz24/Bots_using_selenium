    "summary": "I'm a technology leader, software architect, and tech strategist with 19+ years of experience building and delivering software, creating strategies, leading teams, coaching, and mentoring.\n\nMy current focuses are architecture, digital transformation, and technical strategy.\n\nI have a track record of delivering global strategies, and big-impact business initiatives, building and growing engineering organizations, and designing highly scalable solutions.\n\nI believe in taking a broad perspective when designing and optimizing processes and ways of working in project and program management. This is why I have, over the past decade, completed a number of pieces of training and education for different methodologies, including LSS, Scrum (Mastera and PO), and Kanban.\n\nMy architecture approach is influenced by TOGAF, evolutionary architecture, and risk-driven architecture styles.\n\nAs a coach-style leader, I empower individuals to grow and foster a supportive team culture.",
