    "summary": "\u201cBeyond: \u2018space is scarce\u2019 and \u2018not everything is possible'\" \n\nMany sustainability challenges come down to a lack of scarce space. The energy transition requires space; climate change adaptation requires space; sustainable agriculture requires space. At the same time, space is needed for housing, travelling and amenities. Henceforth, spatial sustainability challenges can easily become politicized. All of us, in our capacity as a citizen, policymaker, politician entrepreneur, parent and so forth will be affected by sustainability transformations, both those ongoing and those forthcoming, in the years and decades to come. How can we improve societal decision making in such a way that we maximize the solution space, but at the same time are enabled to reach fair and legitimate compromises once tough political choices are on the table? My research and teaching focus on two specific contributions to this wide-ranging issue:\n\n-          citizen engagement in regional water- and climate governance\n-          improved science-policy interactions through knowledge co-creation",

This programme was recently awarded a grant of 5.4 Million Euros by the European Union (FP7). The project is focused on analysing, explaining, evaluating and designing policies to better deal with flood risks from rivers in urban agglomerations across Europe. The results of this ambitious programme are expected to be highly relevant for policies and law at the European, national and regional level and for the development of public-private partnerships. STAR-FLOOD runs from 1 October 2012 until 31 March 2016.\r\n",

                    "description": "My PhD research dealt with transitions in wastewater infrastructures in several Western European countries. These wastewater infrastructures are often criticized for consuming too much water, treating wastewater in an inefficient way and for their failure to reuse and recycle water and nutrients. Furthermore, maintenance of infrastructures is often lagging behind and there are hormone and medicine residues present in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants. From a development perspective it is often argued that the \u2018WC-sewage combination\u2019 has become a desirable status symbol for developing countries, and for that reason hampers the development of \u2018appropriate\u2019 sanitary infrastructures for the poor. \nThe sustainable transformation of wastewater infrastructures is often portrayed as a choice between centralized and decentralized systems. I aimed, however, to look beyond this dichotomy and looked for \u2018modernized mixtures\u2019, win-win situations between both extremes.\n\nI carried out a comparative case study analysis of Dutch, German and Swedish pilot projects in which wastewater management technologies are experimented with in a domestic setting. Desk research, participatory observation and interviews with consumers and providers have been used to analyze innovation processes in various eco-villages and other new building areas.\n\nMy research showed that innovation in wastewater infrastructures is much focused on developing technologies for solving sustainability problems, but that many projects fail to address the question for which problems the new technologies form a solution, how the problems can best be understood and who should play what role in solving the problems. Furthermore, the life-world of the domestic end-user should more often form the starting point: the wishes and demands of end-users concerning convenience, hygiene, esthetics and status provide insight in the opportunities and pitfalls for successful innovation in sanitation.",
