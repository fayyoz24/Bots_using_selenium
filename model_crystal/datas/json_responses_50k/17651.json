Then they were thrown on the streets. Now living in that church for a few months, they need every support they can get. The other volunteers and me try to give that to them. I've become their friend and show them my support, which seems to mean a lot for them. We make them visible. Even after de Vluchtkerk is gone, I will keep on supporting them and fighting for their case."
