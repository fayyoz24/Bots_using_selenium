    "summary": "I have been very fortunate, and also very lucky, to be able to acquire my international experience in space programme implementation, management and operations by working on five of the nine spacecraft that attempted to land on Mars since 1997 (three were successful). My current position on ESA's international ExoMars project will take the lessons from Schiaparelli in 2016 to land the Rosalind Franklin rover with our Russian partners in 2023.  \n\nI am excited about Mars exploration and how what we learn in getting to Mars, and what we learn on Mars serves as a mirror to examine our existence on Earth.",

Specifically, these activities involve putting together the pieces of hardware that become the TGO, EDM, and the Rover, and also checking at each step that all the pieces are functioning properly. The goal of these activities is to verify that each spacecraft can complete all of the functions enabling it to accomplish its mission.\n\nSecond, my team and I are responsible for ensuring that all the scientific instruments for the ExoMars programme are compatible with the spacecraft and can accomplish their scientific objectives. This responsibility covers the nine instruments of the scientific payload on the Rover, the five instruments on the TGO, and the instrument package on the EDM. The range of instruments - from orbiting spectrometers (ACS and NOMAD) to a Rover-mounted ground-penetrating-radar (WISDOM) - is broad, which makes the task both interesting and challenging.",
