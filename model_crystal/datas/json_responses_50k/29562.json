            "description": "Project ROYAL FALCONS was commenced in November 2011 by Team Gear Shifters under the leadership of Anshul Singhal (Team Captain) and Varun Das(Team Vice-captain). \n\nThe team had purchased a Honda CBR 600f2 carbureted engine (1992 model), with the intention to learn and convert the engine to fuel-injection system successfully.\n\nHaving joined mid-way on 7th September 2013, I was dedicated and quick in learning the necessities of electronics in car and my objective in the project.\n\nBy 1st December 2013, the electronic section had begun converting the engine to fuel-injection system. On receiving MoTec Engine Management kit, we distributed our work into two sections:\n\n1. ECU mounting and wiring setup \n2. Software setup and engine optimization.\n\nI undertook the second task which involved exploring forums, Webinars, understanding the manual and interaction with engine tuning engineers in Dubai.\n\nDuring this process, additional goals were drawn for the electronic section. These involved mainly ergonomic technologies: paddle-shifting and dashboard display.\n\nPaddle-shifting assembly was purchased from Proshift while the dashboard display involved an Acewell RPM meter and Arduino-Uno board.\n\nThe paddle-shifting assembly had to be accommodated and integrated with MoTec Engine Control Unit to perform interrupt processes such as ignition and fuel injection cut. This was achieved successfully through an idea to send a digital input to the ECU which was approved by MoTec support.\n\nThe engine followed a complicated gear-shift scheme thus it was recommended to display which gear was being operated and what action was performed (upshift/downshift). This was done by programming an Arduino-Uno board with Hitachi HD44780 LCD display. The goal was achieved by making use of the property of a counter and LCD display instructions.",

Developing modular interaction using predefined/user defined function blocks (standard Boolean instructions, clock generator etc), structured data types and variables.\n\n3. Designing faceplates for HMI and simulating the entire process.\n\nUsing OOP model, we successfully developed a library for synchronization control which has been registered under ABB library - PMS India. Using network determination concept developed by ABB.Ltd, the library can determine the generator to be operated. Protective measures for circuit breaker control were implemented in a logical format using languages like Structured text, Function Block Diagram and Ladder logic. My mentor introduced me to ModSoft for improved methods of writing instructions to reduce execution time. \n\nThe library has offered easy implementation in existing projects where load-shedding and load-sharing are already being used. The parameter connections have been optimized to be dependent on the IO only for the circuit breakers and synchronization panel thus reducing memory usage to the best.",

The workshop offered IoT training and projects using Arduino mini and cloud servicing platforms for data acquisition through sensors.\n\nFor Enginuity 2016, we conducted Codeblitz - the competition puts forward a series of programs with very trivial and subtle errors (bugs). The participant would have to identify the bugs and debug the code to get the correct output for all valid test cases.\n\nAnnually IEEE xTreme is conducted at the university. In IEEE xTreme 9.0, 7 teams made it to the global 50 rankings while also holding the top-ranking position in the middle-east.\n\nWith growing membership and activities, the university has also initiated a IEEE Power and Energy Society division.",

It is implemented extensively in the Manufacturing/Packaging and Process industries and power automation industries as well. It has opened an entirely new dimension to smart grid implementation. The controller allows IO interactions and integration with AutoCAD and MATLAB.\n\nThe project allowed me to better understand the interaction of a controller with IO devices, software-based control and analysis using real-time data.",
