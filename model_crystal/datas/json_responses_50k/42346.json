    "summary": "I am a Digital Marketing Masters's student with a Bachelor's degree in Sports Studies and a background in social media management and fitness entrepreneurship. I deeply understand the importance of physical activity and enjoy leveraging digital marketing strategies to promote it. Currently, I work part-time as a gym host at Trainmore, where I have the opportunity to interact with members and support their fitness journeys.\n\nI am profoundly enjoying my master's degree in Digital Marketing at Northumbria University, where I am deepening my understanding of the latest trends and best practices in the digital marketing field. I am, then, busy growing my strategic mindset and learning to create \u00a8the magic formula\u00a8 for effective strategies that engage customers and deliver measurable results.\n\nAlso, as a gym host at Trainmore, the fastest-growing gym chain in the Netherlands, I have honed my customer service and communication skills, providing a welcoming and supportive environment for gym members. At Trainmore, I am proud to be part of a community that promotes health and wellness. In fact, Trainmore members work out an average of 70% more than the national average, a testament to the supportive and motivating environment that Trainmore provides. I can also see firsthand the impact of effective marketing strategies, as Trainmore's focus on innovative marketing techniques has helped attract and retain a loyal customer base.\n\nAs a sports studies graduate, I have a comprehensive understanding of the role of physical activity in promoting health and well-being, and I am excited to apply that knowledge to my digital marketing work. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am passionate about using my skills to impact the world positively.",
