Furthermore, as mitochondrial dynamics had been reported as one of the initial modified processes, a better understanding of its mediators' regulation is needed. In my thesis, our focus was on gene and protein expression of mitochondrial dynamics related genes and proteins within the cachectic differentiated muscle cells. Additionally, we observed the parallel regulation of cachectic markers between the processes of muscle atrophy, mitochondrial fusion and fission, and myofibers remodelling.\u00a0\n\n-Found the knowledge gap and designed the project: aim, hypotheses, methodology.\n-Cultured cells, differentiated myoblasts into myotubes, and conditioned them with lipopolysaccharides, used cancer medium or different differentiation media.\n-Fixated the cells with formaldehyde and performed fluorescent staining of the cells.\n-Used fluorescence and brightfield microscopy to determine myotube width, length, number of nuclei, and mitochondria networks.\n-Used Fiji (ImageJ) to analyze the obtained images, data.\n-Performed protein extraction, western blot, and antibody staining of the membrane.\n-Measured gene expression with RT-qPCR.\n-Performed RNA extraction, purification, and cDNA conversion.\n-Used GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis and visualization of obtained data.",

The selected biomaterial was silk fibroin which naturally\ndeteriorates in the body and releases different amounts of entrapped hormones,\nand therefore more closely imitates the natural excretion of progesterone and\nestrogens.\n\n2ND PROJECT: Biodegradable Silk Fibroin Scaffolds, Films, and Hydrogels for stem\ncell growth and specialisation\nWe focused on natural biodegradable materials, such as silk fibroin, that can be\nused to treat osteochondral and bone defects, wound treatments, and as a\nsupporting matter for stem cell growth. The project was held in collaboration\nwith the Veterinary Faculty of the University of Ljubljana.\nImplemented the dialysis for the obtainment of pure silk fibroin without\nimpurities.\nPerformed lyophilization.\nWith different methods obtained, the silk fibrin gels, scaffolds, and films.\nIncorporated hormones inside the gel structure of silk fibroin.\nPerformed the degradation test and estimation of hormone release.\n\n3RD PROJECT: Bioactive glass for bone ingrowth and prevention of implant\nloosening\nWe produced an innovative bioactive glass used in regenerative medicine to\npromote bone ingrowth and prevention of implant loosening. In addition, the\nbioactive glass was used as a composite in teeth whitening agents, as it helps to\nreduce teeth hypersensitivity by regrowing dentine tubules with hydroxyapatite.\nThe material was later patented, and a spin-off company was established.\nUtilized potentiometric titrator for the obtainment of bioactive glass.\nOperated high-temperature laboratory oven for calcification of bioactive\nglass.",
