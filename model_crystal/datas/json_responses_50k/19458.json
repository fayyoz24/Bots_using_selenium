For instance, how could a space be designed in order to host the choreographed or (even harder) the spontaneous movement of its visitors?\nThe present diploma thesis was carried out in the quest for answers to such questions. The necessity of the creation of a Dance Center, that is, a public infrastructure to host dance creation in Greece, \n constitutes the practical basis of this project. This space concerns the daily reality of the backstage work of dancers, not the exceptional case of the show, providing thus the opportunity for the creation of an alternative condition for dance space design. This condition seeks to unify the daily reality of the dancer with the urban condition, the everyday life of non-dancers, attempting the fruitful merge of the two. At the same time, a space, preferably public, which encourages the activation of the human body and the expansion of its everyday movement is also required, as varied everyday movement is a vital element that seems to be missing from life these days. Therefore, the creation of an environment where architecture would be designed with regard to the human body is attempted, providing the conditions and stimuli for the spontaneous movement of its visitor.",

It is a world-wide festival that takes place once a year in the Black Rock desert of Nevada, where a temporary city of 80,000 people is created for a week, culminating in the burning of a giant wooden model of a man. At the same time, it is an experiment in the creation of a community with different philosophy and principles than those of the conventional world. In order to understand the structure and composition of this community, it is examined through sociological terms such as ritual, carnival, and neo-tribes. On the other hand, Burning Man is also an organization, a company built to manage the annual event, as well as the activity of the global community that has been created around this event. Examining the historical development of the entire venture from its beginning, as a party between friends on a San Francisco beach in 1986, to date, with its Burning Man Project business management, we are following its gradual change of character. Finally, through the duality of the community and the organization, we see the contradiction between the authentic, unconventional nature of the festival and the totally conventional business activity of the organization.",
