Given the identified knowledge gaps, the objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of electricity saving potentials and cost-benefits of emission mitigation due to scaling up energy efficiency in industries. Our research targets industrial electric efficiency improvements in China, where electricity supply heavily depends on a coal-fired power plant fleet and faces multiple challenges to a sustainable future. To meet the research purpose, the following five sub-goals are established:\n1. Comparing electricity use projections and electricity saving potentials for China\u2019s industry in different studies to provide an overview of efficiency improvement opportunities and identify sectors with the highest potential for electricity savings.\n2. Understanding the modeling parameters and approaches that affect the studied results across different scenarios.\n3. Measuring the multiple benefits of electricity savings in industrial sub-sectors, in terms of GHG and air pollution emission reductions at a power grid level.\n4. Quantifying the potential impacts of reduced electricity load from industry on the phaseout of high-polluting coal power units, air emission changes from the power sector, and air pollutant control costs.\n5. A comprehensive assessment of the mutual benefits of industrial electricity savings, coal power removal, emission reductions and related investment optimization across provincial and grid level.",

Industrial structure adjustment will include what Henan province should do to increase the proportion of strategic emerging industry and service industry by controlling those sectors with \u201chigh energy consumption, high pollution and excess capacity\u201d. The energy-saving and cost-reducing approach will include what Henan province should do to realize energy-saving and cost-reducing in key sectors such as energy supply, industry, construction industry.\n\nThis study aims at analyzing the implementation of energy saving control targets in Henan\u2019s 18 cities and 10 counties by proposing adequate management scheme to ensure the achievement of energy saving targets. In general, it contains following two parts. First, a pre-warning system will be proposed to see whether it meets energy saving control targets. On the basis of the current study of energy saving target prediction and pre-warning in 12th FYP, the completion status of energy intensity and consumption targets of 18 cities and 10 counties will be predicted according to the possible development trend of Henan in 13th FYP, and subsequently a pre-warning system will be presented in advance for the non-completion status. Second part is the evaluation of management of total energy consumption in Henan. Based on the present \u201cManagement of energy consumption control in Henan during 12th FYP\u201d, by learning from reduction of pollutant emission together with the decomposition methodology of energy saving control targets, the implementation plan of total energy consumption containing quota estimation, decomposition, adjustment and the completion status will be presented .",
