    "summary": "I humanise technology as a UX designer, Product Manager and Agile leader.\nMaking technology usable, enjoyable, and accessible for humans.\n20 years experience, 10 years in big complex orgs.\n\nI have always been interested in the interaction between humans and technology and the communication around that. I learned early that I was quick in understanding the needs of people and could adapt the technology to make it usable for them and also to tech them how to use it.\n\nThis lead me to pursue roles and educations that was catering to this - long before anyone knew what a UX designer was. I have 20 years and have studied IT and communication sciences, usability, interaction design, graphic Design and Web development.\n\nI both have a strong attention to detail and a good overview. I have high ambitions, like challenges, love to learn and evolve. I am pedagogical, analytical, structured, good at making strategic decisions and have good interpersonal and communication skills.\n\nMy attitude is always that it is fun and necessary to move forward, improve, develop and learn new things. I am a dynamic, flexible, meticulous and driven person. For me it is easy to learn new things and I understand that the key to success is to be flexible and adapt to new realities with a solid knowledge base to hold on to.\n\nI am based in Leiden, The Netherlands. Relocated from Stockholm, Sweden July 2021.\nI like to work hybrid and I can be onsite 1-3 days/week if the office is in the Randstad area (Leiden, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and their surrounding areas). If it\u2019s longer away and has reasonable travel time I can be onsite 1-4 times/month depending on traveling time etc.\n\nI speak English and Swedish fluently and I am learning Dutch.\n\nUX Designer\nUX lead, Service designer, Process designer, Product designer, UI designer, UX researcher, Domain knowledge, User centered design, Prototyping/Wireframes, Visual design, Impact mapping, In-depth interviews, Target groups/Personas, Workshops, User flows, User stories/mapping, Usability test, Information architecture, Accessibility, Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Balsamiq\n\nProduct Manager/Owner\nProduct Owner team manager, Application management lead, Strategic decision making, Domain knowledge, Coordinate business experts, Requirements Manager, Strategy, Priority, Roadmap, Jira / Confluence administrator, Azure DevOps\n\nAgile leader\nScrum Master, Process facilitator, Application management lead, Agile processes designer, Feature teams leader, Coordinator, Collaboration, Scrum, Kanban\n\nMore info: http://linddesign.nu",

It is very complex and has many stakeholders: local health care units, laboratories, regional infection control units and The Public Health Agency of Sweden.\n\n\n* UX Designer / Requirements Manager *\nI was managing all de requirements for the project, it was an extensive catalogue of requirements. I was responsible for creating and organising the requirements\nand helping co-workers to find the right place to look for the requirements. I also constructed Issues in Jira with manageable parts of the requirements for development.\n\nThe user\u2019s needs, web standards and accessibility is always central in the requirements and when I design or redesign the UI or create copy.\n\n* Product Owner team manager / Scrum Master / Process facilitator *\nWhen I started in the project there was no clear implemented process and no tools to support it. I designed a process with the help of the team in a series of workshops and implemented it in Jira and Confluence. It was an agile process with workgroups and requirements handling in Scrum that we lately changed to mostly Kanban.\n\nI coordinated the POs/business experts and digested their knowledge into requirements. I also had the role of acting PO for the team so they can ask me if they could change requirements during the development. I made decisions based of my knowledge of the domain and usability and when needed gathered input from the other POs.\n\n* User interface developer *\nI was also responsible for the development of the UI. I rewrote the code for the UI and made a redesign of the graphical look and implemented frameworks. I have educated my co-workers on how to code for the frameworks and according to my guidelines for this project.",
