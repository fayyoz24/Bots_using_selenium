Experienced in project management and strategy development. \n\nThanks to my diverse experience, I am used to quickly exploring the value-adding aspects of my teams and delivering results in a short-period of time. I consider myself a problem solver who constantly looks for ways to learn something new. I love to work in teams, but do not shy away from personal accountability or leadership roles.\n\nAfter many years of moving countries for studies and work, I am soon relocating to Amsterdam, NL, and am looking for a challenging opportunity to put my enthusiasm, experience and skills to a great use.",

All-Star Game was held at the end of the season. \nGyBu Liga exists to date and is now run by younger students.\n",

With the team, we analysed the conditions for corporate donations across the EU, prepared a roadmap for the NGO to secure new sources of corporate funding and invented processes for the organisation's social reporting.\n\n3b) A follow-up project with the Nigerian-European NGO with the aim of developing a fundraising strategy for individual/private donors and public donors such as international aid funds or large foundations. Over the course of the project, the team and I also developed a social media strategy for the client.\n\n4) The team under my supervision developed a sustainable and long-term fundraising strategy for a global NGO. The NGO works very closely with the UN and connects thousands of mostly high-school students around the world. We developed and delivered a clear selection matrix for the search of prospective partners, step-by-step communication guidelines for the client's representatives, social media strategy and a clear roadmap to establishing regional fundraising teams.",
