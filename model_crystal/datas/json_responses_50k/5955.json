All group entities took part in the project requiring coordination and collaboration with six other risk departments, group and local treasuries and group IT department.\n\u2022 Developed the project plan for streamlining and unification of fair value processes for derivatives across all group entities. The development included outlining the differences in data sources and methods used across entities, and deciding on the best methods to be implemented based on mathematical arguments, as well as outlining the steps necessary to unify the methodology from a technical standpoint. The plan included the creation of documentation on methods and data sources as well as a cleanup of a lot of legacy procedures no longer in use.\n\u2022 Reevaluated market data sources and looked for substitutes where regular low-quality data was observed, initiated discussion on obtaining additional licences to improve data quality where regular intervention was required.\n\u2022 Automated parts of daily market risk reporting processes through VBA and Excel macros, coordinated with IT to improve the format of reports produced in Portfolio and Risk Management System for easier downstream use.\n\u2022 Held several workshops on fair value and value at risk methods and processes used on the group level.",
