    "summary": "I love puzzles, trying out new things, talking about ideas and rallying the troops around a common goal. I believe the agile mindset is the mindset of the future - in order to deliver value continuously, we must make people awesome, give them a safe space to be at their best and let them experiment, fail and learn from their mistakes.\nEver since I got my first internship on the QA team of an open source startup, I have been fascinated by how all the pieces in the software development lifecycle fit, what are the challenges at each step and what makes teams successful. During the first years of my career as a software developer, I helped our teams establish good architecture standards by crashing our production servers on my first go-live night with a new piece of code no one had used before. My boss called it \"fail forward\" - it's not bad to make a mistake, as long as we learn from it. \nLater on, as a consultant in a Big Four, I've tried to purposefully crash systems, in order to test them, have advised many clients on the quality of their software systems and how to address certain challenges, such as legacy software, scaling, maintainability and usability and I've even written some code. But the projects that gave me the most energy and taught me the most were always centered around teams - from being the product owner for the most amazing and accepting banking app team, to being the Scrum Master and coach for my own colleagues, to leading a team that successfully developed a novel static code analysis tool for a client, so they can embark on their continuous quality journey.\n\nWhen I am not moonlighting as an all-around IT nerd and an agile coach, I am a mom of a very bright and determined toddler who always wants to learn about everything. Raising him showed me something important - we all start with an agile mindset - an infinite capacity for learning and the burning desire to try again, and again, until we get it right. \n\nSo, if you are wondering how to introduce Agile into a traditional organization without mentioning the word Agile, or how to improve a complex development process with multiple stakeholders across a few continents, or how to get the creative juices flowing in your teams, do reach out, I'd love to help!",
