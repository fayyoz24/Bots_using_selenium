From this system a computerized calculation model was made to effectively predict the future output (ships, components, parts), costs and throughput times of different ship types. \nIn this calculation model a wide range of process improvement measures (waste time reduction; mechanization; improved building strategy and learning effects) was tested and an optimal layout consisting of new and rearranged facilities was created this way.\n\nFor several improvement scenario's the required investments in new capital goods were established, efficiency gains were calculated and business case prepared.",
