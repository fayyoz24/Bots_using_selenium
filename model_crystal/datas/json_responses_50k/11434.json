In the first design these are all linked to one central computer which consists of a Teensy processor with a large number of expansion boards. This must be replaced by a network of smaller processors, so the machine is more scalable and there is more computing power to collect more data from the sensors and actuators. The hardware has already been made and consists a master board and around 50 slave boards, both based on stm32 microchips. The board are connected to each other via a bus system. The master board has a serial connection over which commands are sent. The master ensures that the slaves execute the commands correctly.\n\nResponsibilities\nIn a team of 2-3 persons I am responsible for the architecture and implementation of the completely new code base. Part of this new codebase is the protocol used over the bus connection, the serial communication, the possibility of distributing and installing new firmware, handling commands to the various slave boards and collecting data throughout the system.\n\nProgramming languages: C, C ++, Python\nMethods: SCRUM, DevOps, TDD, BDD, CI / CD\nTooling: Eclipse, STM32Workbench, STM32CubeMx, Jira, GitLab, Cucumber (behave).",
