    "summary": "I am an ESG and Sustainability Engineer at ABB E-mobility, a global leader in electric vehicle charging solutions. I have a Master of Science in Environmental Science from ETH Zurich. My core competencies include ESG, data analysis, environmental policy and regulations.\n\nIn my current role, I am responsible for establishing and coordinating the annual ESG reporting process for ABB E-mobility in reference to international standards and frameworks. I also support ESG ratings and rankings, and sustainability disclosures for external stakeholders. Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at World Benchmarking Alliance, where I conducted sustainability and ESG benchmarking research in various sectors and industries, and engaged with companies in the benchmark development processes. I have also gained valuable experience in product stewardship and regulatory affairs at DuPont and Dow Chemical, as well as in environmental consulting at International Labour Organization and UN Environment. I am passionate about advancing the sustainability agenda and contributing to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. I bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, as I have lived, studied, and worked in different countries and cultures, and I can speak Chinese, English, and Spanish.",
