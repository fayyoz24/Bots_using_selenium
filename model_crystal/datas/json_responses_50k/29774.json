The redesigned container provides a better user experience to help the user get every last drop of Marmite with less effort. Marmite is a brand centered around nostalgia that is reinforced with its iconic bell jar that has not changed since the 1920s. Redesigning this new container so that it's more user-friendly yet still in line with Marmite\u2019s brand identity was a fun challenge.\n\nAlong with this, the secondary and tertiary packaging was envisioned to create a promotional package for the new squeezable container along with two egg cups. The box utilizes Marmites high contrast colour palette. With minimal exterior detail and images, it is the Iconic colours that do all the talking.",

These small hinges in sunglasses are prone to failure and are a point of weakness when the hinge buckles and fails the sunglasses are nearly always irreparable. To solve this problem the Rotate sunglass concept was envisioned. This is a retro pair of sunglasses with a revolutionary hinge. The sunglasses work by a rotational mechanism at a 45 and 47-degree angle and clipped together by 2 neodymium magnets on either side holding the pivot together. With this new hinge the mechanism can never break, is always reliable, contains fewer components Increasing manufacturing efficiency, whilst being slick and invisible to the eye.\n\nFor more information on the project check out the link to my instagram.",

            "description": "When growing up every child loves to be creative and build objects which is one of the reasons for the success of companies like Lego\u00ae. This creative drive can be put to great use in many children's toys, and one of the best is the toy train set. The toy train set allows the child to design their own train track arrangement and scenery layout through the use of simple wooden building block shapes, however, one of the downsides of these sets is that you are unable to design the toy train itself. \n\nThe Toy Train Programme is designed to allow a child to design a new bespoke train easily, with a user-friendly interface. Once the child is happy with their toy they have created an STL file can be generated allowing the child to 3D print their train and within a few hours, the child has their own Toy Train to play with, which can be customised further with paint or simply added to their collection. \n\nThe parameters of the train have been carefully chosen to ensure that the width, axle length and wheel thickness and minimum wheel diameter still match the working drawings for the dimensions of the Brio\u00ae Toy Train Track, thus allowing the toy train to work on existing wooden tracks. This lets the child invent with endless possibilities and combinations the child is able to choose, with no worries about compatibility.\n",
