The tasks involve but are not limited to:\n\n-researching about the new concerns and challenging regarding sustainability in the water sector and conceptualizing a topic which could cover those concerns\n\n-contacting the companies which are doing innovative work in the said topic about taking part in the symposium\n\n-finding the pioneers in the said topic and contacting them for being a speaker at the symposium\n\n-organizing the whole event (practicalities, schedule, food etc.)\n\nI learned some valuable skills during my time in this committee such as multi-tasking, efficient management of schedule, writing professional emails and forming invaluable connections in the water sector. This year due to covid, a full scale symposium was not possible but we planned in advance for such circumstances and were able to organize a successful hybrid symposium giving the audience and the speakers/companies the best of both platforms, and at the same time adhering to covid rules and guidelines.",

It also involved a holistic review of available market ready technologies which could supplement the existing treatment scheme. It enabled me to develop a solution finding mindset for sustainable ways of innovating existing systems according to environmental guidelines or company's future ambitions.",
