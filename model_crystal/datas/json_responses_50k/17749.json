    "summary": "I am from Lublin, Poland but after high school graduation in 2019 I moved to Italy to continue my scholar career at Polytechnic University of Turin. The decision to study abroad was motivated by my desire of gaining such a unique experience and to open up new possibilities. Last summer I took a step further and joined the internship program based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Recently I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Architecture and I'm about to start a master's degree at University of Technology in Eindhoven. I'm excited to keep my architectural journey going while traveling and moving to another country!",
