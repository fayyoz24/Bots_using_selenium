As the only German-speaker at the office, my tasks included: Link-building with bloggers and influencers, B2B partners, and other players in the child care industry; handling customer service enquiries from all German-speaking countries/areas; managing all German social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest); content creation (photos, text, etc.) for Babysits' own blog and social media channels; and translating new additions on the platform.\n\nFor me, the most valuable learning of this internship was the degree of freedom and responsibility I got. I was solely responsible for the German-speaking areas, I was able to shape the role according to my strengths such as my creative mindset, and I was involved in many decisions such as changes on the website or new ideas for the marketing strategy.",
