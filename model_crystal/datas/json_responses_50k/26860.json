Simulation made with Vissim and Aimsun.\nIn most of the busway stations,when buses enter, they take the first spot along the platform that is available. There is no \u201cset\u201d location along these platforms where a bus on a particular route will stop. Passengers waiting for a specific bus route will then have to move up and down the platform. However, any attempt to better organize buses into specific locations on the platform might cause greater bus congestion. We developed a simulation to analyse the best solution.",
