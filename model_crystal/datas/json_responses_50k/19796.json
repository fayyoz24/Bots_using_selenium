ESA can point to a document that describes its science interests and objectives. \n- Led a team of staff and contractors to organize a 3-day SciSpacE Strategic Roadmapping Retreat that brought together 55 scientists from diverse research domains, to identify the key science questions and associated capabilities for the SciSpacE element and draft a SciSpacE Strategic Roadmap that links investments to science outcomes.\n- Worked with an internal team to update the selection criteria for science competitions to reflect values, including science excellence, multidisciplinarity, and diversity, identified in the SciSpacE strategy. \n- Internationally, I have persuaded international partners, particularly NASA, that ESA is the European partner to deal with in LEO and Gateway matters, while instituting quarterly meetings with the member states involved in the International Life Sciences Working Group to ensure that Europe has a unified voice.\n- I created science criteria to be considered when prioritizing missions for large financial investments in research.",
