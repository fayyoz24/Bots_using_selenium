    "summary": "Expertise in academic research, education, management and outreach. \n\nResearch: Laboratory Astrophysics, specifically high resolution molecular spectroscopy of transient species and solid state astrochemistry. In recent years the focus of my research has been on the (non)energetic processing of inter- and circumstellar ice analogues with the aim to understand how complex organic molecules form in space. The primary goal is to interpret astronomical observations from different telescopes (JWST, HST, VLT, NTT, ALMA, ...) and to provide all physical and chemical details needed to prepare for future projects. I am also involved in industrial research. Prime achievement: 30 completed PhD theses and nearly 280 peer reviewed scientific articles.\n\nEducation: I have been lecturing for more than 25 years, covering a wide range of topics, varying from physical chemistry and introduction courses in astrophysics and planetary systems, to astronomical spectroscopy and research skills for the bachelor research projects. I have been supervising some 70 bachelor- and master projects as well as technical traineeships. \n\nManagement: Since 2018, I'm director of education at Leiden Observatory, member of the management team of Leiden Observatory and the board of directors of studies of hte Faculty of Natural Sciences at Leiden University.\n\nOutreach: Press releases, popular scientific articles, public lectures on astronomy in general,\n\nSee also:  www.laboratory-astrophysics.eu",
