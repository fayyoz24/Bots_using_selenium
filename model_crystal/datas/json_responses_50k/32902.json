    "summary": "I'm a microelectronics and automation engineer with master's in microelectronics from TU Delft. I'm currently a controls engineer at Vanderlande. I've been a student, a systems engineer at IBM, and then a master's student again having carried out my thesis in wafer level packaging of deep UV LEDs.\n\nI have the foundation in electronics and instrumentation engineering from my bachelors. And the experience in programming, root cause analysis, and supply chain management from my time at IBM.\n\nAfter researching in deep UV LED lifetime, reliability, and packaging at TU Delft and Philips I gained knowledge on device physics, optics, materials, industrial standards, measurement equipment, and data handling.\n\nAs part of my master's at TUDelft and Philips my research includes studying different LEDs' performances over their lifetime and analyzing the causes of degradation from literature. For this I setup the equipment, perform tests, analyse data, and I present the study for everyone, both at my university and Philips. Over this research I've become better at communication, dealing with uncertainties, being independent, and as a team player.\n\nWith the information from the performance studies I've decided to contribute to the improvement of the deep UV LEDs' performances. Consequently, my master's thesis was on packaging of the deep UV LEDs at wafer level with silicon. I've dealt with chips from different suppliers and design innovative solutions coordinating with Philips research. After designing the mask for the package, with my cleanroom-100 qualification I fabricated the packages at the university guided by experienced advisers, fellow lab users, and knowledgeable PhD. mentors.\n\nAs part of my coursework I've studied semiconductor physics, instrumentation, analog and digital design, MEMS, imaging sensors, sensors and actuators, and microelectronics fabrication.\n\nMy cultural, educational, and social backgrounds make me unique. Reach out to me if you want to talk engineering, physics, movies, football, music, or comic books.",

The aim is to contribute to the packaging industry by improving the thermal conductivity and light extraction efficiency, and establish a processing line for high volume production. I design, fabricate, analyse, and compare the packaging with the state of the art advancements. With chips from different suppliers I planned the fabrication in multiple ways. After designing the mask for lithography with my cleanroom-100 qualification I fabricate the package at the university guided by experienced advisers and knowledgeable PhD mentors. I use photo lithography, RI etching, wet chemical etching, low pressure and plasma enhanced CVD, sputtering of Aluminium, evaporation of noble metals to achieve this goal. The complex process allowed me to find multiple ways to reach the aim.",
