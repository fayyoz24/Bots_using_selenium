    "summary": "Hello everyone!\n\u201cCuriosity\u201d is a word that follows us since our early years of childhood. Mine was decoding people\u2019s behavior. What interests them, what drives them, what motivates them? I spent several years working in Education and Hotel Management which fed my passion for building relationships, working passionately with different teams, and creating in my field by listening and accessing feedback from both colleagues and students. I love learning and this is why I am drawn to working in companies that are not afraid to bet on people and lead their way to innovation and growth. I am the kind of person who devotes myself to what they do when given the chance and makes things done the most effective way. \nAs a people person, I am able to find constructive and direct ways to communicate to clients or colleagues what\u2019s in their best interest and use their feedback to help them make decisions in their best interest. \nMeeting new people is a natural need of mine. It\u2019s the special ingredient that pumps me with never-ending energy. My friends call me \u201cenergy ambassador\u201d because I never stop smiling and experimenting, whether it\u2019s sporty adventurous quests, delicious food, or cheering them up at any moment of the day!",
