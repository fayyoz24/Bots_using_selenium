    "summary": "In summary my key experiences are:\n- Process Operations\n- Process Control\n- Leadership\n- Calamity handling\n- Operations Management\n- Problem Solving\n- Task-oriented\n- Goal oriented\n- Assertive\n- Pro-active\n- Team player\n- Thinking in solutions\n- Creative\n- Innovative\n\nLeadership Behaviors: According to leadership behaviors I could say that I inspire people with my integrity, positivism and passion. In my formal function as Team Lead I had to delegate work to the operators in my team. This was going very well most of the time and people were always at my service. I think it was because of my honesty and sincerity that people \u2018really\u2019 wanted to work for me. When there were problems I always helped people out to provide solutions (or the way to it). If the workload of the operators was too high I managed to divide it over other operators, even if it was not there job. Thereby I was also helping when there were trouble during the production process, by doing so it gave me a lot of respect and  commitment from my team. Because of creating a strong and collaborative team we could handle a lot of pressure by operating as a team.\n\nTo achieve this state of collaborations it took a lot of effort to align everyone in my team. This was also caused by the information that the operators received. When employees are not fully informed they make up their own story what ends up in gossip. By informing my team fully they had a better picture by what was ongoing and what they could expect. I experienced that one of the most important things of leadership is clarity.\n\nI believe that when a team works as a unit, goals are achieved naturally, of course there is need of guidance and direction. When every operator has a lot of pleasure in their jobs they work harder, effective and more efficient, and there behavior is more open to ask questions. People are prepared to think larger in the sake of the company.",

From there it was transported through a main line to the first cooling till 25grC (indirect). After the first cooling the gas was led through an Electrical Filter (25.000V) to undo the gas of tar, and then the gas was compressed to a pressure of 180mbar. The total gasflow was approximately 60.000m3/h.\n\nWhen the gas had passed the compressor it was going to the ammonia filters to undo the gas of NH3. Then the gas was going to the after gas coolers with two stage (direct) with naphtha washing between. After that the gas was directed through a BTX and H2S washer. \n\nThere were several byproducts as well, to know; ammonia sulfate, tar, BTX, H2SO4.",
