I am enthusiastic about the dynamics in a team, but also feel confident working on projects independently. I have a creative vision, experience with online marketing, social media, website development, (sustainable) tourism and nature conservation.\n\nIn 2019 Kololo launched a complete rebranding (Logo, website, stationary, brochure, display materials), a project that I deployed, supervised and executed from start to finish.\n\nIn addition to my responsibility for the marketing of Kololo I was also actively involved with the management side of the reserve and helping Kololo achieving its conservation/sustainability goals. Achieving a balance between tourism and nature conservation is my passion.",

By applying a governance perspective I conceptualized the conservation-development debate and the role of tourism. Within the changing political-economic context in South Africa, I analyzed tourism and its relation with conservation and development, eventually focusing specifically on private protected properties. Through this research I attempted to identify if and how tourism contributes to conservation and development within private protected properties. \n\nThere has been an intense debate on conservation and development in Africa for decades. Especially, private protected properties provoke a lot of discussion.  To grasp this debate I analyzed the development and the role of tourism in South Africa from a Governance perspective. Hereafter my focus shifted towards private protected properties in South Africa and their role in the conservation and development. To grasp the discussions around private protected properties I did several in-depth interviews with several knowledgeable people and organizations about the subject. The main aim of the interviews was to capture the debates related to private conservation-development, but also identify the arguments and indicators respondents use to define these debates. The main discussions are about whether or not private parks contribute to conservation, development and the effects of commercialization through tourism.",

During my internship I developed Codes of Conduct for suppliers and tourists for several activities, excursions and services including horse riding and fresh water activities (canoeing, kayaking, and rafting) for the Travelife system. These Codes of Conduct will be used in the Travelife system among other things to improve the attention and communication towards suppliers and tourists; make both suppliers and tourists aware of the e.g. sustainability issues at the destination and provide suppliers with guidance in their day to day operations. Besides developing the Codes of Conduct I gave several recommendations as to how these Codes of Conduct can be effectively implemented within the Travelife system.",
