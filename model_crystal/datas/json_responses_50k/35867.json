    "summary": "Growing up, I always saw myself as a famous singer who got to travel the world and meet new people. Since then, a lot has changed, most notably my interest in singing has dwindled. What I never lost, however, was my passion for travelling and experiencing new cultures. Unexpectedly, during my final two years of high school, I became fascinated about the study of history and had a special interest in how nations interacted with one another during and after the two World Wars. When considering my Bachelor's degree, I simply combined my passion with my interests and ultimately chose to study international relations at the University of Groningen. My future ambitions involve completing a Master\u2019s degree and locating an internship that would allow me to obtain experience in the sector as my undergraduate degree draws to a close.",
