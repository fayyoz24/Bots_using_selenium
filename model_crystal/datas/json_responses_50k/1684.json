    "summary": "I am a visual and conceptual artist, whose multidisciplinary practice merges critical, physical and digital projects. I create objects and graphics, design spaces, art direct and curate. Having studied in Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands, I hold master\u2019s degrees in both, art and architecture.\n\nMy professional experience includes working on the quality of public spaces and urban design, exhibition and stage design in numerous cultural institutions and interior design of retail showrooms and art galleries.\n\nMy sculptural work combines a passion for raw, natural materials with an enthusiasm for the unexpected in design processes. Engaging with different techniques I work mainly with glass, stone and metal. I founded Szk\u0142o (www.szklo.studio) functional glass sculptures.\n\nI participated in exhibitions in the Netherlands, Poland, Georgia and Ukraine. My project \u201cDostroyka\u201d was displayed at Tbilisi Architecture Biennial 2020. I initiated discussion panels \u201cNerd Nite Warsaw\u201d and held the \u201cExercising Modernity\u201d scholarship of Pilecki Institute. My concept of \u201cNew ideas for buying\u201d was awarded in Non-architecture Competition. I was a part of curatorial and design team of the play \u201cNew Moralities\u201d performed during Opera Forward Festival in National Opera in Amsterdam.",
