    "summary": "My mission is to reduce corporate impact on the environment and society. I obtained a masters in Environmental Economics at VU in Amsterdam. My thesis focused on the anti-competitive behaviours of the fossil fuel industry to slow green technology innovation. Specifically, I collected patent data from the top global FF firms and used econometric techniques to discover that indeed FF companies have had negative impact on the rate of solar technology diffusion. This discovery reveals that companies create an impact on the environment and society beyond what we are aware of. I want to change this. \n\nI was inspired to get my economics degree when working at Impaakt, which is the next generation impact data provider to the financial industry. My role utilized the UN's SDGs as an analytical framework to determine what impact companies have on society and the environment. More specifically, I reviewed, edited, wrote, and analyzed sustainability reports in order to measure a company's impact. Such analyses were both confronting and motivating that our current system is not working and we desperately need change. \n\nAlongside pursuing higher education, I also started my own business in Amsterdam that involves a different approach to changing the world. I am a spiritual healer and coach in which I host events and ceremonies. I provide safe and sacred spaces for people, especially women, to express and work through their emotions through embodiment practices. I particularly work with dance and sound medicine. This gives me an opportunity to not only be a leader and guide my clients in their most vulnerable state, but to also be creative. \n\nI have a diverse background in research, leadership, creativity/art, and government work. I was previously Director for Released Contemporary Dance Company. As Director, my vision was to merge growth and environmental sustainability. This approach applied to the entire value creation chain from commercials to the actual creation of our annual show-- Dance for A Cause. Simultaneously, I interned at Sacramento County's Environmental Management Department where I assisted as a regulator for businesses that produce hazardous waste. I have also been involved in extensive research in ecology, environmental policy, climate change mitigation, and sustainability in which I took part in fieldwork and performed data analysis using R-studio and Excel.",

The show was more successful than I could have ever imagined! We sold out and raised more than $5,000 for Camp Kesem, a charity that helps children through and beyond their parent's cancer. I am beyond grateful to lead a team full of diverse, strong, and innovative women, and I hope this company continues to grow after my graduation. ",
