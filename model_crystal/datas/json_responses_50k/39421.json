    "summary": "I am human rights advocate and public theologian with deep, global experience in conflict resolution and community organizing. With 10+ years experience in leadership of nongovernmental organizations, the practical skills of management accompany my passion for building a better world. \n\nMy background has largely placed me at the intersection of religion, spirituality and social change. I have worked with communities to harness the insights and wisdom of religious traditions in their work for international human rights and the public good. In addition to my formal study, my orientation as an advocate, strategist and organizer has been shaped by my time learning from veterans of the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., and from human rights activists with deep legacies of work around the world, especially in Africa, Europe, and Latin America.\n\n",
