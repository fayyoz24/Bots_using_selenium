    "summary": "I am currently employed at Dunlop Protective Footwear, a leading Dutch company specializing in designing, manufacturing, and distributing safety footwear. Our products are available in over 50 countries, and we have offices in The Netherlands, Portugal, and The United States.\n\nIn my current role, I have the privilege of interacting with partners from around the world on a daily basis. I see my position as one that enables my colleagues and partners in what they can do best; representing our brand, to expand and grow our mutual business in different countries and regions.\n\nI strongly believe that intelligence and talent can be cultivated through hard work and acquiring new skills. My enthusiasm for international business is coupled with a strong interest in various IT-related topics. Therefore, alongside my full-time position at Dunlop Protective Footwear, I am currently enrolled in courses to learn Python, SQL, and Power BI, with more to follow in the future.\n\nAlways choose the wrench! \n\nStay mellow,\nStan",

The highlight of my job was definitely the spectacular views I got to enjoy every single day\n\nWhat made this experience even more enriching was the opportunity to work alongside people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. It taught me that diversity is a strength when well-managed and that it brings about new perspectives and ways of thinking.\n\nOverall, this journey has given me the chance to grow both personally and professionally, and I'm grateful for every moment of it.",
