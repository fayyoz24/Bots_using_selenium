    "summary": "In social innovation, we want to tackle societal challenges and bring transformative change. We strive for a better world. In order to change a system, we need to change the way we think and interact with others. Those complex challenges will not be resolved by a quick fixed solution but by the involvement and the co-creation of various stakeholders, thus requiring stakeholder management and community building. \n\nThe human is always at the center of the process, and as a social innovator,  I aim to inspire but also get inspired by others and create a safe environment where different perspectives and ideas can be shared. \nBy using tools such as complex system mapping, design thinking,  as well as leisure, we can work towards making a societal impact either internationally, nationally, locally, or within an organization. \n\nAs a traveler and someone who likes to get out of my comfort zone, I have done various work in different countries from Australia, France, and England to the Netherlands. Therefore I learned to be flexible, positive, determined, and develop intercultural sensitivity. \n\nEcoFeminist & Witch, I take a particular interest in the following topics: Mental health, Menstrual health and rights, Gender Equality, protection of nature's rights, and cyclical living.\n\nEager to learn, discover, and grow.",
