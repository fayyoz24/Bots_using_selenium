    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic, responsible and cooperative individual. I am determined to dedicate my career to the cause of sustainability and it is energy transition above all that fascinates me. I have worked hard to acquire a wide range of knowledge and experiences. I am fluent in 4 languages and competent in 4 more. I have worked in 6 different countries in education, in customer services, in management, and in administration. I have fortified my resilience during my military service in Greece and broadened my horizons by travelling around the world. \n\nYet above all it has been the exploration of my own motives that helps me better myself every day. After graduating in Mathematics from the University of Glasgow, I realised that in order to meaningfully apply my computational skills I needed broader sense of purpose. This is why I decided to confront my longstanding insecurities on writing skills and start a new degree in International Relations. This venture has exposed weaknesses and forged strengths, it has allowed me to explore my interests and gain new perspectives, but most importatnly, it has convinced me that improvement is a matter of time and habit. Thanks to this experience I can now say that it is the problem of climate change whose solution I mean to be part of and I have now gained both computational and literary skills to do so. \n\nIn sum, I am a well-rounded person with a diverse toolkit of skills, a strong sense of duty and a determination to pursue improvement.",
