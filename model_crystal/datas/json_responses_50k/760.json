The aim of this paper is: to see if the results of previous studies still apply to recent data, to understand why differences between countries like Italy and the Netherlands persist, and to check if research on this topic might suffer from serial correlation problems. Indeed, the results show that serial correlation is a problem, that results on the OECD data are in line with previous research and that economic development, education and childcare spending are the factors that affect the Italian and the Dutch participation the most.",

Not published. \n(Click on the title above to be redirected to the paper)\n\nAbstract of the paper: \nThis paper empirically examines China\u2019s monetary policy, using the Taylor rule from 1993 and from 2001 over the period 2000:1-2015:1. We compare the lending rate, set by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), to the Taylor rule implied interest rates. Specifically, we tried to estimate PBC\u2019s reaction function that models the PBC\u2019s interest rate determination process.\nFurthermore, we show that the Taylor rule can be used as a benchmark to understand China\u2019s monetary policy. The NLS estimates show that benchmark interest rate, responds passively to the CPI gap and output- gap. Furthermore, we point out that the literature fails to mention heteroskedasticity caused by the period 2008:3-2009:1, which is likely to be caused by stimulative measures taken by the Chinese government.",
