    "summary": "My career in Electrical consulting engineering has provided me with indispensible knowledge about industry practices, design standards, and code compliance in both the Americas and European Regions. I have experience in bringing a variety of projects from concept phase through design, permitting, construction and Commissioning. The most recent journey in my career has had a focus on Mission Critical facilities and Data Centres.\n\nWith an academic background in physics, renewable energy, and power distribution, I have been open to non-conventional design practices, new technologies, and new methods of building design. My specialties include solar PV, Mission Critical Facilities, Live Retrofits, BIM modelling, Power flows, and Large scale distribution.",
