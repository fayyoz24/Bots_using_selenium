    "summary": "I am an international management specialist with 20+ years of experience in communications and technology related fields. I have worked on global commercial networks spanning the globe, cutting edge IT infrastructure projects, and some of the world\u2019s most challenging systems engineering endeavors in the military\u2013industrial complex.\n\nMost recently, I have been a part of the management team leading a multi-national consortium of engineers dedicated to the integration and interoperability of systems vital to the defense of Europe\u2019s populace. Successes include the delivery of critical services across land, water, air and space in real-time operational scenarios. Previously, I ran my own business as an OEM distributor of platform services focused on the holistic optimization of Enterprise operations.\n\nI offer expertise across a wide spectrum of communications and technology solutions built and deployed to operate in some of the world\u2019s most challenging business and environmental conditions. Bringing such products to market requires bridging the gap between executive and technical stakeholders. \n\nThis has made me a leader and self-sufficient innovator comfortable in any situation from the executive boardroom to the help desk hotline. My international experiences across the commercial, entrepreneurial and military communities have given me strong business development and relationship building skills and an innate ability to build the high-performance teams critical to a productive work environment.\n\nColleagues know me as a highly flexible and adaptable member of the executive management team with a clear view of organizational strategy and an innovative approach to meeting goals and objectives.\n\nI hold international master\u2019s in business from three of the world\u2019s top business schools and a BS in Information Technology, as well as international certifications in project management and systems engineering. Each learning endeavor has broadened my mind and deepened my understanding, bringing personal joy and satisfaction. \n\nAs a longstanding member of the international community I have worked in more than 15 countries and I can say that I truly enjoy connecting with other cultures and societies to share in their unique perspectives of our interconnected world.\n\nI am always interested in hearing from colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative individuals, so feel free to contact me if you\u2019d like to connect.\n\nAreas of Expertise:\n\nCorporate Startup\nBusiness Development\nCommunications\nSystems Engineering\nOperations Management\nProduct Management",
