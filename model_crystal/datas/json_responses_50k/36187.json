    "summary": "Even prior to completing her University degree, I have been actively running projects to help underprivileged children and adolescents. As a teenager, I founded a civil association 'Kairos' in Tucum\u00e1n, north of Argentina, which aimed at helping homeless children under vulnerable situations. After completing my Law degree I participated in social projects of the criminal law department of the University of Tucum\u00e1n. I also coordinated a number of national projects oriented to champion and assist underprivileged children and families in Argentina.\n\nI possess knowledge and expertise creating, developing and directing programs and initiatives oriented to fight poverty of the Young and Children, promoting education and human rights. Proven track record in the articulation and championing of social policy initiatives with representatives of the civil society, government and international organizations. I worked at YMCA Argentina for 10 years as part of the social development department where I gained experience in human rights related matters, especially regarding youth and childhood. \nMotivated since 2020 to gain new work experiences, I discovered the importance of being able to communicate and help other people to communicate, get to know other cultures and learn the Spanish language. Based on my experience teaching Spanish, in May 2022 I opened my Spanish School \u201cLa Cig\u00fce\u00f1a\u201d. La Cig\u00fce\u00f1a offers conversation courses in Spanish. Being Argentinian and proud of my culture and language, the school has an Argentinian stamp, very open to sharing with other cultures.",
