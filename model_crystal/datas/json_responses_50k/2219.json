    "summary": "I'm interested in meteorology, the climate & the environment, geology and geography. \n\nI have spent 3 years in Aberdeen (UK) in secondary school where I got very proficient in English. \n\nHaving moved back to Greece, I graduated from high school and got accepted into the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2013 where I majored in geology. My thesis was a synoptic analysis of the cold air intrusion that took place over northern and central Greece during January of 2017.\n\nFive years later I was inducted in 2nd place, upon examination, in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for my master's in Meteorology Climatology & Atmospheric Environment.\n\nMy master thesis was a synoptic and dynamic analysis of the African Easterly Waves during the unusually active hurricane season of 2019 over the Atlantic ocean. A case study of the category 5 hurricane Dorian was also presented.\n\nIn 2022 I completed my military service in the Greek Air Force.\n\nI'm currently an Associate Weather Risk Analyst at DTN in Utrecht, Netherlands providing weather forecasts for the BBC among other clients in the UK.\n\nBesides meteorology, I play and study classical piano & guitar.",
