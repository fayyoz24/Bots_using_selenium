    "summary": "My name is Luke, and I am a student currently living in Amsterdam. I grew up in the Philippines and was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to study abroad in the Netherlands. Prior to moving, I had some experience working in the financial sector, from administrative work done in Manila, Philippines with Altus Capital. I later co-founded a start-up clothing brand that branched out into film production, of which I handled all finances for. \n\nUpon moving to the Netherlands, I prioritized my studies before deciding to work in hospitality to attempt to broaden my knowledge as much as possible. I worked at a bar/restaurant for over a year, and developed a set of valuable skills that I will carry with me to everything I do in the future. \n\nI am now a graduate of the University of Amsterdam in Business Economics with a specialization in Finance. Throughout my time abroad alone, I learned a multitude of skills that I am continuously improving and enhancing, yet I am a quick-learner and will dedicate myself into anything that I do.",
