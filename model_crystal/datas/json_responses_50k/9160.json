    "summary": "I am passionate about driving sustainable development in the field of climate adaptation and food security. With my expertise in meteorology and programming, I am especially keen about providing tailored and reliable information to farmers in rain-fed agriculture.\n\nAs a consultant for meteorology and climate change at Weather Impact, I am working on projects in the Global South and the Netherlands that entail products from nowcasting and flooding alerts to seasonal outlooks, climate projections, and agro-weather tools. As a consultant and product developer, I make sure to turn complex meteorological data into actionable and reliable advice for farmers so that they can adapt their operations in the field.\n\nSome highlights of my work are the development of crop suitability maps for farmers in Myanmar based on climate and soil parameters and developing an agro-weather tool that gives advice on farming practices - depending on the crop, the growth stage, and more - to farmers in Lesotho and Zimbabwe. Over the past years, I have advanced my Python programming and GIS skills to be able to build such products in my daily work. Currently, I am also working on building my expertise in Machine Learning to improve agro-weather services.\n\nThe aspect of sustainability is very important to me. This includes that agronomic advice is always tailored to the context of the respective project location based on the input of local partners and that preferably practices of climate smart and conservation agriculture are promoted. Furthermore, I find it important that every project has a capacity building dimension so that services can ultimately be managed and maintained locally. Thus, I am thankful that I could gain experience in giving on-site and digital trainings in programming and the development and interpretation of agro-weather tools within some of our projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. These trainings are mostly aimed at high-level institutions like the national meteorological agencies, agricultural ministries, and other relevant parties. \n\nLastly, I am actively engaged in project acquisition to ensure the continuation of ongoing projects and build new partnerships. I enjoy exchanging ideas and working towards a real-world implementation. If you are interested in my work or partnering with Weather Impact for a project, please do not hesitate to contact me.",

The main countries I am working in / have worked in are Zimbabwe, Lesotho, South Africa, and Myanmar. Within these projects I can utilize and accelerate my programming skills (mainly Python) and agro-meteorological knowledge to build mobile and digital advisory services for smallholder farmers. Products that I have built and/or worked on are farming advisories (e.g., when to plant, weed, fertilize), seasonal outlooks, weather forecasts and nation-wide crop suitability maps. To make sure that this information reaches the end-users, in this case smallholder farmers, we employ dissemination methods ranging from SMS to apps and chatbots. Next to building digital services, I have given on-site trainings in Sub-Saharan Africa on agro-weather tools and programming in Python to government officials from the Met-Office and agricultural ministries, as well as, other experts. Lastly, I have been the project lead of a couple of projects due to my excellent time management, organisational skills and sense of responsibility.",

I took courses like 'Atmospheric Modelling', 'Atmospheric Dynamics', 'Climate Smart Agriculture', 'Earth System Modelling', and more to enhance my knowledge. I learned to especially enjoy programming and modelling so that I also made sure during my thesis and internship to further develop these skills. During my studies, I used the WRF model to analyse a heavy precipitation event in Jakarta, Indonesia, and to model wildfires and the moisture characteristics in pyrocumulus clouds during my internship. I wrote my MSc Thesis at the chair group 'Meteorology and Air Quality' and 'Water Systems and Global Change' with the title 'Enhancing hydro-climate services for smallholder farmers in the Global South by combining indigenous and scientific weather forecasts'. The innovative character of the thesis led a lot of recognition: - My work work was 1/3 theses being nominated for the Folkert Hellinga Award 2022 - Best Pitch award for environmental thesis within the Folkert Hellinga Award 2022 - 1st NVBM MSc thesis prize 2022; Nederlandse Vereniging ter Bevordering van de Meteorologie (Dutch Association for the advancment of Meteorology)",
