    "summary": "Over the years I have cooperated with product specialists in the financial services industry in order to generate the right platform for both institutional and retail prospects and clients. My prime network consists of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, private banks, (multi) family offices, wealth managers and high net worth individuals. Both in sales and relationship management, from idea generation to development and implementation, I have successfully helped build and grow organisations by targeting new markets and expanding existing markets. Especially so in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Switzerland. I have done so with both renowned banks such as MeesPierson and Kempen & Co, as well with start-ups such as Munros Capital Management in Edinburgh and Monolith Investment Management in Amsterdam.\nHelped by strong communicating and networking skills, I have built an outstanding track record in both building new business and expanding existing business.\n",

In addition, it offers a specialised translation service for such professional documents between Dutch and English, in either direction. \nThe range of services on offer is as diverse as the financial industry itself but the main services include: \n\n\u2022\tA translation of your annual or periodic reports, either in full or in summary form as required, from Dutch to English or vice versa. \n\u2022\tA translation of your website, prospectus, brochure or other publications. \n\u2022\tCustomised marketing presentations for specific targets internationally, both institutional and private\n\u2022\tWriting/Translation of Requests for Proposals. \n\u2022\tPreparation of, and if necessary translation of, Due Diligence material. \n\nIn all the above, it is key to add value by ensuring that the translation of any document is not just wholly accurate but is adjusted for all idioms.  \nExperience has taught that translation quality is crucial in the success of all documents, in hitting the correct target audience and producing the desired results. Such professional investment translation is a discipline in its own right, not just because of the complex nature of the subject matter but also as a result of the professional jargon employed. For a writer/translator who lacks in-depth knowledge in the investment business, it is next to impossible to find the correct words/phrasing in the right context to convey the true intended message. Frequently, this leads to a disproportionate amount of time, both for the client and for the writer/translator, being required with the attendant costs and frustration. \nFirst Financials will always ensure that the completed text supplied to a client is accurate linguistically and grammatically but also that it transmits the investment message to the intended recipient effectively.",
