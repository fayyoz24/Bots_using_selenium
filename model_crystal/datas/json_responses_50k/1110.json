    "summary": "Micky Hoogendijk\u2019s work is characterized by sharp iconic images that deeply touch your soul. With her camera and lighting, Micky Hoogendijk enchants religious and mythical themes.\n\nAt the basis of her work lies always the quest for the vulnerability of man in order to be able to uncover and capture its powerful essence. The image without embellishment. Man is majestic if he shows his vulnerability. This theme is prominent in her portrait series Regal of 2012.\n\nArt has always been an integral part of Micky Hoogendijk. She grew up in an international environment of art, surrounded by bold artists, art dealers, theater makers, actors, actresses and dancers.\n\nHer grandfather Dirk Hoogendijk was one of The Netherlands\u2019 most successful art dealers in the last century. Thanks to his excellent perceptiveness in his field he was able to enrich many museums with Dutch Masters. As a young girl Micky Hoogendijk spent hours and hours in the painting workshop of her father, the painter Roelof Frankot, who initially did a lot with photography but then later on focused on abstract art.\n\nMicky Hoogendijk moved to the United States in 2009. Two months before her mother Gine Frankot passed away in Amsterdam she gave Micky a camera as a last gift.  The camera and Micky Hoogendijk was love on first sight. In San Francisco she discovered the majestic lines and architecture in Los Angeles in 2010 Micky Hoogendijk discovered her love for portraits. \n\nAt the end of 2011 she moved to Austin, Texas. In 2012 Amstel Gallery brings Hoogendijk\u2019s work to Art Platform Los Angeles 2012, E-merge Art Fair, Washington DC and the Contemporary Art Fair in Istanbul. Since 2012 she is among others represented by Eduard Planting Fine Art Photography Gallery in Amsterdam and since 2016 by IconicImages.net. Her work has been show in Japan, USA, Mexico City, Bogota Columbia, Canada, Germany & Amsterdam.\nShe lives in Los Angels, USA.",
