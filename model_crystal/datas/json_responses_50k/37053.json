This was a deeply humbling and enriching life experience where I learned more about life than in any school. \n\n\u201cThe counseling sessions with the patients in the hospice and their family members touched me deeply in my heart. I felt grateful for being able to help our patients come to terms with their death and deal with their unfinished business. Yet another part of me felt frustrated that they all died, because I knew that if the patients would have had access to alternative therapies at an earlier stage in their lives and let go of their psychological and emotional pain, at least some of them would have survived.\u201d\n\nThe science that stress is one of the major causes of chronic disease combined with my deep desire to do more for the patients than I was then capable of, I decided to find the knowledge and means that can help people heal in other than conventional ways.\u201d\n\nWhile still working in the hospice, I started studying the underlying psychological causes of cancer and the successful survivors who had healed in some inexplicable way. I also studied the psychology of emotional, mental and physical health and well-being in a more general way and the complexity of the body-mind-spirit relationship.",
