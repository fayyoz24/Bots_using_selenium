    "summary": "I view the world with curiosity and openness, and try to learn as much as possible from different people and different cultures. In one of my journeys abroad, I have seen devastating effects of a profit driven way of doing business on our environment and the people that live in it. Since then, I am on a quest for a more sustainable way of living. \n\nI aim to be involved in projects in which I can utilise my talents for stakeholder- and projectmanagement, as well as follow my passion for hands-on horticultural activities. Preferably at the same time. \n\nDuring all my endeavors, I have come to know myself as someone who is thrilled by issues with a high degree of complexity. I am usually involved in several projects and able to reach the goals I have in mind. As a result, I am confident, and able to stand my ground in dynamic environments. \n\nStrengths: Stakeholder Management, Project management, Mobility, Aviation, Public Transport, Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility, Horticulture.",
