I also created volunteer-based activities, grow the volunteers network, and mobilised them for various activities, i.e. fund raising, promotion, camp facilitators, etc. I also spearheaded engagements with various like-minded organisations and donors.\n\nInitially, the Camp aimed to further leadership development among the Christian youths in Indonesia. Nowadays, it serves as a platform for youth experiential learning of communal living. The camp still runs annually, with a total number of more than 2,500 youths participants and volunteers located across Indonesia."
