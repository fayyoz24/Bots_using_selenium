    "summary": "I am a loyal, enthusiastic and balanced person who over the years has gained an extensive international experience, both at management level (risk management, project finance, leverage finance, mergers and acquisitions, investment management) and at board level (with systemic bank, financial cooperative, start-up bank and corporate bank). \n\nA team player who likes to lead and collaborate with motivated colleagues in an entrepreneurial way to exceed profit targets based on a clear strategy. People appreciate my stable character, hardworking, not easily disturbed by professional stress. I value open, honest communication and can motivate and unite people. I have an open mind, am respectful to others, eager to learn and willing to change my opinion based on good arguments. I have a proven track record in turning around under-performing businesses. \n\nIn large groups I tend to behave modestly, preferring a discussion in a smaller group to a superficial conversation with many persons. I am committed to the people I work with and I enjoy building a winning culture to get the best out of people and generate results. Feedback from peers include that I am structured, result-oriented and easy to approach. \u2018What you see is what you get\u2019; they do not perceive me a threatening and easily give their confidence. As a result, I know how to function well in (potential) conflict situations. \n\nIn all, I am flexible in my style, sensitive to the environment and have the ability to act in different ways, depending what works best. I like to work in a dynamic and complex context in which I combine analytical skills with execution power. No surprise that I obtain energy from working in a high performing team where having fun is part of the process.",
