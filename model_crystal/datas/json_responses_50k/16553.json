    "summary": "I just finished my rotation at Unilever via Yacht. First as Supply Chain Operations Lead (short term planing) on the Ice Cream NL portfolio and later as Business Planner (medium-long term planning) on the HomeCare Benelux portfolio. In these roles, I explored the extensive Supply Chain of Unilever and was responsible for risk mitigation and portfolio change management. I coordinated with sales, marketing, customer service, forecasting and factories/production planning. After finishing my rotation at Unilever I am exited to explore different environments and ready for the next challenge! \n\nI have very broad interests, which is why I chose the ATLAS University college as bachelor and why I taught next to pursuing a EngD degree. I find it motivating to combine engineering and application, which led to my master program Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) and PDEng afterwards. During my master I focused on the technical aspects of the program by following the Production Logistics and Management (PLM) track, and used electives to deepen my knowledge on Healthcare Logistics. Currently I am gaining more applied experience by participating in the Yacht traineeship, a three year rotational program with additional (professional) skills training. \n\nBesides problem solving and optimization I have a passion for dancing. I am an active salsa and ballroom dancer and have been part of the salsa instruction committee for the past years. I also participate in ballroom and latin tournaments.",
