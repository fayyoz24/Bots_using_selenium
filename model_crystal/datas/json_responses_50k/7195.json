    "summary": "My life has been based on a balance of critical thinking, proactiveness, open-mindedness, math skills, ethics, integrity and problem solving. At the university, I discovered ways of confirming and reaffirming methods and hypotheses. And there was a fair difference when the Arts grabbed me. My discoveries were abundant like ways of reaching the same spot and learning that misses are as important as hits during processes to achieve better results. In other words, I am able to join a work team, organize, elaborate, execute stages of the project and predict their needs before realizing them.\n\n",
