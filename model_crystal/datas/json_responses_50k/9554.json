    "summary": "I\u2019m Larae Malooly, a journalist, writer, editor, and powerful communicator based in The Netherlands. I research and write about science, sustainability, technology, and culture for mission-driven organisations like Metabolic and Elsevier.\n\nSome of my favourite topics include regenerative agriculture, sustainable industry, digital product passports, issues such as scarce metals and SU plastic, and the intersection of grassroots conservation with top-down policy. \n\nMy innate environmental and social conscience drives an analytical mindset and a penchant for translating topical issues into palatable and useful articles, websites, white papers, and reports. My specialty lies in grasping complex topics \u2014 such as systems, academic and scientific research, current affairs, and social trends \u2014 and weaving together an engaging story that everyone can understand. I use comprehensive research, interviewing skills, and lively storytelling methods to make engaging content. \n\nMy copywriting skills include writing news articles, reports, online content, press releases, social media and creative texts, commercial materials, and ghostwriting books for organisations and private entities. \n\nHaving been on-camera as a reporter and announcer for CBS in the United States, I enjoy engaging an audience and know how to create content that appeals to diverse groups. New experiences, cultures, and technological advances inspire me tremendously.",

I am also a confidante and problem-solver for the entire group on both a professional and personal level, connecting with the people on a deeply personal level even after the tour has ended. \nThe primary achievement has been inspiring young Americans to travel and become global citizens, helping them understand different cultures and issues around the world.
