    "summary": "A young energetic, Architect and Structural Engineer with experience in site and construction management in Malta, Lesotho and Kenya. \n\nDetermination, Positivity, and Happiness.\n\nThose are the three forces that I use, to make the best out of every opportunity and challenge in my life. After graduating from a B.Sc in Built Environment Degree from the University of Malta, during 2018 I specialized in an M.Eng Structural Engineering. This package of studies gave me the ideal foundation to delve into the construction sector. Together with a good number of job experiences, I believe that this was a great start to an interesting career. However, following what my heart desires, I delved even further into sustainable architecture with a second masters in Barcelona, Master of International Cooperation, Sustainable Emergency Architecture.\n\nFor the last 2 years, I gained experience in sustainable architecture with a personal interest in timber, design and structural. During the last year, I embarked on two special projects. Whilst being employed for a company in Kenya, I got to design, calculate, and supervise a CLT Pavilion in Nairobi, the first of its kind. In parallel, during the pandemic, I was situated in Valladolid, Spain where I set up shop for wood design and small-scale carpentry projects. Currently, with a handful of projects completed together with a visit of 3 months in Kenya during the CLT supervision, I am keen on pursuing more experiences related to timber, whilst continuing to grow my knowledge in this sector.\n\nNew Updated Portfolio - (under construction)\n\nPrevious Portfolios\nPersonal Portfolio can be accessed through this link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1mInf7un6bo6ImljCOnESleWV4Mf7FsU7\nPersonal Profile report of Experiences in the field can be accessed through this link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1EtN1_HZGt_F7oS_b_uvXdy4ZxhTkDGiK",

As a solution to this problem,  together with the help of my parents, I used part of our basement at home where I designed and constructed a studio with all the necessities to my studies. Part of the design was the use of recycled material. This project was later used as  part of a recycling competition.  The  design involved the construction of tables and work surfaces large enough for  drawings and model building. The materials used were mainly euro pallets (the ones used for transportation), acting as wall divisions and features such as tables, supports or even shelves.",

The prototype, being part of a larger research project for affordable housing, is a 50sqm pavilion, serving as an exhibition for prospective developers and politicians. My role here was to coordinate the design process within our team, taking it towards the manufacturing stage where I had the pleasure to meet and coordinate with XLAM SA, a CLT supplier from South Africa. Together with our in-house procurement team, I coordinated the shipping and importation processes of the 40ft container delivered directly to the construction site. From May to August I had the pleasure to join in person the local team in Nairobi, where I was entrusted to coordinate the site, bring all contractors and experts together and ensure the completion of the project in the stipulated timeframes. This experience gave me a wide reach of contacts and knowledge as I also served as the in-house timber engineering consultant for the team whilst managing the external consultants AKT II and Arup Kenya for our project reviews and Gatsby Africa for our forestry and local material consultancy.",

                    "description": "Responding for a call to newly graduates, I experienced a whole month in Lesotho as an intern within a construction group of fellows who came together to build a new self-sustaining orphanage in a poor community. Together with a colleague, our job was to transform a shipping container into an external IT facility.\nThe experience in a developing country gave me an insight into how architecture can serve the community directly rather than being just an economical machine of just quantity, without any feeling to the actual user. Working together in a team and learning new hands-on skills where surely the best parts of the experience. One month was a short part of the whole process, but today that orphanage is functioning endlessly and changing the lives of the few.",

On my first day I was welcomed by warm words and for the following months I was grasping of new knowledge everyday. I had the opportunity to work with surveyors on the field; including projects of ski lifts and regularisation projects. In addition to field work I was also given particular projects to design buildings, one of them being a reconstruction of a small holiday house for which I also had the opportunity of meeting the client and discuss several issues. Secondly, I was entrusted to take in charge of new ideas for a first class holiday villa in a luxury area of Rijeka. For both projects, I was also entrusted to calculate and think about the construction process for which I was supervised by a professional engineer. \n\tBeing a very short experience, I left Croatia with a full luggage of lessons for me to explore and put to use in my next experience.",
