    "summary": "Senior Agile Transformation consultant and trainer.\n\nSjoerd's focus is on helping organizations to become adaptive. It never stops to amaze him how slowly organizations are adopting new ways of organization design, strategy and leadership in contrast to the increasingly fast changing and complex environment they operate in.\n\nEver since his first job in a small IT consultancy company with no managers, no departments, no rules, just a strong culture, he has been obsessed by finding ways to scale that mentality, engagement, and speed to larger organizations. \n\nSjoerd has spend a lot of time researching and experimenting with the concept of the Adaptive Leadership.\nToday he spreads his ideas and research on www.adaptive-organizations.com, offering high impact courses and workshops and tools that match the adaptive organization.\n\nSjoerd is also an experienced trainer providing training and workshops in areas like Agile, SAFe, Change Management, Management 3.0, Innovation, agile leadership, and Adaptive Leadership. He's also a certified AQai consultant helping individuals and teams assess and grow their ability to adapt.",

We also launched an extended trainer network by setting up a train-the-trainer program, where I coached new trainers.",
