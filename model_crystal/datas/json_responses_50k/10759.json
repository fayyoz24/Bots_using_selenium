    "summary": "As an innovative Python developer with more than 5 years of experience, I have experience working with maintaining legacy systems and developing new software. My experience is in software that is used in end-to-end automatization frameworks and rolling these out in a dev-ops environment. I work on low level code, interacting directly with the hardware, and high-level code such as user interfaces.\nMy focus has always been on delivering quality and stability for the end-user and on the production of readable and maintainable software. This gave me experience with developing and designing test code and the infrastructure to run this test code efficiently. In my work I have experience with collaborating in and managing both small and larger teams in the roles of software architect and scrum master.\n\nDuring my education in Physics, I used simulation software and analyzed complex data and \u201cbig data\u201d. During this time, I organized an international Physics Olympiad including a large symposium with world renowned speakers including Stephen Hawking.\n\nMy colleagues describe me as enthusiastic and wanting to learn. With a precise, driven work ethic where it put the functioning of the team in the first place. My goal for the next years is to develop myself both as a technical engineer by taking a more active role in high level design. To reach this goal I want to work with or in varied teams and companies with different cultures. I would like to develop my Python more but am open to working in other programming languages.",

During this time I supported and filled in for the ASML architect changing to a PO role within the ASML SAFe implementation.

To achieve this, virtual copies of the machines are used, both to increase test speed and scalability and decrease the cost, as they would be in production controlled by the VirtualFab test framework. This assignment started as extension of an existing framework (TWIST) but the choice was made to create a new software package that better fit the user requirements and integration into more modern automation frameworks.\n\nMy contribution to this project is in both design (software architecture) and the development/integration of the new software. For this several external products (Jenkins, JFrog Artifactory, Docker) where used in different combinations. The code of the development work was making an abstraction layer between the testcases and the machine interfaces. This involved multiple internal and external interfaces (RESTfull, Secs/gem/ SSH).\n\nWithin ASML the VirtualFab project is quickly growing, in two years the software is developed from non-existent to a scalable package used by multiple development groups, offering ASML new possibilities. Because of the flexible design it is possible to quickly create new functions that can be used in new testcases and to quickly scale the number of users.",
