    "summary": "Passionate and enthusiastic Marketing Management Master student at Rotterdam School of Management (Erasmus University). Always studied and worked in an international context, where I fluently learned English, besides my mother-tongue Italian. Studying and living in an international context like The Hague broadened my mind-set, helped me set life goals, and got me out of my comfort zone by exchanging ideas, experiences, and lifestyles. I am very interested in working in the advertising, and marketing sector in the fashion industry. Very eager to learn and always striving to do my best!\n\nMy academic background gives me insights into the marketing industry, trends (eg. gamification, blockchain...), and relationship marketing (eg. CRM).\nIn the past two years I have worked at Hunkem\u00f6ller, a market leader in the lingerie industry, where I was learning something new every day. My working background helped me develop very good communication and interpersonal skills. Moreover, I also have developed very good organisation and analytical skills.",
