    "summary": "I started learning webdesign and development when I was 11 years old. Started with the basic HTML and CSS. When I was a bit older I went to my new school where I had a lot of free time. This time was spend by learning the basics of Flash and PHP.\n\nAfter High school I went to the IT Academy in Hoofddorp and after finishing this school I went studying media technology in Leiden.\n\nWhen working at several webdesign companies I found out that I wanted to do something different. I wanted to deliver a service where design and software development meet. A service where we would deliver websites and webapplications that are build together with the customer to reach the perfection the customer wants. \n\nStegwee Drukwerk & Designs was founded after these experiences. Offering webdesign and graphic designs. Working together with a printing company also offering printwork.\n\nAfter a year we were researching our target group and found out that there was little association with the company name and our webdevelopment services. After that...\n\nPXL'87 was born, a new company that brings design and development together. A company that offers webdesign, mobile development and search engine optimization.\n\nSpecialties: Business, programming, designing, SEO",
