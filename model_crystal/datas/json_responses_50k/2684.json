Next, he has been working at TNO from 2007 on, currently as senior scientist in the Sustainable Transport and Logistics group. \n\nI especially focus on logistics in urban areas, sustainable transport and logistics, innovations in logistics, and last mile distribution. \n\nI was / am involved in several (inter)national projects on city logistics, projects on urban freight transport and the electrification of urban freight transport vehicles, sustainable logistics and the influences of external or disruptive factors on the logistics organisation in companies. I (co)authored several reports, papers and book chapters on freight transport, logistics and (local) policy in these areas. \n\nBefore, from 1997 to 2002 Hans studied Business Administration at the Erasmus University Rotterdam after which he started as a Ph.D. candidate at the Rotterdam School of Management in January 2003. In his Ph.D. research he focussed especially on urban freight transport (city logistics), urban access restrictions, sustainability and retail logistics. Hans successfully defended his Ph.D thesis \u2018Sustainability of Urban Freight Transport\u2019 in March 2008. \n\nSpecialties: Urban freight transport / City logistics / Sustainable logistics / Supply chain collaboration and cooperation /",

Specifically, CILOLAB focuses on the transferability and scaling-up of successful logistics initiatives; i.e. concepts that facilitate decoupling between transport towards and in cities.\n\nCILOLAB is an action-driven partnership where cities cooperate with transport operators, interest groups, research institutes and societal partners and collaboratively develop new approaches for urban logistical solutions. Through continuous monitoring and impact assessment these solutions are evaluated and further developed within this experimentation environment, all contributing to the CILOLAB ambition.\n\n",

            "description": "Urban areas represent particular challenges for freight transport, both in terms of logistical performance and environmental impact. A range of regulatory, technological and logistical measures have been applied, most of them suffering from a lack of systematic evaluation and assessment related to their short and long term effects which impedes knowledge transfer and the adoption of best practice. As a consequence, large scale adaptations often fail, although many initiatives seemed successful in pilots and demonstrations. There is a clear need for a comprehensive approach to urban freight solutions, particularly linking urban to interurban freight movements.\n\nThe objectives of STRAIGHTSOL are threefold:\n\n Develop a new impact assessment framework for measures applied to urban-interurban freight transport interfaces.\n Support a set of innovative field demonstrations showcasing improved urban-interurban freight operations in Europe.\n Apply the impact assessment framework to the live demonstrations and develop specific recommendations for future freight policies and measures.\n\nThe demonstrations represent cutting edge initiatives from leading stakeholders like DHL Supply Chain, Kuehne+Nagel and TNT, and cover Brussels, Barcelona, Thessaloniki, Utrecht, Lisbon, Oslo and the south of England. STRAIGHTSOL will contribute to the Commission's research agenda through: 1) an implementation of sustainable urban-interurban freight transport solutions, 2) widely disseminating the experiences and effects from the demonstrations amongst the logistics community, 3) demonstrating the added value of the evaluation tool framework for assessing last mile distribution and urban-interurban freight activities.\n\nThe STRAIGHTSOL demonstrations and deliverables will give policy makers and transport industry players input for future measures in the field of last mile distribution and urban-interurban freight transport interfaces.
