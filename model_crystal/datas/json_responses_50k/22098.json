    "summary": "Hi, I am an MSc graduate in Bionics engineering with a specialization in Biorobotics. I am passionate about designing, innovating and developing devices at an intersection of various domains.\n\nI have worked in a multidisciplinary team/setting and it fascinates me to see how a problem can be approached through different perspectives. I really enjoy such multifaceted discussions. You can find me around a makerspace or meetups discussing and participating in engineering challenges.\n\nFrom a core skill set perspective, I like to see myself as a Mechatronics engineer, who can adapt to any field of application and can bring together skills from various domains for problem solving. I care about building things that matter and have a positive impact on society.\n\nHackaday : https://hackaday.io/akshat.wahi\nGitHub : https://github.com/AkshatWahi\nGoogle Scholar : https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ntTH8zQAAAAJ",
