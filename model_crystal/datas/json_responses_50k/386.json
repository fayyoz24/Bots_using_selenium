    "summary": "\u200b\u200bfields of expertise : \nProduct development, Business Strategy |  New Features & Apps |\n\u200b\u200bchallenger, strateeg en doener\n\nI\u200b\u200bk ben een ondernemende teamplayer met veel ervaring in het opzetten/starten van nieuwe producten. Met veel plezier heb ik eerst 5 jaar festivals georganiseerd, om vervolgens de laatste 10 jaar aan verschillende digitale producten te hebben gewerkt. De belangrijkste tip, die ik meegekreeg, is dat alles een logistiek proces is. De uitdaging is om een naadloos proces te cre\u00ebren, die rekening houdt met steeds veranderende omstandigheden en frictieloos alle stakeholders de gewenste informatie aandraagt voor de meest optimale productbeleving. Heldere communicatie, doorgrondelijke navigatie en toegevoegde waarde zijn de kern ingredi\u00ebnten voor elke succes. Ik zet mijn creativiteit, oplossingsgericht- en servicegerichtheid in om dit te bereiken.\n\nAls (New) Business Prototyper zorg ik ervoor dat met minimale inspanning en budgetten, het concept in een korte periode in de markt wordt gezet.Met behulp van een Proof of Concept of Minimal Viable Product kan snel ingespeeld worden feedback van de gebruiker en heldere keuzes worden gemaakt hoe door te ontwikkelen tot een volledig product.\n\nAls Strategy & Business Developer streef ik ernaar om op basis van het huidige product de bestaande markten en doelgroepen verder te bedienen en/of nieuwe markten en doelgroepen te defini\u00ebren. Hierbij ben ik kritisch, breng ik het product terug tot zijn essentie en vraag ik mezelf steeds af hoe kan het product, nog meer, waarde toevoegen voor een gebruiker en het bedrijf.\n\nAls Product Owner staat bij mij voorop het managen van de verschillende verwachtingen van alle stakeholders. Business, techniek en consumentengedrag kunnen haaks op elkaar staan. Met mijn marketingachtergrond en mijn ervaring, weet ik hoe cruciaal het is in te springen op de veranderende wensen van een consument en rekening te houden met aspecten die niet direct met de development te maken hebben, maar wel essentieel zijn voor het succes van het totale bedrijf.",

It opens up that blackbox of concept, customers, network, partners and funding. It is the essential part all new projects and businesses have to go trough before actually starting up. Basically it asks some basic marketing input, what is your plan, what are the products, who are the customers, do you need partners, what are your assets, what are the costs and how do you get it funded. Based on this info users indicate how much paying customers, advisors or funding is needed. As this is all set users can start with selling their idea, collecting worthfull informtaion about their product, markt, customers and funding potential. When everything is checked, the project is validated and ready to have a succesfull start. \n\nThe Proof of Concept was solid, but missed an essential part namely visualizing the proces and connecting all gathered info to work toghether. I have worked out the businessmodel expanding the marketingplan with basic questions. I also added the feature that customers can be connected to products, including feedback on the product, which can be used to improve the propesition. For a straightforward product as this is, the sales offer was simplified to payment per live product for a limited period. Final we added a document creator, so the validated project could be send as an pdf to potential stakeholders. As a final I translated this into a complete live prototype, which is ready for devlopment.\n\nPersonally I love Tygermom en working on it. I wished I had this tool 15 years ago. It would have helped me tremendously in getting the needed validation to share with the cultural subsidiaries. It is teh perfect tool for prevalidating your project before starting an crowdproject. I think when it is on the market for usage, it will help thousands of people and projects to acheive a succesfull startup.",

            "description": "Leanfund.us is a platform where business can start a selfhosted project for funding their projects or institutions, accelarators can white label their own platform for their clients. \n\nIt is a different approach to the crowdfundingplatforms where entrpreneurs only get funded if their goal is met within the set period. If you don\u2019t meet your goals with lets says 10 to 20%, you won\u2019t get funded. This harsh because all the effort is wasted and with 80% of the soughtafter funding funded, nearly all projects can start. So for setting up a real business this is counter productive. 99% of setting up a new business is building step by step, concepting, strategizing, growing, refining and so on. This is the vision behind leanfund.us enabling their customers to setup projects and get funding for what they need to startup. From there on they can continue using the leanfund.us untill they have growing into a selfsustaining business.\n\nI supported the team with advice regarding their productstrategy, salesmodels, customersmodels. Toghether we worked on the task how to serve more different type customers with the same technical setup. One mayor improvement was refactoring the code into modules, so leanfund.us could offer:\n- A simple widget to be used by individual businesses.\n- A out-of-the-box platform for cities, accelerators and large institutions.\n- A fully custimizable white label product.\nAlso by modularizing the code, it is know possible to completely have all the customer service being handled with the tool by the client self. This results in drastic decrease of customers on leanfun\u2019s part for clients that are actually taking their services via a white labled platform.\n",

I have strategized their product in how it engages with users and how to retain them. Created a simplified salesmodel. Improved viral growth of the app, but I most say Arthur van de Graaf is one of the best salespersons I know, so growing the app is the least of concerns. I finalized the project by building a fully working live prototype, with sales, sharing, login, dashboards, user settings and product feautures. The app is planned to be developed Q2 2019.",
