Is it a Jewish musical monument? Is it worth it, even when it is on the moment in a deplorable condition, to be restored. My answers where clear. The instrument is one of the largest synagogue organs still left in the South American continent, in its origin an extremely beautiful example of a great synagoge organ,  a unique Jewish cultural heritage and it is fully worth to be restored. It is in my opinion a shame that it is held in this deplorable condition. ",

I compared the Reformation in Zeeland/Flanders and the actions of the reformers in historical perspective with the turmoil around the Islam and IS. Focussing on processes of radicalism, intolerance and their effects. This historical circle has serious problems publishing articles uncensored. The main reason in my case is that my article had a well-founded criticism on a action and the ideology of the Dutch politician mr.Wilders. WHICH IDEOLOGY I STRONGLY REJECT ! 17% of the readers of this journal vote on this contradictional politician.The reason for censure is in my view a pure financial matter. Not confronting the Wilders voters with critic and making in that way more profit to sell the journal also to them. It is a serious attack on academic freedom. Totally not done! Discussions and a open debate is not tolerated by the Historical Circle \u201e De Vier Ambachten\u201c. I suggested my relations and students therefore not to buy and/or read this journal. If they do I adviced them, to be very critical indeed about the \u201cscientific\u201d content. Given the facts in my case the journal wanted to censure my Academic article. Academic research can\u2019t be censured, certainly not by politic feelings. A journal calling them self\u2019s scientific, censuring, not pure on academic grounds but on arguments related with voting habits of some of their readers, is in my view not scientific at all!  So I withdraw for the Historic Circle the right to publish my article; censured!!",

Overal we had a good conference with workshops and discussions about watermanagement in Somerset, London and Lewes. The organization lacked the necessary professionalism. One of the problems that appear (in my view) was a overal lack of good time-management in the program (the program was to dense). A second problem was a major overkill in every detail by one of the initiators mr. de Vriend combined with the overal lack of good timemanagement. The practical organization was not satisfying at all. Mr. de Vriend invites academics to work for the project lodging them in a youth hostel paying notting. Thats not done! In general another problem to overcome are the cultural difference between the Dutch and English mentality. The Dutch eager to proceed and earn quick money, the English patience, sometimes by the Dutch translated in slowness. A first event should be a learning moment. I learned that a general lack of good organization combined with a extreme dominant project organizer is not a condition for me to continue in this setting. To have a minimum chance of success it has to proceed in a better organizational setting with a committee that organized the practical issues.",
