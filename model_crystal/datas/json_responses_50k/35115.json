Meanwhile, there are more than 700 million people who do not have access to clean water and almost 2.5 billion humans who lack adequate sanitation. In our minds, water and hygiene are hardwired together but do they have to be?\n\nClensta International was formed with the promise of bringing hygiene to those who need it and at the same time conserve water. With that goal in mind, we invented 2 products for hair and body hygiene, completely waterless. Clensta's waterless shampoo and body bath solutions can save the lives of up to 8 million people who now die because of water-related diseases.",

Currently I am responsible for all marketing aspects of the institution including management of social media and graphic design as well as coordination among 30 teachers. I had always wanted to be able to contribute to the people of under-developed nations and this has been the perfect opportunity for me to do that while exploring new cultures. As a teacher/trainer, I take general speaking classes due to my background in Public Speaking training and serve as the main trainer for the corporate training programmes with Electricite du Lao (EDL) and LaoViet Bank and ANZ Bank Laos. I have also developed the curriculum and started a new English Speaking Programme which was designed for individuals who are currently working or looking to secure a scholarship for further education. The programme received high satisfaction rates from the trainees and witnessed an 80% growth in registrations in each consecutive term.",
