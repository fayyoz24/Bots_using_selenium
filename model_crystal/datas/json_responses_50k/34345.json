In March of 2014 we left our home in San Francisco and set off for an adventure around the world. We knew we wanted to start in Europe, make our way through Asia and then just see where the road took us. No Destinations is our scrapbook of photos and the memories we make along the way. So far we've been to over 12 countries and 40 cities and our bucket list just seems to be getting longer by the day. We hope you like our little corner of the internet and please feel free to leave us recommendations or say hi...we love good food, good cocktails and even better views! Cheers. ",
