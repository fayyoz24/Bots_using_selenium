American expat studying in the Netherlands.\n\n*Open to opportunities in the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (DE).\n\nI aspire to dedicate my skills to hard, critical work.

Time management is very important to me, as I strive to execute and maintain objectives. I hope to continue enjoying my professional experiences, as they provide me with challenges that incorporate creativity, agility, and proficiency within my work. With excitement, I am looking forward to applying my talent internationally.",
