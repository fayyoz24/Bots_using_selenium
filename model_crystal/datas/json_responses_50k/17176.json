This makes it a realistic learning experience, much unlike any other 'college company' or 'business simulation'. During my time here I was responsible for leading a team of 4 managers also from the Hogeschool of Arnhem Nijmegen and 9 interns from various MBO schools (programmers, graphic designers, sales managers) in the region. \n\nDuring my time as Director at DOE-Arnhem I have learned a lot about forming and working in teams, I have learned how to provide a safe working enviroment for my colleagues while challenging them to push  themselves to the limit. I did this while guarding both the financial goals of the company and making sure my colleagues could get as much experience and knowledge of their inner strenghts and weaknesses as possible. I have had the chance to refine my entrepeneurial, management, financial and creative skills at DOE-Arnhem.",
