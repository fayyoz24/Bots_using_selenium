    "summary": "It is my ambition to contribute to the development of renewable energy via solving fundamental physical problems.  My scientific interests are in heat and mass transport in porous media in connection to phase transitions.  I am guiding a team of PhD students an postdocs that investigates the physical-chemistry of materials for heat storage with the goal to improve them. A class of materials that have my interest are the so-called TCM's (Thermo-Chemical Materials), materials that can store heat via reversible reactions with for example water. I focus on four different aspects:\n\n1) Manipulating TCM's to make a better fit between use conditions and phase behavior.\n2) Improve kinetics of charging/discharging of TCM's in order to increase power output.\n3) Boost the thermal conductivity of TCM's to improve the power output.\n4) Mechanical stabilization of TCM particles to have reliable cyclic performance.\n\nNext to the topic of heat storage, I have worked for more than 10 years on water/ion migration through polymer films and coatings.",

In order to have good print quality the pigment en polymer particles should stay at the surface of the paper after the ink droplet has hit the paper surface. The problem is that paper tends to suck the ink by capillary forces and along with the fluid the particles migrate into the paper. In a joined project of the Eindhoven University of Technology, M2i and Oce the migration of particles in the paper fabric is studied. The goal is to find the key parameters determining the particle penetration and thereby the handles to improve waterbased inks.",

In order to use waterborne coatings for woodcare the main factors determining transport through these coatings have to be understood. Waterborne coatings are intrinsically more sensitive to water. Further, the influence of wood on the coating structure and permeability have to be understood. In this project the migration of water through waterborne coatings on wood will be studied with NMR imaging tools. NMR imaging is very suitable tool for visualizing water distributions in the wood and the coating. Further, NMR also gives information about the state of water (bound or free) and plasticization effects (polymer-water interactions).",
