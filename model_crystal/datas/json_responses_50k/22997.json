    "summary": "All throughout my life and schooling, I had had a strong sense of what I am passionate about, which stems from my intrinsic creative, curious and compassionate nature and desire to make an impact in my community- wherever this may lead me. Thus, I have ensured that I have grounded my academic career in studies that cover all of these three aspects. At age 23, I am very proud to have achieved a masters at the University of Amsterdam in Arts and culture (with a focus on music studies). Throughout both my bachelor and masters degrees I ensured that I would dip my toes in as many varying experiences in and out of university, however I began to partake in these experiences as a young teenager. This resulted in me working for professional global musicians, well accredited therapists and holistic practitioners as well as aiding individuals with learning disabilities and in the mental health sector. As a strong-willed and passionate individual, I have always known what I wanted and gone after it. It is my intention to continue to do so, as I develop my career. I strongly believe in having a strong and dedicated work ethic, whilst maintaining passion as well as compassion! My personal interests and knowledge lie heavily in spirituality, philosophy of the mind and the arts (namely music). I look forward to combining these interest with my background and personal expertise to establish exciting future prospects, and make a positive\u00a0difference!",
