    "summary": "I am an International Marketing & Communication professional with experience in digital content marketing, research and event hosting. Overall, I am inspired by any visual, written and spoken communication and passionate about using creative writing, public speaking and design to help organizations establish meaningful connections with their audiences in the modern, dynamic, interlinked world. \n\nCurrently, I work in international education, creating content and facilitating events for international students of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. My goal is to aid applicants with study choice (a lifechanging decision!), guide them from admission to relocation abroad, and support current students in their educational paths. To respond to my target audience\u2019s needs, I continuously engage in research and exercise critical thinking. \n\nI am a quick and eager learner, continuously striving to improve my skillset. My International Communication studies at the Hanze UAS Groningen and a completed exchange at the American Business School of Paris aid me in my thirst for knowledge, allowing me to broaden my competencies and improve my intercultural sensitivity skills.",
