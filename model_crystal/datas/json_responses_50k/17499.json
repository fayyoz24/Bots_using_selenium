    "summary": "Social, cultural, personal, relational DEVELOPMENT\n\nI am an eternal student driven by the desire to constantly learn new skills and improve those that I already possess. Regardless of the type of job or activity that I am working on, I strive to pursue the best results. The development is the fuel that ignites my dedication to every action. With this in mind, I always try to gain multi-disciplinary knowledge and experience through different jobs.\n\n\u2022 I helped build a school for orphans in Uganda, where I taught them maths and English.\n\u2022 I worked for fostering social inclusion, sustainable production and circular economy development in my local area.\n\u2022 I nurtured my passion for food by working in different restaurants, where I also learned how to handle stressful situations in teams.\n\u2022 I worked in the Czech countryside, farming and learning how to respect and dive into nature through anthroposophy.\n\u2022 I commit to the future of humanity by joining the global community \"Mars Society\", fostering the idea that space exploration should be inclusive and responsible.\n\u2022 And yet, there is still much to do. \n\nIn the meantime, I climb and compose music, and I keep in mind that perfection is not the goal but a tendency.",

The project involved local communities, governance and minorities in creating a long-term plan to transform Lecco into an active and cohesive environment. Through art as a tool, we, as ArtStation#1, organised creative hubs, workshops, conferences, meetings, events, summer schools, sustainable products, and even a restaurant serving only local products. Throughout these activities, we always involved Lecco's citizenship in its entirety without marginalising anybody and creating a building and inclusive community.",
