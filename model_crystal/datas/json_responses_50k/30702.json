Back in 2005, OCI added Oracle Human Resources and Oracle Payroll for more accurate cost and resource tracking at both departmental and project levels. The company also deployed Oracle Procure-to-Pay across 45 industrial business units to deliver precise reporting for top management and enable more accurate and efficient purchase request (PR) and purchase order (PO) routing and processing.\n\nOCI can now efficiently manage and unify employee, supplier, and customer data across all application modules, driving accurate information flow and enabling PR and PO status tracking, from issuance to payment. As a result, OCI can provide a more accurate view of costs for all construction and industrial materials used on each project, which its cost-control engineers can access immediately whenever materials are released from warehouses. OCI has also reduced the project-approval cycle from five days, when using manual spreadsheets and paper forms, to just hours with Oracle Procure-to-Pay purchasing recognition and rapidly centralized order transfers.\n\n",
