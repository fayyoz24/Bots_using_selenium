He is a team player, and he will always try to get the best from the ones surrounding him, as he profoundly trusts in synergy. \n\nQuite familiar with troubleshooting and fine-tuning, Guillermo will try to find the root cause of the problem he encounters, making sure that a solution is already known the next time he or a colleague faces the same situation.\n\nIn addition to a technical mindset, he has also shown a strong interest in management. While studying for the degree, he went from being a dedicated football player to running his football club for 3 years involving fundraising, developing the brand, and coaching male and female teams, among others. \n\nAt this moment he is studying an MBA in International Management in ICEX-CECO",
