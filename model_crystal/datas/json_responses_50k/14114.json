It is a follow-up to the original NIS Directive and aims to increase the resilience of the digital infrastructure of the Member States of the European Union. The NIS2 imposes obligations on operators of essential services and digital service providers, with the aim of reducing cybersecurity risks and improving cooperation between Member States. Through closer cooperation and coordination, the NIS2 aims to strengthen cybersecurity in Europe and ensure the protection of critical systems and digital services.\n\nThese directives will be incorporated into national legislation by the end of 2024 at the latest, which means that this law will apply to many organisations. But what does this mean for Amsterdam UMC?\n\nWe have been asked to investigate which steps need to be taken to comply with the NIS2 certification and to obtain the certificate. Due to the short duration, we have scoped the assignment together with the client and the compliance manager into a manageable assignment. The assignment that has been proposed to us is to create a tool/checklist that clearly indicates what needs to be done to comply with the NIS2. In short, a model of the NIS2 that tests the current measures/processes from previous certifications against the own regulations from the new guideline, in order to provide insight into the 'gap' that is still there.",

With the increasing reliance on technology and the emergence of more organizations, there is a greater need for systems and networks to be protected against cyber threats. However, the shortage of security personnel and lack of practical education in the field of information security pose a risk to organizations. The Virtual SOC provides a solution to this problem by offering hands-on experience to students, preparing them for their future careers in cybersecurity. It performs endpoint monitoring, logs abnormalities, and allows students to practice resolving cyber security issues in a realistic simulation environment. The use of open-source tools allows for ongoing improvement and contributions from the community, making the Virtual SOC more efficient and robust. The Virtual SOC project is a significant step towards addressing the shortage of cybersecurity professionals and improving the overall security of organizations in the digital world.",

We have seen that this has a major influence on the enhanced greenhouse effect. As a result of this problem, we wondered what consequences it would have if we didn't do something about it or what consequences we could stop if we did something. We, as AIRAL, have come up with a small but nice solution that allows us to measure the air quality above certain areas.\n\nWe did this by designing and realizing a device that calculates Air Quality Indexes based on particulate matter and so-called 'volatile organic compounds in the air. He does this by means of external sensors, which specifically measure VOCs. Ultimately, the values \u200b\u200bend up in certain software that calculates AQIs. Those AQI values \u200b\u200bare displayed in an app that should give the consumer a good overview of the air quality in certain areas.\n\nIn the longer term, this should ensure that people make a more conscious choice when it comes to traveling to certain cities. In addition to the goal described before, we have another goal. Our central goal is to use our device to ensure that global warming is reduced, which would lead to a less enhanced greenhouse effect.",
