    "summary": "As an Innovation Sciences graduate working in the renewable energy sector, I am highly motivated to solve societal issues by helping countries and companies achieve their sustainability goals. During my time as a student, I learned that I thrive when different disciplines are combined, and therefore love working in environments that are at the intersection between technology and society - which is exactly what I am currently doing as an advisor for sustainable energy projects at Ventolines. Learning from others and trying to understand their perspective on a matter is important to me when trying to find common solutions.",
