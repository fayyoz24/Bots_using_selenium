Each experience has shaped my mind and approach when presented with a problem; I no longer dwell on it, but instantly switch to \"fix mode\".\n\nI love creativity and innovation and most importantly I love analyzing the outcome! Analyzing the data helps me understand better the direction I should take in order to achieve my goals. Personally I like to view myself as a hybrid between Digital Marketing and Marketing Effectiveness with a dash of Sales understanding.",
