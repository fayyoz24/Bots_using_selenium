Instead of deploying a dedicated fleet, we have deployed various types of environmental sensors on garbage trucks in the City of Cambridge.\n\nWith a few garbage trucks, we collected various environmental data for the whole city over several months. The result is a set of 1.6 million data points including thermal images, temperature, humidity, acceleration and air quality data.\n\nThe spatio\u00adtemporal datasets play a significant role in smart city domain by empowering advanced analytics solutions for decision makers and urban managers. The City Scanner project follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time map of sensed data, building on existing fleets and moving sensing platforms.",

            "description": "As part of the Bachelor Computer Science and Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, my partner (Simon Kassing) and I created a low-cost demonstrator for sensing in the enterprise environment, which we named \"The Sensitive Office\"\u200b. We executed the project after doing a literature study regarding sensor networks. The actual execution of the project resulted in the creation of a general low-cost framework for sensing and a high quality implementation of this framework. The implementation consists out of four components: (1) the sensor nodes, (2) the hub nodes, (3) the server and (4) the database. The product is capable of sensing various phenomena (e.g. temperature, light-intensity, humidity) in any office.\nThe product is already being utilized for other research within IBM regarding the Inclusive Enterprise. The project has also lead to several innovations that are currently pending to be patented. Furthermore, it was referenced to in the Wall Street Journal. The product was developed under supervision of Drs. Sips (IBM) and Prof. Dr. Ir. Geert-Jan Houben (TU Delft) and was graded with a 9/10.\n\nMore information about the context of the project can be found in the Wall Street Journal article \u201cIBM Researchers Try to Measure Employee Well-Being Using Technology\u201d (http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/07/08/ibm-researchers-try-to-measure-employee-well-being-using-technology/) which refers to our project.",
