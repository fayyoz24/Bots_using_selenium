    "summary": "I am passionate about improving patient health on a global level, using mathematical models to study the natural history and control of diseases. With a background in academia, I pursue this passion for health economics at Lumanity since 2018 (when the company was known as BresMed), where I quickly progressed from junior health economist to EU Head of Modelling and Analytics. I am blessed to be working with a highly skilled team of health economists and statisticians located in the Netherlands, Ireland, and the UK, and working closely together with our colleagues in our offices in Germany, USA, and India. \n\nI strive to create an environment for the team in which we can reach our full potential and optimize client collaborations. With a strong believe that we should never stop learning, the appropriate set of challenges and the right level of support ensure growth in a non-stressful manner. And, importantly, it ensures that the team can develop in the direction they are passionate about and are proud to take ownership of. \n\nI am eager to work together proactively in search of a tailored solution for any challenge our clients may encounter. With my diverse background, I bring a creative perspective to the table to enable this search. Together we can define, develop and execute successful health economic and outcomes research strategies.  \n\nLooking forward to connecting with you!",

The groups\u2019 interests include evaluating the benefits, harms, and costs of HPV vaccination and screening and identifying the most efficient, cost-effective strategies for cervical cancer control, including strategies in HIV positive women. The Cervical Group is also leveraging opportunities made possible by CISNET\u2019s comparative modeling approach to disseminate findings and strengthen transparency, understanding, and confidence in model-based analyses of cervical cancer control strategies.",
