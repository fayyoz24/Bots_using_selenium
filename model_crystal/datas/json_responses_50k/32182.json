Resulting in an a website which delivers a great customer experience.\n\nMain improvements:\n\n- Information combined on single pages\nUser research showed that the separation between service information and technical information caused confusion by the users. We solved this by combining all product information on single pages.\n\n- Less pages & fewer steps\nThe site has become more concise, so there are fewer steps needed to find what you are looking for.\n\n- One website for all customers\nExplorative research showed that the desired target groups (small business professionals and high end consumers) have similar needs and wishes. In addition, their work life and personal life is highly integrated. This resulted in the decision to integrate the consumer and business section of the previous website.\n\n- Responsive website\nThe new design is fully responsive and designed with the tablet display as the primary view. This means that the site, no matter what device is used by customers, will look great, function correctly, and load quickly. This can be on their smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop.\n",
