    "summary": "\u2018Change\u2019 and \u2018growth\u2019 have been 2 constants in my life and career so far.\nI started my career as project coordinator at Ahold Delhaize in Brussels (BE) of which sustainable packaging was my pet peeve project. Then my partner and I started our expat adventure, now spanning 10 years.\nWe moved from Paris (FR) where I had my own technical undershirt business, to Dallas, TX where I joined a scaling digital marketing boutique as Chief of Staff, to NYC where I was Business Developer for a Tech Scaleup and became a mom of 2 to now The Hague (NL) where I have the opportunity to bring experience in growing and changing together at Team Bliss (www.teambliss.nl), a change management consulting company where results \u00e1nd heart are equally important.\nBecause that is what I learned along the way, change requires the right mindset, but in truth it requires heart. It only lasts and it is only durable if it comes from within.\nThe same for growth, lasting growth, is growth that comes from growing from within based on trust in yourself and the process.\nWith Bliss, I look forward to contributing to our mission of bringing this new way of working - a focus on both results and intrinsic growth - to 100,000 professionals in 5 years.\n\nDo reach out if you like to chat about joining Bliss or finding out how our consultants can help with change projects at your company.\n\nOn a personal level, I am passionate about the motherhood transition and have obtained a Life Coach certificate to one day support \nmoms on this journey.\n\nFinally, because of my international experience in the USA and I cheer on our start-ups and scale-ups that want to make the jump across the pond, I am always happy to make connections should I have access to a relevant network for them.",
