    "summary": "The new normal? Living in a world where the economy is about offering 'meaningful' products and services designed for improving people's quality of life. That is the new normal I envision.  \n  \nWe work hard to make that happen. ProPortion offers human-centered design and venture building support to NGOs, social businesses and corporates who aim to impact low-income communities. We support them in innovating new services, products and business models and build social impact ventures. \n\nOur methodology combines human-centered design and lean start-up. A key success is to have great empathy for the people you want to design a solution for. Through qualitative research, we gain a deep understanding of people's needs, aspirations and constraints to generate rich insights. We turn those insights into ideas, in co-creation with the customer segments and other system actors. We prototype the most promising ideas to get user feedback as soon as possible, to learn and pivot, till we get it right. This includes validation of revenue models, marketing and pricing, in order to create viable innovations. \n\nOver the last 11 years, we have enriched our skills & knowledge base through getting our hands dirty in the field in co-creating new innovations with and for low-income communities in South Asia, Africa and South America. We are passionate and highly motivated to share our experience with others to speed up the mainstreaming of such social entrepreneurial industry & venture building. For that reason, we have launched the Proportion Academy whereby local instructors around the world train and coach aspiring entrepreneurs in building ventures.  ",

            "description": "Colombia has the highest victim rate of landmines in the world. It causes, together with diabetes and traffic accidents, many amputees. When ProPortion found out there are many amputees in Colombia that do not have access to a qualitative prosthesis, we decided to further research the situation.\n\nIn the past 5 months we went for 9 weeks to Colombia with a group of young talented designers from TU Delft. We interviewed prosthesis makers, healthcare insurance companies and other stakeholders in the Colombian health care system. We learned the current way of prosthesis making in Colombia is time-consuming and requires a lot of knowledge and skills. The experienced and certified prosthetic centres are mainly located in big cities, therefore rural amputees need to travel a lot. During this time they cannot take care of their families, nor work, creating all sorts of social, financial and mental problems. Since prostheses are expensive, and people not always have effective insurance companies, so a part of the low-income amputees do not get a prosthesis at all. \n\nDuring our research, we found an exciting new way to create prosthetic sockets invented by the Strathclyde University (UK) that makes it possible to make qualitative lower limb prosthetic socket prosthesis in a short amount of time for a low price. It is relatively easy to teach and implement, especially in low income countries where human resources are often scarce and the demand is high.\n\nWe aim to deliver within the coming 2 years a fully working product in order to create a prosthesic socket that can be combined with other low-cost components in order to have a qualitative, affordable prosthesis; and a business plan with a value proposition, a marketing strategy and the roadmap to create impact at scale. In order to restore the mobility and independence of amputees, so that they can lead a mobile and dignified life. \n\nIf you know people that could be interested in this project, please let me know!",
