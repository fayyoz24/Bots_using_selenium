    "summary": "With a background as an experimental spectroscopist \u2013 someone who uses light to study matter \u2013 I am specializing in building more and more complex systems. I am always looking for possibilities: I come up with ideas easily and can quickly evaluate their viability. Practical feasibility and the end-user experience are important considerations for me. By doing this iteratively this results in a well-considered solution. I like to work in diverse teams where you can use and complement each others qualities.",
