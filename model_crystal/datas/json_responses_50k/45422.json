This NGO also teaches these girls, sexual education and self-defence. For this project alongside others I modeled for one of many student designers. Over the months we tried on the clothes countless of times and made alterations and practiced the structure of the fashion show.",

I led classes sometimes with another partner but mostly by myself. I interacted closely with the participants as it was a hand on job and required me to be in the pool and demonstrate and help them at all times.",
