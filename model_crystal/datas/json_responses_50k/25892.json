This project involved researching, designing, constructing, and testing multiple damping methods for helicopter blade models in order to reduce the damped natural frequency of the blade assemblies for S-97 Raider Helicopters. We successfully achieved Sikorsky\u2019s desired deliverables including designing a damper system that significantly reduced beam vibration in addition to being inexpensive, highly durable, and easily variable. We then provided insightful and well-researched recommendations to Sikorsky as to which damper designs were most optimal for further analysis and development by the company.
