    "summary": "Who am I? My name is Tom, positive attitude and am always open to a new challenge. Definitely, a social butterfly with a strong organizational connection. Continuously networking. \n\nThe perfect fit for my role as Community Manager at The Villy Rhapsody (Amsterdam) and The Villy Terraced Tower (Rotterdam). My full-time mission for The Villy is to create a place that feels honest, familiar, friendly, and, most of all, inclusive and inviting. I am in constant contact with residents, guests and the neighbourhood of The Villy's. I love making connections among and with them. \n\nA community doesn't just happen. For this, I use the right tools. Collaborations with the neighbourhood, organizing events (workshops, VrijMiBo's, collaboration days, you name it), social media and much more. I do everything I can to create optimal engagement. \n\nFurthermore, I graduated from the Hotel Management School Maastricht with a Bachelor in Hospitality Management (BA) with an average of 8.2. Here I followed a great minor in Sales & Marketing as an exchange at the FHW Wien der WKW in Vienna. During this study, I lived in Vienna and did a Washington as a Whatever/Whenever agent at W Hotel D.C. What a time! After my final internship as Brand Strategist at MediaMonks (IMAgency), I followed and obtained a Pre-Master Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam. This was followed by my Master in Science (BA), specializing in Digital Marketing. I completed this study with an average of 7.3. My thesis 'Does eco-labelling in green social media advertisements impact consumer purchase intentions? Does the trust in eco-labels and green word of mouth moderate this relationship?\" I finished with a 7.5. Fun fact: I got my Master's degree with (72 ECTS instead of 60) due to taking extra courses. \n\nBesides this study, I have been working as a full-time board member at Study Association Sefa. The Faculty Association of Economics and Business at the University of Amsterdam. Currently I am in the Supervisory Board of Sefa. Supervising the current Board as previous Marketing Officer.",

The Supervisory Board of Sefa has three main tasks: controlling, advising and motivating.\n\nControlling\nThe Supervisory Board monitors the functioning of the Sefa Board on behalf of the General Meeting (GM). This is mainly done by examining the board\u2019s weekly minutes, quarterly financial statements, the half-year and end of the year reports. The Supervisory and Sefa Board meet every eight weeks to discuss the status of the Sefa Board\u2019s policy plan and the finances of the association. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is involved in the search and selection of new Sefa Board members.\n\nAdvising\nThe Supervisory Board advices the Sefa Board on the difficult issues that arise during a board year: these can be association-related issues, but also issues of a personal nature. The Supervisory and Sefa Board meet once a year to discuss the future of the association, which results in an updated version of the Sefa long-term strategy.\n\nMotivating\nA board year can be demanding and stressful at times. The Supervisory Board tries to support the Sefa Board as a whole, but also individually. Every Sefa Board member is matched up with a member of the Supervisory Board: this way the individual board members always have someone to fall back on."
