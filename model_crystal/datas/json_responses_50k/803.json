    "summary": "My professional life began at the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs where I served in two Directorate Generals - African Affairs and Protocol. In African Affairs I was a desk officer for ten North, Central, and West African countries. My experience in the international politics of Africa is complemented by my academic career. I studied Political Science and International Relations at undergraduate and graduate levels and completed my Ph.D. studies in 2019 at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in The Hague. With extensive teaching and supervision experience, I have the skills to supervise and motivate research at undergrad and graduate levels. My research skill is strengthened by reviewing papers for scientific journals and publishing in them as well as extensive field research in Ethiopia and archival research in the Nordic Africa Institute and the University of Cape Town. My job and research interests focuses on (East)Africa political economy, democratization and development, and elite/oligarchy studies as well as diplomatic and business relations of Ethiopia with the rest of the world.
