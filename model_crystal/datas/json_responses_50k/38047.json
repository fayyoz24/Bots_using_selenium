    "summary": "My work is driven by a single passion - to make the value of nature and sustainability visible in our economy and fundamental to how we define and measure growth and success. \n\nI have over fifteen years of experience in advisory, management and leadership in sustainable development with a focus on green economy, both in the public and private sector, in developed and emerging economies. I am currently the Global Advisor at GIZ\u2019s Natural Resources Stewardship Global Programme, supporting business, government and civil society to partner in joint solutions to manage natural resources and water-related risks. I have recently returned to Europe after 5 years in Uganda with GIZ managing delivery of both the Water Stewardship and Natural Resources Stewardship programmes with the Ministry of Water and Environment. Prior to GIZ I was the Senior Expert Green Economy at IUCN Netherlands, overseeing and advising projects on both natural capital for European corporates and developing economies. I have also spent a few years at a consumer empowerment tech start-up, and in Vietnam working on national park management and social forestry. I have also guest lectured on green economy at a number of universities, including Makerere University in Kampala, Free University of Amsterdam and Wageningen University.\n\nI am a dual British/Dutch citizen, married, and have two daughters. I am currently based in Bonn.\n\nSpecialties: Green Growth; Green Economy; Corporate sustainability (F&B, agri-business, water, finance); Natural Capital Accounting; Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB); Business and Biodiversity; . Value chains, standard setting and certification; biodiversity based business cases and models; innovations in advertising and communicating sustainability.",
