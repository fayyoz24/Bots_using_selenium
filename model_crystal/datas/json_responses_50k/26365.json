Molybdenum is a candidate catalyst with excellent surface smoothness but poor graphene nucleation, while nickel stimulates and sustains continuous graphene growth, but has poor control over the deposition rate and quality. This research proposes a model to employ the two contrasting growth mechanisms to complement each other in a binary metal alloy system. Varying compositions of Ni and Mo co-sputtered thin films were processed by CVD to consider the feasibility of uniform graphene growth on their surface.  The thin film surfaces were characterized by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Although graphene growth was not achieved in the current experimental setup, existing critical parameters and mechanisms were investigated to inform future approaches.",

This report has reviewed the recent developments in the on-going efforts to induce a bandgap in graphene.  Although graphene has  many  interesting  properties,  its  major  drawback  is  the  lack  of  bandgap  in  its  pristine  state.   Inducing a  bandgap  does  have  its  consequences  but  the  effect of those consequences is still small and neither does it degrade the device performance where graphene is deployed,  nor  does  it  change  the  properties  of  graphene itself.  Indeed, a trade-off needs to be brought out between the size of the bandgap and the required mobility for optimum performance of g-FET. The main focus of this report was the variety of methods to induce a bandgap in graphene.",

            "description": "In this design project the aim was to develop a MID-IR spectrometer using Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs)as the source of emission. Benefits of using QCLs are that they create high intensity single mode emission and their small size compared to ordinary MID-IR spectroscopic techniques that use infrared lamps (FTIR). Due to these benefits, QCLs show high potential in performing real time measurements in Lab on a Chip (LOC)scale environments.  This will enable real time monitoring of (bio)chemical processes.  The reason QCLs are still not used often is their lack of tunability and their cost.  In order to achieve multiple wavelengths in a spectrometer, the approach of arraying is used where multiple Quantum Cascade Lasers(QCLs) are deployed. Each QCL has a dedicated waveguide coupled to it using the end-butt coupling method and the waveguides are combined using beam combiners.  The approach of side-wall gratings is used to overcome the drawbacks such as high-power dissipation, metal-semiconductor losses and regrowth process of gratings fabricated on the top of the semiconductor structure",

            "description": "To bring a balance between the switching time and actuation voltage, the Fixed-Fixed beam for  MEMS Switch has been designed and simulated. The beam was designed with microscale  dimensions. To go beyond silicon for MEMS devices, graphite was chosen as the beam material  for testing. \nThe beam was designed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a using various studies and physics  available in the software. The physics chosen for the beam design was electromechanics and the  studies chosen were stationery and time-dependant.  \nActuation voltage, beam thickness and air gap were the parameters that were studied to achieve  a good switching time. Graphite, silicon, gold and aluminium were the four materials tested for  the beam material.  \nThe proposed beam design has overcome the drawbacks such as large oscillations and long  settling time of the rectangular beam design. Among the materials tested, graphite had the fastest  switching time with 115ns, silicon with 125ns, aluminium with 140ns and gold with 400ns. To  achieve these switching times, actuation voltage, beam thickness, and air gap were kept constant. \nGraphite has performed well against the other three materials that were tested. The best achieved  switching time for the graphite beam was 115ns with actuation voltage of 40V, beam thickness  of 400nm and air gap of 500nm.  \n",
