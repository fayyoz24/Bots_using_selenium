Simultaneously, we crafted a Contracting Strategy, incorporating key elements like handovers, coordination efforts, and compensation structures.\n- Phase 3 involved the establishment of a robust Project Governance Structure, thoughtfully aligned with the project's values and objectives. This structure empowered proactive responses to deviations or issues through corrective actions and facilitated informed decision-making concerning change requests.",
