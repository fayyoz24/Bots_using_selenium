    "summary": "Volunteering at Staatsbosbeheer, protector at stichting Limburgs Landschap, member of the Dutch mycological organization, member of IVN nature education, obsessed user of ObsIdentify and Waarneming.nl and a candidate member of parliament for the Dutch Libertarian party. You could call me a true \"green libertarian\" with a strong heart for the natural human rights and applying the same none-aggression-principles to the environment around us. I think the total living biomass on earth and the diversity therein are the most important values on our scorecards. And in my position I strive to have a positive impact one this. \n\nI also got a special weakness for swamps and bogs, a little bit of an underdog in human's history as all attempt were made to get them dry and productive. I think we need to learn to appreciate the true value of these wetlands with sphagnum as the predominant driver within these ecosystems. they play an essential role in water(quality) management, housing of biodiversity, (local) climates and in sustainable food production as a renewable substrate constituent.",

And simply by the numbers; the exports of goods has a larger growth potential than the imports of goods to the Netherlands. \n\nThe Solution: I carried out a research within the sector. While doing so, I talked to many representatives within the food industry and government officials. I participated in different seminars and congresses, creating foundation for the implementation along the way. \n\nThe Result: I cannot provide more insight into the project because it is currently in its implementation phase and defines Seacon's strategy to a lesser extent. However it contributed to the government's interest in Seacon as a worthy advisory within the food industry.",

The involved product lines were: Scitex, Indigo and the Inkjet Web Presses. \n\nProblem 1: Within HP large quantities of marketing collateral such as photos, videos and customer references are created and spread within HP to be used in media communications. The internal dispersement of these was facing difficulties. Colleagues were unable to find marketing material within the dedicated system, or unaware of the creation of some. This resulted in time-loss because of unnecessary communication and double data transfers.    \nSolution 1: The creation of a list of created materials and the addition of a unique project code to every photo shoot. Secondly this information would be shared with all involved employees within HP so that everyone who regularly uses marketing collateral is aware of what has been done and where they can find it.  \n\nProblem 2: HP was changing its appearance and logo. For the large-scale and high-capacity business printers, \"Customer Success Stories\" were an important marketing tool. However these stories were still in HP's old style and needed to be adapted before the start of the DRUPA trade show (http://www.drupa.de/). \nSolution 2: I lead the project of change of these customer testimonials and fulfilled a central role between the performing agencies in India, the technical support in Mexico, and managers in Spain, Great Britain, Israel and the United States. \n\nResults: All deadlines were met and the customer stories were on display at the HP stand at Drupa 2012. Furthermore the internal search-engine for videos and images could finally be used.",

Customers would receive return instructions, but in many cases the origin of returned goods was still unclear. At the time only one manager had the abilities to process these. In his absence nobody could do the task of handling returned goods and giving cash reinbursements. \n\nThe solution: Firstly, to map out the different returned goods flows and the different tasks and procedures which come with them, and secondly, to write instructions for the other employees to follow. \n\nThe results: The instructions are still being used up to this day, even after Oc\u00e9 became part of the Canon Group.",
