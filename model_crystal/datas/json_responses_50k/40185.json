    "summary": "A spatial and regional planning expert with over a decade of experience in consultancy services involving various town, urban and regional development planning and management projects. Expertise in different inclusive planning process approaches for spatial/non-spatial development plans, policies and strategies across Nigeria birthed my research interest in providing practical solutions with the use of planning support systems (PSS) in the spatial planning practices across the Global South. \n\nA researcher with consultancy experience avails practical knowledge to execute studies to embed and institutionalise PSS in spatial planning practice. My interest in PSS encompasses the use of geo-information sciences (GIS) tools, technologies and methodologies. Also,  the quest for contemporary innovations and methods in spatial planning strategies for a sustainable, inclusive and resilient environment for human settlement, socio-economic development and regional planning. \n\nOne of such innovation I work with and research is the Spatial Development Framework (SDF) methodology developed by UN-HABITAT in 2011 which is being implemented in countries across the global south. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563475.2019.1658571",
