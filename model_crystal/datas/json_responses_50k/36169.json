I was responsible for the development, planning, implementation, content development and program outputs, such as articles, publications and events.\n\nTogether with partners, I co-managed the Corporate Action Group for Reporting on the SDGs from 2019 to 2020, a knowledge-sharing and peer-to-peer learning platform that supported businesses to advance their contribution towards sustainable development. The program engaged senior business representatives from over a dozen of countries in a thought leadership program that enabled companies to define and improve their contribution to the SDGs. \n\nAfter this, I led the Business Leadership Forum on Corporate Reporting as a Driver to Achieving the SDGs, an international thought leadership program that brought together sustainability reporting practitioners, key stakeholders, and data users. \n- The program engaged more than 130 sustainability experts and leaders across 8 stakeholder groups. \n- Through a series of 8 online workshops, we brought together businesses with leading experts from key stakeholder groups. They facilitated dialogues focused on understanding data users\u2019 needs and expectations related to corporate sustainability and SDG reporting. \n- 7 summary papers were developed, and are freely available to the entire community of sustainability practitioners and advocates. \n- To further disseminate the learnings and thought leadership produced by the Forum, a series of 4 masterclasses and open webinars were conducted. Through these, we reached a wide audience of over 2,720 sustainability practitioners. \n\nBesides, I develop high-quality content and learning materials that build capacity for sustainability reporting, directed to different audiences through multiple channels (webinars, workshops, reports, and e-learnings courses).",

I collaborated on teams composed by managers and directors of HR or Corporate Social Responsibility/Sustainability from international companies with the goal of developing sustainable business strategies and solutions through research and cross-sector collaboration. \n\nIn addition, I scouted, approached and engaged new partners in the public, private and third sectors as well as engaged with businesses in the wider corporate community while advocating for the network. I researched D&I and CSR policies, initiatives, best practices and latest trends and co-authored 3 guidebooks and a toolkit.
