The potential well energies, that con\ufb01nes electrons in three dimensions, and the Coulomb energy (the average value of Coulomb repulsion existing between an electron and a hole) were considered in the lowest states of the potential well. I observed that the smaller the diameter of the quantum dot, the more con\ufb01ned the movements of the electrons and holes and this raises the energy necessary to excite the electron into the conduction band. Due to this, the band gap energies decreased with the increasing diameter of the quantum dots. The calculated band gap energies were compared with reported values (experimentally observed as well as theoretically calculated) in these quantum dots and found that my results agree with experimentally observed values only at lower radii.",
