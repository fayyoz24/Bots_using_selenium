I have 5 years of experience managing and executing multi-faceted research projects.\n\n\u2705 As a fast learner with great eye for detail I efficiently deliver high quality output. Innovative data that I generated in my Ph.D. were key in securing $1M in funding for the lab, and were featured in 2 peer-reviewed publications in high ranking journals.\n\n\ud83d\udcac I am a reliable team player with strong collaboration and communication skills. I have presented complex information to diverse audiences at 8 (inter)national conferences, which resulted in winning 3 presentation awards. \n\n\nI strive to advance the empowerment of women and minority groups, and I have a special interest in physical and mental wellbeing related to reproductive health. In my free time, I love hiking in nature, practising yoga and travelling.",
