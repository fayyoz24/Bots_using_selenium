The thing to keep in mind, however, is that this growth be in tandem with a sustainable environment. Recognizing my confidence, the Government of Dubai appointed me the Youth Ambassador for Dubai's bid for Expo 2020, a bold vision of a city reinventing itself to become the world's hotspot for business, social, technological and environmental innovation. My team's efforts were handsomely rewarded when Dubai won the EXPO 2020 bid! Since then, I've been working tirelessly with my Innovation Team for promoting large-scale scientific & technological projects in the build-up of the Expo, most notably the \"3D Dubai Initiative\", which targets that one-quarter of buildings of Dubai be 3D printed by 2025.

In 2012, I was selected as Campaign Leader for the Neighborhood Recycling Project 2012. Through this project, I not only gave away more than 500 Kgs of paper, plastic and aluminium cans, but also got the opportunity to spread the word of the importance of recycling. Thank you EEG for the wonderful experience!"
