    "summary": "Ready to make a change with my strong communication skills and my determined personality. I think that what differentiates me from others is my ability to adapt to different situations and people around me, as well as portray my skills in the best way possible. I graduated from high school at an English-speaking school in Vancouver, and after that, I started my bachelor\u2019s program in Marketing Management at Hanze UAS in Groningen. I worked on many different projects in which I helped companies with market research and possible expansion plans, together with online and offline marketing strategies. Additionally, I completed two six-month internships. The former was in a small and dynamic marketing department of an international company based in the Netherlands. The latter as a Sales Development Intern in a Dutch-based scaleup operating in the L&D field. Along with a four-month International Business Management program in Bordeaux, France. As of today, I am working as Business Development Associate at Garter's vibrant Barcelona office. I think I can be a great addition to any company by bringing my knowledge, a lot of positivity and motivation.",
