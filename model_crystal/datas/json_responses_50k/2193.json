It was founded in 2011, as a continuation of the Committee for the Protection of Stray Animals, which had started in 1994.\n\nEvery year, in collaboration with the veterinarians of the area, we collect, treat, neuter and promote for adoption the stray animals that we find in the boundaries of the Municipality. We host them in private shelters and often in our homes, until they are adopted.\n\nOur goal is to find in each animal its own family, so we have chosen, as far as we can, not to follow the method of reintegrating animals into the inhospitable environment of the city.\n\nFinally, we seek to inform and cultivate the consciousness of the responsible pet owner, in our fellow citizens, in order to reduce the phenomenon of animal abandonment."
