    "summary": "I am a systemic thinker who enjoys optimizing complex processes and workflows, preferably while working together with a diverse team. Security, in the broadest sense of the word, interests me a lot. New threats such as climate change, energy scarcity, terrorism, attacks in the cyber space and foreign meddling ask for adequate and strategic solutions, both in the public and private sector. I am passionate to contribute to making the world a more secure, safe and sustainable place. I can characterize myself as a team player, open to other ideas, cultures and influences. I am a direct, emphatic and a very enthusiastic person. In all things I do, I strive for a challenge and the possibility to develop myself.\n\nHe/him",
