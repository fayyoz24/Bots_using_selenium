    "summary": "From an early age, Egith, aka IGGY was fascinated by horses and found, through her relationship with them, a place of peace and power.  She trained horses on an international level at professional show jumping stables across the world.\n\nIggy balanced her love of horses with her business brains and applied to the Johan Cruiff University in Amsterdam where she studied a Bachelor of Business Administration. Throughout her modeling career, Iggy was inspired by fashion and so in 2016 she graduated from the Cond\u00e9 Nast College of Fashion and Design in London. \n\nIggy is known for her million-dollar smile and sustained her modeling career throughout her studies, rising in the industry to become an International cover girl. She worked for prominent fashion houses such as Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Escada, Monique Lhuillier & Carolina Herrera, to name a few. She has appeared in editorials for various magazines including Elle, Harper\u2019s Bazaar & Glamour. Iggy has had the honor to work with celebrities such as George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Antonio Bandera & Gary Oldman. She has stared in TV Shows such as American Beauty Star, Glam Masters & The Affair. \n\nAt the peak of her career, Iggy found herself in search of greater meaning and purpose and embarked upon her spiritual journey. In order to find herself, she knew she had to look at her shadows to uncover her gift which she could then share with others. She then started, 'Models See The Light,' a platform to spread a powerful message of body positivity, self-awareness and the power of sisterhood. \n\nAfter MSTL, she continued to be the face of Dolcezza Montreal. A Canadian Fashion brand where she is not only the brandambassadeur but also in charge of Public Relations, Marketing and Social Media.\nBy moving to Istanbul Iggy picked up her tv presenting skills. Ending up working for TRT WORLD\nWhere she is now presenting the TV show \u2019SHOWCASE\u2019",

Their journeys were colored with stories that ranged from wild parties and famous flings to eating disorders and cases of untold sexual harassment.\n \nFor a long time, both women felt alone in an industry that perpetuated competition and comparison but through sharing their stories, they broke through this separation and found sisterhood.\n \nInspired by the healing that they found in one another, they decided to start recording their conversations and sharing it through their Instagrams. Models See The Light was soon born.\n \nRaw and real, MSTL is a safe space to talk about the shadows of an industry that sells perfection. Honoring the dualities of life, MSTL aims not to judge or give answers but to ask the difficult questions, shining a light on topics that may support other young models on their journeys in the industry.",
