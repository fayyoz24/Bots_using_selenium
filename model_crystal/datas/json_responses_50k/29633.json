    "summary": "I have recently graduated cum laude, with a double degree. One in Physics and the other in Liberal Arts and Sciences. My broad academic background gives me a unique perspective on problems and challenges and allows me to seek and produce well rounded, creative, and effective solutions. I have a strong background in data analysis and problem-solving and my analytical skills are sharp and polished. \"How can this be improved?\" is a question that rings constantly in the back of my mind when I approach any task. I am always seeking to find more efficient and effective solutions to problems, challenges, and tasks I pursue.\n\nI am passionate about applied physics and mathematics, machine learning, data visualization, and problem-solving. Furthermore, I am highly motivated to produce high-quality work, I do this by maintaining focus and an eye for detail. I have fantastic analytical and problem-solving abilities and intermediate programming, numerical, and software development skills. I enjoy dissecting complex problems into smaller more focused pieces, before tackling the entire problem. This allows me to not only have a holistic picture of the problem at hand but allows me to effectively explain complex and technical systems and solutions to a non-technical audience.  Beyond my technical abilities, I have excellent and well developed interpersonal skills. I value creating and maintaining strong and reliable relationships with colleagues and clients.\n\n",

As it stands, the results are being kept privately by the Soft Condensed Matter and Biophysics (SCMB) group for future research and publications, a great honor. I really appreciate the guidance and support from my research supervisor, Dr. L Fillion, and my research team at the institute. \n\nMy research project, entitled \"Extracting the interaction force profile\nfrom noisy colloidal trajectories\", reported and expanded on a newly presented method that allows for the determination of the interparticle force profile from particle trajectories.  Using numerical simulations of nano-particles (colloids) -- Programmed in C -- I generated many data sets of particle trajectories in a range of systems. These data sets were then analyzed extensively in Python using a variety of statistical and numerical methods, which ultimately led to the successful extraction of the interaction force profiles.\n\nDuring this valuable time, I gained many technical and professional skills. I learned how to program in C during the project, in order to write the code to execute and record data from the numerical simulations. I also become much more proficient with using LaTex while writing the lengthy report. Furthermore, I provided weekly reports and presentations to the research group, updating them on my progress, and answering questions any of the team members may have had.  Overall, this was a fantastic challenge and experience. ",
