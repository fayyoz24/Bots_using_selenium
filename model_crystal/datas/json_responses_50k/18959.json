    "summary": "I am a passionate and motivated applied mathematician with a talent for tackling challenging problems across a wide range of mathematical subjects. As a pragmatist, I am dedicated to bridging the gap between mathematical theory and the real world. During my undergraduate (double BSc Applied Physics & Applied Mathematics) and graduate (MSc Applied Mathematics) studies, my area of focus was within the analysis and implementation of numerical methods for (partial) differential equations. \n\nIn terms of programming and scripting: I am fluent in MATLAB and and Python, where I use object-oriented programming to perform data-driven design analysis and optimization. I furthermore have basic working knowledge regarding C#, TypeScript and SQL during my time as a system developer.\n\nIn addition to the core skills which I developed during my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have focused my recent work as a PhD candidate on the design of materials, structures, and microelectronic components using multi-fidelity Bayesian machine learning techniques. Through research collaborations between various universities and industrial partners, I have also gained working-level knowledge of deep learning with artificial neural networks. My goal is to continue applying my skills to solve complex problems and drive meaningful results in a variety of fields.",
