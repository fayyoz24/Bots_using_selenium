    "summary": "'Do more of what makes you happy' \u2728\n\nThis has been a quote that I have used for a long time now. Creating events is what I am passionate about, and which make me happy. Using your creative mind to come up with innovative ideas and see this all come alive is what drives me. Seeing which positive effects your event has on people, is a feeling which cannot be described. Do more of what makes you happy and you will find joy in whatever you do. \nAlways keen to learn new things, discuss ideas, or brainstorm on innovations. \n\nFeel free to contact me through leanschotting@hotmail.com",

Some of my daily tasks are; making quotations and invoices, managing the hosts, making the event scripts and schedules and of course managing the event on the day itself. During this period at Raccoon, I have learned a lot and developed new competencies (especially) in sales.\n\nRaccoon designs communication with impact, we build serious escape rooms and games.
