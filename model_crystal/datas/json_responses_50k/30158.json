During this reorganization, I got the responsibility for preparing sales budgets and free good policy for 2013. I also worked on sales/marketing activities and budgets, too. \n\nOne final note, I have developed and launched a new bonus scheme and sales targeting system and all the field force targets are currently defined and measured by these systems at the moment.\n\nAt the moment, my department still carries on essential sales force effectiveness activities plus alternative sales channels too.\n\nAt beginning of 2013, company decided to run another project with McKinsey & Co to define 2020 Strategy of Nobel \u0130la\u00e7.
