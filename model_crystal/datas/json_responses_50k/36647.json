    "summary": "With significant experience in both the public and private sectors, my most recent role, for over four years, was as project coordinator and head of Sustainable Development at Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES) in Bolivia. Here, I spearheaded the development and execution of strategies, methodologies, and content for eight projects. These initiatives spanned a wide range of domains including economic and sustainable development, digital transformation, urban agriculture and food policies, and international relations, among others aimed at contributing to democracy and governance in Bolivia. As part of my leadership role, I coordinated the research agenda, oversaw publication content, and moderated events featuring high-profile authorities and stakeholders.\n\nIn my other capacities -as a consultant, fellow, lecturer, and published author- I have had the privilege to participate in national and international forums, as well as make contributions to initiatives led by organizations like International IDEA, UNDP, and the Global Solutions Initiative, among others, in an effort to address the most pressing multidimensional challenges.\n\nI hold a Bachelor's degree in Political Science with a minor in International Relations, an MSc in Sustainability Science, Policy and Society from Maastricht University, and an MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Cambridge, where I was awarded as a Trinity Hall Bateman Scholar.\n\nDriven by a deep commitment to sustainability, democracy, and social justice, I am always searching for meaningful opportunities to effect change in these areas.",
