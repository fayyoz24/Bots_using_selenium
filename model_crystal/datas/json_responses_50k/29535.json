    "summary": "As a young evolutionary biologist, I am interested in many aspects of biological diversity, specifically the evolution of species traits and interactions. I am currently in the process of finishing my PhD thess at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by dr. Martijn Egas and prof. Toby Kiers.\nMy aim is to have a career in science, evolutionary research, but also in teaching. Ideally, I would simultaneously develop myself as a researcher and teacher, and be able to pass on my interests by inspiring others.",

This spider mite species originated in South America but has recently become an invasive species in many parts of the world. The rapid spread of this species is of concern for agriculture, because it likes to eat many commercially grown crops, such as tomato, potato, aubergine and pepper. \n\nOne reason why T. evansi can so easily infest these plants is that it can suppress their defense. The exact mechanism behind this is unknown, but it causes the infested plants to be very edible compared to other plants. Upon infestation, the spider mites quickly multiply, and cover the plant with dense webbing. Within 2-3 weeks the plant dies, and the mites disperse to find new host plants.\n\nSuppression of plant defense is not new for science, but the extent to which T. evansi can suppress plant defense is unprecedented. Why is T. evansi so keen on suppressing plant defense? What evolutionary forces have driven this species to become such an aggressive suppressor? In my research I aim to find answers to these questions.\n\nMy research has so far led to the following publications:\n(1) Kant MR, Jonckheere W., Knegt B, Lemos F, Liu J, Schimmel BCJ, Villarroel CA, Ataide LMS, Dermauw W, Glas JJ, Egas M, Janssen A, Van Leeuwen T, Schuurink RC, Sabelis MW and Alba JM.

The idea was first instigated by Amotz Zahavi in 1975, and states that by demonstrating extravagant and costly traits, males can try to impress females, in an attempt to convince them to mate. This theory has led to an extensive amount of scientific discussion, heated debates, mathematical modeling, and observational studies. In my review, I summarize the onset of this discussion (1975) until the first synthesis was reached between the Handicap Principle and its main adversary, Runaway Sexual Selection, by Hanna Kokko in 2006. Specifically, from a set of theoretical papers on this subject, I derive the criteria that an emperical study of the Handicap Principle should meet.\nThis project was supervised by prof. Maurice W.

On the side, I engaged into volunteering work at the rowing club, of which two functions stand out:\n1) Chairman of the yearbook committee (2010-2011). My task was chairing and heading a 7000 euros project, resulting in a 200+ pages book, 550 units printed. Work entailed fundraising (5000 euros from advertisements) as well as graphical design.\n2) Secretary of the Skoll Cup organizing committee, hosting more than 2000 participants and spectators within one weekend.
