I performed requirement gathering, design, hardware appraisal and selection, implementation & installation. I liaised directly with customers, both end users (paramedics) and management in New Zealand.\nThis project completed a successful in-field trial run and included enhanced features not in the paper form, but that were possible with an electronic form. \n\nThe next largest project, CAD2CAD, lasted eighteen months, and involved development of a system that allowed the three ambulance services that cover New Zealand to pass data to each other and send back ups of all Emergency Calls taken, in the event of a catastrophic failure of a call centre.\nI took the previously gathered System Requirements through to development and on-site live installation in the three New Zealand call centres. After returning from NZ for installation, the debugging and optimisation was done from Australia.\n\t\nOther, smaller projects, included various roles developing Paging, Push-to-Talk Radio, GIS and Medical Alarms add-ons to the Computer Aided Dispatch system for Ambulance and Fire Services.\n\n\u2022\tVisual Basic 6\n\u2022\tEmbedded Visual Basic 6 for PocketPC\n\u2022\tEmbedded C for Pocket PC\n\u2022\tVB.NET\n\u2022\tC#.NET\n\u2022\tODBC/MS SQLServer\n\u2022\tPocketPC",
