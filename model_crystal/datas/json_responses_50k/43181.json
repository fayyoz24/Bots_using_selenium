This includes implementing use cases that increase cooperative awareness to guarantee safe and responsible teleoperated transport\n* Preparing and piloting teleoperated and telemonitored transport on roadways and waterways to alleviate the increasing shortage of manpower and bring transport and logistics to a higher level of efficiency through data sharing in the supply chain and use of AI\n* Exploring the possibilities of increasing the volume of freight transported during the night where excess physical infrastructure capacity is abundant; the lowering of personnel costs would make this feasible on a cost-effective basis\n* Teleoperation will be enabled by 5G qualities, such as low latency, reliable connectivity, and high bandwidth.\n\nThe project\u2019s outcome will be the blueprint for operational pan-European deployment of teleoperated transport solutions in the logistics sector and beyond.",
