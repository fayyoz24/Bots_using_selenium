    "summary": "I am an associate professor at TU Delft, and my background is in landscape ecology and urban design. I am convinced that the transition towards a circular economy is a crucial component to make our cities and regions regenerative and thereby future proof. I am interested in how co-creative planning and design can contribute to a circular built environment. \nI was recently involved in a leading role in the Horizon 2020 Project REPAiR \u2013(Resource management in peri-urban areas). We could develop in six living labs across Europe participatory co-creation and co-decision process by developing and using an open-source geodesign decision support environment (GDSE). I am proud that the results of REPAiR gave a boost to the circular economy vision and implementation plans of Amsterdam, Naples and Hamburg. If you are passionate about regenerative design and development, feel free to contact me for collaborations.\n\n",

The ambition is to develop a method that can successfully link energy-\u00ad\u2010efficiency of buildings to weather and satellite data in order to better predict overheating problems of dwellings and well being of citizens on a citywide scale. The approach to involve large numbers of citizens allows us to raise awareness for these energy-\u00ad\u2010related challenges and make it considerably easier to attract the attention of the press.\n\n\n\nProject Team\nProf.dr.ir.

Especially in times of restricted public budgets they feel a strong need to understand how policy action can become more effective in their daily practice and how synergies can be exploited through vertical and horizontal co-ordination of public policies, programmes and projects. In particular in complex policymaking contexts such as territorial development where different levels and sectors of policymaking are involved, practical advice and good examples providing inspiration for both policymakers and practitioners are needed. The aim of this project is to develop practical advice for territorial governance based on evidence from current practices.",

Climate adaptation and mitigation, regeneration of biodiversity, digitalisation, scarcity of materials, the energy transition, provision of affordable and healthy nutrition all have multiple spatial claims on the finite resource of land. Following the Delft Design tradition, we integrate design and engineering approaches to address those challenges. We develop and apply environmental-based methods and techniques, urban data science, and geospatial information technologies. Our research and education blend environmental technology, urban ecology, citizen participation and environmental behaviour at different scales. There is a strong emphasis on the interaction of these fields in terms of theories, methods and techniques, and their application via concepts, strategies and spatial interventions. ETD's research and education portfolio concerns applied science for and often with public and private partners.",

This in turn brings the CAP into closer association with a wide range of sectoral policy regimes: regional policy, spatial planning, environmental management; social, energy policy, and others. RUFUS (Rural Future Networks) will provide policy makers and stakeholders with a better theoretical and practical understanding of how CAP measures interact with other forms of public intervention in rural development.",
