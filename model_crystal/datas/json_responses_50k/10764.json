Maarten Steinbuch, and looks at the identification and MIMO feedback control of nano-positioning flexible motion systems with overactuation and oversensing. Taking into account the requirements (accuracy, repeatability) in high precision motion control, engineers have been looking for solutions to mitigate limits on achievable control performance. Since attainable bandwidths, dominantly restricted by a flexible dynamical behavior, the problem of how to enhance motion performance beyond conventional bandwidth limitations will be explored in my research in a robust control framework. To this end, active control of flexible dynamical behavior is essential. In order to control flexible dynamical behavior, extended generalized plant configuration with extra inputs-outputs will be exploited. All the developed theory in system identification and robust control will be employed on Fumo Floating Reticle (FFR) 6-DoF stage designed by ASML. The FFR basically consists of two actuators body which can be controlled independently. These two bodies can clamp on each other and act as a carrier platform for nano-positioning purposes. Each actuator body has 7 Lorentz-actuators. The position and the orientation of the FFR is measured through in-plane linear encoders and out-of-plane capacitive sensors. The system will be controlled using a Simulink real-time environment and Speedgoat. This project allows me to develop myself in the field of mechatronics integration of FFR, identification and real-time robust control of complex motion system. Moreover, local parametric methods for the non-parametric system identification of MIMO systems in a closed-loop configuration have been researching during the thesis.",

In this model-free approach, obtained frequency response functions of the multivariable systems through input and output measurements are used to avoid complex parametric MIMO identification. Interaction measures were analysed to study interactions between the control loops. In this internship, focus is given to optimize input and output decouplers and the non-parametric system identification for MIMO systems. The main goal of the internship is to introduce optimal decoupling method in order to diagonalize the 6-DoF multivariable electro-mechanical plant and increase the performance of the diagonal controller. System is controlled through the NYCe 4000 motion control system . As a result, optimized static decoupling matrices which are easily applicable to current motion drivers were obtained, the performance of the decentralized controller increased and calculation of the decouplers reduce control design complexity of multivariable systems to complexity of straightforward design of SISO controllers.",

The CO2 robot represents a new generation of mould cleaning technology in the form of a system that is programmed to suit individual applications and can be used for practically any industrial mould. Speed, safety and ease of use are the principles on which this robot is based. After the group discussions with the customer on their required specifications and the dynamic analysis on the robot, I\u2019ve selected the needed motors for the robot. Using the Beckhoff servo drives which are connected to TwinCAT PLC through the EtherCAT system communication, each motor position information is accessed in the TwinCAT software. In the software, functions for position control of both inverse and forward kinematics of the robot were developed. Software Human Machine Interface (HMI) design was written in C# programming language. In this HMI, the user can load different defined path plans for different moulds to execute on the real robot or can generate a new path. This database management was also handled in C# environment. The TwinCAT NC Interpolation (NC I) was used in the software for interpolated path movements. Since this project is government funded, the first prototype of the robotic system is analyzed and evaluated for the project planning. Through the complete robotics project I\u2019ve enhanced my skills in advanced mathematics, applied physical science, and computer science, and I\u2019ve enjoyed collaborating with a customer and be adept at communicating with others.",

Manipulation of micro- objects in three dimensional (3D) has been succedded by using capillary force at liquidgas interface which is between microrobot and the object. This is accomplished by the addition of a cavity in the hydrophobic microrobot, in which an air bubble is captured when the robot is placed in a water environment. The extension of the air bubble from the cavity is adjusted dynamically by controlling the pressure of the workspace. The air buble can then be used as a gripper for micro-object manipulations such as transportation in microfluidic devices or fluidic environments of assembly of hydrophobic objects. In this project, control mechanism and algorithm was developed to allow micro-robot capable of moving to desired location to perform pick & place operations. Existing image detection algorithm in C++ was enhanced to detect the robot much better in its environment. Characterization of the air bubble with respect to the pressure was determined.",

With the help of the camera on the gripper, the objects on the production line can be easily identified and the robot automatically programmed according to the data which is gathered from the vision system. So required tasks (pick & place) can be done without intervene of the human. This results in efficiency in time and less human labor. In this project, firstly efficient 3D robotic Hand (Gripper) /Eye (Camera) calibration was performed by aiming both the camera and the robot can understand and analyze the exact position of each other. The fixed industrial camera is used for object recognition and an interface was built in C# to generate grip pattern for the recognized objects.",
