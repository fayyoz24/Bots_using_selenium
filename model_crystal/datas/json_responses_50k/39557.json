    "summary": "Rogier is a renewable energy expert with business development skills based upon in depth (financial- as well as  operational-) knowledge of the energy market. His knowledge comes with entrepreneurial experience, a strong commercial focus, people skills and a passion for (art-) history.\n\nAlready in 2001 he joined a start-up company and has set up together with a small team a fully equipped energy company in the Netherlands. By delivering electricity from A to B as a member of the APX/Endex wholesale market under EFET, the trading desk created value for big industrial customers by servicing their portfolio management or procurement department by taking advantage of trading opportunities on their behalf. Edmij as one of the first new players in the newly liberalised energy market and was partly funded by Stichting Doen.\n\nAfter his experience in a highly illiquid energy market, subsequently working for EDMIJ and Oxxio he decided to work as an independent propriatary trader/investor on his own account. His entrepreneurial background, broad and in depth knowledge of the financial markets combined with his historical awareness made him invest in Greece for several years as he saw this country part of the solution to a safe and more competitive Europe. The Hercules plan of Greece and it's systematic banks will deliver an important contribution to this end. \n\n\n",
