Thesis in TU Delft I investigated the development of a residential ventilation concept based on displacement airflow distribution for balanced systems with heat recovery. Primarily, this study aims to contribute solutions to the contemporary construction practice that leads to highly air-tight and insulated buildings. Thus, investigating a topic which combines the potential energy benefit with a better indoor air quality, such as displacement ventilation, seemed quite intriguing.\n\nWithin the framework of this study, the thermally stratified ventilation systems and their ability to create better indoor air quality were researched thoroughly via the scientific publications during the last 20 years. The final outcome of the master thesis was the comparison of displacement ventilation with alternative ventilation strategies regarding their impact on the energy consumption of a dwelling. To deal with the non-uniform thermal and contaminant distribution of displacement ventilation, a simulation model based on a 3-airnode structure per zone was developed in TRNSYS-TRNFlow software. The evaluation of the simulation model was made considering data from relevant scientific papers, as well as, from thermal measurements conducted in dwellings with heat recovery. The simulations revealed an energy reduction for the sensible heating load and the ventilation system (i.e., fans and heating coils) up to 24,66% for displacement ventilation compared to traditional mixing systems.\n",

Objective of the study was the thermal and visual assessment of the fa\u00e7ade refurbishment of Gertrudis College in Roosendaal made by the Hunter Douglas company (http://www.hde.nl/).\n\nFor the needs of this research we conducted field measurements with thermocouples and lux meters, while we also took luminance pictures with the help of 'LMK2000 mobile advanced' software from Techno Team Bildverarbeitung Gmb\u0397. The acquired measurements were used to calibrate thermal and visual simulations in Physibel CAPSOL and Dialux software respectively. The assessment of the fa\u00e7ade refurbishment was based on the measurements before and after the refurbishment, as well as, from the results of simulations with alternative scenarios.",
