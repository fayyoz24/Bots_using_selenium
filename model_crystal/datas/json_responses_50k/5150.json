    "summary": "I am a researcher with an interest in policy and governance mechanisms for (sustainable) international development. I have a background in global health (governance), human rights & migration, diversity & inclusivity and higher education. My professional experience spans qualitative & quantitative research, policy analysis, project development and teaching. I enjoy innovative, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural work environments. \n\nPreviously I examined the origin and effect of discourses produced by civil society organisations for refugees in the Netherlands, in relation to local policy environments. Currently, I devote my attention to the issue of diversity and inclusion in higher education. I uncover experiential and professional knowledge on the mechanisms of student attrition in health professions education, among others. With my research I hope to strengthen institutional support for the retention of diverse talent, and reduce overall disparities of representation and attainment in the academic pipeline.",
