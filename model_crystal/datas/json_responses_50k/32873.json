    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic process engineer, who is always up for new challenges. I hold a Master in Process Engineering at University of Delft and a Diploma (Bachelor and Master of Engineering) in Chemical Engineering at University of Patras. I graduated 2nd in my class from the University of Patras and I received an Academic Award of Excellence by the Limmat Foundation of Zurich. \nI have worked as Junior Process Engineer at Technip. During these years I had the opportunity to work for various projects spanning from research and development to conceptual design and detailed engineering.\nI am highly interested in process design and optimization. Additionally, I am excited in the investigation of options to decarbonize the industrial processes.\n",
