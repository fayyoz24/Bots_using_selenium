Most recently, Hurricane Maria in 2017, the earthquake sequence in 2020 as well as the COVID-19 pandemic have posed significant long-term negative health outcomes, especially for specialized cancer care patients. The increase in exposures, vulnerabilities, and health risks, leads to increased stress on health systems worldwide but disproportionately affects countries where health inequities exist. Currently, PR is experiencing a deteriorating socioeconomic situation amidst concurrent and compounding disasters. The increasing climatic variability and socioeconomic situation make PR one of the most vulnerable countries to disasters. Thus, requires an examination of disaster management policies from a transdisciplinary and social determinants of health perspective.\n\nTherefore, my research will be focusing on how disaster management policies can be improved to incorporate the social determinants of health for breast cancer patients. Breast cancer remains one of the highest causes of death for women in PR and its detection rate is increasing at a rate of 0.3% per year.\n\nIt is evident that without addressing the barriers imposed by social determinants of health, disaster management strategies will continue to exacerbate rather than alleviate long-term health outcomes for breast cancer patients.\n\nI am very excited to work with the UPR RLC team on this very important research!",

In addition I taught full classrooms of 20 students on math, writing, reading and citizenship. During my time at the school I also helped set up a 'school council'. This school council delegated a leadership role to one boy and one girl from each classroom to help the teacher maintain order. Furthermore, the school coordinator, Billa Mahmud, was in the process of starting a new program called \"Rising Girls and Boys\" which, was dedicated to sex and drug education. Billa recognizes the impact these factors have on students' education and hopes through education about these subjects the students will know to make the better decisions. I was responsible for spearheading this program in fruition through coordinating, organizing, and speaking at the opening.\n\nAfter school I rode the school bus with the students to soccer practice. I co-coached the the soccer practices with the Ghanaian coaches working on soccer technique and scrimmaging. In addition, I was able to train with the women's national field hockey team and coach field hockey to the youth."

This was my first official service trip although I have done a lot of service work in the past, and it completely changed my ideas about service work. We were about 4 hours outside of the capital of Honduras, Tegucigalpa and worked for a week with 3 close-knit communities - Huatales, Las Pilas & Tierras Coloradas - to help implement clean water infrastructure. I worked side-by-side with community members who welcomed me with open arms and made it feel like home for me over the course of the week. This project will take 6 months to be completed with a new brigade group coming in weekly to help. I spent the week digging trenches from 8 am to 5 pm. Then on one of the last days I helped lay the pipes and cover the pipes. It was great to see our work have a direct impact on the community. In addition, to helping with the implementation of clean water infrastructure we held an education for the 100 children in these 3 communities. We played songs, games, and had a lesson plan that incorporated lessons about sanitation and other important health tips. I am so excited to go on my next brigade and see the finish product of this water project in these 3 communities!"

I continued to collect school supplies in my hometown - Concord, MA - over the summer and in August coordinated with a teacher at Clarence R. Edwards Middle School to drop the materials off. The materials ranged from notebooks, binders, paper, rulers, pencils, pens, color markers and pencils to locker decorations, erasers, etc. Clarence R. Edwards Middle School is a school home to many low-income students that cannot afford new school supplies essential to their learning.

This was my first time volunteering at RMH. We bought the groceries for the food we were going to make and headed over to the house. We went to the grocery store to buy the supplies needed to cook dinner - we made mac and cheese (one batch with bacon and one batch without), garlic bread, Caesar salad, and brownies! After the cleaning the kitchen, a family came into the kitchen and a boy around the age of 10 asked if he could have some of the mac and cheese. The parents later told us they had been here for several years and this was the first time that the boy was willing to try the volunteer's food - we were so touched!"

            "description": "During the senior spring I attended my second brigade in Nicaragua.\n\nFirst we worked on a public health project in the community La Mesa del Ocote working with 2 families to bring these sanitary stations. This involved a multitude of tasks: pick-axing and shoveling to create a hole for the septic tank, mixing concrete, layering cement blocks to create the infrastructure and laying pipes. I worked with family members in Spanish to understand how the project will influence their life. Jos\u00e9, 4 years old, worked diligently with his father and our brigade bursting with excitement to have access to these basic necessities.\n\nAfter we finished, we moved to working on a water project. Similarly, we worked alongside community members digging and pick-axing trenches and laying pipes to build the infrastructure for running water. This area was 5 communities compounded into one project and is projected to serve over 1,000 people and 250 families. \n\nWhy is this work important? Without access to in-home clean water, people - especially women and children \u2013 spend hours a day carrying heavy buckets of water for miles back their to homes often up steep inclines and in the blazing heat. Thus hindering women\u2019s opportunity to be involved in economic activity and children\u2019s opportunity to attend school further perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Without access to home sanitation infrastructure preventable infectious diseases continue to spread through communities.\n\nLastly, we traveled up the mountain to individual homes of some women to talk to them about what the project would change for them. Many of the women responded with the same story - each day they spent hours traveling more than 1 mile to get dirty water and carried 50 pounds of water at least 6 times per day back to their homes. They were filled with enthusiasm that they would be able to dedicate this time to more important tasks and not have to strain their bodies in order to gain access to a basic need. "
