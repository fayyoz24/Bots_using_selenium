    "summary": "I am an aspiring 3D artist who wants to take his first step within the game industry. Because of my studies at SAE Institute and my personal developments, I already possess a wide range of skills that are necessary to work as a 3D artist. \n\nI am an organized and goal oriented individual who doesn\u2019t shy away from acquiring new skills or learning new software, as I am always eager to raise my skill level to new heights. As an artist I primarily focus on prop modelling, but I also very much enjoy both rigging and animation.\n\nAt the moment I am looking for an internship or starter position within the game industry. If you need  more prove of my skills and dedication, then feel free to check out my portfolio at: https://tangledmesh.artstation.com/",
