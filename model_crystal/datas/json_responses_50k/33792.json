Diepsloot, a township in South Africa, was only a few streets away from the large American school which we were enrolled at, so together with my friends for community service we created small football tournaments. What we had in mind was that if people are playing football, they're learning a lot about teamwork and gaining social skills, also, it would keep them from possibly doing crime in their community, as Diepsloot is an area in Johannesburg with a very high crime rate amongst the youth. For this project, planning with regards to finding people form the community had to be done. Transportation from the township to the schools had to be arranged, fields had to be booked, and equipment had to be arranged. Everything went well and everyone had a good time, we were very happy with what we had achieved."
