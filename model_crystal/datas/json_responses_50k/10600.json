    "summary": "Growing up in a developing country where people are struggling every single day with different difficulties and hardships to make a living, I was drawn to do something good for society and those people in need.\n\nI decided to study the program 'Global Management of Social Issues' that allowed me to get a deeper understanding of these persistent social challenges and provided me with a tool to help others and organizations bring a positive change not only through people but also through a system. \nI can help organizations achieve their objective in multiple ways:\n\nA.\tPromoting the cause and company\u2019s visibility to potential sponsors/partners through effective communication and media channels/platforms to increase awareness and support.\nB.\tDeveloping data collection tools, qualitative and participatory tools for measuring impact and identify areas of improvement.\nC.\tProviding administrative support and assistance with the projects that help senior-level management to achieve higher performance and successfully complete projects.\n\nMy function over the past 6 years has been divided into 5 main overlapping areas, each role demanding attention to varying degrees on one or more of these 5 areas.\n\n1.\tEvent planning and coordination (facilitator/host, using social media tools to promote the image of the company)   \n2.\tResearch and development\n3.\tAdministration support (planning, organizing, and scheduling)\n4.\tProject Assistance (financial resources' management including procurement and logistical activities)\n5.\tProject Management (reporting, follow-up, monitoring, and evaluation activities to different project activities)",
