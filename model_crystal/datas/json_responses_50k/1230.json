In this role, she contributes to the strategic development of the office globally, working with potential clients and collaborators to realize their projects with MVRDV.\n\nWith over 20 years of working in a range of capacities within the built environment, Sarah\u2019s professional experience extends across several scales, clients, users, participants, communities, cities, and countries, and its versatility lends significant strength in the decisive pursuit of ambitious new opportunities for MVRDV.\n\nAs an experienced, licensed Architect in the State of New York, and UCLA graduate with several years\u2019 experience expanding Starbucks\u2019 market in EMEA, Sarah has a unique background combining design and business.\n\nHaving worked in many regions, Sarah has found that being open minded and flexible wherever you are enables insight into the many nuances of a country, city, or neighbourhood.
