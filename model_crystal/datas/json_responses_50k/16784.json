    "summary": "With 10 years of experience in the sustainability sector, I lead analytics and leverage research insights to design and implement sustainability action in the fields of land use change, deforestation and climate risk. I currently focus on the cocoa sector but I use tools and methods applicable to tropical agricultural commodities. My focus is on the impacts of agriculture across scales, from the farm to the global systems as a consequence of the globalized and telecoupled nature of agricultural supply chains.  \n\nAs sustainability researcher I\u2019ve studied the impacts of global agricultural commodities on deforestation, biodiversity loss, carbon stocks, and livelihoods using a large combination of quantitative methods such as LCA, land use modeling, spatial analysis, statistical modeling, trade flow analysis. Currently focused on the global global cocoa value chain.\n\nI have experience in political advocacy on issues related to climate change, sustainable agriculture, sustainable land management, and nature conservation in tropical areas. Experience working with multiple sectors, especially national governments, multilateral and bilateral cooperation. \n\nMy interest is on the the private sector setting up the powerful strategies to lead the sustainability pathway across society. Strong focus on agri-commodity business, banking and investment sectors.",
