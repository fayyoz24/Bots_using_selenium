    "summary": "I'm passionate about creating digital products and services that are meaningful and add joy to peoples' lives; one experience at a time. \n\nWith more than 15 years experience in user-centered design both in-house and for a design-agency I've worked in a wide range of industries e.g.; Retail, Automotive, Entertainment, Consumer Electronics, Navigation, Travel. I've had the privilege of working with companies such as; IKEA, Albert Heijn, Bol.com and TomTom to name a few.     \n\nMy specialties are consumer and enterprise software, (eco)system thinking and cross-channel and platform design solutions. I like untangling complex processes, shaping them into Business- and User requirements, and transforming them into solid designs.\n\nI love to work in multidisciplinary development teams across the whole journey; from design research, concepting, prototyping, design, user testing,  implementation, and bringing to market products and/or services.
