    "summary": "I am Jonathan Hielkema (b. 1994) I grew up in Twisk and Hoorn, The Netherlands. I completed my BA in Arts at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague in 2018, where I currently reside and work. Concurrently, I pursued academic growth through the MSc Media Technology program at Leiden University.\n\nAmidst the turmoil of 2020, I completed the BKB Academy political fellowship in Amsterdam, and subsequently, I got my Master's degree from the F for Fact program at the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam.\n\nLast year, I worked as a specialist tutor at the MA Information Design program of the Design Academy Eindhoven. At this moment, I find myself donning the hat of an IST tutor at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. Meanwhile, my involvement with Touchy Studios continues to be an everyday affair. \n\nMy approach is provocative, containing personal involvement and unbeknownst collaborations, resulting in explosive and often uncomfortable works that challenge people\u2019s biases about society and common sense. \n\nPrevious works address \u2018touchy\u2019 subjects such as privileges, the status quo, exploitation, and worryism. I am privileged, I am the status quo, I am being exploited and I am worried.\n\n#touchyoulater!",

With this idea in mind each story is worked on in collaboration with other creators to tell it in the best possible way. They made an interactive video clip about soldiers suffering from ptsd, a transmedia web documentary in episodes about Rwandan reconciliation radio and a multi-year journalistic research project about the turbulent region around Olympic Sochi. At SXSW, Love Radio Rwanda was nominated for the best Visual Media Experience in the Interactive Innovation competition. Shadow Game recently won the Golden Calf.",
