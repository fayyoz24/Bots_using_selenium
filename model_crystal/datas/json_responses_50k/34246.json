The key findings are that:\n- Myanmar\u2019s HE is rigid and complicated system of governance;\n- lack of university autonomy creates a fertile ground for political manipulation and control;\n-  HE is troubled with rampant corruption and nepotism;\n- there is inconsistence between inconsistence between the content of education and work force requirements;\n- some ethnic minorities such as the Karen people \u2013 especially those who live in refugee camps \u2013 are not integrated into Myanmar\u2019s primary and secondary education and are thus unable to enter the HE system.",
