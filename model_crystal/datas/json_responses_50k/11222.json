It's about thinking outside of facts, the creation of expertise in future-oriented issues conected to the climate change and creating of sustainable neighbourhoods. For this we have to ask ourselves in the future and thus our profession. Landscape architecture is more than we might think today.",

Here I can directly use and put my knowledge into practice that I have gained in the years before in landscape architecture, urban planning and architecture. As an experienced landscape designer, I am responsible for making and following strategic goals. Decision making and considering different point of views is a daily task. Quick adaptions and a flexible but continuously quality conscious mindset is a must. I am able to implement future orientated themes into a lot of projects simultaneously with a variety of developers and architecture offices while creating European tenders. Contact with residents, children, local businesses or senior citizens is a very important task to me to get the connection with the people that live and use a area.",
