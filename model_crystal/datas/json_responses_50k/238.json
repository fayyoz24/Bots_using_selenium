    "summary": "I am a driven community manager and social entrepreneur with a focus on education, innovation and diversity. In 2022, I was selected by the Obama Foundation as one of the 35 Obama Leaders for Europe in 2022. In 2018, I was selected by the Dutch Financial Times in their Top 50 most promising talents. In both 2015 and 2016, I was selected into the Top 100 Best Young Professionals in the Netherlands (spot 18 and 17, Memory Group Magazine). \n\nAfter having finished my Social Innovation Fellowship at the U.S. State Department as one of the first seven Europeans, I lead the Dutch cohort of 34 Global Shapers for the World Economic Forum. From May 2017 until September 2022, I worked with the city councils, universities and universities of applied sciences of the twenty biggest Dutch cities to innovate higher education on behalf of the Dutch government and all formal representative parties of higher education. As of October 2022, I started as a senior policy officer at the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, with the task of connecting organizations and movements on a national level when it comes to education innovation in Dutch higher education. In April 2023 I was asked to lead the Taskforce on internationalization and international student streams, one of the main issues our Minister of Education faces. In 2012, I founded my own social platform AMS Connected, through which my team and I connected 4.000 Amsterdam locals and expats to each other and their local communities by hosting over 150 events per year. I handed over the lead for this platform in 2017, and still consult on the way forward for the team.\n\nI have a background in Political Science (MSc summa cum laude at the University of Amsterdam) and Communication- and Information Sciences (MA summa cum laude at VU University Amsterdam), with a Minor in Military Science (at the Royal Military Academy).",
