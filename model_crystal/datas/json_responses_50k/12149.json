We created a platform for HSBC to identify such loans and take required steps to avoid foreclosure. This project dealt with upgrading the existing FAP module with the new terms and conditions implemented by the government.\nMy role in the project:\n-- I was responsible for developing online as well as batch modules for the projects.\n-- I was also responsible for doing the basic round of testing for the developed modules.\n-- I was responsible for making and updating the test plan and test results.\n-- I was responsible for for making the jobs for running those modules in the batch as well as online.\n ",
