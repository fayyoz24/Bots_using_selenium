I organized workshops on design thinking and lean UX, where I trained and guided team members to enhance their skills and knowledge in design methodologies and processes. Through interactive and hands-on sessions, I fostered a culture of continuous growth and development.\n\nFurthermore, as a lead-by-example, I introduced the Job to Be Done approach by guiding a core group during a 6-month pilot phase. This initiative aimed to foster a more user-centric approach and prepare individuals to become ambassadors, ensuring the dissemination of this methodology throughout the organization.",
