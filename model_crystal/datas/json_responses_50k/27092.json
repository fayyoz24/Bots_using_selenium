    "summary": "Nicolaas Jozef van Disseldorp: a Business Development Specialist at OpenUp, however, that does not define nor differentiate me. I believe in my three core values: authenticity, connection and adventure. \n\nAuthenticity means truly knowing who you are, the good and the bad, and embracing this. To me, authentic living entails making unpopular decisions that are close to my heart. It sometimes requires sacrifices, but I\u2019m willing to make those to lead a life full of meaning. \n\nConnection is my second core value, which is about listening to people to understand, not to reply. It is about truly seeing people, not just looking at them. It is about holding space for people to be vulnerable, and connect beyond the superficial. \n\nAnd finally, Adventure. I love a good adventure on the bike, on foot, alone, or with friends. I like seeking thrills, and going new places, both in the outer world, and in the inner world.",
