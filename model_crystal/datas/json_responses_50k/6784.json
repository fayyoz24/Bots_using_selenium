    "summary": "I am a Mauritian-born, English-qualified litigation lawyer with over 10 years\u2019 experience representing clients in complex litigation/arbitration and advising on alternative dispute resolution. My work has straddled sectors from fine art to oil rigs, via IT systems, intellectual property, industrial action, international human rights and shareholder fall-outs, and jurisdictions from the UK to India, Nigeria, the US, Jamaica, Switzerland and Iran. I have managed teams across borders and time-zones, advised on litigation and settlement strategy, written briefs and pleadings and worked with many witnesses and experts on trial preparation. \n\nMore recently, I acquired 3 years\u2019 experience in business transformation and management within the family-owned hardware and maintenance company in Mauritius. With no prior experience, I learnt on the job, creating a modernisation project for the entire business: we implemented organisational restructuring, digitisation and a full review of business development, supply chain and client relationship management. The COVID-19 pandemic brought valuable lessons in financial management in times of crisis, and the business came out of this challenging period stronger and more resilient. \n\nWith that project now successfully completed, I am excited to be pivoting back to law. Building on my pro bono experience with LGBT+ issues, I am pursuing an Advanced Master\u2019s Degree in European and International Human Rights Law at Leiden University, The Netherlands. I seek to put my diverse skills at the service of human rights initiatives. I can offer resourceful and pragmatic problem solving, a tactful and culturally-sensitive approach, detail-oriented drafting and research, passionate advocacy, high adaptability and ease with complex team work.\n\nI am available to work remote/hybrid from Mauritius on opportunities in the Eastern/Southern African and Indian Ocean region from September 2023. I have a particular interest in strategic litigation and project management opportunities in the rights of women, ethnic and sexual minorities and corporate responsibility.",
