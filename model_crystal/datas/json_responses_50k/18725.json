    "summary": "I am guided by the philosophy: \u201cWe are all patients\u201d and this has driven me to excel in Clinical Research, Life-Sciences Business Consulting, and Scientific Marketing and Communications.\n\nI am an enthusiastic, client-oriented, and hands-on clinical research manager and I have broad experience managing global Phase I-II-III clinical trials in oncology, neurology, HIV (drug delivery), Gastroenterology, Women\u2019s Health, Quality of Life, Rare/Orphan disease and Pediatric studies in Canada, the USA and the EU. I actively contribute to the clinical research industry in diverse roles in clinical operations, including successfully coordinating large investigator-initiated trials, ensuring compliance at sites as a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) for a CRO, developing business and marketing solutions for pharmaceutical, CRO and medical device companies, and managing clinical trials at innovative biotechnology companies. Currently, I am a Clinical Project Manager at Sairopa B.V.\n\nIn addition to supporting medical research, I have strong skills in communications, (digital) marketing and branding strategies. I bring a fresh approach to communication initiatives which has helped to achieve clinical trial management goals, and I leverage my strong research background to develop compelling scientific communication tools to reach business goals.\n\nWe are all patients - and in parallel to managing ambitious clinical research studies and business projects, I became a patient advocate, writer, and entrepreneur and I co-wrote the book Fabulupus: How to be young, successful and fabulous (with lupus), to empower and educate young people with lupus to pursue their life goals while managing their chronic illness.

As the second person hired at Seuss Consulting, I was a pivotal member of the company and my project management and marketing skills, along with my infectious energy and enthusiasm, helped launch and grow this innovative start-up life-sciences consulting company. \n\nAs a Account Manager, I was successful in securing new business with pharma, biotech and CRO clients. In my role as a Business Consultant, I developed and coordinated the processes for; 1) Pharmaceutical sponsors to select their CRO partners for clinical trial projects, 2) Global CROs to expand their clinical operations in new countries, and 3) Optimizing business development strategies for CRO/Suppliers in the life-science industry. I delivered superior client service and support which resulted in repeat business and long-term partnerships. \n\nI also helped increase the growth of Seuss Consulting (along with sub-brands Seuss Recruitment and Zocket) by coordinating and implementing marketing strategies including brand development,  website creation and optimization, content creation and curation and social media messaging activities, which resulted in increased brand recognition and higher SEO. I produced over 100 blogs  and developed strong storytelling skills (I myself authored over 75  of these purpose-driven, informative  and blogs) to inspire, inform and engage our audience of life-sciences professionals.",
