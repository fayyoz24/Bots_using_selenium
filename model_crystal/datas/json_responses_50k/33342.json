These three parts are part of a shipment to ASML. At the moment they deliver these products to the customer every week.\nBy collecting data and systematically examining it, many insights have emerged. For instance, simulations were run for several batch sizes of 5, 50 and 500 pieces. These simulations were performed in Nedinsco's ERP system itself, so that the effects are as realistic as possible. The further information obtained comes from the ERP, but literature was also used to substantiate this study. This will be mentioned if necessary.\nBased on analysis and simulations, overviews have been made of the costs, times and numbers that could possibly improve Nedinsco's situation. A new batch size was determined based on the Theory of constraints(TOC)(Goldratt, 1993). The TOC was used because it incorporates variables needed for Nedinsco and it is a commonly known way of working. Solutions were also extracted from literary articles that can be implemented at Nedinsco. With these implementations, the objective is to offer Nedinsco a new situation where it will achieve the 95% delivery reliability.",
