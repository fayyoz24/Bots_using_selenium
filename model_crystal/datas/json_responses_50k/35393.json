Continuous heavy rains also added devastating effects to the flood. This led to the loss of lives and properties, making many homeless.\nThe quality of the value-added products is good for better and timely decision making on disaster response and management. \nThe spatial products generated supported the end users - National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in the following ways: \n1. Relocate few of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps from areas still liable to flood to upland not liable to flood. This was done by overlaying a topographic layer on the 2.5m pan-sharpened SPOT image.\n2. Assess the area coverage of the flood and inform the other people staying at the floodplains to relocate to provided areas.\n3. Approximate the buildings in the settlements affected in order to quantify the level of damage and compensation for the affected persons. This also helped in approximating the population and relief materials to be distributed in such affected areas.\n4. Analysis of areas affected provided adequate data for the recovery process phase of the disaster. It also provided local institutions in Adamawa/Taraba States with ideas on the kinds of scenarios to expect, prepare and respond to such flood disaster in the future., through their experience with the team during the process.\n\n\n"
