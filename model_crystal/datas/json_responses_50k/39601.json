To begin, I conducted a root cause analysis of the company's data architecture to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current situation. Next, I researched various Hadoop solutions to identify the one that would best align with the company's requirements. This involved installing and evaluating the top 3 Hadoop solutions on a test server.\n\nBased on my evaluations, I selected a specific Hadoop solution as the most beneficial solution for the company. To further support my recommendation, I developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate how this solution could address the company's specific needs. Through the PoC, I showcased the capabilities of the chosen solution, providing evidence of its effectiveness in resolving the identified issues.\n\nBy conducting thorough research, evaluating different Hadoop solutions, and presenting a compelling PoC, I successfully demonstrated to the stakeholders that my chosen solution was the best fit for the company's requirements. This involved utilizing my analytical skills, technical expertise, and ability to communicate effectively to provide a well-supported recommendation for the company's data architecture needs.",
