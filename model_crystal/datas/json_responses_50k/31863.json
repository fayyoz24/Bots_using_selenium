    "summary": "In 2014 I decided to escape the cubicle and moved to South East Asia with the ultimate goal of being able to work from anywhere in the world. \n\nI spent the first seven years of my working career in marketing and before leaving South Africa was a marketing brand manager for a large investment company in Johannesburg. \n\nFollowing a year as an English Teacher in Thailand, I started my freelance career, which ultimately allowed me work and travel across Cambodia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka for three years. \n\nFollowing two years in beautiful Cape Town, I moved to The Netherlands in 2020 where I continue my remote lifestyle. My freelance focus now is working as an Executive Assistant and a Virtual Marketing Assistant. \n\nFreelancing for the past eight years has taught me to manage my time well and get tasks completed within tight deadlines without the need to be micro-managed.\n\nUpwork profile: https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01c4a02d886bee8208/",
