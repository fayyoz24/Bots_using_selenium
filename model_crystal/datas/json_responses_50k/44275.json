As a training certification institution, PPSDM Migas provides not only certification for workers, but also internships for students. There are some facilities to enhance their practical skills, such as mini oil refinery, boiler, wastewater treatment, and many more.\n\nAs a chemical engineering student, I was offered to hands on mini refinery unit. With the capacity 600 m3/day, this refinery is the only one that provides solvent for Indonesia\u2019s demand. Long story short, something bad happened coincidentally. One day before I met the operator, I had got the information that there was a leakage in one of the heat exchangers, which could ihibit the supply. Therefore, I was asked to analyze the cause of it quantitatively and qualitatively, while the heat exchanger had been repaired.\n\nWithin the first week, I have struggled to find a way to solve this problem, as it was really complex and needed a lot of data. Here was the tools where I was looking for:\n1. Distributed Control System (DCS): Detecting the operating conditions\n2. Process Flow Diagram (PFD): Determining the flow of the crude oil\n3. Piping & Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID): Acquiring the placement of controller and transmitter on each unit operations.\n4. Crude oil feed data: Identifying the percentage of main components and impurities.\n\nAfter the data had been given, I proceed it by using simulation in Aspen Hysys and Microsoft Excel to examine the possibilities, whether the hypotesis was reasonable. At the end of the third week, I could finally identify the major cause of the leakage. The water content inside the crude oil exceeded the limit. Therefore, when it was heated inside the heat exchanger, The phase was changed and increased the volume and pressure simultaneously. Moreover, without the periodic maintance, the possibility to leak is inevitable.",
