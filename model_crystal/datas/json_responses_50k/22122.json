    "summary": "I am a seasoned innovation catalyst, a slightly rebellious optimist, and a creative visual storyteller. My mission is to help you create, build & share better ideas with the world.\n\nOver the past decade and a half, I have worked on more than 100 innovation challenges spanning from new product development across Asian emerging markets, setting up a co-creation practice in an award-winning bank, digitising traditional manufacturing in Europe, mentoring intrapreneur teams in big pharma from concept to MVP, to building systemic innovation structures within large organisations.\n\nReal, tangible, meaty stuff.\n\nI did not go to the University of Innovation. Instead, I bring stories, tough lessons, as well as tools and tricks learned from working with some of the coolest industries and business. \n\nI have the battle scars to show.\n\nWith one leg in innovation, breaking the rules & entrepreneurship and the other in understanding how to stand out from the plain vanilla in a digital era, I am perfectly equipped for this exciting world.\n\nNow add to that a level of energy and excitement that few can match and that\u2019s me in a nutshell.\n\nIf you too love some inspiration for innovation, make sure to give me a follow (\u27a1\ufe0f Joeri - The Magic Sauce \ud83e\udd6b \u2b05\ufe0f and click the \ud83d\udd14 to see my posts.",
