De Rijk graduated from the Master of Film programme of the Netherlands Film Academy this year. In her graduation project, the observer looks at three screens showing the walls of a solitary confinement cell in the deserted psychiatric clinic Valerius. The camera scans the walls, searching for traces of the former residents.\n\nThe jury praised Dorian for the integrity and aesthetics of her work. Jury chairman Maarten Kloos: \u2018\nThe jury praised Dorian for the integrity and aesthetics of her work. Jury chairman Maarten Kloos: \u2018Human affliction is made tangible in the compositions of the triptych. After conducting meticulous research, Dorian handles relevant themes like fear and control. She also broaches topical subjects with Valerius, such as changes in the healthcare sector and the dismantling of the welfare state. However, Dorian does not only tell a story: this is a film which borders visual art - as well as being musical. The jury felt that this filmmaker is advancing her discipline through using the medium of film in an unconventional way.\" \n\nhttp://www.ahk.nl/en/filmacademy/actueel/news/article/artikel/2016/11/21/dorian-de-rijk-wins-ahk-graduation-prize-2016-with-valerius/",
