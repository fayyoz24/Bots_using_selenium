    "summary": "I have always been excited about technology and its underlying mathematics. I enjoy the puzzle that comes with figuring out how things work. The challenge that comes with designing smart solutions drives me to call forth my inner engineer. I am passionate about sustainability and would like to contribute to accelerating the energy transition. In that spirit, I want to develop more experience and skills related to wind energy.\n\nSome of my strengths are analytical reasoning, critical thinking and time management. I work well in a team and have extensive knowledge of physics, engineering and programming. I am also a very quick learner! My hobbies include kitesurfing, sailing and chess. All require precision and focus. I particularly love sailing races, where tactics, performance and working as a team come together.",
