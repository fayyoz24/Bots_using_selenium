    "summary": "Technology changes the world. \n\nPeople create technologies and improving the way they work together is what I'm all about.\n\nI am a physicist and manager with particular interest in R&D projects in hightech, quantum and space. With a wide background I am at home in political environments, highly regulated environments, comfortable working close to business development and always maintain one eye on technology. \n\nWith this eye on technology, I am capable of understanding experts, determine courses of action on technical developments and I am particularly skilled at making complex developments understandable and translating between different expertise due to my science communication experience. My technological background is in thin film, optical measurement systems and vision, and space, but I am also able to understand thermal problems (such as recognizing interfaces and understanding models) and other complex High-Tech problems. \n\nMy focus is on high-tech entrepreneurship, project/program management, product ownership, (inter)national cooperation and consortium building. \n\nAs program manager helping organize and strategize the quantum program at the TU/e. Streamlining research from idea to spin-off, setting up co-operations, supporting upcoming spin-off and working with Brainport development, BOM and NFIA to develop the Eindhoven region to impact quantum technologies with out regional high-tech systems capability. \n\nContact me if you are interested in co-operating with the TU/e in the quantum field.",
