    "summary": "Finance and Control International graduand (late 2021)\n\nI am a driven and highly motivated individual with a focus on long term goals. Moving to the Netherlands at just 17, combining sports with my MBO studies and proceeding to a bachelor study afterwards are just some of the building blocks in my future goal career. One that I would like to have in the industrial, technology or production sector.\n\nAs a person, I always want to feel challenged weather this is academically, professionally or just in my sports. The joy of accomplishing a goal using a systematic and calculated approach only fuels the motivation to do more. Furthermore, working in teams comes naturally to me. This is derived not only from my professional and unprofessional experiences, but also my knowledge and interest in psychology, organizational behaviour and ethics. Additionally, during the years I have grown my skills further in, marketing and communication, economics, financial accounting, management accounting, internal controls system, business research methods, merger and acquisitions, strategic marketing planning and financial risk management.\n\nWhen I am not working on my financial independence by balancing one of my side jobs with the bear minimum student load, I can be found embarking on some DIY projects, learning how to video edit, following financial, economic and technology news and watching documentaries. I believe one is never too old, or young to learn something new!\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have a complex business problem and want a highly experienced, motivated and critical International Finance and Control graduand on board.",
