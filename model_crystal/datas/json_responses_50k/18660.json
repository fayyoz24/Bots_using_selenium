I have packed and handed out food and water to golfers at the annual Megs Smile Golf Tournament, set up and broke down for their annual Silent Auction, and performed at the annual Christmas Cabaret where all ticket funds go towards \u201cSmiles\u201d. It has given me such a strong sense of community to see my own gather and work hard to support not just a family who lost their child that we all know and love, but all the children who receive \u201cSmiles\u201d."
