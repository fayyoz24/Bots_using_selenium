    "summary": "I\u2019ve been obsessed with the science of weather for my entire life. I still remember watching the Blizzard of '78 (a historically deadly nor'easter) through my bedroom window and wanting to learn how it worked. From dust devils to medicanes, weather is weird and wonderful! \n\nNow, I\u2019m an interdisciplinary scientist, number-crunching data analyst, and weather geek with well-rounded expertise in meteorology, data science, geoscience, and physics. I address problems both from a \u201cbig picture\u201d perspective (global weather systems and patterns) and from a \u201cdetail focused\u201d perspective (individual drops of rain on a camera lens) to develop the best-fit solution for our needs. I am especially driven to combat the escalating climate emergency.\n\nMy passion for meteorology culminated in my transition to the world of data science after 21 years as a science education leader. I achieved my third Master\u2019s degree in applied data science so I could better address the urgency of climate change from a data-informed perspective. In my final year, I completed a Master\u2019s thesis project to design an automated fog detection system using machine learning. Learning is lifelong, and I\u2019m excited to continue developing my analytic and scientific skillset. \n\nThe earth belongs to everyone, so I believe everyone should have the knowledge and tools to understand scientific principles and apply them in their daily life. My students and colleagues appreciate my infectious curiosity and engaging presentation style, both of which allow me to make complex scientific concepts accessible to people without a technical background. I plan to engage people of all backgrounds, cultures, and walks of life in our lifesaving work.\n\nAreas of Expertise: Applied Data Science \u272f Meteorology \u272f Storytelling \u272f Machine Learning, both Diagnostic & Predictive Modeling \u272f Data Visualization \u272f GPS/GIS Systems \u272f Project Management \u272f Teaching & Training \u272f Technical Writing \u272f Climate Advocacy",
