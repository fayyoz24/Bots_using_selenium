    "summary": "I am a painter, graphic designer, illustrator, textile designer, a graduate of a bachelor's and master's degree program at the University of Art and Design of Cluj-Napoca, specializing in Textile Design.\n\nIn the last 7 years I created my own brand, named Adam's Studio; under the brand, I produced accessories, toys, bags, jewelry, various decorative objects, and with which I participated in various exhibitions.\n\nIn addition to the textile accessories brand, I have been an organizer in various volunteer events that aim to bring art as close as possible to the general public.\nAmong the topics covered were: live music, dance and graphics performances, painting workshops, jewelry, illustrations, textile art, and motivational speeches.\nAll events have been created to bring art as close as possible to the public and to inspire them in everything they do.\nWe also organized workshops where participants of all ages learned different artistic techniques of expression that are based on therapy-through-art methods.\n\n My passion for art made me look for different methods to express myself; I paint, draw, photograph, write, and adore human relationships.\n\nAn important step was when I was accepted in the Erasmus Scholarship Program that gave me the chance to go to Lodz, Poland, where I learned new techniques in the textile arts.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve become a professional and have participated in exhibitions, fairs, appearances in the local press and media.\nI learned to sell my products and art, studying business, marketing, but also psychology, body language, and personal development.\n\nI want to communicate what I know, to learn, and to contribute so that I can further my art. \n\nHere you find my pages\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TextileThingsByOtiliaAdam/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Otilia.Adam.DesignTextil/?ref=bookmarks \n",
