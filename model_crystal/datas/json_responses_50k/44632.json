Sound and Vision, EYE and the National Archive invite parties to tender on a European scale.\"\n\nPicturae was responsible for digitising the negatives collection within this project and up to 2 million images were created. We developed new technology based on high end camera systems to comply to the high quality demand and the throughput requirements. This project was a benchmark for the (still) only paper on transparency digitisation requirements: http://www.nationaalarchief.nl/actueel/nieuws/beelden-toekomst-presenteert-richtlijnen-digitalisering-fotografisch-materiaal\nMy part was in the answering the tenders from the projects consortium and starting up the project. I worked closely with our image engineers and development teams together with our CEO. The initial project with over a million negatives was follow with two consecutive projects. For the follow up we also created the negative contact sheet selection tool.\nThe best accomplishment in the project was the proven quality of our systems and workflows. We finished the initial project well ahead of schedule, little over a year were two years was seen as the demanded minimum.
