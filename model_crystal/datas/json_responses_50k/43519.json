    "summary": "My passion is to design and implement robust, reusable, and flexible software. I like solving problems and I am skilled at outlining the logic structure for a given customer challenge or problem and translating it into code architecture and I implement it fast.\n\nI believe that the success of software development comes down to a proficient and satisfied team. Different kinds of abilities and people complement each other by improving the innovation process and the whole software development. At the same time, the team should not lose insight to whom the product is made for and make sure that it is delivered well finished, and in time.\nThe same rules apply in a business or in non-professional relationships, where ever there are people, respect, fairness, and good manners take a long way.\n\nSummary of experience:\n\nPlanmeca\nI have been privileged to be developing the world\u2019s leading imaging software Romexis from the very beginning. I have played a major role in designing and implementing the 3D part of Romexis from user interface to database and everything in between.  The cherry on the top has been working with cutting-edge technology and 3D visualization.\n\nSince February 2020, I have worked as a Salesforce developer for Planmeca One Insights, which displays statistics and status information generated from data obtained from the use of X-ray and dental devices.\n\nFinnish Genome Center\nGave me an insight to medical research and what is it to work in the university world.\n\nMicro Analog Systems\nI went in as an IT support and came out as a software designer. Thank to my excellent boss who understood my blossoming love to software development.\n\nMansikkam\u00e4ki Ltd\nA family business that makes coffins and urns for undertakers. Mentioned here because it gave me good work ethics and first insight how business works (regardless of somewhat grim disposition).",

The jaw motion images can be used for immediate diagnostics or recorded for later analysis. The patient is first imaged with a tracking device. The patient's upper and lower jaws are segmented from CBCT images resulting from the capturing. The Markers of the tracking device are also defined from CBCT data for correspondence of jaw segments and patient movement.\nI was responsible for designing and implementing of jaw segmentation user interface. I also designed and implemented the integration of the Jaw Motion module and jaw segments to other sub-modules of the 3D module. I also designed and implemented the database solution for this feature.\n\nI was also responsible for the entire design and implementation of the following features:\n\nImplant-centric view where plane projections are centered to selected implant. Users can rotate the view around the implant and analyze it with respect to surrounded bone structure.\n\nVirtual tooth removal - a feature that can be used to remove selected teeth from 3D X-ray data.",
