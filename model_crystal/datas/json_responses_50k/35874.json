    "summary": "I was born and raised in Sofia, Bulgaria, and received my Bachelor's degree in International Sales and Marketing from the Business Academy Aarhus in Denmark. \n\nI am currently a Consumer Direct Marketing Specialist for Activity Apps at Nike, where I am responsible for content creation, marketing of app content, and the improvement of the onboarding journey experience. \n\nWith over four years of Marketing experience gained through internships, student positions, and full-time jobs, I have a strong interest in CRM and digital marketing, as well as the fashion and tech industries. \n\nPrior to my current role, I worked as a CRM Marketing Specialist at bunq, a Dutch fintech start-up, where I was involved in various digital marketing projects focused on user retention, user churn, engagement, and brand loyalty. My most recent projects there involved the development of cross-channel campaigns and user journeys designed to decrease churn rate and engage users with relevant content through emails, mobile, push notifications, and in-app messages. \n\nI have previously interned at adidas HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany, and at Calvin Klein EMEA in Amsterdam. I am a creative, analytical, and easy-to-work-with individual with an open mind and a lot of creativity.",
