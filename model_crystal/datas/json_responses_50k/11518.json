    "summary": "Annebet Philips is a Dutch designer from Amsterdam, a creative soul, unshakable optimist, life enthusiast and holds a cum laude master\u2019s degree Industrial Design Engineering from Delft University of Technology. \n\nShe enjoys playing with familiar archetypal shapes and ideas, to put them in a new perspective and to tease the conventional in a joyful creative way. \n\nAnnebet designs outspoken interior products, furniture and lighting with a strong, graphic style and a recognisable, almost cartoon-like signature. With a humoristic view she creates surprising products that mix the expected with the unexpected, eye-catchers that leave a smile on your face. Her work can be described as \u2018Iconic design with a playful twist\u2019.\n\nHer work is exhibited in numerous (inter)national design fairs and she collaborated with both niche design labels as global brands like Mogg, Seletti, Droog, Tonone, Tommy Hilfiger, Scotch&Soda, and galleries like the Frozen Fountain and Mint, all known for their authentic style and nonconformist approach. \n\nHaving an artist\u2019s heart and an engineer\u2019s mind, it is natural for Annebet to combine conceptual thinking with commercial and technical feasibility. \u2018I love the entire process of creating, from idea to reality\u2019.\n\nAs designers I believe it is important to celebrate originality and to inspire people to be open to seeing things from different points of view. I believe everything around you affects you, so better to surround yourself with products that make you happy, are original, that have personality and that inspire you to do your original thing.\u2019",
