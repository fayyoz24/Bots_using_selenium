One of the highlights was organising the municipality election debate with all the parties participating in the election in collaboration with Forum Groningen. It was the first time that a debate was held in English, concerning topics such as the housing crisis and the internationalisation of Groningen for more than 130 people. Moreover, I was involved in creating the campaign encouraging international citizens to vote. \n\nTo ensure the quality of organised events, I worked closely with the Treasurer and the Commissioner of PR which helped me to develop a team-player mindset.\n \nI kept in contact with various speakers, for instance, scholars, diplomats, politicians and journalists. I collaborated with external organisations most notably the municipality of Groningen, Globalisation Studies Groningen, the Palestinian Mission in the Netherlands and Europe Direct. \n\nAdditionally, I assisted several different committees within the association by providing a clear overview and structure. It helped me to develop leadership skills as I was responsible for keeping the members motivated, supporting both from a personal side as well as sharing knowledge about organising events.",
