The pollution occurring inside the industries due to the various industrial processes has a high impact especially on the work force directly working in close proximity to those polluting sources. To prevent and minimize the damage caused due to the pollution, suitable monitoring systems are required to detect the polluting sources and to take the necessary corrective actions. The existing instruments for air pollution monitoring involve mass spectrometers, gas chromatographs, and Fourier Transform Infra-Red meters. However, these are of high cost and cannot be used in large scale areas or in the small industries. The objective of this project was to fabricate a mobile robotic vehicle platform equipped with gas sensors and other sensors for environmental monitoring. A Radio Frequency module was used to transmit the values wireless to a central computer. This project presented a cost effective, reliable and real-time air quality monitoring system with inexpensive sensors and a RF transceiver.",
