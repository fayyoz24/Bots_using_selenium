    "summary": "Passionate about enhancing society and the environment (the energy transition in particular), I am a conceptually strong strategist with a proven track record in developing effective strategies. With a curious mindset and a unique combination of strategic insight and analytical scrutiny, I excel at quickly grasping the scope of challenges and objectives, putting them into perspective, and developing effective strategies. \n\nCurrently, as the Strategy Director for the Industry & Buildings Business Line at Royal HaskoningDHV, I am leading the  development and execution of strategies for our global division, driving growth and transformation in the renewable energy and net-zero industry sectors. In this role, I have been responsible for strategy development and execution, M&A and post-merger integration, and growth strategies for renewable energy.\n\nThroughout my career, I have successfully led talented teams and collaborated with industry and government clients, enabling them to make (data-driven) decisions and increase the value they derive from their assets and deliver to their clients. My expertise spans business strategy, financial modeling, leadership, and transformation, among others.\n\nI hold a Master of Science degree in Social and Political Sciences of the Environment from Radboud University, where I was part of the integrated Erasmus Mundus Masters Programme Planet Europe. Complementing my education, I have acquired certifications in energy markets, financial modeling, valuation analysis, and renewable energy management and finance.\n\nBeyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply committed to making a positive impact in the world. One of my aspirations is to contribute to the development of offshore wind farms, and I find great joy in (trail) running.",
