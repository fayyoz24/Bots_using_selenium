Not only do politics and borders have an impact on the virus\nspread and deaths in a country, but a lot of other different features may be taken into account, such as healthcare (which gives an idea of the hospital's attention and space for patients) or the density of people (which is related to the reproduction rate of the disease in the country). The complex relations between the different features and the death rate of a country due to COVID-19 is difficult to assess. So machine learning and data science are the main tools that are applied to tackle the problem.\nThis project has two main goals related to the deaths by COVID-19. On the one hand, it is interesting to compare the correlations between different features and the death rate of the countries in the world and, on the other hand, given a set of features correlated with the death rate values, a supervised model that can predict the likelihood of dying due to COVID-19 in each country is made. With the help of this study, people can be well prepared and cautious when traveling to a country.",

After the control strategy is implemented for the MGT in order to operate it at the most optimal operating point when the state of the charge of the battery drops to a certain defined value. Along with the MGT, other components like a generator and other components of the driveline were also sized and the packaging size of the entire driveline is estimated. The entire driveline is modular and developed in Simcenter AMEsims environment\nSoftware used: SIEMENS AMESim",

Starting at the driver pedal, via calculating the required torque, a set point for the throttle valve is defined. The throttle itself consists of a throttle valve which is operated by a DC motor. To get precise control, the behavior of this component, including spring forces, friction, hysteresis etcetera have to be well known.\nThe aim of the assignment is to model the throttle valve, and the component-control system has to be designed. A black box modeling approach is followed in order to depict the behavior of the throttle system. With the help of the plant model, the control structure for throttle angle control has been developed. The results were implemented in a Rapid Control Prototype setup using the Simulink model. For analysis the model is flashed into the olimexino STM32 microcontroller, and the system is monitored and calibrated using HAN tune software.",

A collision mitigation system is an accident avoidance program that is designed by my team during my bachelor's program. The motivation for the assignment is to avoid unintended risk caused due to human error. A prototype of the system is built with the help of Arduino microcontrollers and radar sensors to detect an obstacle on the path. The control logic to is programmed within the Arduino environment. The controller is programmed to do a high level and a low level task. In  the low level loop when the object is detected the CMS program alerts the driver by signaling a hazard light. If the driver doesn't pay enough attention and if the distance between the object and the vehicle decrease then the high-level program loop is initiated which results in either applying the brakes or swerving the vehicle based on the mode selected by the driver. In this way, any hindering traffic can be identified and assessed safely without endangering people's life.",
