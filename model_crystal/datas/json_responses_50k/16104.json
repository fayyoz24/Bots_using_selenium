    "summary": "Hi, I'm Bibi-Joan, an artist and creative communication strategist from Amsterdam. After my studies Psychology and Neurosciences, I graduated from the Photo Academy in 2018. In my art projects I investigate how people relate to themselves, to each other and their environment. I use the body as a starting point to reflect on our behavior and ideas in modern society. In recent years I have worked on several autonomous photo and video projects on the themes of gender roles, sexuality and intimacy.\n\nIn addition to my own projects, I support organizations in solving social challenges. With my artist mindset I help to break through thinking patterns and to find new perspectives with the aim of creating a sustainable and inclusive society. I am deeply involved in the current socio-environmental challenges in our society and I believe that fostering a non-dual perspective, empathy and connection will help people solve these issues together.\n\nI have more than twelve years of experience in various organizations as a marketer and strategic consultant. Together with my open, enterprising, creative and flexible attitude, this provides a basis for fruitful collaborations from which change can be initiated.",
