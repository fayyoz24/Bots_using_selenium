In this minor we get two projects, one business project and one community project. Sheila\u2019s Day care is our community project. She has a day care next to her mother\u2019s house. The room is eight square meters and on average fifty children come in. Sheilla teaches these children Afrikaans, teaches them about healthy food and hygiene. In the afternoon, even more children come in since Sheila offers after school care as well. She helps the children with making their homework. Therefore, more space is needed to help all these children in an effective way. This is where my team comes in, we help her getting a grant from the government, we started a fundraiser already and we will organize a charity event. In this way, we help her to acquire enough money for a license to expand her building. ",
