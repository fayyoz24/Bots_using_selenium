I discovered I enjoy this hidden talent, as do readers.\n\n\u25cf Business, in The Netherlands (Greater Amsterdam), keeping finance professionals in the know. In China (Shanghai) predominantly in English, covering multi-national business for several leading international business publications based in Europe. Many face to face interviews with Chinese and western leaders: business, government, NGO; finance, logistics, infrastructure, F&B, IT, shipping; in Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore. It gained me a lot of insight and understanding, which I shared as key note speaker or chairman at international conferenes.\n \n\u25cf History, all English: about the 80 Years' War and the Military Revolution by Maurice, Count of Nassau and (later) Prince of Orange. It won independence for The Netherlands, began its Golden Age and changed the world (also see 80yw.org). Four volumes* so far. Original research led to some great new discoveries. For me the challenge was to put as much information as possible onto the very limited number of pages available, while still telling a compelling story. I more than succeeded in that, according to readers and online reviews. Volume 1 sold out within three weeks and was in the top 1% of best-selling books on Amazon. Also some articles (e.g. Medieval Warfare II.2, p42).\n\n\u25cf Science, all English: contributor to research on system dynamics, computational linquistics and AI for the legal profession.\n\n* the four titles are:\nBattle of Nieuwpoort 1600, The First Modern Battle\nDutch Navies of the 80 Years' War 1568-1648\nDutch Armies of the 80 Years' War 1568-1648, vol 1 (Infantry) \nDutch Armies of the 80 Years' War 1568-1648, vol 2 (Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers)",
