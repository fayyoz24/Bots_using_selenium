Thus they are being asked to define and analyze a problem for a company taking the point of view of neutral outsiders. \n\nIn a small team, students develop a strategic recommendation for a company which plans to expand its business activities to new markets abroad (precise assignment see appendix A). Thus the student consultants have to collect, select and structure information which is necessary to define opportunities and threats of the planned venture. They have to develop appropriate tools and methods to channel, process and evaluate the flood of data. The result is a clear and precise recommendation, being formulated in a report, which is targeted at the management of the company under consideration",

Based on that, the group has to set up a business plan which would convince an investor to invest in the business idea of the students.
