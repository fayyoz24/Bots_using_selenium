    "summary": "As an international lawyer with a passion for dispute settlement and arbitration, I have pursued both academic and professional excellence in this field. I graduated cum laude with an Advanced Master in Law from Leiden University, where I gained in-depth knowledge and skills on various aspects of international dispute resolution, such as investment arbitration, commercial arbitration, public international law, and WTO law. \n\nCurrently, I work as a legal and operational officer at ZED, a tech startup with the aim of creating clean and sustainable technology. I handle the legal challenges of export, and import, drafting business contracts and documents, and intellectual property rights. Additionally, I have founded and nurtured a freelance design service business, Peaar.in, where I provided branding and design services to a wide range of clients. I demonstrated resourcefulness by managing my legal career alongside my business growth.\n\nI am currently looking for work opportunities in legal teams of law firms, international organizations, or multinational companies, where I can apply my dispute settlement and arbitration expertise, as well as my legal and operational skills, to contribute to the success and development of the organization. I am a motivated, adaptable, and collaborative professional, who values learning, innovation, and diversity.",
