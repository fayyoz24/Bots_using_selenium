I analysed how fast cases were solved, what the bottlenecks are and what the expectations of the supermarkets are. I interviewed JSC and department case handlers. At the end of the project, I delivered a report with recommendations regarding the Service Level Agreements. Additionally, I analysed numerous processes. I spotted processes that could be improved and wrote project proposals. The main goal here was to ensure the supermarkets would have fewer questions for JSC, and that questions that do come in can be answered more efficiently.\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Management | Process Improvement | Project Management | Stakeholder Management | Leadership | Warehouse | Logistics | Operations Manager | Consultancy | Production",
