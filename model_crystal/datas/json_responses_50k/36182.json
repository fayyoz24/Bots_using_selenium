    "summary": "I graduated from a scientific high school and participated to an exchange program for a year in the united states, allowing me to broaden my communication skills, by taking a public speaking course, acting class and be part of a theater company. I have studied biomedical engineering for the first year and then computer science engineering. At 22 I found my passion for physics and realized that I was completely on the wrong path. I started to study independently, while working full time. At 29 years of age, after having changed five jobs, I decide to invest my earnings in a proper education. My bachelor research thesis is a subject that I personally proposed, the title is: Fibre bundles, Yang-Mills theory and the geometry of spacetime. Now I am 33 and I am doing a Master in theoretical physics at Utrecht university and I am ready to go back to work. I am glad to have learned from engineers and from physicists, I have the outermost respect for both disciplines and they are two different mind sets. Someone said that engineering is about putting the period on the sentence, writing a code or making a plane as efficient as possible. Whilst a physicist has a broader understanding of the code within a larger context or has a dream to fly. Both figures are essential and together they are very effective. A physics curriculum creates familiarity with technologies commonly used as programming languages, circuit design and diagnostic,mathematical proficiency, fabrication. A physicist is also trained to easily grasp new knowledge and concepts, to identify,formulate and solve problems, to analyse and interpret the data, use computer applications and databases, to use current techniques and tools for technical practices, to engage in continued learning and problem solving. My personal background and past jobs, allowed me to additionally acquire important training and experiences, that are lacking for just a physic graduate. Working at Vittoria Assicurazioni, led me to develop the ability to design a system or process to meet specific need, to function with multidisciplinary teams. At California Masterplant I started to recognize the value of diverse relationship between customers, employers, supervisors and management. Having been employed by Masterplant group allowed me to develop leadership skills and familiarity with basic and complex business concepts as budgeting, reporting, cost-benefit analysis, funding sources, project management.",
