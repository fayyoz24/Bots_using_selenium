    "summary": "I am first and foremost a people-person, and always seek to meet you from a place of empathy, cross-cultural learning and understanding. I have a passion for collaborative change and growth across communities and systems, and am interested in working with varied populations, including youth, inmates and their families, asylum seekers or refugees, and policy- and change-makers at all levels. \n\nI am a critical thinker with practical and project experience from the criminal justice systems of Finland and the US, on- and offline higher education, as well as justice planning and consulting work for governments at varying levels. I enjoy working within a diverse and challenging setting, alongside people who love to laugh while embracing opportunities for growth and continued learning. \n\nHealthy environments and design innovation as they relate to criminal justice settings or carceral environments and psychological well-being peak my interest and get me excited about all the opportunities in these fields!",
