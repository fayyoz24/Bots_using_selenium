Coordinating all activities of the organization in Uganda (9 staff), Tanzania (1 staff) and Kenya (working through partner organization). Pioneering work to expand activities to new countries (i.e. travels to Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Rwanda and Ethiopia). Participating in proposal writing. Achievements: From 2014-2016 I was field based and got thoroughly immersed in the situation on the ground. Cumulative volumes of locally produced probiotic yoghurt in Uganda raised from 700 l/week to 26.000 l/week during my time as country coordinator. Due to the successes achieved, the concept expanded to Kenya and Tanzania, where currently 4.000 l/week and 15.000 l/week are produced respectively.",

Coordinated awareness raising activities. Established the details of the implementation strategy and subsequently coordinated the implementation to reach the different objectives of the project. Streamlined the project with the Tanzanian and Kenyan counterparts. Managed relationships with partners and stakeholders.",
