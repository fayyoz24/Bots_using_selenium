    "summary": "From an early age I always knew I wanted to travel the world, which I was lucky enough to do later in life. I believe that the experience I gained from living and working in several countries gave me the opportunity to build up an extended network and allowed me to gain valuable international experience. \nI began my career in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil as an architect, opening an architecture office and later opening and running a restaurant. In 1991 I moved to the Netherlands, where I worked in collaborative projects with several architectural firms. During this period I had the freedom to, for shorter periods, live and work in countries such as India, United Kingdom, Italy, United States and Thailand.  \nIn 2004, I started my own firm in Amsterdam, Steun in Architectuur  (Support in Architecture), which is specialised in providing services for architects, contractors, developers and private clients.\nIn all those years I could build up a solid experience on team working, management, and the particular aspects of architecture and construction around the world.\nMy communication skills, motivation, flexibility and performance have also developed during the years. I now have a deeper understanding on my own capacity and how I can perform in a more successful way. Clients can count on me on finding the best answer to their demands.",
