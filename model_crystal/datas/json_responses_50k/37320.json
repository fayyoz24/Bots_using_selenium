    "summary": "I have over 10 years of experience working with some of the most recognizable brands in the world. I spent 8 of those years in the tech industry scaling hyper-growth starts ups. I've started the Uber Eats or Disney+ business in more than 75 international countries. \n\nMy work has primarily focused on markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East, United States with some attention to Latin America and APAC. From local marketing operations, international expansion, product, strategy and planning, I've covered most facets of the business in my career which serves as the foundation for my expertise in helping start ups scale their business across the globe. I'm people-oriented and can often uncover operational efficiencies backed by data that go overlooked due to my interpersonal observations and on-the-ground experience building businesses. I've been able to connect the dots across business units, markets and operational levers to unlock growth. Data is at the foundation of my decision-making.\n\nOver the last 5 years I've also led diversity and inclusion work as the chair of an ERG that served as the connector between the employee community and executive leadership. In this role, I helped drive company-wide, business and internal strategies around DEI.",
