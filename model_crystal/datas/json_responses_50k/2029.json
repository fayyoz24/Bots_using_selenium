    "summary": "I'm a motivated young scientist, in his final year of the master program of biomedical science at the University of Maastricht, the Netherlands. \nI recently got accepted for an joint-degree program to promote collaborations between Europe and Japan on the field on neuroscience. Currently I am in performing research at the University of Toho near Tokyo, Japan where I study protein trafficking in the neurons. \nBesides neuroscience, I try to educate myself both broadly and in-depth in a variety of topics such as regeneration and the immunesystem as well as master as many techniques as I can to be the all-round scientist that I aspire to be.\nWith my eyes on the future, I am looking to persue a PhD position in the field of Neuroscience and/or Regeneration to further dedicate myself towards my scientific ambitions and apply my potential to the fullest.",

This involves developing a method for assessing functional cholinergic clustering, microscope dissection and various immunological co-staining to investigate the state of receptor clustering. The project revolves around protein domains, parts of the protein code that enables interaction, and by that function to the protein.",
