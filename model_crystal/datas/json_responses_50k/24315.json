    "summary": "I am a graduate from Erasmus University in Rotterdam with an MA in Media Studies (Media Culture & Society). I have also studied Communication, Political Science, Law, and the English Language, earning Honors along the way. Currently I teach first and second year bachelor students within EUR\u2019s media and communications department. \n\nI have lived in 4 different countries, studied in 3 of them and worked professionally in 3 of them. In that time I have developed a variety of cross-cultural and communication skills. I have a professional background in both marketing and sales. At this stage I am very interested in the production and/or analysis of media, including marketing and advertising, at really any stage. \n\nBut beyond that, I have developed a love for existing outside my comfort zone. I've lived in placed that were culturally and at time linguistically very separate from my own, and thrived. I have met people from all over he globe, sharing the quirks of my culture while actively engaging with their with earnest curiosity. It is from that curiosity that my interest in the ways that companies and organizations attempt to interact with a wide variety of people was first piqued. \n\nIf you want to discuss my experiences traveling and meeting people, or the ways the mindset that has allowed me to do that can be utilized in your corporation, don't hesitate to contact me.",

I was allowed specific freedom in the production of LinkedIn and Twitter posts.

One method was  of newsletters, which I assisted in the proofreading and writing of sections, which were sent to external email lists.
