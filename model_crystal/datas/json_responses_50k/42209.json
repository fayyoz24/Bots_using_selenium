I wanted to create a safe and nurturing space where you can compassionately explore and embrace yourself through a variety of practices to provide different perspectives and insights to build deeper connections from within - both with yourself and others. This little seed eventually bloomed into Essenza Retreats - retreats to come home to the heart, home to yourself.\n\nAfter a successful first ESSENZA edition in Tuscany, we expanded to the South of Spain to host two new retreats this year and one in The Netherlands:\n\nGROUND. - A retreat to (re)connect with (your) nature\n\nSPACE - A retreat to explore and expand from within\n\nSILENZIO - A retreat to move into stillness\n\nOur programs are based on the energy of the seasons and designed in alignment with each other in order to create a year round journey for those who would like to continue to grow and evolve from the space of the heart, from their essence.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to be the first to know about future retreats and events.",

Sleepwalking through my life that was completely run by my rational mind and its limiting beliefs - distracting me from my biggest dreams. I felt totally disconnected from my body and most of all, from myself. When I unexpectedly reached a finish line I realized that it was time to wake up and run the only race that was left to run - the one from my head to my heart.\n\nDuring my journey I discovered the power of rest through yoga (nidra) and lucid dreaming. I now live more awake, more aware and navigate through life with more purpose, energy and humor. \n\nIt inspired me to combine these ancient - and scientifically proven - practices together with my psychology degree, corporate background and coaching experience to guide people back to their heart, back to their essence, in order to live a more fulfilling and balanced life - using both their head and their heart. Are you ready to wake up to life?",
