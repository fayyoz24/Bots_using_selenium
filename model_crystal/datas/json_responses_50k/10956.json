An interesting alternative considered by the clinic is the implementation of a one-stop-shop concept for the treatment of new patients diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma. This alternative proposes a significant improvement in the average waiting time that a patient spends between the diagnosis and treatment. This study is focused on the identification of factors that influence the average throughput time of patients treated in the clinic from the logistic perspective. A two-phase approach was followed to achieve the goals stated in this study. The first phase included an integrated approach for the deterministic analysis of the capacity using a demand-supply model for the hospital processes, while the second phase involved the development of a simulation model to include variability to the activities involved in the process and to evaluate different scenarios. Results showed that by managing three factors: the admission rule, resources allocation and capacity planning in the dermato-oncology unit throughput times for treatments of new patients can be decreased with more than 90 %, even with the same resource level. Finally, a pilot study with 16 patients was also conducted to evaluate the impact of implementing the one stop shop concept from a clinical perspective. Patients turned out to be satisfied with the fast diagnosis and treatment.",

Demand for end item is assumed to occur at a constant and continuous rate. Production is instantaneous and not backorders are allowed. Both setup and echelon holding costs are charged at each stage. The attention is on nested and stationary policies. Furthermore, the reorder interval for each echelon is restricted not to be only integer, but also a power of two times a base planning period. Experimentation is conducted to determine the genetic algorithm parameters and in addition to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methodology. ",
