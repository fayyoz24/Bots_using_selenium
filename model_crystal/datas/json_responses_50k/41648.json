    "summary": "I am a dedicated researcher specializing in global climate governance and driven by a strong passion for creating tangible change in the transition towards a Net-zero world.\n\nMy journey toward becoming a scholar in environmental studies began at Renmin University of China (RUC), where I attained my Master's degree with a specialization in Environmental Policy and Management from the esteemed School of Environment and Natural Resources. My academic prowess and dedication were evident in my Master's thesis, which focused on investigating innovative actors and mechanisms of environmental governance in rural China. This research was made possible through the support of the collaborative project 'Sustainable Resource Management for Adequate and Safe Food Provision (SURE+).' This project, jointly sponsored by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST), enabled me to delve deep into the realm of sustainable environmental practices.\n\nDriven by my passion for tackling global environmental challenges, I have set my sights on exploring China's evolving role in governing climate change as part of my Ph.D. project. The primary focus is on the multi-level climate governance mechanisms that operate at different policy levels. Through this research, I aspire to uncover how coherence between these policy levels impacts the effectiveness of China's climate governance domestically and internationally.\n\nAside from my academic journey, I have actively pursued practical experience through various internships. In 2015, I was privileged to contribute her skills and expertise to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) China's Energy and Environment Team. I was integral in the 'Strengthening the Effectiveness of the Protected Area System, China to Conserve Globally Important Biodiversity' Program. Subsequently, in 2018, I embraced an opportunity to work with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH China under the 'Sino-German Energy Partnership' Project. My contributions to facilitating a dialogue on energy efficiency between the German and Chinese governments were significant and impactful.",
