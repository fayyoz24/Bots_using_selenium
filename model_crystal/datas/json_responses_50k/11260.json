Simple, because fragmented PPP's in multiple countries, with only a few ambitious countries to tackle water/food/energy stress nexus, it\u2019s not sufficient, nor really successful. One would say its not manageable due to its complexities. I would argue that due to the nature of the threats. Threats are global and they don\u2019t know any physical boarders like nations/ governments still want to keep. Therefore, companies like IBM, with the support of UN, should initiate such collaborations.",
