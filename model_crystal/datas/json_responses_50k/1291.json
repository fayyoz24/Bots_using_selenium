    "summary": "As an Economic Geographer, I have a special interest in the geography of innovation, green technologies, and statistics/econometrics. I graduated cum laude from my Master of Science in Urban and Economic Geography at Utrecht University in July 2023. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Human Geography and Spatial Planning with an honors certificate from Utrecht University in 2021. Currently, I am working as a research assistant on an NWO project focused on crowdfunding at the Economic Geography department of Utrecht University.\n\nIn September 2023, I will begin my PhD program at the University of Toronto in Canada. Here, I will delve into the theme of green innovation, with a special focus on public policy within the field of political science.\n\nUntil April 2023, I worked as a Fulbright visiting graduate researcher together with Professor David Rigby at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his guidance, I researched the geography of green innovation in the United States. This research encompassed factors such as air pollution and environmental legislation, which ultimately resulted in my master's thesis.",
