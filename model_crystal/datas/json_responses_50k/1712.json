    "summary": "Senior Business Controller with a track record of developing Finance Business Partnerships in an international banking environment. \n\nOur Deepest Fear\nby Marianne Williamson\n\n\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? \n\nYour playing small does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.\n\nAnd as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.\nAs we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\"",
