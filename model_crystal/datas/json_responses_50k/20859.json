    "summary": "    For 2 years, I worked at 2 international companies that are based in Moldova and cooperate with producers from China, Turkey, and Ukraine. My mission was to: systematize the prices and quantity in invoices, to regulate the marketing projects and to translate when it was necessary. I gained experience within the business of bath and face towels. I worked also as a potter, that gave me a detailed image of this business in all its aspects.  \n   My dream job for the last five years was to get a shop to sell fashion products, or even create my clothing line that will revolutionise the fashion world. In order to get my dream true all this time, I studied meticulously fashion industry/trends/history to get a better insight and be able to work in this industry. . To prove that dreams can come true, this year in January I became officially the co-owner of a suit shop called Royal Suits. After a detailed presentation, my partners agreed to make a rebranding strategy and after it was done, in less than two weeks we sold 10 suits. \n   In the generation of the computer revolution, I tried to chase most acquired programs like Microsoft office word, Microsoft excel, turbo pascal, Microsoft Office PowerPoint. Even more, I recently started working with: Adobe Photoshop express and adobe illustrator. All these skills I integrated into my school and business projects by implementing new methods that I studied in the school program. Moreover, I was a sports president in a voluntary group CLL. This rose in me that spirit of leadership and made me responsible for all my actions. I had under my supervision 12 people that I coordinated to accomplish our projects. This was a necessary experience for my future career, that helped me to handle stressful situations. ",
