    "summary": "Welcome, my name is Nils Hoebe and I\u2019m fascinated by understanding extreme weather and the movement and distribution of water through the Earth and its atmosphere; using programming language to solve real-life climate problems. Many global regions encounter enhanced environmental extremes such as ground water depletion; air pollution and heatwaves. Understanding; mapping and the provisioning of solutions for these processes enthusiasts me. My interests focus on extreme weather; hydrology and climate change, combining them to adapt the changing urban- and rural living environment. \n\nDuring my education, my specialisation emphasised on urban- and catchment hydrology; water resource management; atmospheric physics and the use of state-of-the-art observational and modelling techniques to understand complex local weather- and climate extremes. Electives focused on ecology; fluvial geomorphology; water systems; renewable energy & physical oceanography. I'm enthusiastic for the understanding of broader systems, coming up with creative and novel engineering solutions to unify nature and humans.",

The required reinforcement activities for this levee system coincided with future scenario uncertainty due to local climate change. In other words, the conventional rather large, integral maintenance projects that usually result in a levee system that would be safe and sufficient for several decades, was now considered too coarse for the current situation in which many environmental processes provide future uncertainty. Hence, the urge for adaptation made it my job to advice the water board on potential frameworks for adaptive management, while accounting for safety; technical boundaries and the formal duty of care.",
