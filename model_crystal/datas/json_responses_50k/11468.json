    "summary": "I am a scientist, engineer, and leader, with a diverse set of interests, focusing on the development of algorithmic techniques and solutions that have a concrete and positive impact on the world.\n\nAs a scientist, I develop several algorithmic solutions that led to discoveries presented in important venues such as \"Nature Communications\", \"Nature Immunology\" and the \"Journal of Experimental Medicine\".\nMy work in single-cell analysis, led to the discovery of previously unknown cell types, thanks to the development of scalable dimensionality reduction approaches. I also lead large-scale research activities, such as the AI4MRI lab between Philips and LUMC. I enjoy working on complex and previously unsolved problems, with a drive for excellence\n\nAs an engineer, I implement solutions that are scalable and proven to work well in the real world.\nIn my career, I have covered a diverse set of topics including industrial automation, computer vision, 3D reconstruction and processing, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence in general. I had success on all of them thanks to a key focus on software excellence and a fast-delivery mindset.  As an example, I drove our Philips team to win the fastMRI challenge and convert it into our FDA-approved SmartSpeed product in less than 3 years, while training our staff on hybrid deep learning. Also, my contributions to 3D scanning technology were instrumental in the acquisition of the OpenTechnology startup by FARO.\n\nAs a leader, I drive teams to success thanks to a win-win and agile mindset. \nI led very diverse teams, from very junior to senior teams, from small ones to teams of more than 15 people, and from engineering to research-focused teams. I am experienced in driving teams both in my organization and across organizations. For example, I drive several public-private partnerships leveraging my joint appointment as an assistant professor at TU Eindhoven.\n\nI worked in a diverse set of environments. I have several years of experience in freelancing, startup to scaleup, big tech, the healthcare industry, and publicly funded research institutions.\nI worked at Google AI with Alexander Mordvintsev, the creator of Google's DeepDream, where I was recognized as one of the best research efforts in 2018. I currently work at Philips Research, focusing on the development of robust Artificial-Intelligence solutions for healthcare. I also have a joint appointment as an assistant professor at TU Eindhoven, focusing on human-centered AI, and I collaborate with several research groups across the world.",
