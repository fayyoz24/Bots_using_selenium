By presenting facts and data that illustrated how Universities such as Queens, Trinity and UCD are considered prestigious institutions despite not falling within the \u2018mainland\u2019 of Britain I was able to show hard proof that Queens University was an institution worth exploring. The personal strengths that I used were tenacity, foresight and knowledge of the Irish and British University systems. I believe this acted as a catalyst for the organisation to consider Northern Ireland as a future area for them to branch out their services to. The experience also improved my awareness of the Chinese business etiquette and how to form positive relationships with my colleagues. This experience made me feel I was an attribute to the team in my new working environment.\n",
