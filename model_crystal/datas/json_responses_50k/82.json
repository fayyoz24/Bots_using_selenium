    "summary": "Halfway through April 2020 I started as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management. The current focus of my research is on developing an instrument to measure well-being in the adult population of 18 years and older.  \n\nFrom September 2016 till March 2020 I worked as a PhD candidate for the CENTER-TBI project at Erasmus University Medical Center. Focussing on outcome assessment and preferences in mild traumatic brain injury. Additionally, I also taught a variety of courses in the Medicine and Clinical Technology bachelor programs.\n\nIn July 2016 I graduated with a masters in Health Economics Policy and Law at the Erasmus University. In May 2014 I graduated with a double bachelor from the University at Albany in Albany, New York where I had studied and played Field Hockey for 4 years. An enthusiastic centipede with a passion for planning and organizing. Very good at time-management, multi-tasking and performing under high pressure.",
