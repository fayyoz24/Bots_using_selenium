    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn profile! \u2028\u2028I have over 30 years of in-depth interpersonal and organizational mindfulness experience: this includes 15 years as a Buddhist monk, attending many group silent retreats, as well as many retreats alone of up to 3 months. \n\nI work with talented, creative, quick-thinking executives and business leaders that want to grow and get results for themselves and their employees. For example, I have led a 10-day interpersonal mindfulness retreat with up to 50 people and have safely taken many people on a life-changing journey to have clarity, find meaning and purpose in their lives and to recognise peace.\n\nI have worked with executives and staff and I enjoyed working with various organisations, like:\n\u27a2 One of the top-healthiest companies in the Netherlands.\n\u27a2 The biggest startup ecosystem in Europe.\n\u27a2 Senior healthcare executives who lead very large, diverse and ethically challenging environments.\n\u27a2 Peer and agile team coaches in the automotive industry, to develop their ability to listen, be  with uncertainty and collaborate.\n\u27a2 Developed the feedback skills of a large cybersecurity team's for international fashion brand.\n\u27a2 Developed and facilitated the first year-long mindfulness for educators program at Eton College.\n\nSome of the skills and specialities that I developed in my career are:\nExecutive Coaching | Leadership Development\u00a0| Agile Mindset Coaching | Organizational Development | Change Leadership | Cultural Transformation | Employee Engagement | Workshop Training and Facilitation.\n\nI have made dramatic changes in my own life and understand the emotional roller coaster this can cause.  I developed the PlayfulMonk approach from dealing with complex situations, it develops presence and the ability to stay connected to yourself and others. Because of this, I live by these three standards:\n\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\udde3\ud835\udddf\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8:  What is blocking you from optimum performance?\n\ud835\udde3\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddec: Learn to be adaptive and relaxed in the way you deal with complex situations.\n\ud835\udddf\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddd8:  \u2028Love what you do and yourself. Empower the people around you to do the same.\n\nTo learn more about me, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out via:\nhttp://www.playfulmonk.net \nama@amaranatho.com \n+31 6 14284808  \n+44 7766 646545",
