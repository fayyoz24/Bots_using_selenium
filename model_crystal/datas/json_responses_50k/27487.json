    "summary": "As a kid, I wanted to be a bulldozer operator. It happens that nearly every year before summer, a bulldozer would come to repair the unpaved road near the grandparents' farm where I spend a lot of my childhood. Fast-forward, from chores and being fascinated with a big machine, to building my own toys, the bruisers, and the fun that came with it, it is 2005. After learning pseudocode, Pascal, C and DBMS, as part of Information Technology class, I am deciding which university degree to pursue. Building GUIs with Visual Basic, making animations with Macromedia Flash or knowing about relational databases or programming is fun but perhaps not per se. Building tangible things, machines, automation, and CAD seemed fascinating and fulfilling as a career path. Thus, in 2005 I started Mechanical Engineering after being accepted at the University of Aveiro, Portugal. In 2011, I completed my M.Sc. dissertation in computer vision at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics at AGH University, Poland. In the 10+ years that followed, I have worked in the development of a particle physics detector (PANDA), as a materials researcher in polymer nanocomposites (TheLink, Promolding B.V. and NovAM - TU Delft). And, as senior R&D engineer in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) modules (EXASUN B.V.). \n\nMy technical skills include CAD (CATIA v5, SolidWorks), FEM analysis (ANSYS Mechanical, Thermal, CFX, CST Studio, COMSOL Multiphysics and Moldex3D), MATLAB (Instrument Control, Image Processing Toolbox), Avizo, computer vision (OpenCV, HALCON) and data analysis with Python 3 / Jupyter Notebooks. As a material researcher, I enjoy solving problems related to materials/processes. Thus, extensive material testing/characterization, data analysis/plotting, literature review and publishing peer review research articles are part of my experience. In my current job, I have worked as lead engineer for the development of a solar cell pick-and-place machine. And as lead certification engineer for the IEC certification of an entire portfolio of BIPV modules. \n \nI perceive myself as dedicated, structured, helpful, and capable of solving problems independently. I take ownership seriously, and I always have a strong sense of responsibility within the teams and projects that I am involved. My multidisciplinary skills, curiosity, sense of achievement and willingness to continue working and developing, together with the prospects of a better career path, makes me naturally motivated and dependable. I like a no-nonsense and down-to-earth approach to work and interact with colleagues.",

                    "description": "My work was performed within a group of physicists and engineers focused on the R&D of a particles-physics detector called PANDA (http://www-panda.gsi.de/).\nMy main tasks included: \n-> 3D CAD of an electromagnetic colorimeter sub-detector for PANDA. For this task I used CATIA v5 for 3D CAD, GD&T and exploded-view drawings.\n-> Fluid-solid-interactions (FSI) parametric simulations using Catia v5 and ANSYS (Workbench, Design Modeler, CFX-Pre, CFD-Post). I also attended two training courses on ANSYS Workbench (4days) and ANSYS CFX (2days) at CADFEM Aadorf(CH). And invested many days studying ANSYS docs and performing other FEM analysis (mechanical, thermal, welded joints and bolt-pretension). \n-> Design of 2 molds to produce CFRP parts known as \"CF-alveoli\". Including: 1) Design of 3 less expensive molds CNC-machined in house to test initial molding concept; 2) Design and GD&T of two new improved molds with better dimensional accuracy; 3) Commissioning of tools and FPL-etched Al-inserts.\n-> Production of CFRP parts: 1) Procurement of different CF prepregs (different fabrics, tow number and elasticity modules); 2) Backing of c.a. 30 composite parts to evaluate the molding procedure (mold cleaner, mold release agent, prepreg wrapping, curing cycle and production of parts for mechanical tests. 3) Test adhesive/graphite mixtures for improved TC. 4) Mechanical loading and thermal-cycling tests. 5) Matrix-fiber interface SEM analysis. 5) Tools and part dimensional inspection.  \n-> Worked on several other projects: Design of BFRP parts, design of light-scintillators with PTMs, selection of materials (adhesives, thermal management materials, release and molding agents, brazing alloys, optical fibers), design of customized multi-optical-fiber ferrules, fabrication of thin-PT100 sensors, selection of HV modules, design of high-density feedthrough connectors for signals and power services, prototyping and testing, design of polymeric parts produced by SLS and FDM, within others.",
