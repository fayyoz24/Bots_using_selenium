    "summary": "Let\u2019s start at the beginning, shall we?\n\nThis is the story of Abeer Pervaiz who is from Lahore, Pakistan and is living in Netherlands. \n\nAfter graduating from the Lahore School of Economics with a BBA (Hons) in Finance in 2010, Abeer wanted to pursue her higher education from abroad. Abeer knew that it was difficult without funding to achieve her dreams but then she applied for the prestigious fully funded Erasmus Mundus Scholarship Award in 2011 and lo and behold she was off to The Netherlands to study Masters in Entrepreneurship & Innovation from the University of Amsterdam. \n\nShe then came back to Pakistan and started working first, as a researcher at the Lahore University of Managemenet and Sciences (LUMS) for the funding department and second, as a content developer at The Knowledge Factory. Here she realized her passion and interest was in research and her motivation to work on projectes within the field of business. She then got the oppotunity to start her PhD in Management & Economics at the Libera Universita di Bolzano, Italy on a full scholarship. The PhD gave her more resources and opportunites that allowed her to develop her skills in interviewing through qualitative methods, writing, research, communication, leadership, project managment etc. She worked for some time as a researcher at the university where she assisted her supervisor in multiple projects.\n\nDuring her job search period, Abeer started her small Etsy store where she sells her creations and paintings. Apart from having a business background she also has artistic and creative skills. She has also learnt Adobe Photoshop during this time period. Instead of sitting idle she used her artistic skills and started working on a new project. She also has been learning social media strategies which she finds interesting and challenging. \n\nAbeer worked at IViR as a postdoc researcher on a Horizon 2020 project reCreating Europe where the research focused on understanding the experience of artists and performers within the EU with emerging trends such as AI, Digital Platforms and Covid. This was done through interviews and a survey. \n\nAbeer is currently working as a Business Project Lead-Research Data Management at Vrije Universiteit.",
