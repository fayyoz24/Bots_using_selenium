    "summary": "My main research interests lie in understanding cell biology for metabolic disorders to aid the knowledge of such pathologies and improve their therapeutic treatment by identifying novel drug targets. My particular interests are driven by diet-induced metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver diseases. The use and application of 3D cell culture model systems to support such biomedical-driven research  is of high interest to me.\n\nCurrently, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen investigating fatty liver disease applying novel organ-on-chip technology to provide a human based in vitro model. I aim to use this to study diet-derived therapeutics such as fermentation products from dietary fibres, short chain fatty acids and study the molecular mechanism of these compounds in fatty (NAFLD) and fatty inflamed liver disease (NASH). \n\nMy career goal is to become a professional highly capable of managing and applying knowledge in biomedical research and translational medicine. Learning tools of molecular cell biology, biochemistry, model systems and immunology, I aim to enhance my research skills and complete my training.",
