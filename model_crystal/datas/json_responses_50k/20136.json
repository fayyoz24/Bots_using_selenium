    "summary": "Recently, I was employed by Fibriant, a small company from Leiden, the Netherlands, aiming at the deployment of human fibrinogen from tissue culture origin in biotechnology and medical care. I have been working on future research possibilities by performing literature reviews on widely varying biomedical subjects. I also looked for evolutionary constraints on various fibrinogen polypeptides. I also supervised the ELISA and tissue culture experiments of an undergraduate biology student. My temporary contract could not be extended at the time, because a contract for an indefinite period was too great a financial risk at the time. I am therefore looking for another job.\n\nMy main focus during my time at the LUMC (1996-2011) has been on the structure-function relationship of genes that might be involved in venous thromboembolism. My small group consisting of post-docs, PhD students and technicians has elucidated the molecular mechanisms behind several thrombosis-associated mutations. We also investigated the effects of DNA polymorphisms in genes involved in estrogen breakdown on the thrombotic risk in women using oral contraceptives. Unfortunately, no clearly positive result was obtained in this case. I was also involved in interpreting the results of a Genome Wide Association Scan and I have performed evolutionary studies on coagulation factor V.\nI also had a position at the Molecular Diagnostics lab of the Dept. of Experimental Hematology, where I developed novel PCR-assays for leukemia diagnosis.\nIn 2011, I have spent 8 months at the Leiden Genome Technology Center. I have done RNAseq experiments there.\n\nFollowing my time at the LUMC, I have done a course at the ICLON to become a high school teacher in Chemistry (2013-2015).  This course was not completed.\n\nSpecialties: Structure-function research, PCR, in silico analysis of DNA for evolutionary conservation etc. I am also an experienced literature reviewer.\n\nSee my CVs for many additional details.",
