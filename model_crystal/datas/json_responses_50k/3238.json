    "summary": "Currently living and working in the Netherlands, where I\u2019m helping +30 industrial North American manufacturers to develop and expand their business all across Europe, I have 12 years of international management, sales, and business development experience in a wide range of industrial sectors, projects, and countries in Europe. \n\nPreviously, during the +10 years I\u2019ve been living and working in Poland, I have been helping Polish and Spanish companies to grow internationally in Europe. Some of the goals achieved were the full development of a new Polish subsidiary with financial support from the company\u2019s headquarters, based in Spain. I led the project from the very beginning, being responsible for the company\u2019s expansion and operations in the Central and East European regions and developing the first business value by achieving the creation of the subsidiary company in Poland, where I was leading 50 employees office together with the P&L result and continuous growth of + 20% YoY, including the sales and business expansion in Romania and Belgium.\n\nDuring my professional career, I have been adopting skills in business management, more specifically in industrial services, manufactured goods, and EPC projects in a wide range of industries, such as energy generation, renewables, construction, automotive after-market, processing as well as in heavy industrial sectors. The activities performed and the responsibilities and duties I have taken, made me get a managerial and leadership background while I was leading multicultural teams, and carrying out budgets by always being focused on achieving shareholder objectives through the value added to clients and employees.\n\nI feel very proud of my integration into new cultures, learning the local language from zero up to an advanced level in a short period, and being able to adapt myself to the local society, markets, and formalities in the countries where I have been living and working. \n\nFinally, it is worth highlighting that the interpersonal skill which I best identify myself with is the relationship with people through cooperation and respect.\n\nSincerely,\nJose",
