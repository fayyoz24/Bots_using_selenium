            "description": "Abstract: \nThe aim for this extended essay is to explore the theory of Cymatics by conducting an experiment with Chladni Plates. Cymatics is the study of visible sound created by vibrations of specific frequencies. The vibrations on the Chladni Plates react with different frequencies to produce different geometric patterns. This phenomenon can be understood by the theory of standing waves; the wave equation differs under different boundary conditions.\nFurthermore, the experiment setup would allow the exploration of the factors that result in the changes to the Chladni such as the differences in resonant and the shape of the object with different boundary conditions. This leads to the research question: How does the shape of the plate and the resonant frequencies affect the patterns shown on a Chladni Plate? The general relation between the factors affecting the patterns on a circular Chladni plate and the frequency could be demonstrated with Chladni\u2019s law,\n\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc5a + 2\ud835\udc5b)!. The importance of understanding the theory could potentially assist in understanding the real life applications of Cymatics. For example, assisting the deaf with speech problems by comparing the tone generated by the speaker to the Cymatic pattern, they would be able to communicate with proper tone and pronunciation.\nHowever, the experimental setup was not very accurate and many uncertainties and errors were involved in gathering the data. Therefore the lack of data was difficult to conclude and validate the hypothesis. However with the limited data, the patterns did demonstrate the difference in boundary conditions that led to the general difference in the patterns. In addition, the circular plates did demonstrate some relationship between the frequency and modes of vibrations stated in Chladni\u2019s law. Subsequently with the high errors and uncertainties, the theory of Cymatics and the hypothesis would not be validated through this experiment.",
