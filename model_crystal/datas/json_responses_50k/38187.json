We add matching layers between the piezoceramic component and the load medium in order to reduce the amount of energy loss. However, bandwidth and sensitivity should be improved with the help of different matching layers by optimizing the acoustic impedance. Obviously, we have analytical approaches which will help us to calculate the maximum bandwidth and maximum sensitivity very easily. But one faces challenges when a defined ratio (equally balanced) of bandwidth and sensitivity has to be found. In order to overcome this problem, the model-based optimization has been performed to the ultrasonic transducer using the optimization methods to overcome that problem.",

The rise in electronics significantly increases the probability of disturbances, which is amplified by decreasing intrinsic immunity. An important innovation in this research project, next to the optimization of the software design and automated test procedures, is the inclusion of software solutions in the system, making it fault resistance or tolerant, which leads to a cost-efficient solution in many situations. Such a software solution is rarely applied, mainly because they are not widely known and need further research for effective implementation. A key objective of my research is to design and produce better and more reliable software algorithms and AI-centric solutions with a lower development cost and a shorter time-to-market.",

We add matching layers between the piezoceramic component and the load medium in order to reduce the amount of energy loss. However, bandwidth and sensitivity should be improved with the help of different matching layers by optimizing the acoustic impedance. Obviously, we have analytical approaches which will help us to calculate the maximum bandwidth and maximum sensitivity very easily. But one faces challenges when a defined ratio (equally balanced) of bandwidth and sensitivity has to be found. In order to overcome this problem, the model-based optimization has been performed to the ultrasonic transducer using the optimization methods to overcome that problem.",
