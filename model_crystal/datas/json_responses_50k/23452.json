    "summary": "As a teacher, I would like to utilize my lively and energetic attitude in teaching student with the help of my good communication skills and great enthusiasm. With my administrative and institutional abilities, I would also work to perform administrative tasks, responsibilities and to participate in doing constructive programs. I would also like to lead students which will bring independency within the students.\n\nEach teacher can recount numerous highs and lows in their teaching career. Personally, I experienced many great moments while teaching in these schools. These were days when I ended so happy and enthusiastic that I knew I had selected the right profession. On the other hand, I had days where I definitely questioned teaching as a career. There were days where the students seemed uninterested, too talkative, or even worse a blow up occurred and nothing got accomplished. Thankfully the average combined with the positive days outshines my negative days. Through this internship I learned so much about teaching and dealing with students. My hope is that the student involved was at least partially changed for the better from the experience as I was.",
