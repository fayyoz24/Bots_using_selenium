Plantations established on lands converted after 1994 are not eligible for FSC Forest Management certification if the forest manager was directly or indirectly involved in the conversion.\n\nIn the last few decades, growing demand for natural resources resulted in increased pressure to convert much of the remaining forest ecosystems to other land uses. Simultaneously, there has been increased awareness for the need to promote restoration of degraded ecosystems as a means to fight climate change, land degradation and to avoid the loss of biological diversity.\n\nForm International & Van der Hout Forestry Consulting conducted a conceptual assessment of the costs associated with the remedy scenarios proposed by FSC, to understand the magnitude of remediation cost scenarios in the context of land-use changes. Subsequently, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out to show under which circumstances an \u201cinvestment into remediation\u201d would be economically attractive.",

Introduction of forest inventory and planning procedures to determine sustainable cedar harvest levels;\n3. Introduction of thinning and timber harvesting procedures to promote quality and growth of cedar stands\n4. Development and promotion of a regional value-added concept for cedar wood\n\nTasks:\n- General project management, including planning, coordination and monitoring of the implementation of the component.\n- Support to MAPMDREF for the scaling up of the wood tracking system at the national level.\n- Advise relevant authorities on the development of appropriate forest inventory procedures as a basis for cedar forest management planning.\n- Advise the competent authorities on the testing of thinning methods to improve the quality and value of cedar forests.\n- Identify the need for short-term missions, plan and manage the missions and support national and international short-term experts.\n- Assess training needs and develop and implement continuous training measures for civil servants and forest workers.\n- Organise study tours and identify topics and opportunities for cooperation with German partners.",

Based on project ideas received from stakeholder consultations, we will draft 12 project profiles for discussion and  participatory  pre-screening  with  stakeholders,  in  areas  of  the  four  principal  drivers  of deforestation and forest degradation, namely: 1) the targeted harvesting of a limited number of prime commercial species, with little emphasis being placed by the loggers on efficiencies; 2) the clearing of forested areas for mining; 3) the conversion of forested areas to allow for agricultural activities; and 4) infrastructure development,such as roads.\nIn  a  consultative  process, we will prepare selection criteria for project prioritization taking into  consideration:  1) Emission  reduction  potential;2) Provision  of  ecosystem  services;3) Scalability and replicability; 4) Social benefits;and 5) Multiple co-benefits.\nAfter the project ideas have been ranked and mutually agreed on, three (3) full projects will be designed in collaboration with local partners and implemented based on the documentation prepared and agreed on.",
