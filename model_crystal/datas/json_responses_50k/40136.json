    "summary": "I am a driven individual with a diverse educational and professional background, always seeking to explore new horizons. My journey began with electrical engineering at the Technical University of Delft, where I honed my technical skills and delved into the world of electrical circuits. Realizing my fascination with the business aspect, I transitioned to a commodity trade finance (CTF) internship in Dubai, gaining insights into successful business operations.\nMy academic path shifted towards a holistic approach with a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG), focusing on socio-technical problem-solving. As a learning coach for second-year students, I facilitated technical workshops and collaborated on innovative projects.\nBeyond academia, I cultivated a deep interest in blockchain technology and Middle Eastern culture, studying Arabic as a hobby. This passion led me to pursue an M.Sc. in Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) at TU Delft, where I excelled in data science and applied it to complex societal challenges like 'Room for the River.' My thesis explored blockchain policy and regulations, reflecting my evolving enthusiasm for this technology.\nDuring my M.Sc., I founded BEY Trading, specializing in blockchain-based trading algorithms. Our success attracted a partnership with the multinational company 'BOTS.' I harnessed Artificial Intelligence to enhance performance and adapt to changing market dynamics. However, challenges arose, leading to the closure of this business. Despite the hurdles, the journey enriched my understanding of entrepreneurship and technology's transformative power. I am now ready to channel my experiences into new endeavors, leveraging my skills, knowledge, and passion for innovation.",
