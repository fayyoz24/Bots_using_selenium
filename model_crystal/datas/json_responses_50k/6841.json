Over the years, the collection has grown to become an extensive and internationally-renowned collection of artworks, with a focus on contemporary art by professional artists. In 2014, to celebrate 40 years of the Art Collection, this milestone is marked with an exhibition and the publication of this book.\n\nRe: Society gives a tour of the highlights in the ING Collection. The history and tradition of ING makes for an art collection that is diverse. The works in this publication are presented by theme. This was a conscious choice in order to create a dialogue between works that seem unrelated at first. Although covering different ground, all ten themes have one common denominator: they are drawn from society. They show some of the most important themes that have shaped the world as we know it. This selection shows how artists engage with, react to and reflect on society as they hold a mirror up to the viewer. For instance, the Urban Culture theme zooms in on life in the city, while Family Values shows the importance of family in an increasingly individualistic society. The Corporate World theme relates to ING, while The Great Escape takes us into the unknown.",

During his eight years there, he evolved as one of the most masterful painters of the 20th century, but being away from New York undermined the critical reception for his work. In the years since, the writing and scholarship has rarely measured up to his stature. That begins to change with the recent University of California Press publication.\u201d\u2014Artnet Magazine\n\u201cBringing together a \u201ccoffee table\u201d book with the functionality of a digital archive has created a remarkable hybrid catalogue.\u201d\u2014Artdaily\n\u201cThe editor's fact- and anecdote-packed biographical chronology of Francis complements a mellifluous and insightful essay by art historian William C. Agee\u201d\u2014Art Ltd\n\u201cI have been looking through the recently issued \"Sam Francis: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of Canvas and Panel Paintings, 1946 - 1994,\" and finding myself wowed by the inventiveness, nimble brushwork, and sumptuous color of Francis' works. . . . Because Francis worked and exhibited all over the world, his paintings have been scattered, and the Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9, is an opportunity to savor works -- more than 1,850 paintings on canvas and panels -- that have been scattered across the globe. Prior to the publication of the CR, more than 600 of the works had not previously been documented.\u201d\u2014Huffington Post\n\u201cNow the standard reference source on Francis.\u201d\u2014Arlis/Na Reviews\n\u201cAmazing revelations.\u201d\u2014John Seed Huffington Post",
