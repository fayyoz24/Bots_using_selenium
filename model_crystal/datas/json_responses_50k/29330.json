    "summary": "As a designer, I'm fascinated by the way design influences people. I am constantly seeking for new experiences to learn about, and develop my understanding of how human interaction functions. At the same time, in order to better understand complex phenomena, I use this knowledge to tackle problems that others often see as unsolvable. The result of my work spans across various disciplines, including Graphic Design, Product and 3D design, and UI/UX. In my work, I bring ideas, perspectives and knowledge from these disciplines together in detailed and carefully constructed designs.",
