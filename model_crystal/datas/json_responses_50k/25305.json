I was responsible for producing basic overview of Russian lexicon and grammar for school administrators, and to aid in the development of a bilingual curriculum based on my understanding of the language acquisition process. I worked with a number of very dedicated professionals to help a little boy adapt to a new country and language, and I think we did well.",
