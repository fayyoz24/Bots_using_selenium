The primary objective of SOLiD is to explore the possibilities of enabling parcels to autonomously make decisions, thereby creating more adaptive logistics networks.\n\nAs part of my work with Prime Vision, I conducted research on the implementation of intelligence in parcels, enabling them to make their own decisions. This includes determining which delivery vehicle to travel with and their optimal placement within the vehicle after automatic loading. The focus of my research was to assess the impact of this decentralized intelligence on parcel delivery vehicle drivers in terms of both time efficiency and control.",
