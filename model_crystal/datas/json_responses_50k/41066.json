The \u2018Materiaalbureau\u2019 focuses on infrastructure and traffic services. \n\nThe goal of this project was to gain insight in the efficiency and effectiveness of their processes, inspect the possibilities for uniform procedures and create recommendations and suggestions on how to improve their administrative organization.\n\nI used Risk Assessment from COSO ERM while working closely with the business controller and the manager of the department. Furthermore, I reported my progress periodically with the department and the faculty of my study.\n\nBased on my findings, the organization started working on the implementation and renewal of their systems and activities and the competence of their practices.",
