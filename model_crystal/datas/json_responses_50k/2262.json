The project is implemented in Tinos, Greece under the coordination of the municipality of Tinos and the cooperation of the associated beneficiaries National Technical University of Athens and Culligan Hellas SA.\n\nThe project aims at developing an energy autonomous brine treatment system for total elimination of brine, according to Zero Liquid Discharge principle (ZLD), being produced from Tinos seawater desalination plant. The project will result to high water recovery (>90%) and production of dry salt with market prospects, adding one more valuable output to the entire system.\n\nThe implementation of the project involves the design, development, testing, demonstration, optimization and evaluation of a pilot scale brine treatment system, contributing significantly to the development of full-scale brine elimination systems.",
