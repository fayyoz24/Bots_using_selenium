    "summary": "I have always had a keen interest in pedagogical sciences. Following my passion to become a teacher, I attained my teachers' training and worked mostly for middle school students. Through my masters' specialisation in diversities in youth care, I have further acquired the knowledge and skills that help me to sensitively work as a pedagogue within a diverse environment. I get actively engaged and take on responsibility. Using my interpersonal skills and enthusiasm I aspire to gain positive outcomes for the work at hand.",

This study was conducted after the prolonged school shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the findings of the study suggests, that in the absence of a structured daily routine, students failed to take autonomy in their learning.",

Since this is a relatively new research topic, the information from this study is of great importance for organisations working to improve the lives of families with disabilities in low- and-middle income countries.",
