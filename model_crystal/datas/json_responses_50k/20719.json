    "summary": "My name is Yimeng. My parents gave me this name because in Chinese, \u2018Yi (\u6021)\u2019 means happy and joyful, and \u2018meng (\u840c)\u2019 means growing up. It reflects my parents' desire for me to live a happy and healthy life. As I got to know myself better, I realized that I am ambitious by nature, both in my studies and career. I was born and raised in Beijing, and at the age of 23, I came to Europe for the first time to pursue my master's degree in International Business in the Netherlands. My friends value my ability to achieve my goals and be well-organized in my approach. I always try to leverage these skills to accomplish my ambitions.\n\nI am highly motivated to study International Business because I am interested in understanding the obstacles that arise when doing business with partners from other countries, such as agency, distance, and LOF. This understanding will help me plan my career in business effectively. Additionally, studying International Business will help me comprehend how globalization has increased the interconnectedness of businesses, markets, people, and information across countries, and will help me develop a global mindset and the skills necessary to evaluate and manage challenges and opportunities in an increasingly complex global environment.\n\nFor my future profession, I am interested in consultancy, specifically in strategy consulting. I have a natural curiosity about how things work, and I\u2019m always learning and training myself to see things as they are. These traits make me analytical, structured, and solution-driven. Besides, I enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts, and I am a quick learner. When I realized the potential for exposure to new challenges as a consultant, I knew that this was the career path for me. Moreover, my classmates describe me as someone who can be both a good leader and a supportive member of a team. This trait is beneficial for working efficiently in a team and making valuable contributions. I'm excited to see how my future will develop.",
