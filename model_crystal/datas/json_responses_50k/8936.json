(The university then enrolled some 15 000 students in ten faculties on 4 campuses.) While my direct responsibilities were in the areas of academic policy, planning and administration, my membership of the Vice-Chancellor's executive management group and my periods of office as Acting Registrar gave me a broad exposure to all aspects of university management including finance, human resource management, industrial relations, physical planning, public relations and student affairs. This overall perspective on university management was strengthened by attendance at meetings of Council, Senate, Budget Committee and senior planning committees over a 10-year period.\n\n\u2022\tWithin the broad area of academic administration I have particular experience in the fields of planning, information systems, careers services, student financial aid (including the establishment of a major loan scheme with a commercial bank), the development of flexible selection mechanisms and undergraduate programmes for a heterogeneous student body, and major reviews of academic programmes.\n",

As with my work in developing countries I also functioned as a key expert in the governance reform project.\n \nIn 2009/10 I was again co-project leader (with J\u00fcrgen Enders) for three European Commission funded projects on higher education reform in 33 countries across Europe (Bologna process [46 countries]; governance; and funding) where in the latter two projects I was again a key expert. \n\nIn 2010/11 I was the co-project leader (with Frans van Vught and Frank Ziegele) of the European Commission funded feasibility study on the development of a global multi-dimensional university ranking (U-Multirank) and I am currently one of the four project leaders for the 4-year U-Multirank implementation project launched by the Commission in January 2013. \n\nIn 2014/5 I am the co-project leader (with Hans Vossensteyn) of a European Commission funded project on higher education drop-out and completion in 36 European countries.\n\nThese eight projects for the European Commission had budgets totalling \u20ac7 million. \n\nIn 2006 I was appointed by the OECD as an expert member of the review teams for higher education in the Czech Republic and Portugal. In the former I was also the rapporteur. \n\nApart from these major projects I have played a key role in the development of U-Map (a university activity profiling tool); acted as a context expert in the OECD\u2019s international assessment of higher education learning outcomes project (AHELO); and have led a range of smaller research and policy projects. \n",
