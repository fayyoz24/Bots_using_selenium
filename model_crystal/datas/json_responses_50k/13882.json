    "summary": "As a health scientist, with wide experience in occupational epidemiology, I developed a preference for interdisciplinary research. My main focus is on the interrelations between worker health, work participation and informal care giving. Combining work and informal care giving can be challening, in particular for vulnerable groups, such as workers with chronic disease. The workplace can play a rol in facilitating the combination of these two important societal roles. Another focus of my research is prolonged work participation, and how society and organisations can support workers with chronic disease to prolong their working life sustainably. \nSince 2018, I combine my position at the department of Public & Occupational Health at Amsterdam UMC with a part-time position as endowed Professor 'Organisation and Quality of Work in elderly care workers' at the faculty of Social Sciences of the Radboud University. This chair is initiated and supported by Kalorama, an elderly care organisation in Nijmegen area. In Nijmegen, I focus on healthy work(ing) in elderly care.",
