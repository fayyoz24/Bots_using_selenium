    "summary": "Passionate. Vision Driven. Dedicated. \n\nPicking up and learning anything quickly is my greatest strength and has afforded me a very wide variety of experience. As soon as I become involved in a project or organization, I gravitate toward what can be improved and am over-taken with delivering a quality product or service. A graduate of University of Iowa Tippie College of Business with a BBS in Management and Organization complimented with a certificate in Entrepreneurial Management. Since graduating, I have found myself an immigrant in 2 European countries where I have creatively build a career of my own making in a myriad of fields. I have used my entrepreneurial education in no less than three businesses, as well as numerous one-off freelance projects. I am a yes woman. \n\nI am currently contributing my experience and unique insight to the marketing, human resources, and finance areas of the family businesses, while designing and optimizing Squarespace websites as a freelancer. I am open to the right hybrid or remote part-time or temporary opportunity to lend my varied and eccentric experience. My passion for integrity and leadership guide me to and through my opportunities while keeping an eye open to the next adventure.",

Developed an spreadsheet to keep track of team members by location, position, contact information, and where in the process they currently were for approximately 40 team members. \n\nThe process to obtain the testimonial involved sending the initial invitation, scheduling an interview, recording the interview via word processor, writing the summary of the interview, sending summary to respective team member to approve, make corrections if necessary, obtaining a photograph of the team member, designing the web page where the testimonials would be showcased 6 at a time, and ultimately sending thank you's to those who participated. 18 team member testimonials were successfully obtained and those showcased will be refreshed every three months. At the conclusion of the project, wrote a process report to sustain the refreshment of testimonials.",
