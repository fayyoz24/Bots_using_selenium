Stuff is made usable for longer periode and does not have to be thrown away.

At FTC it is not only about building the robot itself, but also about team building, process and presentation. The matches are played on a field of 3 by 3 meters. The robot must be able to carry out tasks on the field and they will receive points for that. Every competition starts with an autonomous period of 30 seconds. In this period the robot may only drive on pre-programmed instructions. This is followed by a two-minute Driver Controlled period. The team can control the robot with two people. The alliance with the most points at the end of this time wins.\n\nFTC Netherlands is entirely powered by volunteers.",
