    "summary": "Young ambitious Life Sciences professional. During my career I worked in various commercial roles while still exploiting my Life Science background. In these roles I gained experience in skills like: networking, account management and project management. People describe me as considered, transparent, social and reliable. My communication style is very flexible and therefore I can easily connect with people in every layer of a business environment. As a farmer\u2019s daughter I was raised as a very grounded person which is reflected in my way of working. Moreover I like to \u201cget things done\u201d and to solve problems in a pragmatic and efficient way. It is important for me to challenge myself and keep developing in my career.  \n\n\n\nI have a business mindset and science background\nDuring my master I  was trained to apply my science background in a business environment. I like to be the linking pin between these two worlds. During my career I also situated myself in positions where I could form a bridge these two (sometimes) different cultures; You can say I speak both \u201clanguages\u201d. Moreover it also helps me that I am able to easily translate various difficult topics into an easy to understand and relatable story. Which I am able to communicate  externally, cross functionally and within different levels of a organization. \n\nI have broad knowledge of the Life Sciences industry. Next to my science education I have been working for, and with, various pharma/biotech companies throughout my career. In my current job I am exposed to people with various disciplines and personalities and this gives me even more insight into the industry and makes it easy for me to work cross functional. Moreover it has made me aware of the various topics, stakeholders and potential dilemma\u2019s. \n\nPeople describe me as a people-oriented person. Making connections is important to me. It always came naturally to me to build relationships and make connection. I consider myself style flexible and can easily talk to various types of people within different levels of an organisation. I often find myself empathizing with people trying to figure out what drives them, motivates them and try to understand their point of view. Therefore I often find myself between two parties finding common ground or a compromise so we can work together towards a common goal. \n\nI am very goal oriented, responsible and hands-on. When a task is assigned to me, you can be sure that it gets done. Moreover I am always more than happy to help others, collaborate and be supportive to the success of the team. \n",
