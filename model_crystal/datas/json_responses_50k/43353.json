    "summary": "I have worked in research support for the last 6 years. From a project management role starting at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to a technical role as a DevOps engineer at Nikhef, I enjoy working with experiments and scientists to understand their requirements and see if we can build or implement what they need. I help support local experiments at the Nikhef institute and international experiments by operating and maintaining the grid computing resources with other members of our team. \n\nI have a bachelor\u2019s degree in Physics with additional expertise in writing and editing.",

            "description": "Researchers around the world need and benefit from international collaborations on projects ranging from the humanities to the physical sciences. Many of these projects produce big data, which then needs to travel across continents to collaborators. To enable these collaborations, five national research and education networks (NRENs), lead by SURFnet, ESnet, Funet, Internet2 and Janet, joined together in 2013 to proactively find researchers who needed to connect and share data-intensive research around the world. Called Enlighten Your Research Global (EYR-Global), this program\u2019s goal is to accelerate research and discovery for program applicants in any research domain and in any country. In addition, the NRENs are offering expert networking help to researchers so they can efficiently use the high-performance networks to meet their research needs.",
