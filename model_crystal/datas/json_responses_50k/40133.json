    "summary": "My goal is to help organizations conduct business in an ethical and compliant way. I am an experienced ethics & compliance professional, with 20 years of compliance experience in various industries. I am experienced in establishing and improving ethics and compliance programs in general and anti-corruption programs and whistleblowing procedures in specific. Other specialties include corporate governance, compliance risk assessments, trade sanctions, (third party) due diligence, modern slavery, ESG and US legislation & prosecution practices. When I was nominated for the National Compliance Award, I was described as \"The Compliance Guru\".\n\nRecently I founded De Integriteitsco\u00f6rdinator BV. You can appoint us as an external, independent coordinator of your speak-up or whistleblowing procedure. We also provide training on the legislation and the good practices. \n\nIn 2016 I founded ECMC (Ethics & Compliance Management & Consulting). I am available to provide training and advice. I teach at the Netherlands Compliance Institute, SDU Licent, NBA Opleidingen, EIMF in Cyprus, AGRC in London, IMF Academy and the Greek Compliance Officers Association ASCO. Besides that, I am a guest lecturer at various universities. I also provide in-house compliance training; I have provided ethics and compliance training in over 30 countries on virtually all continents. \n\nI obtained most of my experience in-house. As Global Head of Compliance for Damco, the freight forwarder of the AP M\u00f6ller-Maersk Group, I was responsible for the compliance activities in 90 countries, focusing mainly on anti-bribery & corruption and trade restrictions. As Chief Compliance Officer Aon EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) I coordinated compliance efforts in some 60 countries, all business units.\n\nFollowing inquiries from regulators Aon started its anti-corruption program in 2007. I coordinated this program in the EMEA region from the start. According to the US and UK authorities Aon developed a best practice model other firms may wish to adopt. \n\nI am the former president of the Netherlands Compliance Officers Associaton (VCO) and founded the expert group on Financial Economic Crime (FEC). I am also a member of the expert group on culture & behavior of the association, the expert group on ESG a member of Institute for Financial Crime (IFFC) and a member of the professional advisory committee of the Compliance Minor at The Hague University. In 2020 I was awarded the National Compliance Award and in 2023 I was honored as a top thought leader in trust by Trust Across America/Trust Across The World.",

The latter in a literal and figurative sense. He attracts people as a speaker and as a sparring partner (in dialogue). Geert Vermeulen is a keen commentator on the (unfortunately) daily news about financial economic crime (FEC) and compliance and integrity issues - often with texts translated into English and serving a wide audience - and an interesting storyteller with concrete, clearly formulated examples of what he sees happening: close by, but also within Europe, at the World Economic Forum (!), and far beyond. He discuss the behaviour and (public) role of people and organizations and regularly appears in the national and even international press. Not only professional journals, such as the Tijdschrift voor Compliance, but also general media and newspapers, such as Het Financieele Dagblad and recently NRC Handelsblad, know where to find him. Geert Vermeulen has an open personality and always seeks the dialogue, including with himself. He reflects visibly on his own sometimes radical ideas, for example about a public payment network. Within the network of Compliance Officers and Professionals - he seems to be present at all important compliance and risk events - he shares his years of knowledge and experience with enthusiasm, which is also so important for the younger generations (in the necessary dialogue about values and essence/purpose). In all his work you feel, besides his enthusiasm, the sincerity in his goal, the fight against wrongdoing: 'make the world a slightly better place'.\"",

We offer you the following services: \n\n- We will handle the communication with the reporter in a confidential way and can also coordinate the investigation for you\n- We help you to draft and implement a reporting procedure and investigation protocol. We can also help you communicate this and train your employees.  \n- We can prepare the annual or quarterly report on the whistleblowing procedure for you. In The Netherlands it is mandatory to provide an annual report to the Works Council. But it is useful to do this anyway. \n\nWe also offer courses to Integrity Coordinators or Whistleblowing Reporting Officers and help industry associations to communicate the new whistleblowing legislation and good practices to its members.\n\nShortly all organizations (legal entities) within the EU with 50 employees or more and all organizations that are subject to financial or anti-money laundering/CFT laws have to appoint somebody who is impartial to coordinate their whistleblowing procedure. We have been rolling out and coordinating whistleblowing procedures since 2007 and have handled hundreds of cases, both at multinationals and at small and medium sized enterprises.",
