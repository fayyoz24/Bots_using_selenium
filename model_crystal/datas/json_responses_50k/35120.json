    "summary": "I\u2019m a multilingual communications professional, with an above average interest in design and a love of storytelling.  Having spent 11 years in communications at the global technology firm, Dyson, I relocated to the Netherlands in 2015, my current home.  Here I have the dream design communications job at TU Delft\u2019s Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, leading the communications team. Working with the University\u2019s talented researchers and students, we are in the privileged position of telling the story of Delft Design and its impact across sustainability, health and mobility at a time of great change.\n\nI have experience in building and leading teams, building networks and developing strategies but I also enjoy being hands-on. I am skilled across a wide-spectrum of communications actives including media relations and product launches; ghostwriting and speechwriting; events management and internal communications; developing online content and crisis communications.\n\nI am an English native speaker with the bonus of being  highly competent in Dutch, French and German. I can also speak basic Japanese (JLPT level 3).\n\nStories by Design, my communications consultancy is a little quiet these days (too busy with the day job) but if you\u2019re interested in my help, do get in touch.",

Together with my talented colleagues, we have the enviable task of telling the story of the changing role of design in an increasingly complex world (clue: it's less about products these days but addressing societal challenges such as sustainability, health and mobility by developing services and systems). With the help of inspiring scientists and students, we create and share stories of Delft Design to attract future students, raise the profile of our research and build a strong community. Like the design process itself, this job is shifting and developing each day that goes by. I'm always learning and I think it's that which keeps me hooked.",

Recruited and managed public affairs agency to build network of influencers in Brussels, drafting Dyson position papers and lobbying NGOs, MEPs and officials at the European Commission for a better label. This behind-the-scenes work resulted in coverage in European broadsheets and www.euractive.com and ultimately, a partial win for Dyson and the environment - with the introduction of limits on the size of motors in vacuum cleaners\n- Improved Dyson\u2019s performance on retailer sustainability scorecards (eg. doubled Dyson\u2019s score on Walmart\u2019 Sustainability Index -  a factor in purchasing decisions)   \n- Pioneered Dyson\u2019s responsible sourcing programme in South East Asia, including writing Supplier Ethical and Environmental Code of Conduct and crisis communications",
