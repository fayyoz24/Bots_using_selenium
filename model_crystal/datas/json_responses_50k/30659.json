    "summary": "I started developing websites around 2012 and began my professional career in web development during my studies, first as a junior back-end developer working on an in-house, mainly B2C e-commerce platform used by mid-sized and large companies in the region. I used to work with Laravel (v.4.2 back then) and besides writing code, I gained experience in designing database schemas.\n\nFrom there I moved to being a full-stack developer. At this young and dynamic company, the Vue.js framework was added to the mix. I also gained experience in DevOps, e.g. having designed and created an automatic workflow for video processing in AWS. We created some nice made-to-measure progressive web applications that looked great too.\n\nLater I joined a small start-up company specialising in optimizations in logistics where it was the first time for me to lead a modest team in front-end development. I eventually became the sole front-end developer and had responsibilities for the design and development of a number of in-house products. My tech stack consisted mainly of TypeScript, React.js (CRA) and Electron.js. I used to work with maps a lot too.\n\nNow I have moved to the Netherlands and am looking for a new opportunity here.\n\nThe day The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was officially announced for the first time back in 2010 I immediately created a fansite for this game for Czech and Slovak fans. It later became quite a big thing and I got amazing experiences from this. \n\nThis passion eventually led me to obtain university degrees from renowned universities in the Czech Republic, where I am from. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's in Service Science, both from the faculties of Information Technology, from the Brno University of Technology and the Masaryk University, respectively.",
