    "summary": "Dina Chaerani has a solid blend of experience working directly with youths in need along with a highly accomplished academic record achieved from the International Institute of Social Studies - Erasmus University Rotterdam upon receipt of her Master's Degree in Development Studies with double specializations in Children and Youth Studies (CYS) and Public Policy and Management (PPM). Her skill set gained through her youth work with the Youth Advisory Panel and being the president of Youth Coalition for Girls has afforded her the opportunity to acquire valuable knowledge of social service programs, child and family support, and operational coordination. Currently, she is running a youth-led organization called Sexdugram, an online platform to provide comprehensive pre-marital sexuality education for Indonesian children and youth. Her communication strengths and ability to connect with children and youth of all ages and establish trusting relationships position her to thrive in this challenging field. She feels a devotion to this profession. Her skills include the ability to effectively communicate with young adults of all ages and diverse ethnicity in a way that does not show disrespect which is vital to them. Besides that, she has involved herself in working professionally in Non-Government Organizations life and being a Youth Engagement and Recruitment Specialist. Both of her professional work experiences are really close to youth and children. And of course, she engages them in the project or work values she has. Her social and friendly nature means she has a knack for connecting with children and young people from diverse backgrounds and she values the task of building community involvement, which she sees as part of working with children and youth. Child and youth participation is always at the forefront of her mind.",

In a fun, didactic but also substantive way, this e-learning should invite works councils to think about the challenges in 3 areas (Complexity of strategic decision-making, SDGs, connection and communication flow) and get them to work with how this works in their own organization.",

The soft-skills includes: Gender, Work-readiness, and Financial Literacy. \n \nThe project is aiming to: \n1.\tTest the practical needs of girls and young women. The current e-learning only provides materials from other sources such as Microsoft, ASEAN Foundation, thus it does not build up for the practical needs and based on the interests of girls and young women.\n\n2.\tTest the use of e-learning trends such as gamification. Some institutions in Indonesia have started to develop e-learning materials, however it is still be presented in form of softcopy version that can be downloaded or in the form of video. We would like to test the assumption that the improved e-learning materials that is following the current e-learning trends might increase girls and young women\u2019s interests to use the e-learning materials in GenerasiBisa!\n\n3.\tTest that sharing stories among girls/young women and between girls-boys and young women-men on gender inequalities, barriers, and challenges will create a common understanding and a better knowledge, skills and attitudes towards gender equality.
