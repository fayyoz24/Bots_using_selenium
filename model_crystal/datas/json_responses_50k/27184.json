    "summary": "Hi there and welcome to my Linkedin profile!\n\nIf you are a recruiter and you have no REMOTE jobs available, look elsewhere, not interested. After the whole COVID situation I realise that working remote is the way forward, the era of office is over.\n\nAfter working as a Java backend developer for a number of years, I have decided to focus my attention on the frontend and in doing so I have become a true allround developer with focus on modern frontend techniques and a good customer experience. I have experience in building both pure backend as well as rich web based applications using Java, Javascript and various modern frameworks like AngularJS, Vue, React, Spring, JQuery, etc.\n\nWorking in a team is in my blood and I have extensive experience in practicing Agile/Scrum, I have also followed the Scrum Master course at CollabNet. However, my main interest remains in creating beautiful software that delivers business value.\n\nI am a firm believer in a great Developer Experience and I have therefore created many tools and practices that helped my team members optimise their workflow. I like to adopt lightweight tools and frameworks that help me eliminate waste and automate mundane tasks so that me and my team can concentrate on the more meaningful work.\n\nOn various projects I have worked with leading toolsets including IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Eclipse, Maven, NPM, NodeJS, Grunt/Gulp, Atlassian (Jira, Confluence, Bamboo), SVN, GIT, SoapUI and various others and thus became an expert in using most of these.\n\nSpecialties:\nFrontend development using Javascript, NPM and NodeJS\nJava development (JavaSE & Enterpise) and Spring\nImplementing REST API's (both server and client)\nMVC Frameworks like Spring MVC, Grails/Groovy or AngularJS\nFrontend-backend integration (Javascript/Ajax/JQuery)\nMaven\nOptimisation of the team developer experience\n\nOther area's of expertise:\nProblem solving capabilities (analytic, systematic)\nInterfaces between various systems (both backend and frontend)\nReverse engineering & extracting meaningful data\nScrum/Agile development\nBackend development using webservices, databases, flat files or any other source of data.\nPragmatic, keep it simple.",

Initial backend used Spring MVC, the new and improved backend uses Groovy, Gradle and Jersey. Communication between front- and backend is based on REST calls from AngularJS to Spring/Jersey. Data format is in JSON. Automated testing using JUnit, Jasmine, Fitnesse, Protractor. AngularJS application consists of several logically separated modules that work together with modules from other teams to create a uniform user experience over the whole application.\n\nWhen working with complex multi module systems within a large organisations, I usually experience that setting up a fluid development environment is a hassle but pays off quite quickly. I was the primary/lead developer to implement a developer tool suite using NPM, Grunt, Bower, etc to make local development of frontend components as easy as possible by connecting multiple modules divided over different git repositories with reverse proxy routing, automated Jasmine test runner template generation, hot reloading of code and automatic mocking of backend responses when working without the real backend.\n\nAt the start of the project we were all pretty new to AngularJS, but after over a year of continuous development we feel comfortable with the framework and are actually quite happy with it. Keeping the code organised and separating the concerns makes it very maintainable and extendable.\n\nTechnologies include:\nAngularJS, Jasmine, Less, CSS, HTML, Javascript, REST, Spring, Agile/Scrum, Selenium, Fitnesse, Jenkins, TeamCity.",
