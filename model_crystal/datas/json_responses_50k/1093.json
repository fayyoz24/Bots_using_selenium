    "summary": "I am a diligent student with natural interest in science and engineering. I love to challenge myself and working on projects that can make an impact for a client. I always try to exceed expectations to satisfy the client. This drive shows in the many extracurricular activities that I have done during my bachelor and my drive for high and study performance during my master. \n\nDuring my bachelor I have always been searching for an extra challenge which I have found in doing committees, being part of the university and faculty council and a board year at student association Demos. \n\nDuring my master my main focus has shifted back towards my university and graduation and gaining work experience. I did a case study at Safan Darley on improving their Press Brakes and visited Japan in a study trip. Furthermore I went on an international internship to Japan and worked on flexible and transparent electronics. For my graduation project I am researching the influence of the microstructure of steels on their deformation behaviour. I developed a new method fro identification and quantification of deformations on a nanometer scale. My goal for my master is to graduate with the judicium of 'Cum Laude'.\n\nI expect to graduate March 2020. After my graduation I would like to work at a challenging job as an engineer or trainee, in which I can put my technical background and devoloped skills into practice. If you offer a challenging job opportunity that seems to fit my profile I would like to hear from it to see if we could help each other out.",
