    "summary": "Hi! I'm Karlijn, a Media Studies graduate from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, with a specialization in Audiovisual Culture. I am currently working part-time as a Research Assistant in the Media Studies & Journalism department at the RUG, and as Norwegian Translator for Belsimpel's international marketing team. In February 2024, I will be pursuing a Research MA in Arts, Media and Literary Studies, allowing me to delve more deeply into the entanglements of media, journalism, sociology and psychology. \n\nAs a student and employee, I am meticulous and driven, dedicated to delivering the best work I possibly can and staying curious. I am passionate about weaving international and marginalized perspectives into my research, and working to understand how media can serve as platforms for documenting instances of social injustice and trauma. In both my work and studies my strength lies in my proficiency with language and its subjective meanings, my ability to think critically and solve problems accordingly, and my attention to detail.",
