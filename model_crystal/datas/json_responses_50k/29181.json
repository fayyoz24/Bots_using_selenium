This additional recovery depends on being able to improve the sweep efficiency of our water injectors. This was the result of diligent interpretation of multiple surveillance activities, of aggregating their results in a unified conceptual view of what is happening in the reservoir, and of making use of reservoir simulation to support the results.  \n\u25cf\tI discovered that it is possible to more than double the production rate of about 60% of the wells in the Rotterdam De Lier reservoir by fracturing them.

The adoption of this proposal resulted in a reduction of deferment by about 10% per year.\n\u25cf\tI implemented an alternative data gathering strategy which reduced the number of production stops required to obtain static pressure measurements, from 3 per year, to zero. This was done by carefully aligning the reservoir surveillance strategy and the maintenance schedule.\n\u25cf\tI created an algorithm that calculates the optimal allocation of load across the field, for a given demand.

My tasks included determining the technical feasibility, creating detailed activity plans, cost estimation, coordination interaction with internal and external stakeholders, supervising safe execution and conducting after action reviews.  \n\nKey skills: project management, HAZOP, conducting field operations in oil and gas installations, completions and well interventions technology.\n\nKey Achievements:\n\u25cf\tI co-directed the 2010 coiled tubing stimulation campaign. In this campaign we managed to reduce the price of coiled tubing stimulations by an average of 40%. This was achieved by standardizing the rig up, maintaining crew stability, and simplifying the required surface equipment.\n\u25cf\tI planned and executed multiple wireline, e-line logging and perforations jobs, and also many  coiled tubing acid stimulation jobs, without ever having a single safety incident.",
