    "summary": "Sicco's main entrepreneurial experience has grown from the moment of founding a medical device company in Germany in 2005. Bringing the company to a growing business with various medical products and a healthy development roadmap and business network is proof of his abilities to manage, drive, be organised and stay focused. \n\nSicco's general technical expertise lies in the field of application engineering, germinated by many years of experience in the high tech semiconductor industry at ASML. He understands how to bridge the gap between customer or user requirements, technical or not, and that of a system under development. Understanding the customers and suppliers and their ways of using or manufacturing a product, and then translating that to development requirements that are fit to the product being produced and knowing the impact of such changes, are key aspects to his experience.\n\nHe gained various business skills and experiences during the build-up of a Medical Imaging device company over 10 years, amongst which the following:\nIntellectual Property Management, Company Organization, Quality Management & Regulatory Affairs for Medical Devices, Production Management and Production Engineering, Supply Chain Management, Translation Management, Sales & Marketing, Customer Support and Servicing. Project Management and leadership has been a significant part in each of these.\n\nHaving lived around the globe since his childhood, he enjoys to work with people for people to try and make everyone in the team feel involved and motivated about the goals to facilitate reaching them.",
