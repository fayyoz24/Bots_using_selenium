    "summary": "I am a foreign language graduate with a degree in translation and interpretation in English and German. During my studies I acquired proficiency in English and basic communication skills in German. I used my language skill a lot while working in the banking sector helping business German clients with financial certifications. \nI have the basic foundations in the financial field and back office work and would like to expand my knowledge, but only through challenges we can evolve. I'm currently  interested in back-office work in the banking zone, but not only. I also have client service experience, both as a call center agent and as a bookseller in store. At the bookstore I also took upon making and serving coffee for the cafe inside, a thing I really enjoyed. I am open to new challenges and motivated to work.",
