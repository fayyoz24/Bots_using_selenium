We apply not only common ESG metrics but also engage with companies, develop forward looking models on decarbonization strategies, estimate capital requirements and costs of low carbon solutions, and more. \n\nBoth the water and energy sector are undergoing deep transitions. Water becomes more scarce through qualitative and quantitative constraints and innovation is needed to tab into alternative water sources, like the reuse of wastewater or desalination. Energy supply needs to be decarbonized to reach climate targets and renewable energy finally becomes cost competitive. Working on these transitions and identifying the most environmentally beneficial and cost-efficient solutions is a an exciting challenge to be part of.",
