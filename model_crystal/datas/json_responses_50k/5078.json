    "summary": "For the past 7 years I have been working in High Tech recruitment. I chose Recruitment because of my interest in people and my passion to help people achieve the next step in their career. During my graduation internship I first came in contact with international recruitment and loved every aspect of it. Over the years I have recruited professionals in the fields \"System Test & Release\", \"Electrical / Electronics Engineering\", \"Mechatronics\", \"Mechanical Engineering\", \"Software Engineering\", \"Chemical Engineering\" and \"Applied Physics\" for the High Tech, Semicon and Machinery Industry. \n\nCurrently I work at Vention Technologies at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, where I am recruiting in the following fields: \n\n- Software Engineering\n- Embedded/Firmware Engineering\n- Electrical/ Electronic Engineering\n\nOutside of work, I have a passion for basketball, watches, traveling and motor sport. In my life I have been able to make many beautiful journeys such as an Exchange Program in America an internship in Kinshasa, Congo and working experience in Melbourne, Australia. These experiences have taught me to adapt to new environments, communicate in different languages and learn from people who have a different cultural background than my own. \n\nIf you are looking for an interesting and challenging job in the field of Electronics or Software Engineering, feel free to contact me to learn more about current job opportunities at Vention Technologies via thomas@vention.nl or via +316 48622740.",
