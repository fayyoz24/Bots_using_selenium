For the past five years I also successfully prepared the seniors for their final exams and on several occasions participated with my seniors in the national round of the Geography Olympics. \n\nFor the past seven years I have been a homeroom teacher in middle school (8th grade/second year) as well as a personal mentor for a group of 15 seniors whom I have been monitoring for six consecutive years. \n\nMy strong points are instruction and structure. I believe that strong results and experimental learning can be improved and achieved by providing these key elements for students. For many years I have achieved excellent results in all grade levels when it comes to writing papers or thesis projects using higher education as a reference point. Through flexibility, clear expectations and continuous feedback I  can say that all of my students feel confident and safe to experiment, make mistakes and learn from them. I also like to work with GIS applications in my lessons and can easily mix between verbal and visual explanations.\n\nFurthermore, I have organized fieldwork excursions to Lisbon, Portugal and pre-designed fieldwork trips to Georgia, Istanbul and Budapest for future use. Finally, I have strong interpersonal skills and find it easy to connect to both students and parents. A good relationship is one of the best ingredients for motivating students.",

The letters of the Bistro beams the soap opera culture, while the menu uses the names of famous national and regional artists for their dishes, and includes a variety of local and international brands to achieve a glocal culture. The Leblon Cat tells the story of the poor and rich, the unknown and the famous without judging them.  \n\nOrganization\nIt was tried to implement a more northern european management style, where employees would feel valued and not be to submissive, but speak their mind and bring their ideas forward without being afraid to be fired. They were given a variety of responsibilities and opportunities to grow. At the end however, management style became more Brazilian as it was to early to adopt a totally different style from what employees were used to. \n\n\nMy responsibilities as marketing consultant:\n\n* Development of the business plan \n* Developing the brand and the concept of the restaurant\n* Development of the marketing yearplan and future strategies \n* Building and maintaining relationships with several agencies and key stakeholders in the process.\n* Communication/Advertising through local radio\n* Ambassador of Heineken in the Suburbs\n* Interim manager of a team of 12 employees\n* Hospitality training for the employees\n* Market Research prior to the opening\n* Administration and Financial controller\n\nSucces: So far the most succesful project of Southernwinds. The restaurant opened within 3 months, despite the fact of being exposed to a lot of Brazilian bureaucracy. Within a week it was a hype attracting people by word of mouth from all over Salvador. Social media was also used.",
