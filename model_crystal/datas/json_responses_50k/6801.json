Initially, our team benefited from the mentorship of seasoned journalists and specialists from each participating country. However, due to the challenges posed by the pandemic, we found it necessary to adapt our working model. Consequently, we decided to transition to a national approach, where each country's team would collaborate with and receive guidance from the respective Editorial Group division.\n\n\u2022 Our adapted working model proved effective, resulting in our team's first published article just months later. Comprising seven young journalists, myself included, and supported by four experienced mentors, our team operated through subteams, each responsible for different aspects of the articles. I contributed to various components, including the main text, interviews, graphics, and introductions, allowing us to gain expertise across all facets of article production. This project spanned a duration of 23 months.",
