In order to implement feasible solutions, user acceptance is of critical importance. This thesis investigates preferences of travellers for automated buses on last mile connections and determines whether travellers that have long-term experience with automated buses have different preferences and perceptions than inexperienced travellers. Conclusions include new insights in demand for automated buses and recommendations from a travellers' perspective to be used for future implementations of automated bus systems.",
