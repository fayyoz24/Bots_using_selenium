    "summary": "I am a Belgian student with a passion for international experiences. After completing high school, I spent a year on exchange in Brazil. Seeking new opportunities and challenges, I then enrolled in a bachelor's program in international business at Maastricht University. During my studies, I took a gap year to hold a board position at SCOPE Maastricht, where I had the opportunity to manage a team of 50 people. I completed my bachelor's degree with an Erasmus exchange in Barcelona and  pursued a MSc in Marketing Management while working as a student at Deloitte. As an extrovert, I am always looking for ways to connect and collaborate with others\n\nIf my profile interests you or if would like to know more about me, please contact me at \nsami.bounouar27@gmail.com",
