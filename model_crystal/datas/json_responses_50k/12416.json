    "summary": "Competitive advantage is indeed at the heart of a firm's performance in competitive markets.\n\nI'm enabling companies to gain a competitive advantage by applying the right technologies, building state-of-the-art architectures, using a product development mindset, and doing business analysis.\n\nI believe in the principles of passion, focus, and taking charge: \n\u2022 Be passionate about the things you do \u2013 or stop doing them. \n\u2022 Focus on a few things and finish them before you move on. \n\u2022 Take charge and potentially deliver slightly more than expected.\n\nI am Oleksandr, a passionate, hands-on, highly motivated CTO, Sr. Solution Architect, and Technical Strategy Advisor with over one and half decades of considerable engineering, product, Digital Transformation, and Managerial experience.\n\nPast 15+ years, I have served in SaaS, B2B scaleup companies, and Fortune 500 companies as:\n\u2022 Interim VP of Engineering | CTO\n\u2022 Sr. Engineering Manager\n\u2022 Lead Solution Architect\n\u2022 Cloud Architect\n\u2022 Enterprise Architect\n\u2022 Enterprise Strategist\n\u2022 Technical Strategy Advisor\n\nI have broad and deep technology knowledge and the ability to architect solutions by mapping common customer business problems to end-to-end technology solutions.\n\nI architect systems to enable businesses to add value to their products and satisfy their customers by increasing the speed of delivery with a good enough product at first, then gradually making it better.\n\nTo succeed, I believe in choosing the best technology or approach and choosing because it fits for purpose. Besides, whatever we choose must be flexible enough to evolve so our technology portfolio can adapt to business goals and technology changes.\n\nHow do we know if we have selected the right technology and approaches? The critical point is to be able to measure all decisions, implementations, and processes.\n\nI take pride in increasing employee engagement and scaling high-performance teams that align on vision, execute across targets, and improve the value chain.\n\nSo far, I'm involved in designing and building various applications such as web, mobile, desktop, distributed systems, microservices, IoT, client-side, and back-end solutions running on AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. I enable customer success and digital transformation by leveraging the power of AI, public clouds, and data science.\n\nIn short: Strategy, Innovation, Teamwork, Results, Commitment, Quality, and Wins are vital things that drive me in my work.\n\nWant to support me?
