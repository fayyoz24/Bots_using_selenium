    "summary": "As a practical CSR Fashion manager, socio-scientific Cultural Anthropologist and being a consultant, I see the urgency to reform the culture of businesses. The power relationship should be changed into an equal relationship with a common intrinsic belief of doing good. This common belief can only sustain by investing in a long-lasting partnership and open communication. Everyone is open for change, but nobody wants to be changed. So, only together a difference can be made!",
