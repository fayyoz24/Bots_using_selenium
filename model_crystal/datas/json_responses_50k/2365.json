    "summary": "I started my career in 1986 as programmer and was working on several sites, because I was working at an IT employment agency and was assigned in other companies. I worked for that company until 1997. In these years I was assigned at IBM, ABN (bank), Belastingdienst, Rijksdienst voor het wegverkeer and a company handling the administration for the health insurance branche and finally at ING. What I did in those companies was programming, technical design and functional design.\n\nIn 1996 I was asked to join the ING as an internal employee and that's what I did starting january 1997. At ING I had several roles: functional designer, functional tester, information analyst, suppliers manager, IT architect, contract manager, project manager, scrum master and selecting software packages.\n\nStarting at 2011 to 2017 I was involved in the creation of a new Order Manager based on a Service Oriented Architecture, including the reporting to clients. Since April 2013 I am focussed on this reporting. My role in this project is dev engineer (emphasis on information analyst, functional designer and scrum master).\n\nSince 2017 up until now, I am working at de Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) as an Information Analist. My job here was at first, helping the team working in a more agile way. This is completed now and we are now working on the switch from Billing Engine to SAP Hybris Billing for the creation of invoices for the customers.",

To do this I use the refinement sessions to gather input for the solution from the team and convert the input to a workable design and description of functionality. Also the alignment with the business is part of my job here and I have contact with the Product Owner and the Business Consultants to reach this alignment. Since I am part of the team I see a positive change in the way of working towards really agile working. A great team to work with!",
