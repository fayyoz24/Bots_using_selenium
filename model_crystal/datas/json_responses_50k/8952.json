    "summary": "I\u2019m currently an exchange student at Hanze University of applied science and I will obtain a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Soochow University in 2019. During my study at Soochow University, I gained much basic knowledge in different fields of business, and also developed practical skills such as teamwork, presenting, communication, and multitasking. \n\nI\u2019m an open-minded person, during my exchange in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, I met a lot of people from different countries. In class, we worked together as a group to present our creative idea. After class, we held an international dinner to get to know others' cultures better. It has enabled me to easily accept and familiar with different people and cultures.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m interested in learning the language. I'm able to speak and understand Korean. I've learned Japanese for two years, and I will continue improving both of them. During my exchange, I also learned some basic Czech and Dutch. These language skills will allow me to work in an international environment in the future.",
