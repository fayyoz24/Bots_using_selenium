    "summary": "I am Jonah Dierick, a 23-year-old hospitality enthusiast born and raised in the Philippines. My sincere love and passion for the hospitality industry began at a young age on the East side of the globe, where I was exposed to various cultures and diverse experiences.\n\nWith a strong work ethic and an unwavering determination to achieve my goals, I have gained broad work experience in both Food & Beverage and Rooms Division. My professional background has equipped me with attention to detail, precision, and professionalism - skills that I pride myself on and continually strive to develop.\n\nWhen I am not engaged in academic or professional pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton, where I  participated in the national competition's fifth division as the team captain. My competitive personality has not only helped me to excel in my sport but also to be a great team player, always willing to work with others to achieve shared goals.",
