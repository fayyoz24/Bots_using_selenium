    "summary": "As internationally experienced IT professional, I have 20+ years of experience working with intercultural teams. My focus is on taking on technical challenges and solving problems in fast-paced work environments. I enjoy working in a team where together we can make a difference and deliver improvements to create solutions that companies rely on, perform better and enhance reliability. Architecture, systems integration, enterprise security (RISC), web technologies, analysis, programming and systems support are a few of my strongest skills that I have developed working in the banking and telecom industries. The time has come to make the next step in my career. Systems integration and platform management in the Fintech industry should be among the main themes in my next position. I can work for any, preferably international, company (banks and others) in the Netherlands and am comfortable working both remote and on-site.\n\ncontact: eduardocorreia.work@gmail.com\n\n\n\nkeywords:\nSystems Support Analyst Specialist \nSystems Programmer\nSenior Systems Engineer\nInfrastructure and Operations Specialist\nIT Consultant  \nSenior Systems Analyst Programmer  \nData Analyst \nFIS expert\nFintech\n",
