After producing an album for an acoustic band, and two albums Piet van der Pol and I made for children, I'd built up experience in composing, recording, mixing and mastering.\nThe album 'Closer To The Moon' turned out to be a many-layered, easy-listening record, and I'm actually still happy with the result after 15 years. At the time, I was thankful for the headspace it brought for the writing of new songs.\nThe two albums that followed - 'Between Air And Wing' (2013) and 'Crash Course For Earth' (2015) have received a couple of very positive reviews on Progwereld, DPRP and WrittenInMusic. Performing them live has been a challenge because of my method of recording, so to get my kicks as a live performer I joined a band called Patch The Sky in 2019 playing bass, synth and vocals. Check us out at www.patchthesky.nl and do follow us on facebook and/or youtube if you like our music.\nIn the meanwhile, since 2015 I'm working on a double album. This fourth Steve Merlin album covers the first part of a story that I've been developing for a longer time and hopefully will come out as a novel one day. First it will see the light of day in the form of 19 tracks.",
