    "summary": "It's my passion to improve organisations and assure all valuable people find the right place on board. \n\nI enjoy leading a multidisciplinary team where complex challenges need to be managed. I prefer to work in technical production companies. Colleagues enjoy working with me, because I am an approachable, energetic and straight forward leader. Keeping an overview and thinking one step ahead are some of my strengths. \n\nEvery day I put maximum energy in aligning the organisation's performance with the customer needs. I set the example by being in frequent contact with our customers, which help me to adjust the operations strategy. This makes the company ready for a profitable future. \n\nIt's my ambition and dream to move into a general management position and maybe become an entrepreneur myself.",

Currently we are finalizing the project to implement one planning model for all 12 assembly lines. This used to be two ways of working because two companies were integrated. Main challenge here is a cultural change and teaching one new way of working.\n\nEaton has a great challenge in especially the first objective and I enjoy working and taking a leading role in this challenge together with all disciplines involved (Order Management, Customer Order Engineering, Operations and Supply Chain). Next to this it gives me lot of energy to work on providing the best possible service for our customers.",
