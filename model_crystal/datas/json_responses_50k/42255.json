Headquartered near Mexico City, CIMMYT works with hundreds of partners through out the developing world to sustainably increase the productivity of maize and wheat cropping systems, thus improving global food security and reducing poverty. CIMMYT is member of the CGIAR Consortium and leads the CGIAR Research Program on Maize and Wheat.\n\nIn my master thesis research I focused on the effect of conservation agriculture practices on soil quality, yield and profitability in maize-based production systems in Mexico. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is based on three principals: (i) minimum soil tillage, (ii) crop residue retention and (iii) crop rotation. The combination of minimum soil tillage and crop residue retention has the strong potential to decrease soil degradation and erosion, increase water retention capacity and enhance soil biologic life. Crop rotation will decrease pest and disease pressure and will enhance nutrient- and water use efficiency. The implementation of this combination of principles, combined with other agronomic sustainable sound practices like integrated weed-, nutrient- and pest management, therefore has the strong potential to efficiently increase the sustainability of conventional agricultural production systems.\n"

Based on interviews with our members, I wrote a paper about this topic.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uY3Cosko-M&t=214s&ab_channel=CIHEAMZaragoza "

            "description": "Edukans is a professional educational development organisation which is headquartered in the Netherlands. The organisation plays a leading role in supporting and improving the quality of education programmes in developing countries, with a focus on underprivileged children. Their work centres on general education for pupils of up to 15 years of age and vocational education for young people of up to 25. All of the activities are fuelled by the belief that education is the key to personal as well as national development.\n\nThe Going Global Project is one of the several projects of Edukans. It connects Dutch high school students with children in developing regions with the aim of exchanging cultures and learning from each other and about the educational situation both sides are in.\n\nAs the one representative of my school I visited several Edukans educational projects in Nairobi and North-Kenya (Samburu region). Upon my return I gave several presentations to all students at my school to increase awareness among my fellow students about the need for the establishment of more schools / improve quality of education in the regions I had visited. Thereafter I co-organized a full day fundraising event at my school to raise money in order to make this improvement of education possible.\nThe raised money was sent to the projects that I had visited.\n"
