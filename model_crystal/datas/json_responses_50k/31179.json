After 2.5 succesfull years working from Amsterdam, I had the chance to move with my family to Australia.\nFor 2.5 years I worked and lived in Australia. During my time in Australia I worked as Sevenstar Load Master for the region Australia, New Zealand and SE Asia, booked yacht transport and worked as a port agent. In 2010 I returned to Amsterdam.\nFrom 2010 till 2013 my role was line/sales manager for the Trans Atlantic trade, focusing mainly on the route between the Med - The Caribbean and Florida.\nIn 2013 I took the role as sales manager for Australia and New Zealand and started working on developing new routes for the growing Asia -, Pacific - and Middle East region. \nSevenstar has helped the Asian and Australian/ New Zealand yacht market to grow by offering reliable and professional handling of shipping yachts to and from the region. Not only the number of yachts have grown, but also the size we are shipping now a days has increased a lot. We ship regularly super yachts on these routes.",

I was a 24 year young ex Royal Dutch Marine looking for a new adventure. Together we worked out brochures, booked a stand on the Boat Show in Dusseldorf and managed to sign contracts for  shipping 16 yachts from The Netherlands to Mallorca. We managed to load and discharge yachts on the vessel \"MV Waddenzee\" and shipped 60 yachts in the first year! Then we knew we were working on something which had the potential to grow fast if we would continue to put a lot of hard work in it. We found \"the hole in the market\" and had to keep up with the pace.  \nAfter 5 years a large shipping company (Spliethoff) showed interest in buying the company. Zevenster was renamed into Sevenstar when the company was sold. \nAfter these exciting and challenging years, in which I learnt to grow a business, load/discharge yachts, sell yacht transport, the shipping industry, write articles, managed and trained a team, travelled 35 times a year and dealing with the day to day business, I took the opportunity to travel the world  at age 29.  \nFrom my 29th until my 35th I travelled, owned my own company for 3.5 years and after this was hired by Sevenstar Yacht Transport again. I had the chance to develop a new market for Sevenstar Yacht Transport: The region Australia and New Zealand.",
