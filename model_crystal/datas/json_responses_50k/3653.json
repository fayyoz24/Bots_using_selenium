    "summary": "As an experienced digital professional, I am passionate about online communication in all its facets. During the past 20+ years, I learned about all the aspects involved, ranging from user research to concept development and from project management to backend implementation and adoption. For me, satisfaction comes from analyzing complex problem while involving business and users, and then come to a sustainable solution with contributions from all specialists involved. A solution that meets both business needs and user needs. Open-minded and curious, I listen and observe before acting. I strongly belief in the power of teams to create the best solutions; group discussions, critiques and solid research are fundamental to reach the next level. My strength lies in aligning, challenging and motivating the team members, and in extracting results from the process: as a conceptual thinker, I make sure the dots are connected.\n\nSpecialties\nUX research & design, online strategy and content strategy, concept development, requirements analysis, interaction design, copywriting\n\nSome of the organizations I worked for:\nABP, AFM, Albeda College, ANWB, ASR, Barco, BNG Bank, DNB, DSM, Eneco, Espria, Essent, Gamma, Gemiva-SVG, GS1, Holland International Distribution Council, IBFD, KNHB, KPMG, KPN, Marktplaats.nl, MoneYou, MSN, Nationale-Nederlanden, Natuurmonumenten, NDC Mediagroep, New Heroes, Nuon, NWO, Rabobank, Radboud Universiteit, ROC van Amsterdam, Royal Reesink, Slachtofferhulp Nederland, Staatsloterij, Teva Pharmaceuticals, ThiemeMeulenhoff, TNT Innight, Universiteit Maastricht, Vesteda, Vimpelcom, ZonMw",

We provide UX-design, visual design and the frontend code for their global website, 50+ country sites and numerous product sites. For this, we work in an international setting, collaborating closely with the global Teva digital team located in Israel, the backend supplier located in Bulgaria and the local Teva digital teams. We have setup and maintain the design system.\n\nDesign should, in our age of different devices, be delivered in working frontend code, as to guarantee that everything is working as designed on all devices. Furthermore, this code has to be accompanied by clear instructions regarding functionality, interactions and content architecture. By delivering the design in the fashion as described above, the handover to the technical partner that is responsible for the implementation in Episerver, is more straightforward. It saves time in communication and in art direction after implementation.\n\nBut delivering a design was, in our opinion, not enough. What was needed, was an underlying System that is also suited for continuous improvement: this is a Library containing all current elements. To this online and secure Library, new elements are easily added. Because over time, new components and templates are needed, others are modified, functionality is changed, and content needs to be developed. The countries should be able to count on the global digital team to adapt to their changing needs. Each improvement, whether initiated by a country or by the global digital team, benefits all country sites.",

But the organisation also provides the infrastructure on which suppliers can unambiguously share their product data with their customers and ultimately with the consumer.\n\nThe quality of the data in the database of a number of suppliers still leaves much to be desired. To address this, GS1 set up the Data Quality 2.0 program. Icollaborated with GS1 to develop a vision to further improve the data quality program. This included improving the operation of the My GS1 environment.\n\nTo optimise the process of improving data quality, I thoroughly studied the user experience of the portal - as well as the data entry process and quality assurance in general.\n\nTo obtain an accurate impression of the users and their needs, I started with interactive workshops. The workshops I led resulted in personas and customer journey maps for two target audiences for two industry sectors. These formed the basis for further user research in the form of in-depth interviews.\n\nBased on this research, I issued a series of recommendations for improving the journey and the My GS1 environment. These recommendations were split into \u2018quick wins\u2019 and fundamental issues that needed to be addressed.\n\nI subsequently created an elaborate interaction design for the My GS1 environment that includes the fundamental proposals for improvement. Extensive qualitative user testing led to the fine-tuning of the interaction design. I chose for an internal and an external test, first by the GS1 organisation itself and subsequently by its customers.\n\nThis resulted in a final interaction design that was passed on to GS1's external technical partner for implementation. Additional measurements of the use of the My GS1 environment will contribute to a process of continuous improvement.",
