    "summary": "I've started my carrer as a Physicist, doing my Masters and PhD Level in Theoretical and Computational Physics. After some years teaching in Universities, I have moved on to work on the Embedded Software industry in Brasil, first in Parks and then on Datacom. What i like most working in the area is that we always have new projects and problems to solve, and new technology to learn. Since the beginning, i have chosen to be someone who likes learning, teaching, and solving problems, and I've been doing this all along. In 2019, I have moved to the Netherlands, and since then started working at Philips, in the development of medical devices for Image Guided Therapy. In 2022 I have changed to work at Heliox, as an embedded software engineer, in the electrical charging market",
