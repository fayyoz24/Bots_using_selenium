    "summary": "I am passionate about helping people make their companies more secure and contributing to building a safer society. I have been working in cybersecurity since 2009 and have assisted companies in various industries, particularly in financial services, on a wide range of topics such as offensive security, vulnerability response, cryptography, fraud management, data protection and privacy, and more.\n\nI enjoy connecting with people and working together to understand the present and shape a better future, with a strong focus on the people. My passion for technology and understanding how things and people \"work\" drives my interest in exploring new horizons, cross-pollinating different fields and experimenting with emerging technologies.\n\nIn my free time, I am an avid reader of specialized blogs, magazines, and papers, always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in my field and beyond. My passion for learning extends to my personal interests such as exploring art cities and cooking new recipes with my wife. I also practice archery, which I recently fell in love with and that allows me to truly disconnect and focus on one thing: hitting the target.\n\nThanks to my son, I recently rediscovered my passion for Legos, which adds a building block to my relationship with him every day.",
