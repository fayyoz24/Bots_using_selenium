    "summary": "After completing a structured PhD in Psychology and Health and several years of postdoctoral research, I am currently working as a lecturer in Psychology and Health at the Open Universiteit. Within my PhD, I focused on assessing the effectiveness and implementation of collaborative goal-setting strategies within diabetes self-management support. Within this project I utilised a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods. I collaborated with patients and members of the public in the development of the research agenda and I have maintained these collaborations throughout the research project. I have ongoing collaborations in countries as the United Kingdom and France, and acted as Chair for the international early career researchers division CREATE within the European Health Psychology Society. My research interests lie primarily within the field of Health Psychology and implementation science, with a special focus on behaviour change. In future research, I would be interested in the development, evaluation and implementation of evidence-based behavioural interventions aimed at promoting health. Furthermore, I hold an interest in contributing to the body of knowledge surrounding cognitive mechanisms underlying health behaviour and habits. I am an experienced workshop facilitator and guest lecturer with numerous experiences in training students and non-academic audiences.",
