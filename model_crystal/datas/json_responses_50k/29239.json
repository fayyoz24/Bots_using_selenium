All of these projects are designed to improve the overall experience at the university and through fundraising I have also been able to get in touch with several alumni who have given me very useful advice. This role has helped me to improve my communication and negotiation skills. I was also given the opportunity to be a student guide, a role which comprised of being involved in open days and several alumni events which take place throughout the year and essentially involves being an ambassador for the Business School. This has allowed me to improve my networking skills and has improved my confidence in terms of public speaking. As a mentor to Year 10's, my duties included helping the students with CV building activities, building self confidence and help them with their organisational and revision skills.",
