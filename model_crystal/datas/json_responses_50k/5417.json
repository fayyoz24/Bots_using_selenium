    "summary": "I am a graduate from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Chemistry and Geography & Environmental Management. After my 5 years of study I took a year off to see the world, travelling through Southeast Asia, Australia, and Europe. After fulfilling my travel yen I returned to my beloved Canada to work but have finally settled on making The Netherlands my home. Currently I am searching for a job where I can apply my passion for chemistry in a company I will grow to love.\n\nFor the last year I am proud to have been a part of Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) working as a Lab Technician in the Quality Department. CCEP gave me my first occupation in The Netherlands.   \n\nPrior to working at CCEP I worked nearly four years at Maxxam Analytics, a Bureau Veritas Group company. I worked as a Lab Technician in the Organic Department, first with the hydrocarbon group (CCME) then moving to the HPLC group after only eight months. While working with CCME I learned to handle a large quantity of samples while never losing sight on the importance of quality. Moving to the HPLC group demonstrated my ability to adapt and learn quickly within a new setting. This group requires knowledge of numerous test codes and is responsible for preparing spike solutions and reagents regularly while ensuring all traceability logs are maintained. I have participated in audits, MDLs, P&As, PTs sample studies and aided in the modification of SOPs. I am also comfortable using an HPLC. As a part of the night shift, I have learned to work independently for extended periods of time and be flexible with my schedule.",
