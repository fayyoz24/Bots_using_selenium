    "summary": "A quote that has stayed with me is \u201cWhenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven\u2019t had the same advantages that you\u2019ve had\u201d - F. Scott Fitzgerald. My parents encouraged engagement with different cultures, having us move to the United Kingdom and United States in my early childhood. Once resettled in Sweden, I was enrolled into the rigorous International Baccalaureate program from middle school through high school meeting individuals from all over the world with experiences of their own; each interaction growing a passion for humanity within me. \n\t\nConsequently, in 2020 I graduated with a B.A. in International Relations from Malm\u00f6 University. I spent a semester abroad at Utrecht University, Netherlands studying: Anthropology and Sustainability, The Multicultural Society, Solidarity and Social Justice, and Racism in the Western World. Learning to understand human relationships and setting aside biases to connect with people in a professional manner. Consequently, I was accepted  to study a M.Sc. at Leiden University within Crisis and Security Management, prioritising group work and tackling case studies applying strategical and operational decision-making in crisis events. Additionally, the study focuses on leadership in challenging times. Prior to my MSc I studied a module in Criminological Theory and Crime Prevention at Malm\u00f6 University, where I was taught to assess the psychological propositions which make people act in non-legitimized manners. \n \nPrior to and parallel with my education I have consistently worked, for instance as ambassador for the NGOs Sight Savers and Save the Children. Yet, my primary employment is situated within the banking sector, with institutes such as Ikano Bank (during my fifth and sixth semester at university) and Nordea Bank 2020-2021. These professions have arguably allowed me to apply my decision-making and analytical skillsets in an ever-changing environment. Having received Anti-Money Laundering (AML) training from both institutes, I have been trained to detect and analyze patters of money-laundering as well as fraud and implementing compliance approaches if I suspect misdemeanor. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have a role you believe I would be good for or if you simply want to connect! \n\nI would argue that my skillsets consist of: \n\u2022 Communication (internal/external)\n\u2022 Creativity\n\u2022 Finding efficient problem-solving solutions\n\u2022 Diplomacy \n\u2022 Attentiveness to detail\n\u2022 Native-level bilingual proficiency in Swedish and English",
