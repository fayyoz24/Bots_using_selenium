She is a collaborative leader who champions creative intent, encourages fresh thinking from design and technical teams and maximizes the budget, all while remaining focused on engaging, entertaining and inspiring her clients' guests.\n\nNow living in the Netherlands, Laura is focused on developing relationships in the European themed entertainment market. \n\nBy sharing her holistic show perspective and global experiences, Laura expects to become a reliable partner to design agencies, fabricators, ride vendors, media/interactive developers and other specialists wanting to expand their offerings toward the full scope of design and build projects.\n\nLaura can work with your team on all aspects of a project from initial concept proposal and budget through design development, fabrication and installation. \n\nAs an on demand resource, Laura can provide that additional support often desired, without the cost of establishing an additional full-time role.
