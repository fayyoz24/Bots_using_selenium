    "summary": "In my current position I went back to my flow and volume metrology roots but now at a management level as Chief Metrologist Flow. \n\nI can help you with flow measurements by showing how metrology benefits you and your company by gaining and keeping control over your (flow) measurements.\n\nMy first task (September 2022) as Chief Metrologist Flow is to complete the construction and move of the volume laboratory and flow meter calibration facilities in Rotterdam called the European Center for Flow Measurement. \n\nMy personal goal is to give customers the best possible experience when their flow meters, volume instruments, flow calibration facilities or other instruments are calibrated and made traceable to the National Standards of the Netherlands.\n\nWe as teamVSL can take care of almost all your needs in Metrology not just Flow. Next to performing calibrations we advise, calculate measurement uncertainty, teach and coach you how to measure better or set up a calibration service. As the National Metrology Institute (NMI) of the Netherlands we have a lot of knowledge that you can use in your day to day business. \n\nI have visited many companies around the world in all kind of industries. I will remain doing this as I am transferring my knowledge (29+ years) to you and new VSL team members in this field of metrology. Some of the companies I worked for now use a special designed logo of VSL when performing calibration of instruments. This service is called \u201cVSL CMC Certified\u201d and is being introduced in more fields of metrology. \n\nIf you read this I would like to invite you to try our services if you are not our customer yet. I am sure our enthusiastic sales and operation teams will be more than happy to help you.",

Both the gravimetric method and the volumetric method were used by several laboratories. \n\nWithin EURAMET it is the first time that a comparison is organised in the large volume capacity range. So far there has been only EURAMET comparisons in the \u00b5L range, and volumes of 100 mL, 5 L and 20 L. Compared to small volume standards the calibration of large proving tanks involves a number of circumstances that may vary considerably between the laboratories (type and preparation of water and its actual temperature, control of surrounding air temperature and humidity, practical handling, different surface conditions inside, techniques to read the scale, use of balance or volumetric standards etc.)\n\nIn September 2013 Euramet project 1157 was added as a supplementary comparisons at BIPM with as reference EURAMET.M.FF-S6. Next to this it is published in the technical supplement 2013 of Metrologia (http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/50/1A/07013).",

This comparison has been performed under the framework of Euramet (known as project number 1072). The aim of the comparison was that the measurement errors at different flow-rates between the two water flow measurement standards found using two flow meters did not exceed the summed CMC claims of the two water flow measurement standards according the En value calculation for bilateral comparisons (En<1). VSL was the pilot laboratory for the bilateral comparison due to the fact that VSL has an entry in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) Mutual Recognition Arrangement (known as the CIPM MRA) for water flow measurement. For this bilateral comparison VSL has used Euramet Guide no. 3 \u2015Euramet Guidelines on Conducting Comparisons\u2016. In addition VSL has followed the technical aspects of ILAC guideline G13 \u2015ILAC Guidelines for the Requirements for the Competence of Providers of Proficiency Testing Schemes\u2016",

Next to performing calibrations we advise, calculate measurement uncertainty, teach and coach you how to measure better or set up a calibration service. As the National Metrology Institute (NMI) of the Netherlands we have a lot of knowledge that you can use in your day to day business. \n\nI have visited many companies around the world in all kind of industries. I will remain doing this as I am transferring my knowledge (29+ years) to you and new VSL team members in this field of metrology. Some of the companies I worked for now use a special designed logo of VSL when performing calibration of instruments. This service is called \u201cVSL CMC Certified\u201d and is being introduced in more fields of metrology. \n\nIf you read this I would like to invite you to try our services if you are not our customer yet. I am sure our enthusiastic sales and operation teams will be more than happy to help you.",

During the first year my main task was to open the LNG flow meter calibration facility for commercial calibrations. We took over the facility when it was operated with liquid nitrogen in an R&D project. We faced many challenges but we managed to get it done! \n\nIn January 2021 I received the task to design a new liquid flow meter calibration facility in a brand new building and location in Rotterdam. Next to this facility the LNG calibration facility needed to move to this location too. In August 2022 the construction of the building and facility are on their way to be completed at the end of 2022. The move of the LNG calibration facility was done by a project team where we added our knowledge about safety and regulations to get a permit for the new location. \n\nIn the meantime the commercial operation and the maintenance of the national standards for the liquid flow department kept going strong. The team calibrated all kind of instruments in the laboratories and on customer locations (not always easy due to the restrictions around Covid-19). We all contributed to consultancy in flow measurement and certification of calibration facilities.",
