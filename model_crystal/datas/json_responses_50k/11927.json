Why?\n\nI strongly believe that it is all about: \n- surrounding yourself with great leaders & people where you can learn from \n- taking on courageous challenges supported by those great leaders\n- chosing for an environment that empowers you to excel\n- and not taking things too seriously, have a laugh with the people on your journey \n\nI am passionate about empowering talents, teams and leaders so that organisations not only bring great results but also create a better and happier 'working world'. \n\nBesides, I am confident that every organisation can make things happen whilst keeping the employee experience a magical and joyful journey.",

I chose to work for Booking because of the fabulous concept, the engaging atmosphere, the opportunity I have been given to develop myself, the freedom and responsibility I get and because of the bright and incredibly nice people. If you join Booking.com, you feel that you are part of a 'winning team'. For me, that was the reason to join Booking.com.\n\nBooking.com is highly international, with a HQ in Amsterdam and over 150 offices all over the world: in the greatest cities you can imagine. I am very glad to be part of the Global Recruitment Team of Booking.com who do a great job in hiring the best people in IT, Customer Service, Account Management, Product development, Finance and lots of other exciting roles. In my current role, I am also a member of the HR Leadership team, reporting to the HR Director.\n\nFind out more: http://www.workingatbooking.com/. \n\nDespite from getting the best and nicest colleagues into Booking, I also focus on employer branding, campus recruitment, game changing selection and assessment, system and process optimization, employability, sourcing mix and vendor relations. I created a team of process recruiters and innovation specialists / product owners so that there is focus on execution and innovation/optimization at all times. The goal is to spread the word about Booking.com in order to attract the best and right talent, a segmented way of selection & assessment, aiming for the highest candidate experience (since every candidate is a customer as well!) and to create great relationships with the business & outside. All initiatives should be scalable, in alignment with the regional heads of HR & the business and measurable: a data-driven approach in determining the innovation agenda, from traffic to the website to internal talent/performance.",
