    "summary": "My professional and private life is centered around water in a broad sense. At TUDelft I am supporting BSc- MSc- and PhD-students in acquiring knowledge and research skills concerning transport, mixing and scouring processes in shallow environmental flows. As chairman of the foundation Lunet aan de Snel, I am developing a platform to broaden the societal awareness of water-related issues.\nHydraulic Engineering knowledge and expertise is of great importance for society. I am proud to be a member a department that delivers more than 15 PhD's and about 100 MSc's every year. In addition to transferring knowledge by educating students and researchers we have impact through implementation of improved modelling design and engineering concepts, as well as scientific publications.  \n\nIn addition to my job at TUDelft, I work as a volunteer on the development of a water-experience centre, meant to bring the various interesting and exciting aspects of water to the attention of a broader audience.  See www.waterfort.nl .\n\nSpecialties: \n- Shallow flows: mixing layers, groyne fields, bends, lateral expansions, roughness variations,\n- Rapidly varying flows: weirs, bed forms, inundated flood planes\n- Sediment and plastics transport: particle turbulence interaction, river morphodynamics\n- Fluid Structure interaction: stability of breakwaters, vegetated flows, scour around obstacles\n- Experimental techniques: ADV, LDA, PIV\n- Vegetarian cooking ",

To this end we use the accommodation of an abandoned fortress (Lunet aan de Snel), part of the former Dutch Water Defense system (Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie).  Throughout 2017 renovation activities will take place, so we can receive visitors starting spring 2018. Check www.waterfort.nl for more detailed information\nI support this innitiative by bringing in the necessary knowledge related to the physics and the role of water in our society, as well as experience with education."
