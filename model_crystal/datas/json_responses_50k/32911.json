The analysis was done by using the simulation tool Agent-Based Modelling and the Scenario Discovery technique. In this work, I particularly focus on how to perform decision-making under deep uncertainty. The decision-making of individuals in product adoption, as well as the effects of interactions between them, is hard to understand, varies between various individuals and might change continuously over time. Instead of rejecting or ignoring these uncertainties, there are opportunities in basing model analysis specifically on these uncertainties in order to build more robust policies.\n\nKeywords: smart grids, agent-based modeling, energy, policy analysis",

A better consideration of moral values (e.g. privacy, safety, affordability) can contribute to social acceptance. This can be done by specifying design requirements and policy guidelines during the planning phase of infrastructures. Moral values to which energy infrastructures need to comply may however change after the planning phase. Design requirements and policy guidelines initially specified may become ineffective to support social acceptance. The aim of my work is to develop approaches to identify and explore scenarios of value change. This is done using methods such as probabilistic topic models and agent-based models.",

The advantage of this internship was that it combines the field of diplomacy and renewable energies.\n\nDME department (Climate, Energy, Water and the Environment): this department coordinates policy in these areas in the international field. One main task at the time of the internship was the monitoring of the Promoting Renewable Energy Program (PREP) of the Netherlands\n\nActivities: As an intern, I performed a study on the valuation of the overall costs and benefits of renewable energy projects in development aid activities. I also helped ministry employees on their daily tasks and participated to various meeting inside and outside the Ministry.\n\nKeywords: renewable energy, program management, cost-benefit analysis, intercultural business, development aid",
