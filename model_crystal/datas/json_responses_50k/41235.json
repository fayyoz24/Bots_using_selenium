    "summary": "I am a seasoned specialist and consultant in sustainability management. I have been working for about 30 years mainly in the private sector. I have a background in agronomy, environment technology and science and in business administration This education enables me to have a broad and integrated view on sustainable business development. The sectors I was and am covering range from private equity funds, processing industry and agribusiness. Since 2015 my original education as agronomist helps me to link environmental and social aspects with process integrated measures in primary production. I am convinced that new technological developments in Agtec and satellite data together with the integration of agribusiness with livestock is needed to enable sustainable growth and nature conservation in agribusiness. When I can link new developments and people I am on my best; for example, I have linked a nature conservation NGO with a Paraguayan beef producer to improve business. \nThe region I am most involved is in Latin America, from Central America (sugar, coffee) via Peru (fruit & vegetables, cocoa) to Argentina and Paraguay (agribusiness and cattle); including the processing of these products. \nI started my carrier in environmental consultancy, mainly for multinational companies during M&A and continued my carrier in 2003 in the financial sector (Dutch Development Bank) until date. \nI love cooking (and eating good food) and traveling. For maintaining my physical strength, I started running some years ago and since 2018 I have joined the club of Marathon runners. Marathon running gives me discipline, strengthens my endurance and keeps me result-oriented and pushes barriers and obstacles away, like what I have to do in real life. ",
