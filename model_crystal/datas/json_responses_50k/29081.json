    "summary": "As a Physics student, I learned that one of the tasks of a physicist is to always challenge new or existing theories and preconceived notions, looking for possible breaking points. If issues were found, I would focus on finding solutions for each issue, making sure not to break what was working in the theory. Without realizing it, the years spent at university had taught me to think like a Red Team member.\n\nI started practicing ethical hacking techniques on PeopleSoft ERP HCM / CRM applications running in internal labs. I usually performed black-box penetration tests on the server stack and on PeopleSoft web applications.\n\nTo build a solid foundation on the penetration testing methodology and hacking techniques, I attended: in 2016, \u201cPenetration Professional Testing\u201d and \"Web Application Penetration Testing\" courses from eLearnSecurity and \u201cPenetration Testing with Kali (PWK)\" course from Offensive Security; in 2017, \u201cWindows Exploit Development Bootcamp\u201d from Corelan.\n\nCurrently, as penetration tester, my primary responsibilities are to conduct network and application penetration tests (following OWASP Top 10 and NCSC guidelines), web application security reviews, vulnerability scanning, and writing reports containing detailed information on assessment findings and recommendations.\n\nI have exposure to Assembly, Java, SQL, PHP, HTML and Python. I am also am preparing the exams for the Offensive Security\u2019s OSCP and SLAE (SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert) certifications.\n\nI am a highly-motivated business professional with over 16 years of experience in complex business and data analysis. I am customer focused, solutions oriented, with a significant working experience in international environments. \n\nMy greatest assets are problem-solving attitude, thinking outside the box, excellent communication/negotiation abilities and reflective thinking skills. I am a quick learner and team player, but I am also able to work independently and under pressure.",
