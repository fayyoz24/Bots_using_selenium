    "summary": "I have always wanted to be challenged in all aspects of my career and personal life. I look for positions that require decision making and leadership, the tougher the better. My motivation comes from ways that I can grow on a personal level while improving the position, rather than maintaining it.\n\nI enjoy the ability to be creative in my assignments, thinking out of the box, continuous learning, and working with a motivated team. I am a very high energy individual with very strong personal, technical, negotiation and leadership skills. I thrive on the notion of the company I represent being looked at in a completely different light than our competitors.\n\nI believe that anything I attach my name to needs to be of high quality.  Additionally, I believe that, like myself, all of our employees are capable of achieving more than they are today. As a result, I look for ways to motivate people, keep them learning and challenged, thus providing my company with the high quality people that we need in order to grow. Being a mentor and participating in the growth of my team is something that I consistently strive for.",
