    "summary": "Hola! I am a Colombian development practitioner with an anthropological curiosity at heart. I have over 10 years of experience managing community development, internationalization, and education projects.  I am passionate about co-designing, strategizing, and implementing effective projects that deliver social and business impact.\n\nMy career weaves together my passion for (ethnographic) research, policy advising, and project/program management. Over the last 20 years, I've been blessed to have lived, worked, and studied in Bogot\u00e1, Pune, Bar Harbor, Chimaltenango, London, Lima, Budapest, and The Hague. \n\nI feel inspired working within multicultural and trans-disciplinary teams that value critical\nthinking and out-of-the-box ideas, that are highly adaptive, honor their project partners, and are willing to listen. \n\nI am culturally sensitive, diplomatic, and people- and impact-driven.",
