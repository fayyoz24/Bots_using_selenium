My main task was to design a user-friendly interface that allowed doctors to provide advice and diagnoses to patients. This involved linking criteria such as age, gender, and diagnoses to specific components of the consultation process.\n\nBefore the development phase, I conducted thorough research, including interviews with ChipSoft consultants and a physician. This enabled me to identify the various needs and requirements and align them with the product owner's specifications.\n\nDuring development, I adhered to ChipSoft's business architecture and standards, utilizing the in-house developed framework based on .NET 6.0. This allowed me to effectively implement the desired functionalities.\n\nThe outcome of my work was a new management page within the consult module, which simplified the administration process and proved highly user-friendly for doctors. By taking into account the specific needs of different user groups, I contributed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the HiX healthcare information system.",
