                    "description": "My experience working at Embraer company as engineer and team leader was developing solutions to the defense & aerospace industry.  I had the opportunity to work on military projects abroad within companies as Saab in Sweden (1 year - 2016) and EADS (Airbus company) in France (2 years - 2002/2003).\n\nAs a team leader, I was responsible for the technical leadership of small teams working with scrum in R&D projects to develop new technologies/trends for command and control applications (C4I).\n\nAs a software engineer, I worked with software development of airborne datalink and communication systems for aerial surveillance aircraft and fighter aircraft, command and control systems for ground center and modeling and simulation applications within R&D projects. I have experience with software development of embedded, real time and distributed networked applications using inter-process communication, event driven and data distribution mechanisms in linux/unix environment, using C and C++ language, git tool and agile methodologies.\n\nAs a system engineer, I worked with radio communication and datalink systems.\nI worked as a systems engineer developing the embedded tactical voice communication and data link system for the GripenNG aircraft as part of the Brazilian Air Force\u00b4s fighter program from 2016 up to 2018. I lived one year in Sweden for the transfer of technology (ToT) at Saab company which included theoretical training and on-the-job training on engineering tasks like Requirement Specifications, System Design and modeling but also Model Based System Engineering and Scrum methodologies.\n\nI worked with RFPs issued by the Brazilian Armed Forces including the terrestrial border surveillance program (SISFRON) from the Brazilian Army and the national maritime surveillance program (SisGAAz) from the Brazilian Navy in order to design tactical C2 systems compliant with the military requirements and to provide technical support during procurement and acquisition process.",
