Please join her in her journey for women empowerment and gender balanced leadership.\n\nDianne was a Professor of Management Education at RSM, Erasmus University in the Netherlands.

She served for many years as the Associate Dean for MBA Programs as well as a Statutory Director of the RSM BV, the company through which Erasmus University offers its MBA programs and executive education portfolio. \n\nDianne lead the drive for women empowerment at the RSM and across the broader Erasmus University. She is the Executive Director of the recently established Erasmus Centre for Women and Organizations.  Leading through innovation, Dianne designed a women's only elective at RSM focusing on the empowerment of women aspiring to leadership roles using the mountain (Mt Kilimanjaro) as an outside classroom, and as a metaphor for business.  She also developed and ran Women in Leadership Executive courses and Master classes.  \n\nTeaching highlights include: (a) developing the curricula and serving as the lead faculty for the personal leadership development across the full portfolio of MBA programs; and (b) teaching leadership development and managing people for students and executives across five continents.
