This included working on projects within the field of brand identity development and rebranding. I worked with clients within the field of healthcare, regional government, (national) NGO\u2019s, industrial production (global) and fashion retail. The analysis of the agency within a competitive context and market included making a review of the naming agencies, brand identity agencies, and brand strategic agencies. The review consists of both national and international (EU/global) competitors. In the review the activities, online presence, and manifestation of the competitors were assessed allowing for a better (re)positioning within the market.",

Teams shared their experiences along the way via daily clips. The point system was based on three factors: Checkpoint challenges, Social engagement, and Completing tasks on an Adventure list\n\nMy team was dropped in Stockholm and we engaged our audience using social media. We successfully travelled to the finish line and found creative ways to trade Red Bull for meals, accommodation, transportations and various fun activities such as skiing and skydiving. We became the best Dutch team participating in the challenge",
