            "description": "A risk assessment was conducted for the city of Garm, Tajikistan, which is frequently struck by natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods and mudflows. Provided with a general framework for risk assessment, the team performed a quantitative risk analysis, identifying the various risk scenarios that can occur in the area by analysing the structure of the system (geographical and building types). Using a set of indicators to measure likelihood (probability and frequency) of occurrence for the aforementioned natural hazards - expected consequences such as number of fatalities, individual risk and societal risk were calculated. FN-curves and maps were used to present the results. A sensitivity analysis was done by creating a 'tornado diagram' to discuss the issue of completeness and limitations for the content of the project. The assessment does not suggest risk reducing measures or community resilience, but rather aims to form the basis for these decisions and to provide the foundations for further risk evaluation approaches such as STAPLEE or SMAUG.",
