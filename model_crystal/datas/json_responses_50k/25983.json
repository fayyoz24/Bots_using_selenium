The Q-Concordance is the result of original research on the earliest known (fragments of) Qur\u02be\u0101n manuscripts, as well as various printed editions. By comparing these texts word for word, Milo has identified all common denominators. \nBecause the earliest manuscripts often do not contain all the diacritics of the Arabic script, Milo has devised a \u201ccode\u201d to represent the handwritten texts in the most faithful way possible. This representation of the text allows researchers to find all possible interpretations of a given word found in the handwritten texts.\nThe search results are represented side by side with a digital version of the 1924 Cairo edition of the Qur\u02be\u0101n to facilitate comparison. The Cairo edition\u2019s original text in Arabic orthography has been preserved in its exact layout of 827 pages, because in this edition every word has a fixed position on the page. In split-screen the Q-Concordance presents both the digital Cairo edition (on the left) and Milo\u2019s coded representation (on the right), allowing the user easily to connect search results from the code with specific locations in the edition.\n\nThomas Milo\u2019s Q-Concordance is the only research tool designed especially to reflect both the manuscript and print traditions of the Quranic text. It is an indispensable finding aid for scholars and students of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, and for everyone working with early Islamic Arabic (epigraphic, papyrus, numismatic, etc.) texts.\"\n(From Brill's product description)\n\nNow online:\nhttp://referenceworks.brillonline.com/cluster/Encyclopaedia%20of%20the%20Qur%CA%BE%C4%81n?s.num=0",

Vague is the sense that, though we have very explicit traditional accounts, these accounts stem from centuries later and do not seem to tally with what little hard evidence there is.\n\nFor instance, an academic veterinarian who writes a dissertation about the Military Horse in History points out that horseshoes only emerge at the end of the 9th century. This gives a Terminus Post Quem for \"hoofs sparking fire\" (sura 100) that conflicts with the alleged time of origin of the Koran. On the other hand, an Arabic linguist repositions a single diacritical dot (permitted, because the originals had no dots), and concludes that the verse doesn't refer to horses at all - which makes the Terminus Post Quem irrelevant: the text can have originated before the end of the 9th century after all, but now with a totally different meaning.\n\nThis is the kind of observations In\u0101rah is dealing with by bringing in expertise from outside the conventional arabistic, theological, legal and anthropological fields. \n\nMeanwhile In\u0101rah has produced 6 bundles of scholarly articles. I have contributed to the third and the fourth volume:\nhttp://www.verlag-hans-schiler.de/index.php?title=Gerd-R+Puin+Karl-Heinz+Ohlig+Die+dunklen+Anf\u00e4nge&art_no=M0128\n\nAn English translation of the first volume is now available:\nThe Hidden Origins of Islam: New Research Into Its Early History, Hans Schiller Verlag, 2005 ISBN 3899301285 (German); Prometheus Books, 2008 ISBN 1591026342 (English)",
