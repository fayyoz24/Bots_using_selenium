My first assignment was to organize a health fair for the company personnel. I had to find pharmaceutical companies that would be willing to give discounts for laboratory studies and to send a representative to talk to the employees about different health subjects. After this project was completed I worked in the archive updating and organizing all the documents of the personnel that had been misplaced during the last couple of years. By the end of my assignment, all the documents were in order and all the information organized and saved in the system.",
