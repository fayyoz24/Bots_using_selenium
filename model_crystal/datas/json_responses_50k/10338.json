This was conducted in order to meet the NASA N+3 goals to reduce pollution, fuel consumption, and increase performance. The focus of the project was base on the conceptual design phase where a feasibility study was perform in order to quantify the performance gains from implementing TVC and CCV to a commercial aircraft.\n\nDifferent teams were assemble in order to analyze each engineering discipline aerodynamics, propulsion, structure, stability and control, performance, risk assessment, certification, CAD, and cost. My task as a propulsion specialists and forecaster for future technology in the group was to developed a TVC engine and research future technology that could be implemented into the commercial aircraft.

Also, to see if the plane would fly today and if it would be certified by the FAA certifications. The cost of building the plane would also be taking into account in today\u2019s economy and during the period of time it was being mass-produced. ",

During the trajectory of the first part of the desing project a diver jumps out of plane at an alitutde of 15,000 ft. Druing this period of flight his altitude were terminal velocity is obtain and the different forces acting on the diver have to be produced. Also, sketches of the forces and moments acting on the diver during the jump and as the diver reaches its terminal velocity have to be produce. The drag and Reynolds number have to be calculated for this portion of the project. \n\nThe second part of the assignment is to calculate the wetted area, drag area, the max drag at a 90 degree angle that is produced. Also to produced plots for both the L/D from 0 degrees to 90 and lift and drag for the same range of angles. Also, sketches are to be made of the wing suit and pilot. Anohter criteria is to find how is the wing suit producing longitudinal stability and to quantify the performance for the suit. The desing element for the project arrives from the freedom to choose on how to solve each problem and the assumptions that one takes to accommodate for difficulties. ",
