We wanted to capture the widest range of experiences Rotterdam has to offer.\n\n\u2018Rotterdam Told by People\u2019 is a set of mirrors that reflect collective interpretations of the city. When looking into any of these mirrors, you will not only see yourself, but also people\u2019s memories, impressions, and opinions about Rotterdam. The map shows locations that interest and matter to both locals and visitors. It is a cluster of individual experiences put together.\n\nThe people we interviewed spoke about what was important to them and often pointed or drew that as well. We used these sketches as a starting point for the mirrors. By putting all the visual and told contributions together we obtained a map of personal meanings.",

            "description": "In the Netherlands, 50,000 tonnes of bread gets thrown away every year, in other words, 20% of our bread disappears in the waste bin. BroodNodig seeks a change in behavior regarding bread wastage. The goal is to reduce the amount of bread waste. The remaining bread waste should not end up with the organic waste or on the streets. Through developing the Broodnodig 010, a digester that turns bread waste into biogas, bakers can use their discarded bread to power their ovens.\n\nYURKO's role within BroodNodig is mainly supportive, helping out with its market research, guiding the interns' research projects and maintaining the website's blog and other communication channels.",

The sculpture Santa Claus, better known as Gnome Buttplug was unveiled in 2001 and led to violent protests. Originally intended for the Theatre Square, Gnome Buttplug moved around three times before it came to its present location.\n\nIn the performance the Dutch Inez van Dam came to Los Angeles together with Wunderbaum to take revenge on the famous ketchup artist.",
