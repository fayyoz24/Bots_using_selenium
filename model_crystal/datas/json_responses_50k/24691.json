However, CRC\u2019s, though used widely in safety and weight-critical applications have not been explored to the same degree, often with models that are either overly simplistic or too complex to be used effectively for repeated analyses.\n \nThis thesis aims to close this knowledge gap by developing a theory that accounts for the key damage modes present in CRC structures. This involves creating a model that predicts the pre-damage response, damage initiation and damage propagation till final failure in a generic CRC specimen. Experiments will be designed and performed to validate said damage theory using samples manufactured at TANIQ.",
