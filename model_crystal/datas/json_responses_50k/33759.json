    "summary": "I focus on helping organizations with developing software that does not only deliver value but is also easy to maintain and easy to change.\n\nWe do not live in a static world where software, once written, never has to change again. By applying good software design principles and a structured way of working, we can deliver software fast enough to stay ahead of the competition but that is still changeable enough to market changes.\n\nI'm a big fan of mature development practices, such as Domain-Driven Design, eXtreme Programming, and Test-Driven Development. I also strongly believe that we are at our strongest when we share our individual skills, knowledge, and perspectives. That's why I love to think about working in teams and sharing knowledge within and outside an organization.",

            "description": "Python Discord is an international community of Python enthusiasts with over 100,000 members. As a community, we provide a unique learning ground for those looking to learn Python, improve their skills, or have high level discussions of the language. We also maintain several Open Source Projects and guide people in taking their first steps in Open Source development.\n\nAs the Python programming language is very close to our hearts, we also give back to the broader Python ecosystem by assisting other Python-related organizations. Recently, we assisted the Python Software Foundation in organizing the Python Core Developer Sprint, which was forced online due to Covid-19. We provided the event with an online communication platform and took care of streaming the first even Python Core Developer Q&A with 30 Python Core Developers, including Guido van Rossum.\n\nAs an owner, I play a key role in setting the course of our community and managing our staff of nearly 100 volunteers, overseeing community policy, the organization of major community events, and chairing staff and admin meetings. I also make architectural decisions on our technology stack, which is full of industry standard Python and Javascript frameworks, CI/CD solutions, and serverless architecture.\n\nIn many ways, running a massive community like this is kind of like running a small start-up, and involves managing teams, agile sprints with kanban, weekly stand-ups, lots of triage and task specifications, and public appearances for podcasts, webinars, and other events on behalf of the community."
