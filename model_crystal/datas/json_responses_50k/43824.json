Initially I was asked to create an application for Windows that would enable companies to back up their files with ease. The Managing Director and I worked through the initial programming, and partially through designing the application. My days were comprised of completing the tasks set for that day, which mostly contained programming and managing the database that the files were backed up to. This work included programming SQL in C#, which at the time was a new programming language for me. When I was nearing the end of my internship, I also worked through the functional tests, to find and fix any bugs or errors that may occur.",

In contrast to the 2010 internship, this was a much more formal business environment; with an emphasis on working to a deadline, customer service and cooperating as part of a team whilst completing the given individual assignments.",
