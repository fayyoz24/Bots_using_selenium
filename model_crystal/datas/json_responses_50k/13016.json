    "summary": "Having a great curiosity and a lively mind, I strive to explore new opportunities and I don\u2019t fear upcoming difficulties. After completing the master\u2019s degree with a specialisation in \"Governance of Innovations\" at the University of Maastricht, I would like to start a career allowing me to realise the full potential of my training, abilities, and creativity. My main interest lies in Marketing having graduated with a bachelor's degree with a major in marketing. I subsequently spent almost 2 years working in this field which truly captured my interest. Negotiations, cooperation with partners, as well as solving problems for the successful functioning of the business are among the challenges that I had to overcome that still intrigue me. At the same time, I do not limit myself to the field of marketing. Given my analytical skills, I am convinced I can also add value in other area\u2019s where I can use my data analysis skills. The latter were part of my responsibilities in previous positions. My master's program moreover included policy analysis and the use of programs such as R Studio and Stata. At this stage of my professional development, my skills encompass proficiency in 2 languages (Russian and English) whilst also actively improving my grasp on Dutch. The main functions of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were mastered due to interests of a more personal nature. Needless to say, literacy in MS Office and Google Docs are included by default in my knowledge package. In addition, I try to expand the knowledge I have attained of SEO, and look forward to putting theory into practice. I do not want to be limited to existing skills and will be enthused if the future profession will require the development of new abilities. ",
