    "summary": "Currently I am active as distributor of the unique & patent protected Bandelettes\u00ae thigh bands for Europe. \n\nWhat are Bandelettes\u00ae you might think... Well, they are gorgeous thigh bands specially designed to prevent inner thigh chafing & rubbing when wearing a dress, skirt or short with bare legs.\n\nThe assumption only plus size men & women suffer from inner thigh chafing could'nt be further from the truth. Thigh chafing is actually very common because with the majority of us, our thighs touch eachother. Chances are high you have experienced the sticky, burning feeling on your inner thighs, which can eventually result in wounds, from continuous skin to skin rubbing while walking.\n\nBandelettes\u00ae are the most effective and at the same time most elegant solution for this problem! They are light & comfortable. You genuinely forget you are wearing them! \n\nOur mission is to make sure everyone feels great in their one skin, regardless of the clothing size they wear. So all can wear whatever they want with bare legs on a nice summer day for example.\n\nWhen wearing our real Bandelettes\u00ae with our good sizes and not too much stretch, we are sure you will say goodbye to inner thigh rubbing for ever! They come in two styles; beautiful stretch lace in several colours and sporty unisex bands made of light microfiber. \n\nJust get yourself a pair today at: https://bandeletteseurope.com/shop-bandelettes-thigh-bands/\n\nWe are always interested to cooperate with businesses or organisations to help people feel great in their own skin, just let us know your ideas. \n\n* Maybe you offer plans for people to lose some weight and simply walking every day helps this plan. Bandelettes\u00ae will be a great item for your clients to have. They can walk freely when wearing them, as they do not have to worry about wounds on their thighs after a couple of hours walking....\n\n* Maybe you sell gorgeous plus size dresses? Bandelettes\u00ae are then just the accessory to make your customers wanna buy that dress, as they know they can wear your dress chub rub free! \n\n* Maybe you train athletes to run a marathon  and apart from nipple chafing, their thighs could do with a buffer too.\n\nWe could link and support eachother! \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\ninfo@bandeletteseurope.com",
