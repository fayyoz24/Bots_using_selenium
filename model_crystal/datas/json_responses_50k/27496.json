    "summary": "I'm an AI research scientist and software engineer with a PhD in particle physics. My work focuses on developing and implementing deep learning models and AI algorithms for medical imaging applications. My background in academia and industry has honed my analytical mindset, attention to detail, and pragmatic problem-solving skills.\n\nI have expertise in software engineering, scientific computing, computer vision and transferable skills that allow me to take a helicopter view of complex problems. I'm proficient in C++, Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as well as skilled in bash scripting, Git, Docker, web development (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, HTML), unit testing, CMake, and DICOM.\n\nCurrently, I work as an AI Research Scientist at ScreenPoint Medical. In this role, I have a wide range of responsibilities, including generating innovative ideas, guiding and planning the development process, prototyping and implementing new features, performing deep learning experiments and statistical evaluations, and ultimately preparing the product for market. I am proud of the significant milestones I have achieved and the successful products and features I have helped to bring to market.\n\nPreviously, I completed a PhD in experimental high-energy particle physics at NIKHEF, where I worked on developing and applying novel statistical search algorithms to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I also spent a year on-site at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where I contributed to outreach activities and performed expert-on-call and data-quality-monitoring shifts.",

The strategy involves performing many background-only tests in orthogonal data selections using Monte Carlo simulated background estimates, and then analyzing any data-derived signal regions in a dedicated analysis for which the background model can be optimized further using data-driven techniques.",
